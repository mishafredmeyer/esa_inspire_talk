AB Low-temperature or psychrophilic (< 20 degrees C) anaerobic biological treatment of simple industrial wastewaters has recently been proven feasible as an alternative to more expensive mesophilic (ca. 37 degrees C) technology. We implemented novel expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-based bioreactor designs for 27 psychrophilic anaerobic digestion (PAD) trials for the treatment of a broad range of simple and complex synthetic wastewaters representing dairy, food-processing and pharmaceutical sector effluents. A variety of operating parameters, such as hydraulic retention time, organic and volumetric loading rates and upflow velocity, were tested. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were recorded, which were comparable to previous mesophilic trials. Specific methanogenic activity, toxicity and biodegradability batch assays were employed to monitor the metabolic capabilities of microbial consortia in anaerobic reactors. The prevalence of psychrotolerant communites was observed and psychrophilic populations were detected in two of the reactors. The potential of PAD with respect to global sustainable development is discussed.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is the most prescribed antibiotic worldwide and is considered an emerging contaminant. The adsorption of ciprofloxacin onto calcined Verde-lodo (CVL) bentonite clay in a static system was evaluated in this study. CVL clay was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Zeta analyzer before and after application to examine the adsorption mechanism. Statistical techniques of experimental design were used to determine the best conditions to maximize the adsorption capacity of CIP. Static system tests were performed to evaluate the kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamics of adsorption. The system reached a maximum Langmuir removal capacity (25 degrees C) of 114.4 mg g(-1) and CVL clay displayed considerable reuse capacity with heat treatment at 500 degrees C. The ability for regeneration and high removal capacity of CVL provides a promising strategy to mitigate emerging contaminants present in wastewater.

AB Despite the amount of treated wastewater discharged into the Southern California Bight, few studies have examined pharmaceutical compounds in local biota. The Round Stingray (Urobatis hailer was selected as a representative elasmobranch species to perform an exploratory study on environmental pharmaceutical exposure. Archived liver samples of males and females from juvenile to adult size classes from several locations (n = 53) were examined for 18 pharmaceutical and illicit drug compounds using isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS. Very few compounds were detected in stingray livers, with diphenhydramine as the only pharmaceutical above quantitation limits. Only stingrays collected from the urban site (mainland California) had detectable levels of diphenhydramine compared to no detections in reference stingrays (offshore island). Sex and sampling location substantially influenced both detection rate and concentrations. Our results suggest that aspects of species' ecology and physiology should be considered for future studies investigating pharmaceutical exposure in elasmobranchs.

AB This study aims to investigate degradation mechanisms and kinetics of phenoxyacetic acid by ozonation in aqueous solution. The optimized operating condition was achieved by phenoxyacetic acid and total organic carbon (TOC) removal based on the studies of the effects of various parameters, such as pH value (4-12), the initial concentration of phenoxyacetic acid (100-2000 mg L-1) and the ozone dosage (16-48 mg min(-1)). A series of intermediates were formed in the ozonation process and detected by GC/MS and HPLC analysis, such as phenyl formate, salicylic acid, phenol, oxalic acid and small molecule acids. A possible degradation pathway of phenoxyacetic acid was proposed. The kinetic analysis showed that phenoxyacetic acid degradation was in slow kinetic regime based on the results of Ha. This paper can provide basic data and theoretical reference for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by ozonation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical industrial effluents, which include several organic solvents and other toxic chemicals, are generally treated by aerobic process, which is cost intensive in nature. The alternative anaerobic route to degrade the toxic effluents is attractive due to the lower cost of treatment and the generation of gas, which can supplement the energy requirements. There are few reports on the anaerobic treatment of the pharmaceutical effluents. In the present investigation, the effluents from a bulk drug industry, which utilizes several organic chemicals, have been taken to assess their applicability for anaerobic treatment. The organic loading rates were varied from 0.25 kg/m(3)/day to 2.5 kg/m(3)/day and the COD reduction was found to be in the range of 60 to 80%. Long term operation of an anaerobic suspended film contact reactor carried out with 1.25 kg/m(3)/day was found to be optimum. The biogas generated during the degradation process was monitored and the methane content was found to be 60-70%.

AB Diosgenin (CAS No.: 512-04-9) hydrolyzed from Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright is a very important steroid in the pharmaceutical industry. However, serious environmental pollution and poor efficiency in the utilization of this natural resource have yet to be conquered. The aim of this study was to establish a more ecological and efficient approach for producing diosgenin from fresh D. zingiberensis tubers via pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch. The reaction was carried out in a high pressure kettle, and seven parameters, including the sample to acidic solution ratio, concentration of H2SO4 aqueous solution, volume of extraction solvent, reaction temperature, duration of hydrolysis, agitation speed and boiling point of petroleum ether, were sequentially optimized through single factor experimental design. It was shown that the yield of diosgenin has been increased to 4.17% under the optimal conditions, namely, a 1:100 ratio of saponini/acidic solution (g/mL), 50 mL of 2 mu L/mL H2SO4 aqueous solution, 30 mL of petroleum ether (90-120 degrees C), 130 degrees C, 2.0 h and 100 r/min. Then, the newly proposed approach was compared with our previous strategy as well as a conventional method in terms of the yield of diosgenin, the consumption of sulfuric acid and chemical oxygen demand as well as total organic carbon of wastewater. Consequently, it was found that the yield was 22.29% higher than the conventional process, and H2SO4 consumption was reduced by 88.53%. Furthermore, the level of pollution in wastewater of the novel strategy has fallen greatly as the chemical oxygen demand and the total organic carbon were decreased by 50.15% and 64.39%. Comprehensively, it has been well demonstrated that the novel strategy based on pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch is a more ecological and effective approach for producing diosgenin from the tubers of fresh D. zingiberensis, and it is a promising strategy for application in industrial practice.

AB 'Emerging contaminants' are newly introduced into the environment through release into surface waters from wastewater treatment effluent, manufacturing, and agricultural use. How emerging contaminants move through water systems is unclear. Since the decay rates of emerging contaminants in piping systems have not been determined, this study determines the importance of decay rate on concentration throughout a distribution system and also determines how the system layout effects concentration. Systems were modeled to determine the time to peak contamination for a clean system becoming contaminated, as well as a contaminated system being cleaned of contamination. It was found that only emerging contaminants with second-order decay at the highest rate observed did not build up to high concentrations. The position of storage tanks in the distribution system affected the rate at which contaminants cleared the system, and systems with a branched layout could be cleared of contamination faster than systems containing loops.

AB Rutile TiO2 with highly active facets has attracted much attention owing to its enhanced activity during the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in wastewater. However, it is difficult to obtain by controlling the synthetic conditions. This paper reports a simple hydrothermal synthesis of rutile TiO2 nanorods with highly exposed {110} facets. The obtained rutile was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The main contribution to the photocatalytic activity comes from rutile nanorods with highly dominant active {110} facets, which were studied in the photodegradation of reactive cinnamic acid and more recalcitrant ibuprofen. The contribution of active species was also investigated. The present work further confirmed the hydrothermal synthesis route for controlling the preparation of highly crystalline and active rutile nanocrystals.

AB This study evaluated micropollutants removal and membrane fouling behaviour of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (24, 18, 12 and 6 h). The results revealed that HRT of 18 h was the optimal condition regarding the removal of most selected micropollutants. As the primary removal mechanism in the hybrid system was biodegradation, the attached growth pattern was desirable for enriching slow growing bacteria and developing a diversity of biocoenosis. Thus, the efficient removal of micropollutants was obtained. In terms of membrane fouling propensity analysis, a longer HRT (e.g. HRTs of 24 and 18 h) could significantly mitigate membrane fouling when compared with the shortest HRT of 6 h. Hence, enhanced system performance could be achieved when the MBBR-MBR system was operated at HRT of 18 h.

AB Novel visible light driven Ag-Bi2WO6-graphene nanocomposite photocatalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The optimized photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalysts exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with pure Bi2WO6 under simulated solar light. The optimal product, 5 mol% Ag-Bi2WO6-2.5 weight% graphene, showed the highest photocatalytic activity to degrade metoprolol. Metoprolol was 100% eliminated after 2 h simulated solar light irradiation in a solution with photocatalyst amount of 1 mg/mL, suggesting the potential application of this material in wastewater treatment. Eight reaction intermediate products were observed by LC-MS/MS and a tentative pathway of metoprolol degradation was proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A properly configured bioreactor is in need to transfer the fungal biodegradation of recalcitrant pollutants into real applications. In this study, a novel plate bioreactor was designed to eliminate carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely concerned pharmaceutical, with the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on polyether foam under non-sterile conditions. The bioreactor was operated in both sequence batch and continuous modes. It was found that the sufficient supply with nutrients is crucial for an effective elimination of CBZ. Given the conditions, a high elimination of CBZ (60-80%) was achieved. The effective elimination was stable in a continuous operation for a long term (around 100 days). The high elimination of CBZ could also be achieved under real conditions with the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An Advanced Water Recycling Demonstration Plant (AWRDP) was commissioned and constructed by the Queensland State Government in Australia. The AWRDP was used to study the effectiveness of a variety of treatment processes in the upgrading of municipal wastewater for water recycling applications. The AWRDP consists of eight modules, each housing an individual specific treatment process. These processes are flocculation, dissolved air flotation, dual media filtration, ozonation, biological activated carbon adsorption, microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet disinfection. The individual performances of the treatment processes were determined, as well as their interdependence in series. A range of chemical water quality parameters were investigated. The study provides a broad process comparison on the basis of an important catalogue of these key parameters. This will be valuable in the selection and optimization of treatment processes trains in full-scale water recycling applications. (c) 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB For the photocatalytic removal of bisphenol A (BPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from water solution a new multiwall-carbon nanotubes and TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposites (MWCNT-TiO2-SiO2) were applied. Nano-composites with the addition of 0.15-17.8 wt% MWCNT show high potential for the removal of both pollutants. The starting concentration of each contaminant was halved during 20 min of UVA irradiation. The decomposition process of CBZ over investigated nanocomposites proceeded differently than it was observed for the classical photocatalyst P25. The kinetics of the removal followed as a pseudo-first order regime with the k(1) in range 0.0827-0.1751 min(-1) for BPA and 0.0131-0.0743 min(-1) for CBZ. Toxicity to Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna was significantly reduced indicating formation of non-toxic products of photooxidation of tested contaminants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The tetracycline, antibiotic considered as a recalcitrant pollutant, was successfully depleted from model aqueous solutions by immobilized laccase from Trametes versicolor in an enzymatic membrane reactor. The results obtained show that tetracycline is depleted from water solutions at room temperature and without adding any extra chemicals. The degradation of tetracycline in aqueous solutions at 20 mg L-1 during 24 h, with equivalent amounts of free or immobilized biocatalyst, allowed reaching a tetracycline degradation yield of 56% with an enzymatic membrane whereas it was only of 30% with free laccase. This result highlights the good reactivity and stability of the immobilized enzyme for the degradation of tetracycline. Moreover, the enzymatic membrane reactor was able to reach a constant degradation rate of 0.34 mg of tetracycline per hour during 10 days. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressant drugs have been detected in municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs) at ng/L to low mu g/L concentrations. We exposed fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) over a full lifecycle to a mixture of five antidepressants at concentrations similar to a MWWE (1x AntiD Mix); venlafaxine at 2400 ng/L, citalopram at 240 ng/L, fluoxetine at 90 ng/L, sertraline at 20 ng/L, and bupropion at 90 ng/L, and 10x these concentrations (i.e. 10x AntiD Mix). Mean measured concentrations of venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and bupropion were 2300, 160, 110, 7 ng/L, and below detection limits, respectively, for the 1x AntiD Mix, and 33,000, 2900, 1000, 210, and 100 ng/L, respectively for the 10x AntiD Mix. During the life-cycle exposure, no significant changes were observed in survival of fathead minnows. When male fish from the exposed treatments reached maturity, their weights were increased compared to control males. There were no significant differences in condition factor, gonadosomatic index, or liver-somatic index in the exposed fish. Exposed fathead minnows produced similar numbers of eggs as control fish, and there were no changes in nest-defense behaviours of male minnows. Egg quality, % fertilization, and % hatching in F1 fry were unaffected by exposure to the antidepressants. Eggs hatched 0.5 d earlier, deformities in fry were 50% lower, and there were transient decreases in length of F1 larvae at 8 days post-hatch in offspring from the treatment with the 10x AntiD Mix. Overall, exposure to the antidepressant mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 1x AntiD Mix) caused no adverse effects in fathead minnows. Exposure to the 10x AntiD Mix increased the weight of adult male minnows and caused subtle effects in F1 offspring. This study is the first to assess sublethal effects in fish exposed to mixtures of antidepressants over a full lifecycle.
   Capsule: No effects were observed in fathead minnow exposed for a lifecycle to antidepressant mixtures at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of oxidation processes such as UV and/or H2O2 will change the physicochemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT). It may affect the sorption affinity of CNT to different contaminants and then affect their fate in the environment. In the present study the adsorption of two very common used pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and naproxen) onto CNT treated by UV, H2O2 or UV/H2O2 was investigated. Four different adsorption models (Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich) were tested. The best fitting of experimental data was observed for Freundlich or Langmuir model. The significant relationships between Q calculated from Langmuir model with 0% and dispersity were observed. Kinetics of diclofenac and naproxen followed mainly pseudo-second order indicating for chemisorption limiting step of adsorption. The data showed that the mechanism of sorption was physical or chemical depending on the type of CNT modification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recovering nutrients from urine as solid minerals such as struvite can eliminate many hurdles related to the use of liquid urine as fertilizer in the current urine separation systems. The focus of this study has been to increase nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies by developing a struvite formation and recycling process. Struvite crystallization was carried out in urine samples by addition of MgO where 92% of phosphorus as orthophosphate was recovered. In order to optimize the use of calcined struvite in the struvite recycling step, four calcination treatments were tested and calcination at 200 degrees C for 3 h was chosen for further experiments. To remove the remaining ammonia present in urine a struvite recycling step was used subsequently. Through sequential struvite formation and struvite recycling process up to 90% of ammonium nitrogen was successfully removed.

AB This paper investigates the separation process of two estrogenic hormones, estrone and estradiol, using eight commercial NF and low pressure RO membranes. The results indicate that the separation mechanism of estrone and estradiol in membrane filtration processes is similar. While estrogenic hormone retention by more porous membranes decreases with decreasing adsorption and the subsequent retention is relatively low, tighter NF and RO membranes can retain estrogenic hormones effectively. It appears that the presence of organic matter in solution can enhance retention due to the interaction of such substances with estrogenic hormones. The results also suggest that physicochemical interactions within the membrane can play an important role. There is no cross-flow velocity effect on retention, whereas an increase in transmembrane pressure may lead to a decrease in steroid hormones retention for some membranes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are characterized by specific physical and chemical parameters including high pressure, high temperature gradients and high concentrations of toxic elements. Bacteria recovered from hydrothermal vents were studied for their capability to produce polysaccharides in normal conditions. A first screening performed on mesophilic aerobic bacterial strains led to the discovery of unusual polymers in terms of chemical composition and theological properties. Neutral polysaccharides were found, along with uronic-rich exopolymers. In addition, a new sugar was identified in two polymers. Additional studies identified this compound as a hexuronic acid substituted with an ether-linked lactic acid. The sulfate content as estimated by FTIR indicated concentrations ranging from 2 to 21%. These high sulfate concentrations are uncommon in microbial polysaccharides and may lead to new applications in the pharmaceutical area. Uronic-rich exopolymers could be expected to have some heavy metal binding capability and applications in the fields of biodetoxification and wastewater treatment.

AB Several pharmaceuticals were followed through a drinking water production process on the river Meuse. Tramadol and levetiracetam were the most common compounds while cytostatics were not detected. All compounds found at that intake point had an annual consumption greater than 90 mg/inhabitant. The tracer substance 1,2,3-benzotriazole allowed estimation of the maximal concentration of pharmaceuticals and the evolution profile for tramadol and sotalol. After pre-ozonation of raw water, most pharmaceuticals were completely removed, except levetiracetam and irbesartan, confirming the efficiency of this advanced oxidation process. Irbesartan and levetiracetam were completely removed by granular activated carbon filtration. Levetiracetam was the most reluctant compound. A conventional multi-barrier treatment combining ozone and activated carbon, already used for several decades before implementation in wastewater treatment, can completely remove most pharmaceuticals. Therefore, drinking water without any significant health-related amount of these pharmaceuticals can be produced from surface water.

AB Among all emerging substances in water, pharmaceutical products (PPs) and residues are a lot of concern. These last two years, the number of studies has increased drastically, however much less for water resources and drinking water than for wastewater. This literature review based on recent works, deals with water resources (surface or groundwater), focusing on characteristics, occurrence and fate of numerous PPs studied, and drinking water including water quality. Through this review, it appears that the pharmaceutical risk must be considered even in drinking water where concentrations are very low. Moreover, there is a lack of research for by-products (metabolites and transformation products) characterization, occurrence and fate in all water types and especially in drinking water.

AB Yeast, an abundant, environmental-friendly and renewable biomass source, was successfully converted into three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical porous carbon via a template-free carbonization and alkaline-activation. The optimal YHPC-3 obtained at 850 degrees C and mass ratio of KOH: pre-carbonized yeast of 3:1 exhibits the high specific surface area (3808 m(2)/g) and large pore volume (2.202 cm(3)/g) and was used as adsorbent to eliminate sulfamethazine (SMZ) from water, with a large adsorption capacity of 1244 mg/g at 298 K. YHPC-3 had high adsorption affinity toward SMZ over a broad pH range. YHPC-3 exhibited the excellent regeneration and stability property, showing a great promising application in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds which are used to preserve human and animal health. Once administered, these compounds are metabolized or can remain unaltered until excreted. Therefore, a mixture of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites enters municipal sewers and wastewater treatment plants where, depending on their polarity, water solubility, and persistence, they cannot be completely removed or transformed during the treatment process, so that unaltered pharmaceuticals and/or their metabolites can enter surface water. As a result, in recent years concern has grown about trace concentrations and the risk they pose to ecosystems, considering the annual increase in pharmaceutical production and use at world level.
   This chapter reviews the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Originally developed during the mid-1980s as a test for detecting the developmental toxicity of pure chemical products and complex mixtures in the laboratory, in recent years it has been used to evaluate the mechanisms of action, biotransformation, and detoxification of xenobiotics as well as in ecotoxicology studies using alternative species and in situ monitoring.

AB A novel graphite oxide/poly(acrylic acid) grafted chitosan nanocomposite (GO/CSA) was prepared and used as biosorbent for the removal of pharmaceutical compound (dorzolamide) from biomedical synthetic wastewaters. The performance was evaluated taking into account pH, kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption. GO/CSA presented higher adsorption capacity in comparison with the parent materials (graphite oxide and poly(acrylic acid) grafted chitosan). All adsorbents prepared were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and potentiometric titration. The surface features were also evaluated after the dorzolamide adsorption in order to derive the adsorption mechanism. It was suggested that the reactive groups of GO and CSA can interact with the amino groups of dorzolamide and mainly the abundance of carboxyl groups of GO/CSA composite was the main reason for its enhanced adsorption capacity.

AB There are numerous observations of pharmaceuticals (or their metabolites) as contaminants in wastewater, surface water and groundwater. This implies a potential for indirect human exposure to pharmaceuticals via drinking water supplies. Various effect benchmarks may be employed in an evaluation of the significance of such indirect exposure. In this study a comparison was made between reported concentrations of pharmaceuticals in German drinking water and therapeutic dose. The margin between potential indirect daily exposure via drinking water and daily therapeutic dose was at least three orders of magnitude and typically much more. For certain compounds it was also possible to benchmark exposure against ADIs derived within the context of meat and food stuff residues following veterinary use. In all cases potential exposure was less than the ADIs, similarly suggesting that for these compounds there are no substantial concerns with regards to indirect exposure via drinking water.

AB Several novel fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs), fully miscible with water and with excellent surfactant behavior, have been studied for pharmacological applications. The use of these novel FILs as drug delivery systems can improve the bioavailability, stability and efficacy of therapeutic proteins. An initial screening of toxicity in four different human cell lines indicated that some of the FILs possess low cytotoxicity. An environmental hazard assessment of these compounds, in the context of Green Pharmacy, is necessary before a pharmaceutical application takes place. In this work, ecotoxicity tests have been performed in aquatic species with different levels of biological organization (Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna and Lemna minor) to evaluate intrinsic hazard that these FILs might pose after being released to the aquatic environment from the human body or from industrial processes. Additionally, the biodegradability of these compounds has been evaluated using microorganisms from wastewater treatment plants.

AB Olive processing wastewaters (OPW), namely olive mill wastewater (OMW) and table-olive wastewaters (TOW) were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against five Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria using the standard disc diffusion and thin layer chromatography (TLC)-bioautography assays. Disc diffusion screening and bioautography of OMW were compared to the phenolic extracts of table-olive brines. Positive activity against S. aureus was demonstrated. The optimization of chromatographic separation revealed that hexane/acetone in the ratio of 4: 6 was the most effective for phenolic compounds separation. A HPLC-MS analysis was performed showing that only two compounds, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the predominant phenolic compounds in all OPW. The phenolic extract of OMW generated by a semi-modern process showed the highest free radical-scavenging activity (DPPH assay) compared to the other phenolic extracts. It is apparent from the present study that OPW are a rich source of antioxidants suitable for use in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.

AB The sorption-desorption of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in sand/soil columns can be used to infer performance of managed aquifer recharge. Removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) from synthetic wastewater, containing 100 mu g.L-1 of each pharmaceuticals, was studied in recirculating sand columns amended with uncoated or methacrylic acid (MAA) coated magnetite nanoparticles. Removal of CBZ and DTZ in MAA-magnetite column (68.34% and 61.91%, respectively) was much higher than that with uncoated magnetite (53.47% and 50.26%, respectively). Rapid decrease of dissolved organic carbon concentrations across nanoparticle amended columns (between 42.28% and 50.08% on Day 1), followed by slow recuperation suggests adsorption-desorption dynamics and competition of dissolved organic matter for sorption sites. Core-level binding energy and charge analysis for Fe(2s) and O(1s) in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests involvement of physisorption process on the NP surfaces.

AB The aquatic environment is continually exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals, whereby effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one key source. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental risk assessments (ERAs) addressing individual substances are sufficiently protective for such coincidental mixtures. Based on a literature review of chemicals reported to occur in municipal WWTP effluents and mode-of-action considerations, four different types of mixtures were composed containing human pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and chemicals regulated under REACH. The experimentally determined chronic aquatic toxicity of these mixtures towards primary producers and the invertebrate Daphnia magna could be adequately predicted by the concept of concentration addition, with up to 5-fold overestimation and less than 3-fold underestimation of mixture toxicity. Effluents of a municipal WWTP had no impact on the predictability of mixture toxicity and showed no adverse effects on the test organisms. Predictive ERAs for the individual mixture components based on here derived predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC5) and median measured concentrations in WWTP effluents (MCeff) indicated no unacceptable risk for any of the individual chemicals, while MCeff/PNEC summation indicated a possible risk for multi-component mixtures. However, a refined mixture assessment based on the sum of toxic units at species level indicated no unacceptable risks, and allowed for a safety margin of more than factor 10, not taking into account any dilution of WWTP effluents by surface waters. Individual substances, namely climbazole, fenofibric acid and fluoxetine, were dominating the risks of the investigated mixtures, while added risk due to the mixture was found to be low with the risk quotient being increased by less than factor 2. Yet, uncertainty remains regarding chronic mixture toxicity in fish, which was not included in the present study. The number and identity of substances composing environmental mixtures such as WWTP effluents is typically unknown. Therefore, a mixture assessment factor is discussed as an option for a prospective ERA of mixtures of unknown composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When reverse osmosis brines from potable wastewater reuse plants are discharged to poorly-flushed estuaries, the concentrated organic contaminants are a concern for receiving water ecosystems. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/S2O82-) advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) may reduce contaminant burdens prior to discharge, but the effects of the high levels of halide, carbonate and effluent organic matter (EfOM) normally present in these brines are unclear. On the one hand, these substances may reduce process efficiency by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate (SO4 center dot-) radicals. On the other, the daughter radicals generated by halide and carbonate scavenging may themselves degrade organics, offsetting the effect of ROS scavenging. UV/H2O2 and UV/S2O82- AOPs were compared for degradation of five pharmaceuticals spiked into brines obtained from two reuse facilities and the RO influent from one of them. For UV/H2O2, EfOM scavenged -75% of the (OH)-O-center dot, reducing the degradation efficiency of the target contaminants to a similar extent; halide and carbonate scavenging and the reactivities of associated daughter radicals were less important. For UV/S2O82-, anions (mostly Cl-) scavenged -93% of the SOT. Because daughter radicals of Cr contributed to contaminant degradation, the reduction in contaminant degradation efficiency was only -75-80%, with the reduction driven by daughter radical scavenging by EfOM. Conversion of SO4- to more selective halogen and carbonate radicals resulted in a wider range of degradation efficiencies among the contaminants. For both AOPs, 250 mJ/cm(2) average fluence achieved significant removal of four pharmaceuticals, with significantly better performance by UV/S2O82- treatment for some constituents. Accounting for the lower brine flowrates, the energy output to achieve this fluence in brines is comparable to that often applied to RO permeates. However, much higher fluence was required for the least reactive pharmaceutical. Comparing AOP application to the RO influent or brine, equal or greater removal was achieved for brine treatment for comparable energy input. AOP treatment of brines could be applied to reduce, but not eliminate, contaminant burdens prior to discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anastrozole (ANZ) is a breast cancer drug that was introduced onto the pharmaceutical market in the 1990s and is still one of the most widely consumed cytotoxic compounds. Due to the persistence of the drug, its continued presence after passing through wastewater treatment plants can lead to harm to aquatic environments. The present study investigates use of the solar photo-Fenton (SPF) process applied for ANZ degradation, considering the fate of ANZ and its transformation products (TPs). The SPF process was performed using different concentrations of ferrous iron (Fe2+) and H2O2 in solutions produced with deionized water (DW) and hospital wastewater (HWW), at pH close to neutrality. When solar irradiation in the SPF process was carried out the best ANZ removal rates were found under the following conditions: (i) for the DW matrix, [ANZ](0) = 50 mu g L-1, [Fe2+] = 5 mg L-1, and [H2O2](0) = 25 mg L-1, achieving 95% primary ANZ elimination; (ii) for the HWW matrix, [ANZ](0) = 50 mu g L-1, [Fe2+] = 10 mg L-1(multiple additions), and [H2O2](0) = 25 mg L-1, achieving 51% primary ANZ elimination. LC-QTOF MS analysis allowed to identify tentatively five transformation products (TPs) formed during the ANZ degradation process in DW, and two TPs when HWW was used. The main proposed degradation pathways were demethylation and hydroxylation. Different in silico models free available (quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) software were used to predict the ecotoxicities and environmental fates of ANZ and the TPs. The in silico (Q)SAR predictions indicated that ANZ and the TPs were non-biodegradable compounds. In silico (Q)SAR predictions for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity end-points identified some TPs that require further study. Attention is drawn to the formation of several TPs for which statistical and rule-based positive alerts for mutagenic activities were found, requiring further confirmatory in vitro validation tests.

AB Antibiotic pollution via wastewaters has led to many environmental problems. In this work, to remove ciprofloxacin which is an antibiotic from water, foil photocatalyst of zinc oxide nanowires doped with copper and cerium oxides was applied under UV light irradiation. An empirical model was developed to determine the photocatalyst activity using response surface methodology. The independent variables were the concentrations of precursors, copper and cerium nitrates in the coating solution. TheF-value andp-value of the model showed the accuracy of the model. The statistical analysis indicated that copper oxide had larger effect on the response than cerium oxide. The optimized catalyst was determined and characterized using ICP, XRD, SEM and MIP techniques. The results of this work which are comparable to those of the previous studies have the advantage of easy separation of the photocatalyst from water without using a centrifuge.

AB Gallic acid is a major phenolic pollutant present in the wastewater generated from cork boiling, olive mill, and pharmaceutical industries. Experimental and statistical modelling using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were carried out for reactive separation of gallic acid from aqueous stream using tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) in hexanol. TBP has a more significant effect on extraction efficiency as compared to temperature and pH. The optimum conditions of 2.34 g L-1, 65.65 % v/v, 19 degrees C, and 1.8 of initial concentration of gallic acid, concentration of TBP, temperature, and pH, respectively, were obtained using RSM. Under optimum conditions, extraction efficiency of 99.45 % was obtained for gallic acid. The ANN and RSM results were compared with experimental unseen data. Error analysis suggested the better performance of ANN for extraction efficiency predictions.

AB Ciprofloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is one of the top pharmaceutical contaminants in water and many approaches have been developed for the removal of ciprofloxacin in wastewater. In this study, ciprofloxacin adsorption is carried out using a low-cost silica xerogel synthesized by a simple sol-gel method. The effect of pH, contact time, initial concentration of ciprofloxacin and temperature on the adsorption of ciprofloxacin by the silica xerogel is investigated. At optimum adsorption conditions, the experimental data fits well to a Langmuir isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The maximum ciprofloxacin adsorption capacity is determined as 24.45 mg g(-1). Thermodynamic parameters show that ciprofloxacin adsorption by the silica xerogel is a spontaneous endothermic process. Moreover, reusability experiments reveal that the silica xerogel can be effectively used several times for ciprofloxacin adsorption. The promising results indicate that the silica xerogel can be regarded as potential adsorbent for ciprofloxacin removal.

AB The widespread and large scale use of platinum group metals, especially palladium, in a wide variety of industrial applications has seen their levels in wastewater streams, roadside dust and even pharmaceuticals significantly rise over recent years. Due to the possible environmental damage and potential health risk this may cause, there is now substantial demand for inexpensive, efficient and robust methods for the detection of palladium. Based upon self-immolative linker technologies, we have designed and synthesised a number of allyl ether-functionalised electrochemical probes to determine the optimum probe structure required to deliver a ratiometric electrochemical detection method capable of achieving a limit of detection of<1mg/mL within 20min through the use of disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes. Combined with an enzymatic assay, this method was then used to achieve a proof-of-principle ratiometric electrochemical molecular logic gate.

AB The degradation of solutions with paracetamol and diclofenac has been studied by electro-oxidation (E0x), in a reactor with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a stainless steel cathode. Different current densities were applying: 1.56 to 6.25 mA/cm(2). Close to 50% of mineralization is always achieved due to the great concentration of center dot OH generated at the BDD surface under EOx, with release of NH4+ and NO3- ions. Same solutions have been comparatively treated with electro-Fenton (EF/BDD) process, improved the mineralization reached 80% of efficiency. Reversed-phase chromatography was carrying out to identify some by products that evolve under de degradation process. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB Most commercially available auto-sampling devices do not support a continuous flow-proportional sampling mode, which would conceptually be the best for collecting representative composite samples. Instead different discrete sampling modes are available. Household chemicals can show considerable random short-term variations. With the anticorrosive benzotriazole, relating to a middle-frequent household activity, we show that, besides an accurate flow meter, mainly three factors are decisive for the representativeness of a substance's average load: the substance's load pattern, the sampling frequency and the length of the composite sample. When the sampling intervals are 10 minutes or longer, errors in the order of +/- 40% (standard deviation) or more have to be accepted, if the substance of interest is contained in a low number of wastewater pulses (i.e. the level of household activity). This particularly holds true for specific pharmaceuticals e.g. carbamazepine. Ammonium would be less critical, because it relates to a larger number of sources in the same catchment.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antimicrobial agent, are in common use and can be often detected in the environment. The constructed wetland systems (CWs) are one of the technologies to remove them from the aquatic environment. The final effect of the treatment processes depends on many factors, including the interaction between plants and the plant-associated microorganisms present in the system. Bacteria living inside the plant as endophytes are exposed to secondary metabolites in the tissues. Therefore, they can possess the potential to degrade aromatic structures, including residues of pharmaceuticals. The endophytic strain MG7 identified as Microbacterium sp., obtained from root tissues of Phalaris arundinacea exposed to DCF and SMX was tested for the ability to remove 2 mg/l of SMX and DCF in monosubstrate cultures and in the presence of phenol as an additional carbon source. The MG7 strain was able to remove approximately 15% of DCF and 9% of SMX after 20 days of monosubstrate culture. However, a decrease in the optical density of the MG7 strain cultures was observed, caused by an insufficient carbon source for bacterial growth and proliferation. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto autoclaved cells was negligible, which confirmed that the tested strain was directly involved in the removal of DCF and SMX. In the presence of phenol as the additional carbon source, the MG7 strain was able to remove approximately 35% of DCF and 61% of SMX, while an increase in the optical density of the cultures was noted. The higher removal efficiency can be explained by adaptive mechanisms in microorganisms exposed to phenol (i.e. changes in the composition of membrane lipids) and by a co-metabolic mechanism, where non-growth substrates can be transformed by non-specific enzymes. The presence of both DCF and SMX and the influence of the supply frequency of CWs with the contaminated wastewater on the diversity of whole endophytic bacterial communities were demonstrated. The results of this study suggest the capability of the MG7 strain to degrade DCF and SMX. This finding deserves further investigations to improve wastewater treatment in CWs with the possible use of pharmaceuticals-degrading endophytes.

AB The wastewater contamination of a Swiss university hospital by active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) residues was evaluated with a three months monitoring campaign at the outlet of the main building. Flow-proportional samples were collected with an automatic refrigerated sampler and analyzed for 15 API, including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory drugs, by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The metals Gd and Pt were also analyzed using ICP-MS. Measured concentrations were compared to the predicted ones calculated after the drug average consumption data obtained from the hospital pharmacy. The hospital contribution to the total urban load was calculated according to the consumption data obtained from city pharmacies. Lastly, the environmental hazard and risk quotients (RQ) related to the hospital fraction and the total urban consumption were calculated. Median concentrations of the 15 selected compounds were ranging from 0.04 to 675 mu g/L, with a mean detection frequency of 84%. The ratio between predicted and measured environmental concentrations (PEC/MEC) has shown a good accuracy for 5 out of 15 compounds, revealing over-and under-estimations of the PEC model. Mean daily loads were ranging between 0.01 and 14.2 g/d, with the exception of paracetamol (109.7 g/d). The hospital contribution to the total urban loads varied from 2.1 to 100% according to the compound. While taking into account dilution and removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plant, only the hospital fraction of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole showed, respectively, a high (RQ > 1) and moderate (RQ > 0.1) risk for the aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, when considering the total urban consumption, 7 compounds showed potential deleterious effects on aquatic organisms (RQ > 1): gabapentin, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, ibuprofen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid. In order to reduce inputs of API residues originating from hospitals various solutions can be envisioned. With results of the present study, hospital managers can start handling this important issue.

AB A procedure was developed to assess the biodegradation of micropollutants in cell-free lysates produced from activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This proof-of-principle provides the basis for further investigations of micropollutant biodegradation via native enzymes in a solution of reduced complexity, facilitating downstream protein analysis. Differently produced lysates, containing a variety of native enzymes, showed significant enzymatic activities of acid phosphatase, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase in conventional colorimetric enzyme assays, whereas heat deactivated controls did not. To determine the enzymatic activity towards micropollutants, 20 compounds were spiked to the cell-free lysates under aerobic conditions and were monitored via LC-ESI-MS/MS. The micropollutants were selected to span a wide range of different biodegradabilities in conventional activated sludge treatment via distinct primary degradation reactions. Of the 20 spiked micropollutants, 18 could be degraded by intact sludge under assay conditions, while six showed reproducible degradation in the lysates compared to the heat-deactivated negative controls: acetaminophen, N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (acetyl-SMX), atenolol, bezafibrate, erythromycin and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ). The primary biotransformation of the first four compounds can be attributed to amide hydrolysis. However, the observed biotransformations in the lysates were differently influenced by experimental parameters such as sludge pre-treatment and the addition of ammonium sulfate or peptidase inhibitors, suggesting that different hydrolase enzymes were involved in the primary degradation, among them possibly peptidases. Furthermore, the transformation of 10-OH-CBZ to 9-CA-ADIN was caused by a biologically-mediated oxidation, which indicates that in addition to hydrolases further enzyme classes (probably oxidoreductases) are present in the native lysates. Although the full variety of indigenous enzymatic activity of the activated sludge source material could not be restored, experimental modifications, e.g. different lysate filtration, significantly enhanced specific enzyme activities (e.g. >96% removal of the antibiotic erythromycin). Therefore, the approach presented in this study provides the experimental basis for a further elucidation of the enzymatic processes underlying wastewater treatment on the level of native proteins.

AB Four side-by-side pilot-scale vertical flow (VF) constructed wetlands of different designs were evaluated for the removal of eight widely used emerging organic contaminants from municipal wastewater (i.e. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, diclofenac, tonalide, oxybenzone, triclosan, ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A). Three of the systems were free-draining, with one containing a gravel substrate (VGp), while the other two contained sand substrate (VS1p and VS2p). The fourth system had a saturated gravel substrate and active aeration supplied across the bottom of the bed (VAp). All beds were pulse-loaded on an hourly basis, except VS2p, which was pulse-loaded every 2 h. Each system had a surface area of 62 m(2), received a hydraulic loading rate of 95 mm/day and was planted with Phragmites australis. The beds received an organic loading rate of 7-16 g TOC/m(2)d. The sand-based VF (VS1p) performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than the gravel-based wetland (VGp) both in the removal of conventional water quality parameters (TSS, TOC, NH4-N) and studied emerging organic contaminants except for diclofenac (85 +/- 17% vs. 74 +/- 15% average emerging organic contaminant removal for VS1p and VGp, respectively). Although loading frequency (hourly vs. bi-hourly) was not observed to affect the removal efficiency of the cited conventional water quality parameters, significantly lower removal efficiencies were found for tonalide and bisphenol A for the VF wetland that received bi-hourly dosing (VS2p) (higher volume per pulse), probably due to the more reducing conditions observed in that system. However, diclofenac was the only contaminant showing an opposite trend to the rest of the compounds, achieving higher elimination rates in the wetlands that exhibited less-oxidizing conditions (VS2p and VGp). The use of active aeration in the saturated gravel bed (VAp) generally improved the treatment performance compared to the free-draining gravel bed (VGp) and achieved a similar performance to the free-draining sand-based VF wetlands (VS1p).

AB The study established an integrated view to evaluate the effect of exogenous organic carbon (EOC) on removal rate of cefradine and amoxicillin by Microcystis aeruginosa. Meanwhile, the toxicity control assessment of effluents was also investigated on the rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) during the algal treatment. The results indicated that glucose and NaAc could be consumed as EOC which enhanced the treatment efficiency of cefradine from 27.11% to 85.19% and amoxicillin from 14.70% to 58.20%, while the toxicity of the reaction products could be controlled at a similar level as the antibiotic itself. Moreover the algal treatment and nutrition regulation could also be applied for artificial wastewater and significantly promote the removal rate with respective increases of 47.04% and 48.75% for cefradine and amoxicillin, respectively.

AB Azithromycin (AZI) has been listed as an emerging contaminant by the US EPA since 2009 because it is frequently detected in wastewater, surface water, and drinking water. In this paper, the chlorination of AZI in drinking water was simulated and studied. The results indicated that new compounds were generated in the chlorination of AZI. The byproducts were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF), and four of the byproducts were detected in real water samples. The kinetic studies demonstrated that the reaction rates of AZI chlorination were dependent on the initial concentration of free chlorine and the pH value. The potential toxicities of the byproducts were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship software and investigated by the viability of Chinese hamster lung (CHL), Jurkat T and Hep G2 cells.

AB In this study, nitrate ion (NO3-) was found to collaborate with ozone thereby accelerating the degradation of ketoprofen. NO3- was discovered to induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals (<bold>OH</bold>), which was crucial to the decomposition of PPCPs in wastewater treatment plants. Kinetic studies on the decomposition of ketoprofen were investigated under different concentrations of NO3-. The impact mechanisms and degradation by-products were experimentally determined. The results revealed that all reactions fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model well. The presence of NO3- had the capacity to accelerate the ozonation of ketoprofen. The reaction by-products were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and a total of five intermediates generated via the ozonation of ketoprofen were assessed. The transformation pathways were concluded to be hydroxylation, nitration, and debenzophenone and ketonized reactions. Additionally, the toxicity of the by-products was evaluated by employing Chlorella and Daphnia magna.

AB The continuous release of antibiotic compounds through wastewater effluent into environment has raised concerns about their potential problems for different organisms. Enzymatic degradation with laccase is a green option for removal of pharmaceutical compounds from aqueous media. In this study, laccase was immobilized onto homemade Polyacrylonitrile-biochar composite nanofibrous membrane and the obtained biocatalyst was employed for removal of chlortetracycline, a widely used antibiotic, from aqueous media in continuous mode. The results showed that the immobilized laccase has improved storage, temperature and pH stability compared to free laccase. Also, it retained more than 50% of its initial activity after 7 cycles of ABTS oxidation which indicated improved enzyme reusability. Finally, while using immobilized laccase for degradation of chlortetracycline in continuous mode exhibited 58.3%, 40.7% and 22.6% chlortetracycline removal efficiency at flux rates of 1, 2 and 3 mL/h.cm(2).

AB This work aimed to study both the removal of nutrients and pharmaceuticals, namely salicylic acid or paracetamol, from water by the culture of Chlorella sorokiniana. The removal of nutrients was nearly complete at the end of the batch culture; above 70% for nitrates and 89% for phosphates in the semicontinuous culture. The pharmaceuticals removal kinetics were 2.3 times greater for the salicylic acid than paracetamol, reaching volumetric efficiencies above 93% for salicylic acid in the semicontinuous culture. Finally, to separate the microalgae biomass from treated water, metal salts, synthetic polyelectrolytes and a biopolymer were tested as coagulants-flocculants. The best flocculation results were achieved with AlCl3 (95.23% with 200 mg g(-1), 1 min incubation time). However, given that resulting flocs had different characteristics, flocculants must be chosen on the basis of the subsequent use of the biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of phenolic wastewaters by means of H2O2-promoted TiO2 photocatalysis was investigated in single baffle reactor concerning the effect of major operating factors, namely H2O2 dosage and method of addition on process efficiency. Addition of hydrogen peroxide enhances considerably treatment efficiency and its beneficial role is associated with increased production of radicals due to its reaction with conduction band electrons and other reactive species. When compared to rate of degradation, the solar/TiO2/H2O2 process is two to three times faster than the solar/TiO2 process. For untreated samples of 400 mg/L phenol concentration, from pharmaceutical industry the BOD/COD ratio is 0, while solar photocatalytic treatment of 4 h enhanced the biodegradability values to 0.44. Results of this study open new research window for a more complex approach to photocatalytic experiments where photocatalysis can be combined with hydrogen peroxide.

AB Lipases are enzymes used in various industrial sectors such as food, pharmaceutical and chemical synthesis industries. The selection of microorganisms isolated from soil or wastewater is an alternative to the discovery of new species with high enzymes productivity and with different catalytic activities. In this study, the selection of lipolytic fungi was carried out by submerged fermentation. A total of 27 fungi were used, of which 20 were isolated from dairy effluent and 7 from soil contaminated with diesel oil. The largest producers were the fungi Penicillium E-3 with maximum lipolytic activity of 2.81 U, Trichoderma E-19 and Aspergillus O-8 with maximum activities of 2.34 and 2.03 U where U is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 mu mol of fatty acid per min per mL of enzyme extract. The fungi had maximum lipolytic activities on the 4th day of fermentation.

AB Cetirizine dihydrochloride, a pharmaceutical drug of the class antihistamines is frequently detected in wastewater samples. In the present work, the degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride is carried out using a novel technique of laccase enzyme as a catalyst under the influence of ultrasound irradiation. Effect of various process parameters such as enzyme loading, temperature, power, duty cycle, frequency and speed of agitation has been studied along with identification of the degradation intermediates. The maximum degradation of 91% is achieved at optimized experimental parameters such as 0.02% enzyme loading (w/v), 50 degrees C temperature, power input of 100W, 25 kHz frequency and 50% duty cycle with agitation speed of 200 rpm. It is observed that enzymatic degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride under the influence of ultrasound irradiation not only enhances the degradation but also reduces the time of degradation as compared to conventional enzymatic degradation technique.

TI Catalyst free production of partial glycerides: acetone as solvent

LA English
DT Article
ID CRUDE GLYCEROL; METHYL-ESTERS; OIL
AB Glycerolysis of sunflower oil was studied using acetone as the solvent. Reactions were carried out at 200 to 250 degrees C without the need of conventional catalyst. The use of acetone in glycerolysis of oil allowed the reaction to be carried out at 250 degrees C and 1.8 MPa, resulting in a product that comprises 4.5% solketal, 5.8% FFA, 49.2% MG, 33.5% DG and 7% TG in 2 h. The important parameters investigated in this study were acetone addition, stirring and reactor loading. This new approach in the synthesis of partial glycerides (monoglycerides and diglycerides) avoids the use of chemical catalyst, thus avoiding unnecessary wastewater production. The partial glycerides produced may be utilized in may areas of food and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover the use of acetone as solvent allows the process to be carried out at lower operating pressures compared to other non-catalytic glycerolysis and at the same time co-produces solketal, having a wide application in fuels, pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis.

AB Glucocorticoid (GC) release into the environment has led to widespread detection of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity in water resources that has been shown to persist throughout conventional and some advanced wastewater treatment processes. Here, we used high performance liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore the reaction of natural (cortisone, cortisol) and synthetic (prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone) GCs with free chlorine (HOCl) to simulate their fate during chemical disinfection of water and wastewater. Generally, GCs react slowly (t(1/2) similar to 7-200 h) with HOCl when compared to other steroid classes, but they yield complex mixtures of transformation products, with at times the majority of product mass comprising structurally identifiable and likely bioactive steroids. For example, we frequently observed chlorination at the C-9 position (e.g., 9-chloro-prednisone), a reaction known to increase GC activity 4-fold. We also identified reaction products in the adrenosterone family of androgens produced via cleavage of the C-17 side-chain on many GCs. Another common transformation pathway was the conversion of endogenous GCs to their more potent synthetic analogs via oxidation at the C-1/C-2 positions, with unsaturation reported to increase GR activity 4-fold (e.g., cortisol to prednisolone). Despite identification of such products, in vitro assays generally suggest GR activity decreases with extent of parent decay during chlorination. Cortisol was the exception, with GR activity only decreasing 2-fold in product mixtures (based on measured EC50 values) despite a 95% reduction in parent concentration, a result attributable to formation of the more potent prednisolone during chlorination. Furthermore, our assay likely underestimates product bioactivity as it did not account for the activity of several identified GC byproducts that first require in vivo activation via C-11 reduction, nor did it consider androgen receptor (AR) activity associated with byproducts from the adrenosterone family. To avoid formation of product mixtures with conserved bioactivity, advanced chemical oxidation processes may represent a more promising approach; we show that GCs react much more rapidly with ozone (t(1/2) similar to 0.4-1.3 min) and produce no observable UV-active products. This suggests disruption of the GC conjugated p-electron and ring systems, thereby likely mitigating biological activity.

AB This study examined the significance of changes of UV absorbance and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as surrogate indicators for assessing the formation of bromate and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) during the ozonation of surface water and wastewater effluent. Spectroscopic monitoring was carried out using benchtop UV/Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers and a newly developed miniature LED UV/fluorescence sensor capable of rapidly measuring UVA280 and protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. With the increase of O-3/DOC mass ratio, the plots of BDOC formation were characterized of initial lag, transition slope and final plateau. With the decrease of UV absorbance and fluorescence, BDOC concentrations initially increased slowly and then rose more noticeably. Inflection points in plots of BDOC versus changes of spectroscopic indicators were close to 35 -45% loss of UVA254 or UVA280 and 75-85% loss of humic-like fluorescence. According to the data from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with organic carbon detection and 2D synchronous correlation analyses, DOM fractions assigned to operationally defined large biopolymers (apparent molecular weight, AMW>20 kDa) and medium AMW humic substances (AMW 5.5-20 kDa) were transformed into medium-size building blocks (AMW 3-5.5 kDa) and other smaller AMW species (AMW<3 kDa) associated with BDOC at increasing 03/DOC ratios. Appreciable bromate formation was observed only after the values of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence in 03-treated samples were decreased by 45 55%, 50-60% and 86-92% relative to their respective initial levels. No significant differences in plots of bromate concentrations versus decreases of humic-like fluorescence were observed for surface water and wastewater effluent samples. This was in contrast with the plots of bromate concentration versus UVA254 and UVA280 which exhibited sensitivity to varying initial bromide concentrations in the investigated water matrixes. These results suggest that measurements of humic-like fluorescence can provide a useful supplement to UVA indices for characterization of ozonation processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sludge treatment wetlands (STWs) have recently been used to treat surplus sludge. However, the distribution of antibiotics involved in the process has not been comprehensively investigated.
   This study aimed to evaluate the fate of two antibiotics, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZM) in STWs during the treatment of surplus sludge. Three pilot-scale STWs units-S1 with aeration tubes, S2 with aeration tubes and reed planting, and S3 with reed planting-were constructed and operated under feeding followed by resting periods. The results showed that antibiotic content in residual sludge decreased over time and unit S2 performed the best in terms of antibiotic removal. Planting reed considerably improved the antibiotic removal performance of the STWs. Biodegradation and absorption resulted in removal of most of the antibiotics in the test units. Less than 2% of the antibiotics was taken up by plants, whereas <5% of the influent antibiotics left the STW units through the drainage discharge.

TI UV-Irradiation of the Antibiotic Sulfathiazole Surprisingly Leads to

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely distributed in low concentrations in the water compartment. Conventional sewage treatment plants (STP) are not capable to remove pharmaceuticals to the full extent, so alternative methods such as ozonization or photooxidation are tested as additional stage. However, it has been shown that in many cases no complete mineralization is achieved during these processes and transformation products occur. Up to now only little is known about these transformation products in terms of their structure and toxicity. The antibiotic sulfathiazole (STZ) is used in veterinary medicine and it can be detected in different water matrices such as STP effluent or surface water. We tested the ability of photooxidation for degradation of STZ using a medium pressure mercury lamp. LC-UV showed the formation of several minor compounds and one main transformation product which has been isolated subsequently. Using NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry techniques, we were able to reveal the structure of promizole, an antituberculotic, used in the 1950s. This compound showed a reduced microbial activity in Brilliant Black Reduction Maximum Residue Level test. Furthermore, there was no difference in the effects of promizole when compared to STZ on cell toxicity and cell proliferation in two murine cell lines.

AB Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely used in the treatment of major depression. It has been detected in surface and wastewaters, being able to negatively affect aquatic organisms. Most of the ecotoxicity studies focused only in pharmaceuticals, though excipients can also pose a risk to non-target organisms. In this work the ecotoxicity of five medicines (three generic formulations and two brand labels) containing the same active substance (fluoxetine hydrochloride) was tested on the alga Chlorella vulgaris, in order to evaluate if excipients can influence their ecotoxicity. Effective concentrations that cause 50% of inhibition (EC50) ranging from 0.25 to 15 mg L-1 were obtained in the growth inhibition test performed for the different medicines. The corresponding values for fluoxetine concentration are 10 times lower. Higher EC50 values had been published for the same alga considering only the toxicity of fluoxetine. Therefore, this increase in toxicity may be attributed to the presence of excipients. Thus more studies on ecotoxicological effects of excipients are required in order to assess the environmental risk they may pose to aquatic organisms.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) represent a large group of micropollutants in wastewaters (WW) worldwide. Many PCs are resistant to conventional WW treatment. Moreover, for some PCs the removal process is reversible. The aim of this study was to test three newly developed ceramic carriers for biofilm formation and PCs removal. The testing of untreated WW samples by liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry allowed to detect the occurrence of 18 PCs in the range from 26 ng/L to 20,688 ng/L, with the highest concentrations found for caffeine. Besides, among PCs with concentrations above 1,000 ng/L, ibuprofen (19,234 ng/L), naproxen (1,405 ng/L), xylazine (1,366 ng/L), and diclofenac (1,311 ng/L) were found. Two aliquots of municipal WW were treated on laboratory scale by contacting with the filtering medium for 2 h and 7 days. The majority of PCs detected in WW were removed more effectively during the first 2h when using filtering media coated with a previously developed biofilm derived from activated sludge. The removal of PCs from the second portion of WW by the biofilm-coated filtering media over 7 days was comparable to the results obtained over 2 h. Particular attention was paid to the reversible occurrence of some PCs in WW. Thus, a higher number of PCs with negative removal yield was observed when using filtering media without biofilm, as compared to the biofilm-coated media, namely, losartan, ketoprofen, valsartan, atorvastatin, and naproxen. However, sulfamethoxazole showed an increased concentration in WW after 7 days in contact with biofilm-coated media. An increase of diclofenac in WW after 7 days incubation was detected regardless of the presence of biofilm. One of three ceramic materials tested, i.e., oxide ceramics sintered at 1700 degrees C from alumina, kaolin, and silica demonstrated the best results in terms of minimizing the reversible occurrence of PCs in WW (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Metformin, an antidiabetic drug with one of the highest consumption rates of all pharmaceuticals worldwide, is biologically degraded to guanylurea in wastewater treatment plants. Due to high metformin influent concentrations of up to 100 mu g/L and its high but incomplete degradation both compounds are released in considerable amounts of up to several tens of mu g/L into recipient rivers. This is the first systematic study on their environmental fate and the effectiveness of treatment techniques applied in waterworks to remove metformin and guanylurea from surface water influenced raw waters. The concentrations in surface waters depend strongly on the respective wastewater burden of rivers and creeks and are typically in the range of about 1 mu g/L for metformin and several mu g/L for guanylurea but can reach elevated average concentrations of more than 3 and 20 mu g/L, respectively. Treatment techniques applied in waterworks were investigated by an extended monitoring program in three facilities and accompanied by laboratory-scale batch tests. Flocculation and activated carbon filtration proved to be ineffective for removal of metformin and guanylurea. During zonation and chlorination experiments with waterworks-relevant ozone and chlorine doses they were partly transformed to yet unknown compounds. The effectiveness of the treatment steps under investigation can be ordered chlorination > zonation > activated carbon filtration > flocculation. However, most effective for removal of both compounds at the three full-scale waterworks studied proved to be an underground passage (riverbank filtration or artificial groundwater recharge). A biological degradation is most likely as sorption can be neglected. This is based on laboratory batch tests conducted with three different soil materials according to OECD guideline 106. Since such treatment steps were implemented in all three drinking water treatment plants, even traces of metformin and its metabolite guanylurea could not be detected at the end of the treatment trains. Both can only be expected in finished drinking water if surface influenced raw water is used by direct abstraction without underground passage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WTTPs) contribute to anthropogenic chemical contamination through the release of treated effluent. A constructed wetland (CW) interfaced with a WTTP could potentially purify and naturalize effluent water. This pilot study aimed to acquire baseline chemical data on the fate and distribution of phthalates in the water, sediment, and vegetation (Typhaspp.) of a fully operational horizontal subsurface flow CW adjoined to a WWTP in Oregon, USA. Sample collection followed the flow of water from entrance to exit of the CW. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the most abundant analogs in all matrices. Results indicate reduction of phthalates in water exiting the CW. Significant concentrations of DBP, DEHP, and other water-soluble phthalates were found in the shoots ofTypha, indicating plant uptake as a potentially important removal mechanism.

AB Naproxen is an organic micropollutant widely distributed in municipal wastewaters and water bodies, it is not eliminated by wastewater treatment plants, and it accumulates in soil. In this research, the capability of the non-viable Rhizopus oryzae biomass (wet and dry) to sorb naproxen at environmentally relevant concentrations was assessed in batch experiments. Naproxen sorption was carried out as a function of pH and modeled by kinetic and equilibrium equations. Naproxen sorption increased with increasing pH values using wet biomass, but it also increased at acidic pH values with dried biomass. Dried biomass was more efficient and faster in removing naproxen and the maximum sorption was 1027.45 mu g naproxen per gram of dried biomass at pH 4.7. Wet biomass sorption capacity was low and slow, and the equilibrium was achieved at 7 days, whereas with dried biomass at 26 h. Freundlich isotherm describes naproxen sorption by dried biomass.

The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, SPAN-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent and trioctylamine as carrier. The process parameters namely, feed concentration, pH, internal reagent concentration and surfactant concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium (VI) were: feed concentration (224.04 ppm), pH (2.76), internal reagent concentration (0.71 N) and surfactant concentration (1.92%, w/w). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 92.50%. (C) 2009 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work developed a new method of multiple-phase extraction and in situ coupling of crystallization (MPE-CC) for the enrichment and enantioseparation of amlodipine (AD) from pharmaceutical wastewater. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) experiments were utilized to estabilish a suitable extraction system. An n-heptane solution containing P507 (2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) as extractant and a dimethylsulfoxide solution containing (D)-tartaric acid or (L)-tartaric acid as chiral resolving agent were used as the extraction phase and stripping phase (also as crystallization mother liquor), respectively. The optimized LLE conditions were: P507 concentration of 4.44 mmol/L, pH of 6.0, and amlodipine concentration of 10 mmol/L. However, the enrichment performance of single stage extraction and back-extraction was insufficient to crystallize amlodipine in the stripping phase with an extraction percentage of 34.0%, so repetitive LLE was used to increase the extraction percentage (86.3%, repeat six times) and subsequently (S)-amlodipine crystal was in situ generated with (D)-tartaric acid. The operation of repetitive LLE was intermittent and tedious. To simplify the operation, an equivalent method of three-phase extraction and in situ coupling of crystallization (TPE-CC) were developed. After optimizing the parameters of TPE-CC, an enantiomeric excess (ee(S)-AD) of 85.8% for the (S)-amlodipine crystal was obtained under the flow rate of 30 mL/min and molar ratio of 0.25 for (D)-tartaric acid to amlodipine. Finally, MPE-CC was established by adding a secondary back-extraction and crystallization column based on TPE-CC. The racemic amlodipine from wastewater was recycled and enantioseparated into high-value-added products of two amlodipine enantiomers with an ee(S)-AD of 92.2% for (S)-amlodipine crystal and an ee(R)-AD of 94.3% for (R)-amlodipine crystal. The crystal products were characterized by HPLC and SEM. MPE-CC exhibits better enantioseparation performance than TPE-CC due to the additional effect of impurity removal in MPE-CC.

AB Background: Rivers receive water and associated organic micropollutants from their entire catchment, including from urban, agricultural and natural sources, and constitute an important environmental component for catalyzing pollutant turnover. Environmental removal processes were extensively investigated under laboratory conditions in the past but there is still a lack of information on how organic micropollutants attenuate on the catchment scale. The aim of this study was to describe the chemical and toxicological profile of a 4th order river and to characterize in-stream processes. We propose indicator chemicals and indicator in vitro bioassays as screening methods to evaluate micropollutant input and transport and transformation processes of the chemical burden in a river. Carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were selected as indicators for dilution processes and the moderately degradable chemicals tramadol and sotalol as indicators for potential in-stream attenuation processes. The battery of bioassays covers seven environmentally relevant modes of action, namely estrogenicity, glucocorticogenic activity, androgenicity progestagenic activity and oxidative stress response, as well as activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, using the GeneBLAzer test battery and the AhR-CALUX and AREc32 assays.
   Results: Both approaches, targeted chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays, identified a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as a major input source of organic micropollutants that dominantly influenced the water quality of the river. Downstream of the WWTP the amount of detected chemicals and biological effects decreased along the river flow. The organic indicator chemicals of known degradability uncovered dilution and potential loss processes in certain river stretches. The average cytotoxic potency of the river water decreased in a similar fashion as compounds of medium degradability such as the pharmaceutical sotalol.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the indicator chemical/indicator bioassay approach is suitable for identifying input sources of a mixture of organic micropollutants and to trace changes in the water quality along small rivers. This method forms the necessary basis for evaluating the natural attenuation processes of organic micropollutants on a catchment scale, especially when combined with enhanced sampling strategies in future studies.

AB Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is increasingly used for municipal wastewater treatment and reuse and great concerns have been raised to some emerging trace pollutants found in aquatic environment in the last decade, notably the pharmaceuticals. As a consequence the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants by MBRs has been extensively investigated. But there is still a lack of knowledge on the effects of the current presence of pharmaceutical micropollutants in domestic wastewaters on MBR fouling. Among the different pharmaceuticals, it was decided to focus on carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug, because of its occurrence in domestic wastewaters and persistency in biological processes including MBRs. This paper focuses on the effects of continuous carbamazepine pollution on MBR fouling. A continuous introduction of CBZ into the MBR via the feed (about 90 mu g L-1 CBZ in the feed) provoked a TMP jump. It occurred just 1 day after the addition of CBZ in MBR and a significantly higher increase rate of TMP was also observed after 1 day after addition of CBZ in MBR, as compared to that before addition of CBZ. This indicates that the pharmaceutical stress induced by CBZ causes more severe membrane fouling. Addition of CBZ was shown to induce a significant increase of the concentration of proteins in the supernatant at the beginning several days then stabilized to original level whereas no significant change was found for polysaccharides. HPLC-SEC analysis showed that addition of CBZ induced a decrease of 100-1000 kDa protein-like SMPs and a more significant increase of 10-100 kDa protein-like SMPs in the supernatant. Moreover it was found that addition of CBZ in the MBR affected the sludge microbial activities, as a slight inhibition (about 20%) of the exogenous respiration rate was observed. The increased membrane fouling could be related to the change in biomass characteristics and supernatant quality after addition of CBZ in MBR. This study allows also suggesting that 10-100 kDa protein-like SMPs might accumulate inside the biocake that was formed on the membrane surface during MBR operation and play an important role in the TMP jump phenomenon.

AB The degradation of clofibric acid (CA) in UV254/H2O2 process under three temperature ranges, i.e. T1 (9.0-11.5 degrees C), T2 (19.0-21.0 degrees C) and T3 (29.0-30.0 degrees C) was investigated. The effects of solution constituents including NO3- and HCO3- anions, and humic acid (HA) on CA degradation were evaluated in Milli-Q waters. CA degradation behaviors were simulated with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the apparent rate constant (k(ap)) and half-life time (t(1/2)) were calculated. The results showed that higher temperature would favor CA degradation, and CA degradation was taken place mostly by indirect oxidation through the formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals in UV254/H2O2 process. In addition, the effects of both NO3- and HCO3- anions at two selected concentrations (1.0 x 10(-3) and 0.1 mol L-1) and HA (20 mg L-1) on CA degradation were investigated. The results showed that HA had negative effect on CA degradation, and this effect was much more apparent under low temperature condition. On the other hand, the inhibitive effect on CA degradation at both lower and higher concentrations of bicarbonate was observed, and this inhibitive effect was much more apparent at higher bicarbonate concentration and lower temperature condition. While, at higher nitrate concentration the inhibitive effect on CA degradation under three temperature ranges was observed, and with the temperature increase this negative effect was apparently weakened. However, at lower nitrate concentration a slightly positive effect on CA degradation was found under T2 and T3 conditions. Moreover, when using a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent spiked with CA over 99% of CA removal could be achieved under 30 degrees C within only 15 min compared with 40 and 80 min under 20 and 10 degrees C respectively, suggesting a significant promotion in CA degradation under higher temperature condition. Therefore, it can be concluded that temperature plays an important role in CA degradation in UV/H2O2 process. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of two domestic wastewater aeration lagoons on freshwater mussels. Mussels were caged and placed in two final aeration lagoons for treating domestic wastewaters for 60 days, at a site I km downstream of the dispersion plume on the eastern shores of the Richelieu River; the western shore served as the reference site. The mussels were analysed for gonad activity, oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, stress biomarkers and neuroendocrine status (monoamine and arachidonic acid metabolism). The domestic wastewaters produced many different effects at all levels examined. The gonado-somatic index and vitellogenin-like proteins were significantly induced in both aeration lagoons and gonad pyrimidine synthesis (aspartate transcarbamylase activity) was significantly reduced, indicating that vitellogenin-like proteins were produced while DNA synthesis in gametes remained constant. Biomarkers of oxidative metabolism revealed that global heme oxidase (HO), glutathione S-transferase and Xanthine (caffeine) oxydoreductase (XOR) activities were significantly induced in at least one of the aeration lagoons, but not downstream of the dispersion plume. The activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome P4501A1), dibenzoylfluorescein (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5) and benzoyloxyresorurufin (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2136) dealkylases were readily induced by substances sharing structural similarities with coplanar polyaromatic hydrocarbons and hydroxylated or aminated aromatic or cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as pharmaceuticals or steroids in the domestic wastewaters Biomarkers of toxic stress revealed that exposure to aeration lagoons led to increased production of metallothioneins, lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks, with decreased heme oxygenase activity. LPO was significantly correlated with XOR, HO and cytochrome P4501A1 activities. Neuroendocrine effects included significant increases in dopamine and serotonin levels and in monoamine oxidase (MAO). Dopamine transport in synaptosorne was significantly increased while serotonin transport activity was significantly decreased, suggesting the mussels were in a state of serotonergicity. Moreover, arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was also readily increased in one aeration lagoon. Aeration lagoons for the treatment of domestic wastewaters are toxic, estrogenic and disrupt the metabolism of monoamines and COX in freshwater mussels.

AB Because an understanding of aquatic bioaccumulation of human pharmaceuticals in Latin America is limited, this area was recently identified as a priority environmental quality research need. We examined bioaccumulation of twenty-seven pharmaceuticals. illicit drugs and their metabolites in muscle, liver and gills of multiple fish species (Rhamdia quelen, Hypostomus commersoni, Mottos lacerdae, Prochilodus lineatus) from an urban river receiving wastewater discharges (Parana) and a lotic system (Acaragua) without direct wastewater sources, which runs through a protected area. All samples were analyzed using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Caffeine, which was detected up to 13 mu g/kg, and antibiotics were consistently detected in all fish. Among antibiotics, erythromycin was ubiquitous (0.7-5.6 mu g/kg) but its tissue concentrations were lower than levels of sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim (0.9-5.5 mu g/kg), which are used in human medicine, aquaculture and livestock. Erythromycin bioaccumulation in fish is reported here from Argentina for the first time, though levels of antibiotics in edible muscles of these species were lower than the maximum residue limits for human consumption. We observed norfluoxetine, the primary active metabolite of the antidepressant fluoxetine, ranging from 1.1-9.1 mu g/kg in fish. We further identified benzoylecgonine, a primary metabolite of cocaine, in fish from both study systems, representing the first observation an illicit drug or associated metabolites bioaccumulation in aquatic life from Argentina. Interestingly, high pharmaceutical levels were observed in fish from the Acaragua river suggesting their transport into the protected area, from the surrounding lands. Though fish from the Parana river were sampled near WWTP discharges, pharmaceutical concentrations may have been reduced by hydrological and other environmental conditions, and biological differences among species. These findings, which observed bioaccumulation of select pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and illicit drugs in wild fish sampled inside a protected area highlight the importance of developing an advanced understanding of urban influences on inland protected watersheds.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are found in municipal effluents and represent the major sources of contamination for the aquatic environment. A preliminary chemical analysis of wastewater identified several compounds associated with PPCPs, including caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine. The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxic and oxidative effects of these products and other wastewater-related products (i.e., coprostanol, cotinine, estradiol-17 beta, nonylphenol, and cholesterol) in primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes. The redox activity of various PPCPs in trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver microsomes was investigated in vitro by tracking the rate of oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) after a 60-min incubation period. In addition, primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to various drugs identified in the municipal effluent for 48 h at 15 degrees C. Our results show that most PPCPs (83%) accelerated the rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of microsomes and 72% of them increased LPO in microsomal membranes. LPO levels were significantly correlated (R = 0.5; P < 0.05) with the number of functional groups on the molecule's backbone (i.e., number of O, S, N, P/number of C and H) and negatively so (R = -0.44; P < 0.05) with the octanol/water partition coefficient, suggesting that nucleophilicity and hydrophobicity are related to oxidative activity for these compounds. Exposure of trout hepatocytes to these products leads in many cases to decreased cell viability, increased CYP3A-related monooxygenase activity (benzylether resorufin dealkylase), and LPO. No induction of CYP1A1-related activity (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase)was observed. Moreover, municipal effluent extracts (ethanol) were able to increase all the above responses in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the basic redox properties of PPCPs could influence oxidative metabolism in liver cells and lead to oxidative damage. These products have the potential to produce a toxic response in aquatic organisms and the above biomarkers were shown to respond readily to PPCPs in aquatic organisms.

AB Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously reintroduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lion fish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.

AB Diosgenin is used widely to synthesize steroidal hormone drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. The conventional diosgenin production process, direct acid hydrolysis of the root of Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright (DZW), causes large amounts of wastewater and severe environmental pollution. To develop a clean and effective method, the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. CPCC 400226 was screened for the first time for the microbial biotransformation of DZW in submerged fermentation (SmF). Statistical design and response surface methodology (RSM) were implemented to develop the diosgenin production process using the Fusarium strains. The environmental variables that significantly affected diosgenin yield were determined by the two-level Plackett-Burman design (PBD) with nine factors. PBD indicates that the fermentation period, culture temperature, and antifoam reagent addition are the most influential variables. These three variables were further optimized using the response surface design (RSD). A quadratic model was then built by the central composite design (CCD) to study the impact of interaction and quadratic effect on diosgenin yield. The values of the coefficient of determination for the PBD and CCD models were all over 0.95. P-values for both models were 0.0024 and <0.001, with F-values of similar to 414 and similar to 2215, respectively. The predicted results showed that a maximum diosgenin yield of 2.22% could be obtained with a fermentation period of 11.89 days, a culture temperature of 30.17 degrees C, and an antifoam reagent addition of 0.20%. The experimental value was 2.24%, which was in great agreement with predicted value. As a result, over 80% of the steroidal saponins in DZW were converted into diosgenin, presenting a similar to 3-fold increase in diosgenin yield. For the first time, we report the SmF of a Fusarium strain used to produce diosgenin through the microbial biotransformation of DZW. A practical diosgenin production process was established for the first time for Fusarium strains. This bioprocess is acid-free and wastewater-free, providing a promising environmentally friendly alternative to diosgenin production in industrial applications. The information provided in the current study may be applicable to produce diosgenin in SmF by other endophytic fungi and lays a solid foundation for endophytic fungi to produce natural products.

AB In this study, we used isotopic ( delta O-18, delta H-2, delta S-34-SO4) and chemical tracers (boron) to assess the sources and transport processes of the micropollutants carbamazepine, galaxolide, and bisphenol A in groundwater underlying the city of Halle (Saale), Germany Their ubiquitous presence in urban groundwater results from a combination of local river water infiltration, sewer exfiltration, and urban stormwater recharge. Attenuation during transport with infiltrating river water increased from carbamazepine (0-60%) to galaxolide (60-80%) in accordance with their increasing sorption affinity and decreasing recalcitrance against biodegradation. Distinctly higher attenuation during transport was found for carbamazepine (85-100%) and galaxolide (95-100%) if micropollutants originated from sewer exfiltration. Most likely, this is related to higher contents of organic matter and higher transit times of the respective flow paths. Although attenuation undoubtedly also affects the transport of bisphenol A, quantification is limited due to additional contributions from the urban stormwater recharge. As a consequence, micropollutant loads in groundwater indicate that groundwater discharge may dominate the export of bisphenol. A from urban areas. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential risk of pharmaceuticals in the environment to top-predators is still largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the immunotoxic effects of ten pharmaceuticals individually and as mixtures on a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) B lymphoma cell line. A significant reduction in lymphocyte transformation was observed following an exposure to 12,500 mu g/L 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and 25,000 mu g/L naproxen. Exposure to 12,500 mu g/L 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol decreased the percentage of cell in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle while increasing the percentage of cells in the S phase. Carbamazepine exposure increased the amount of cells in the G(2)/M phase. Binary mixtures showed synergistic effects in lymphocyte transformation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Concentrations inducing toxic effects in the cell line were similar to those affecting fish in previous studies. A reduction of functional activities of the immune system may lead to altered host resistance to pathogens in free-ranging pinnipeds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation and ozone-based advanced oxidation processes have been shown to be effective in the oxidation of several pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) routinely detected in surface waters. Under typical operating conditions of these processes, most of the parent compound oxidized is expected to lead to the formation of transformation products (TPs). For a target ozone exposure, the resulting hydroxyl radical exposure depends on the water matrix or process chosen (e. g. peroxone) which in turn may influence the degradation pathway and the TPs formed. This study was undertaken to examine the expected impact that varying ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures may have on TP formation from the oxidation of PhACs during typical drinking water ozonation. Two representative PhACs were selected for the study. Carbamazepine was chosen to represent PhACs with a fast reaction rate with ozone (k(O3) > 10(4) M (1) s (1)) and bezafibrate was chosen to represent PhACs with a slow to moderate reaction rate with ozone (k(O3) < 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). The results show that under varying ozone and hydroxyl exposure scenarios examined, the major oxidation pathway for the parent compound was dominated by reaction with ozone for carbamazepine while for bezafibrate it varied.

AB This study investigated the sorption behaviour of two endocrine disrupting chemicals; 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 beta-ethinylestradiol and their thermodynamic properties in an activated sludge biomass. The partition coefficient values measured for E2 and EE2 at varying temperatures range from 245 - 604 L/kg (log K-d 2.39 -2.78) and 267 - 631 L/kg (Log K-d 2.43 - 2.80), respectively. The chemisorption K-d values were inversely related to temperature. The average percentages of E2 and EE2 adsorbed to the solid phase at 4.3 % dry solid were 87.2 % and 92.5 %, respectively. Sorption of E2 and EE2 to the activated sludge biomass was found to be spontaneous and entropy retarded with Delta G values in the range of -13 to -16 KJ/mol and Delta S value of -105.2J/mol/K and 96.7 J/mol/k for E2 and EE2, respectively. The enthalpy changes for E2 and EE2 were -45.7KJ/mol and -43.4KJ/mol respectively, demonstrating that the sorption process is exothermic. The values of the enthalpy changes also show that the mechanism of sorption is physisorption with some element of chemisorption.

AB Waterless urinals can save significant amounts of water but they can also be used to separate concentrated urine at source. Urine collection in established buildings is often costly because the plumbing system must be retrofitted for separate urine pipes. In addition, waterless urinals often have issues with blockages because of solids building up in the piping system.
   To solve these challenges, we have developed a fertilizer-producing urinal that uses no water and does not have to be connected to a conventional sewage line to operate. We designed and constructed the urinal using a plastic funnel and collection tank. The urinal recovered 11.23 +/- 1.3 g of solid fertilizer per kg of urine and we found that 1000 nutrient recovery urinals could produce an income of $85/day. This novel approach offers a new and easy method for collecting urine within office blocks or other commercial buildings. In addition, the recycling of nutrients at source offers a more sustainable and environmentally method for fertilizer production since minimal energy is required and "waste" streams are converted into useful products.

AB Due to their widespread use, clofibric acid (CA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) have been frequently detected simultaneously at relatively high concentrations in aquatic environments. In this study, agricultural waste rice straw was employed as a potentially low-cost, effective and easy-to-operate biosorbent (RSB) to remove CA and CBZ. The adsorption of both pharmaceuticals followed pseudo second-order kinetics, and intraparticle diffusion was an important rate-limiting step. The adsorption isotherms of both drugs were fit well with Freundlich model. The adsorption of CA onto RSB was exothermic and was more likely to be dominated by physical processes, while the adsorption of CBZ was endothermic. Solution pH was determined to be the most important factor for CA adsorption, such that the adsorption capacity of CA onto RSB increased with the decline of solution pH. In the lower range of solution pH below 3.1, the CA removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of biosorbent dosage. The CBZ removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of RSB dosage without pH control. The maximum adsorption capacities were 126.3 mg/g for CA and 40.0 mg/g for CBZ.

AB Planned potable water recycling has become an important strategy for managing drinking water supplies in a growing number of countries including Australia, the USA, Namibia, Singapore and some parts of Europe. This involves the advanced treatment of municipal wastewaters (treated sewage) prior to reuse by supplementation of drinking water supplies. In order to ensure the protection of public health, careful assessment and management of trace chemical contaminants is essential. Important chemical contaminants include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroidal hormones, pesticides, industrial chemicals, perfluorochemicals, antiseptics and disinfection by-products. Monitoring of key toxic chemicals of concern is important and can be supplemented by techniques for direct toxicological assessment of whole water samples. Furthermore, monitoring of a limited range of identified indicator chemicals and surrogate parameters can be an effective means for confirming ongoing treatment performance of individual unit treatment processes. This chapter provides a description of some of the most significant planned potable water recycling schemes currently in operation or under development around the world. It highlights the various approaches used in the assessment of chemical safety for these schemes, and hence the alternatives that are available for the assessment of future potable water recycling schemes.

AB A photocatalytic reactor membrane pilot system, employing UV/TiO(2) photocatalysis, was evaluated for its ability to remove thirty-two pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, and estrogenic activity from water. Concentrations of all compounds decreased following treatment, and removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics as a function of the amount of treatment. Twenty-nine of the targeted compounds in addition to total estrogenic activity were greater than 70% removed while only three compounds were less than 50% removed following the highest level of treatment (4,.24 kW h/m(3)). No estrogenically active transformation products were formed during treatment. Additionally, the unit was operated in photolytic mode (UV only) and photolytic plus H(2)O(2) mode (UV/H(2)O(2)) to determine the relative amount of energy required. Based on the electrical energy per order (EEO), the unit achieved the greatest efficiency when operated in photolytic plus H(2)O(2) mode for the conditions tested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been globally detected in impacted natural waters. The detection of trace quantities of EDCs and PPCPs in the environment is of great concern since some of these compounds have known physiological responses at low concentrations. EDCs can have a wide range of polarities, acidic and basic moieties, and exist in trace quantities, which often requires numerous complex extractions, large sample collection volumes, and multiple instrumental analyses. A comprehensive method has been developed allowing for the analysis of 58 potential EDCs in various water matrices using a single solid-phase extraction (SPE) of a 1 L sample with subsequent analyses using both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, each coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS). Instrument detection limits ranged between 0.12-7.5 pg with corresponding method reporting limits of 1-10 ng l(-1) in water. Recoveries for most compounds were between 50%, and 112% with good reproducibility (RSD 6-22%). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Postaeration, where digested sludge is introduced into aerobic conditions, is a technology that could improve the quality of sludge and sludge liquor in many ways. Although it is a fairly simple process, only few data about the effect of postaeration have been published. In this study, batch experiments have been performed first, indicating that postaeration affects the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and sludge dewaterability. In the removal of TAN, both stripping and biological oxidation can play an important role depending on specific condition. Then the postaeration was investigated in a semicontinuous batch reactor. In addition, the effect of postaeration on the concentration of selected micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, EOX and AOX was studied. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8, 6, 4 and 2 days and different aeration intensities were tested. The TAN removal efficiency achieved was about 40-60%, sludge dewaterability expressed by sludge cake total solids (TS) concentration after dewatering improved relatively by 5-30%. In addition, TS degradation is also taking place and therefore the reduction of the amount of final sludge to be disposed could be even higher. The biggest changes in observed parameters were recorded at the longest HRT.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants in a hybrid biofilm-activated sludge process was investigated through batch experiments, modeling, and full-scale measurements. Batch experiments with carriers and activated sludge from the same full-scale reactor were performed to assess the micropollutant removal rates of the carrier biofilm under oxic conditions and the sludge under oxic and anoxic conditions. Clear differences in the micropollutant removal kinetics of the attached and suspended growth were demonstrated, often with considerably higher removal rates for the biofilm compared to the sludge. For several micropollutants, the removal rates were also affected by the redox conditions, i.e. oxic and anoxic. Removal rates obtained from the batch experiments were used to model the micropollutant removal in the full-scale process. The results from the model and plant measurements showed that the removal efficiency of the process can be predicted with acceptable accuracy (+/- 25%) for most of the modeled micropollutants. Furthermore, the model estimations indicate that the attached growth in hybrid biofilm-activated sludge processes can contribute significantly to the removal of individual compounds, such as diclofenac.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments has been of increasing concern in developed and developing countries. The major sources of pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems are waste streams from hospital effluents and excretion (in both metabolized and un-metabolized forms) from humans and animals. This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of four beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol and acebutolol) and four beta-agonists (tulobuterol, salbutamol, clenbuterol and ractopamine) from three hospital effluents and four rivers in southern Taiwan. Analysis was performed via solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. All targets were detected at least once in all collected samples. The most frequently detected compounds were propranolol, atenolol, acebutolol, and ractopamine, which were found in >70% of the collected samples. 83% of water samples contained three or more target compounds. Metoprolol was found in relatively higher concentrations (up to 592 ng/L) in one hospital effluent, although most target compounds were detected in ng/L-range. The concentrations of beta-blockers and beta-agonists observed here were comparable to those reported in previous studies around the world.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is widely used in the world as anti-inflammatory drug, which posed health risk to the environment. A bacterium capable of degrading IBU was isolated from activated sludge in a sewage treatment plant. According to its morphological, physiologic, and biochemical characteristics, as well as 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the strain was identified as Serratia marcescens BL1 (BL1). Degradation of IBU required the presence of primary substrate. After a five-day cultivation with yeast powder at 30 degrees C and pH 7, the highest degradation (93.47%+/- 2.37%) was achieved. The process of BL1 degrading IBU followed first-order reaction kinetics. The BL1 strain was applied to a small biological aerated filter (BAF) device to form a biofilm with activated sludge. IBU removal by the BAF was consistent with the results of static tests. The removal of IBU was 32.01% to 44.04% higher than for a BAF without BL1. The indigenous bacterial community was able to effectively remove CODMn (permanganate index) and ammonia nitrogen in the presence of BL1.

AB Carbamazepine is one of the pharmaceutical compounds frequently detected in the receiving waters and water bodies. The main objective of this study was to develop a quadratic model to predict carbamazepine (CBZ) photocatalytic removal through a response surface methodology. A factorial plan (linear model; 24 experiments) was used to determine the contribution of individual factors (pH, CBZ concentration, photocatalyst concentration, and treatment time) and interactions among the factors. Pollutant concentration and treatment time were found to be the most important parameters influencing the oxidation rate, with respective contributions of 19.22 and 71.55 %. Central composite methodology was then applied to determine the optimal experimental parameters for CBZ oxidation. The highest percentage of CBZ removed was 94.67 +/- 0.51 %, recorded using a pH of 5, a minimal CBZ concentration of 10 mg/L, a photocatalyst concentration of 1.14 g/L, and a treatment time of 90 min. The effects of different anions (NO3- and SO42-) and cations (Cu2+, Cr3+, Zn2+) were also studied. Copper was found to have both catalytic and inhibitory effects on CBZ removal rate.

AB Statins are cholesterol-lowering pharmaceuticals and commonly prescribed drugs in European countries. Their discharge into the aquatic environment has increased in the last few years and they are present at detectable levels in most sewage effluents. The aim of the present study was to quantify the cytotoxic effects of acid and lactone forms of two statins. atorvastatin and simvastatin, as well as selected metabolites (ortho- and para-hydroxy atorvastatin acid, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, simvastatin hydroxyl carboxylic acid, and 3 '' hydroxy simvastatin lactone) to hepatocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Hepatocytes were exposed for 24, 48, and 72 h to different concentrations of each test substance (0.4-400 mu M). Cytotoxicity was measured as metabolic inhibition and loss of membrane integrity with the fluorescent probes alamar blue (AB) and 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA-AM), respectively. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone had dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes. Simvastatin was more toxic than atorvastatin and the lactone form more toxic than the acid form. Exposure time affected atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone but not simvastatin toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aqueous solubilities (S-w) and n-octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow) of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were measured and sorption to two sediments and three soils with organic matter contents ranging from 0.16% to 1.77% and pH ranging between 5.0 and 7.8 was investigated using a batch equilibrium method. SSRIs had high S-w (3,022-15,460 mg/l) and relatively low log K-ow (1.12-1.39). Sorption isotherms followed the Freundlich equation. All SSRIs had sorption capacities of greater than 91% except fluvoxamine with a minimum capacity of 73%. Organic matter contents partly affected sorption, however no correlation between sorption characteristics and cation exchange capacity (CEC) or clay content was observed for any SSRI or adsorbent. Values of K-f, K-d, and log K-oc ranged from 39 to 18,342, from 60 to 42,579, and 3.35 to 6.02 for the SSRIs. SSRIs likely exhibit mixed mechanisms of sorption such as ionic binding in addition to hydrophobic interactions.

AB A systematic study of extraction of various organic pollutants from highly contaminated solid media (e.g., sludge) by applying a phase transition of a benign partially miscible solvent system composed of water/ethyl acetate/ethanol was conducted. This solvent system possesses an upper critical solution temperature of about 55 degrees C. The efficiency of the phase transition extraction (PTE) process is found to be higher and much faster compared to those obtained without phase transition (at ambient temperature). The influence of various operating conditions on the process efficiency was investigated. The performance of the phase transition extraction when applied on contaminated sludge is much better than the extraction with ethyl acetate only, although the latter is shown to be a very efficient solvent for extracting various organic contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals, persistent organic pollutants) from aqueous solutions. The efficiency of phase transition extraction from the aqueous solution was somewhat lower than that achieved with ethyl acetate, but it shows a clear advantage in the presence of detergents, as emulsion formation is prevented.

AB The use of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals is increasing. Over the past decade, there has been a proliferation of research into potential environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment. A Royal Society-supported seminar brought together experts from diverse scientific fields to discuss the risks posed by pharmaceuticals to wildlife. Recent analytical advances have revealed that pharmaceuticals are entering habitats via water, sewage, manure and animal carcases, and dispersing through food chains. Pharmaceuticals are designed to alter physiology at low doses and so can be particularly potent contaminants. The near extinction of Asian vultures following exposure to diclofenac is the key example where exposure to a pharmaceutical caused a population-level impact on non-target wildlife. However, more subtle changes to behaviour and physiology are rarely studied and poorly understood. Grand challenges for the future include developing more realistic exposure assessments for wildlife, assessing the impacts of mixtures of pharmaceuticals in combination with other environmental stressors and estimating the risks from pharmaceutical manufacturing and usage in developing countries. We concluded that an integration of diverse approaches is required to predict 'unexpected' risks; specifically, ecologically relevant, often long-term and non-lethal, consequences of pharmaceuticals in the environment for wildlife and ecosystems.

AB The growing interest in the environmental occurrence of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals is essentially due to their possible health implications to humans and ecosystem. This study assesses the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in a Malaysian tropical aquatic environment taking a chemometric approach using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. Water samples were collected from seven sampling stations along the heavily populated Langat River basin on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia and its main tributaries. Water samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 18 pharmaceuticals and one metabolite, which cover a range of six therapeutic classes widely consumed in Malaysia. Cluster analysis was applied to group both pharmaceutical pollutants and sampling stations. Cluster analysis successfully clustered sampling stations and pollutants into three major clusters. Discriminant analysis was applied to identify those pollutants which had a significant impact in the definition of clusters. Finally, principal component analysis using a three-component model determined the constitution and data variance explained by each of the three main principal components.

AB Development of membrane-associated molecularly imprinted materials that can rapidly recognize and separate specific compounds has broad technological applications for areas ranging from sewage treatments to biomedical devices. However, issues such as low permselectivity and unstable composite structures are restricting it from developing stage to a higher level. Here, inspired by the bioadhesive technology of polydopamine (pDA), a novel porous pDA/SiO2-based molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (PMINcMs) strategy was developed and obtained. The as-prepared PMINcMs were synthesized through an in situ AGET-ATRP method by using ciprofloxacin as template molecule. Importantly, largely enhanced specific rebinding capacity (64.54 mg/g) and permselectivity (the permeability factor 13 was larger than 2.27) had be successfully achieved, which should be attributing to the formation of high-stability and uniform growth of ciprofloxacin-imprinted layers onto the pDA/SiO2-based surfaces. Additionally, the PMINcMs not only exhibited rapid adsorption dynamics of template molecule, but also possessed excellent regeneration performance. All synthesis methods were conducted in water at ambient temperature, which was environmental friendly for scaling up without causing pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed and used because of their specific biological effects. Over the past decade, compounds from various classes of pharmaceuticals have been detected in the environment. Concern has grown about the adverse effects pharmaceuticals in the environment might potentially have on human and ecological health. A sound risk assessment is therefore urgently needed for pharmaceuticals. Standardized tests for assessing the effects of chemicals on environmental organisms are widely used for this purpose. However it is questionable whether classical standardized tests give reliable data needed for environmental risk assessment. In this study we investigated the suitability of the respiration inhibition test OECD 209 for the assessment of the effects of antibiotics, disinfectants and cytotoxics on sewage sludge bacteria. We found that inhibition concentrations can strongly depend on the test period and the type of compound. We conclude that tests to assess the effects of pharmaceuticals on environmental organisms such as bacteria have to be evaluated before their results can be used in environmental risk assessment.

AB Two different electrochemical reduction processes for the removal of dimetridazole, a nitroimidazolebased antibiotic, were examined in this-work. A direct electrochemical reduction was first carried out in a home-made flow cell in acidic medium at potentials chosen to minimize the formation of amino derivatives and then the formation of azo dimer. Analysis of the electrolyzed solution showed a total degradation of dimetridazole and the BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.13 to 0.24. An indirect electrochemical reduction in the presence of titanocene dichloride ((C5H5)(2)TiCl2), which is used to reduce selectively nitro compounds, was then investigated to favour the formation of amino compounds over hydroxylamines and then to prevent the formation of azo and azoxy dimers. UPLC-MS/MS analyses showed a higher selectivity towards the formation of the amino compound for indirect electrolyses performed at pH 2. To confirm the effectiveness of the electrochemical reduction, a biological treatment involving activated sludge was then carried out after direct and indirect electrolyses at different pH. The enhancement of the biodegradability was clearly shown since mineralization yields of all electrolyzed solutions increased significantly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Propranolol (PROP) is a beta-blocicer prescribed mainly to treat human cardiovascular diseases and as a result of its wide usage and persistence, it is reported in aquatic environments. This study examined whether PROP alters developmental patterns and catecholamine (CA)-regulated processes in the zebrafish (Danio redo) and if exposure during early life alters the stress response and behaviors of adults. The calculated 48 h larva LC50 was 21.6 mg/L, well above reported environmental levels (0.01-0.59 mu g/L). Stressed and PROP-exposed adult zebrafish had reduced testosterone and estradiol levels and exhibited behaviors indicating less anxiety than control fish. Furthermore, adults previously PROP-exposed as embryos/larvae had decreased growth in terms of body length and mass. Finally, these adults showed increased cholesterol and a dose-dependent decrease in testosterone levels compared with unexposed zebrafish. Thus PROP-exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae alters developmental patterns and CA -regulated processes that may affect normal behaviors and responses to stressors, and at least some of these changes persist in the adult zebrafish.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) have a remarkable successful effect on fighting animal and human diseases induced by bacteria, too. Over the time, PhACs treatments became victims of their own success, so their intensive use corroborated with their misuse resulted in PhACs treatment resistance microorganisms, becoming a serious health hazard and an environmental threat. In this study, we analysed the effect of four distinct pharmaceutical compounds such as quaternary ammonium compounds (benzenthonium chloride), tricyclic compounds (carbamazepine), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) and a derived compound from pyrimidine (trimethroprim) on five bacterial gram positive and negative strains which are naturally present in the environment. The results pointed out that carbamazepine had a specific inhibitory effect only on Delfia acidovorans and a border line effect on Staphylococcus warneri. On the other side, trimethroprim (80mg/L trimethropim) inhibited the growth of 3 out of 5 bacterial strains, the resistant strains were Citrobacter freundi and Pseudomonas aurantica. Benzenthonium chloride had an overall inhibitory effect with the exception of Staphylococcus warned Interestingly, ciprofioxacin had an inhibitory effect on all bacterial strains regardless of the concentration. This study dearly pointed out that various chemical structures affected specific structural and functional biological bacterial components and their presence into environment could create a massive ecological imbalance with direct impact on human health.

AB The groundwater downstream of a former sewage irrigation farm in Berlin is contaminated with ammonium (NH4 (+)) and para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), besides other anthropogenic pollutants. In the field, in situ removal of NH4 (+) by gaseous oxygen (O-2) and air injection is currently being tested. A laboratory column experiment using aquifer material and groundwater from the site was performed to determine whether this remediation technology is also feasible to reduce high p-TSA concentrations in the anoxic groundwater. First, the column was operated under anoxic conditions. Later, compressed air was introduced into the system to simulate oxic conditions. Samples were collected from the column outlet before and after the addition of compressed air. The experiment revealed that whereas p-TSA was not removed under anoxic conditions, it was almost fully eliminated under oxic conditions. Results were modelled using a transient one-dimensional solute transport model. The degradation rate constants for p-TSA increased from 2.8E-06 to 7.5E-05 s(-1) as a result of microbial adaption to the change of redox conditions. Results show that O-2 injection into an anoxic aquifer is a successful strategy for p-TSA remediation.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a widely used anti-epileptic drug that has been detected in wastewaters from sewage treating plants and thus appears in rivers, streams and other water bodies. As plants can absorb this compound, it can also appear in edible plants like lettuce, entering the food chain. In this study, the effect of carbamazepine in lettuce plants grown in hydroponic solution is analyzed. CBZ was detected both in roots and in leaves and is shown to induce oxidative stress. Hydrogen peroxide levels increased both in leaves and in roots while malondialdehyde increased only in leaves. Regarding the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the leaves, it is shown that superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) have a relevant role in quenching reactive oxygen species induced by oxidative stress. In roots, the only enzymes that showed increased activity were CAT, GPOD and glutathione reductase (GR). Ascorbate and glutathione also appear to have an important role as antioxidants in response to increased concentrations of carbamazepine. Although the roots are in direct contact with the contaminant, the leaves showed the strongest oxidative effects.

AB In this study, the effects of some operational factors, such as pH value, nano-ZnO loading, UV-A irradiation time, and power of radiation on the degradation efficiency of metronidazole (MNZ) in aqueous solution were discussed through photocatalytic experiments using nano-ZnO as the photocatalyst. Results show that removal of metronidazole (MNZ) and COD has a direct correlation with power of UV-A lamp and irradiation time. MNZ solution (80 mg L-1) was rapidly removed by the irradiation of UV lamp OSRAM 125W high pressure within 180 min. In nano-ZnO/UV photocatalysis reactor, irradiation time and power of UV lamp have a great effect on metronidazole degradation. Statistical analysis (One-way ANOVA) has shown that the pH (in acedic and basic condition) and variation of nano-ZnO concentration has no significant effects on MNZ removal, COD, and BOD5/COD ratio. But the maximum degradation of MNZ occurred at pH 10 and 1.5 gL(-1) nano-ZnO. Maximum degradation of MNZ and COD was 96.55 and 95.42%, respectively. In addition, biodegradability improved from similar to 0 to 0.091 within 180 min.

A solution used in geochemical extraction schemes to determine loosely bound species in sediments, 1 M MgCl2 (pH 8), was chosen to determine loosely bound, and potentially bioavailable, tetracycline antibiotics (TCs), including oxytetracycline (5-OH tetracycline) (OTC) in sediment samples from two rivers on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Bottom sediments were collected at sites upstream from, at, and downstream from municipal sewage-treatment plants (STPs) situated on two natural waterways, Yellow Bank Stream, MD, and the Pocomoke River, MD. Concentrations of easily desorbed OTC ranged from 0.6 to approximately 1.2 mu g g(-1) dry wt sediment in Yellow Bank Stream and from 0.7 to approximately 3.3,mu g g(-1) dry wt sediment in the Pocomoke River. Concentrations of easily desorbable OTC were generally smaller in sediment upstream than in sediment downstream from the STP in the Pocomoke River. STPs and poultry manure are both potential sources of OTC to these streams. OTC that is loosely bound to sediment is subject to desorption. Other researchers have found desorbed TICS to be biologically active compounds.

AB Existing stochastic models for predicting concentrations of down-the-drain chemicals in aquatic environments do not account for the diurnal variation of direct photolysis by sunlight, despite its being an important factor in natural attenuation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a stochastic model incorporating temporal variations in direct photolysis. To verify the model, we measured 57 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a 7.6-km stretch of an urban river, and determined their physical and biological properties in laboratory experiments. During transport along the river, 8 PPCPs, including ketoprofen and azithromycin, were attenuated by >20%, mainly owing to direct photolysis and adsorption to sediments. The photolabile PPCPs attenuated significantly in the daytime but persisted in the nighttime. The observations were similar to the values predicted by the photolysis model for the photolabile PPCPs (i.e., ketoprofen, diclofenac and furosemide) but not by the existing model. The stochastic model developed in this study was suggested to be a novel and useful stochastic model for evaluating direct photolysis of down-the-drain chemicals, which occurs during the river transport.

AB Potential aerobic biodegradation mechanisms of the widely used polar, low-adsorptive sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were investigated in activated sludge at bench scale. The study focused on (i) SMX co-metabolism with acetate and ammonium nitrate and (ii) SMX utilization when present as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. With SMX adsorption being negligible, elimination was primarily based on biodegradation. Activated sludge was able to utilize SMX both as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. SMX biodegradation was enhanced when a readily degradable energy supply (acetate) was provided which fostered metabolic activity. Moreover, it was raised under nitrogen deficiency conditions. The mass balance for dissolved organic carbon showed an incomplete SMX mineralization with two scenarios: (i) with SMX as a co-substrate, 3-amino-5-methyl-isoxazole represented the main stable metabolite and (ii) SMX as sole carbon and nitrogen source possibly yielded hydroxyl-N-(5-methyl-1,2-oxazole-3-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide as a further metabolite.

AB Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and oxidized MWCNTs (O-MWCNTs) were studied for the adsorption of ibuprofen (MU) and triclosan (TCS) as representative types of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) under different chemical solution conditions. A good fitting of sorption isotherms was obtained using a Polanyi-Manes model (PMM). IBU and TCS sorption was stronger for SWCNTs than for MWCNTs due to higher specific surface area. The high oxygen content of O-MWCNT further. depressed PPCP sorption. The sorption capacity of PPCPs was found to be pH-dependent, and more adsorption was observed at pHs below their plc values. Ionic strength was also found to substantially affect TCS adsorption, with higher adsorption capacity observed for TCS at lower ionic strength. In the presence of a reference aquatic fulvic acid (FA), sorption of IBU and TCS was reduced due to the competitive sorption of FA on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Sorption isotherm results with SWCNTs, MWCNTs and O-MWCNTs confirmed that the surface chemistry of CNTs, the chemical properties of PPCPs, and aqueous solution chemistry (pH, ionic strength, fulvic acid) all play an important role in PPCP adsorption onto CNTs.

AB Carbamazepine, which has been used in the treatments of epilepsy, is often found in the environment. Although metabolism of carbamazepine by humans and rats has been characterized, the environmental fate of carbamazepine has not been studied. In this study, two model fungi Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245 and Umbelopsis ramanniana R-56, which have previously shown diverse metabolic activities, were tested for metabolism of carbamazepine. Both fungi produced three metabolites each (C1-C3 and M1-M3). All six metabolites showed [M + H](+) at m/z 253, suggesting addition of one oxygen to the parent compound. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis detected 10, 11-dihydro-10, 11-epoxycarbamazepine as a major product (C3 (47%) and M3 (85%)) and 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (C2 (15%) and M2 (7%)) from carbamazepine through mixed mono-oxidation reactions in both fungal strains. C. elegans was confirmed to produce 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (C1 (38%)) while U. ramanniana produced a yet unidentified ring-hydroxylated metabolite (M1 (8%)). The current study suggests that carbamazepine is likely to be subjected to initially diverse mono-oxygenation reactions by fungal metabolisms, resulting in the formation of the corresponding metabolites, which were similarly found in mammalian metabolisms.

AB An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was made for the common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen. The ERA was performed according to deterministic and probabilistic methods, based on different predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and measured environmental concentrations (MECs) on the exposure side as well as on published and newly elaborated acute ecotoxicity data on the effects side. Compilation of a large set of MECs allowed a qualification of the various PEC derivations. The European Medicines Evaluation Authority (EMEA) phase I PEC was shown to be far above realistic values, while the refined EMEA phase II (A and B) PECs were not too far from the 95th percentile MEC, in agreement with their nature as local PECs. The western European continental and regional PECs extrapolated based on actual use data, using the European Union system for the evaluation of substances, with the region reconfigured for Germany where most of the available European MECs are from, were in good to very close agreement with the median MECs. No risk to surface waters is apparent by any of the methodologies applied from the current use of naproxen; however, because only insufficient chronic ecotoxicity data are available, this is a preliminary conclusion.

AB Benzoylecgonine (BE) is the major metabolite of cocaine and a contaminant of emerging concern often detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and surface waters. In this study, an innovative microcapillary film (MCF) array photoreactor made of fluoropolymer material was used to determine the direct photolysis quantum yield at 254 nm of benzoylecgonine. The photolysis quantum yield of BE was found to be (6.22 +/- 0.19) . 10(-3) mol ein(-1). The proposed methodology was validated by estimating the quantum yield of caffeine (7.48 +/- 0.64) 10(-4) mol ein(-1), which was found in agreement with results published in literature. The MCF uses a very small sample volume (in the order of 330 mu L per meter length of material) and allows extremely rapid photolysis with a short contact time ranging from a fraction of seconds to few minutes. The novel microfluidic-based approach presented in this study is particularly useful for determining the photochemical behavior of highly priced pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, metabolites and uncommon or regulated substances.

AB Among drugs and personal care products, antibiotics arouse interest since they are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and can lead to the development of bacterial resistance. Usually, sewage treatment does not remove most of these compounds. So, these drugs can reach water treatment plants (WTP), where disinfection with chlorine compounds is common. This work aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and preliminary toxicity of the mix of by-products forming due to the chlorination of norfloxacin. This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic indicated for the treatment of urinary infection and gonorrhea, with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). The drug was subjected to chlorination tests, on a bench scale, with several reaction times (from 5 min to 24 h). Analyses of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) were performed for the characterization of the by-products. The MS results showed five peaks attributed to the by-products' formation, of which four were identified. The antibiogram results indicated that the solution that contained the mixture of the by-products lost antibacterial activity against theE.colistrain studied. The acute toxicity tests for theArtemia salinamicrocrustacean showed that the blend of the by-products exhibited higher toxicity than pure norfloxacin.

For the sake of comparison, the experiments were also carried out in the dark, and both CP and IBP were not significantly converted. The degradation rate was enhanced by the simultaneous presence of small concentration of LaFeO3 (130 mg L-1) and H2O2 (0.003 M). However, tests on the aquatic acute toxicity indicate that the degradation products of CP and IBP induce toxic effects on aquatic organisms, consequently indicating incomplete detoxification after 5 h irradiation. The main degradation product of IBP was 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP), detected in the irradiated solutions by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. 4-IBAP was more toxic and showed a slower photocatalytic degradation than the parent compound. On the contrary, the toxicity of CP degradation products, although not negligible, was comparable to that of CP itself.

AB A field survey indicated that the Elbe and Saale Rivers were contaminated with both clofibric acid and ibuprofen. In Elbe River water we could detect the metabolite hydroxy-ibuprofen. Analyses of the city of Saskatoon sewage effluent discharged to the South Saskatchewan river detected clofibric acid but neither ibuprofen nor any metabolite. Laboratory studies indicated that the pharmaceutical ibuprofen was readily degraded in a river biofilm reactor. Two metabolites were detected and identified as hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen. Both metabolites were observed to degrade in the biofilm reactors. However, in human metabolism the metabolite carboxy-ibuprofen appears and degrades second whereas the opposite occurs in biofilm systems. In biofilms the pharmacologically inactive stereoisomere of ibuprofen is degraded predominantly. In contrast, clofibric acid was not biologically degraded during the experimental period of 21 days. Similar results were obtained using biofilms developed using waters from either the South Saskatchewan or Elbe River. In a sterile reactor no losses of ibuprofen were observed. These results suggested that abiotic losses and adsorption played only a minimal role in the fate of the pharmaceuticals in the river biofilm reactors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are receiving global scientific attention due to their occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of 19 PPCPs in 6 lakes and River Nag in the city of Nagpur, India. Grab samples were collected and screened by LC-MS/MS. A total of 13 compounds were detected. In the multiple-site monitoring study, metformin (19-94 mu g/L) and triclosan [upto 74.3 mu g/L] were identified as the major PPCPs. In the single-site study (performed for 2 days at 2-hour interval), a spike was observed in the evening of Day 1, for example, atenolol (0.39-35.9 mu g/L), metoprolol (ND-26.4 mu g/L), acetaminophen (1.64-14.2), naproxen (0.5-15.9 mu g/L), etc. The maximum number of compounds were detected in Lake Futala (13), followed by Gandhisagar (7), Khindsi (6), Ambazari (4), Koradi (4) and Gorewada (1). Triclosan and methylparaben were the major compounds in lake samples.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotics have aroused increasing concerns due to their ability to enhance the resistance of pathogenic bacteria and promote the spread of antibiotic resistance. Biodegradation plays an important role in sulfonamide dissipation in both natural and engineered ecosystems. In this article, we provided an overview of sulfonamide biodegradation in different systems and summarized the relevant sulfonamide-degrading species and metabolic pathways. The removal of sulfonamides depends on a variety of factors, such as the type and initial concentration of sulfonamides, the properties of water or soil, and treatment process. The removal efficiency of sulfonamides by engineered ecosystems can be improved by optimizing their operating conditions. Much higher sulfonamide removal was also observed in upgraded or advanced treatment systems than in conventional activated sludge systems. Ammonia oxidation might promote sulfonamide biodegradation. In addition, sulfonamide-degraders from different bacterial genera have been isolated and classified, but no bioaugmentation practice has been reported. Different pathways have been detected in sulfonamide biodegradation. Further efforts-will be necessary to elucidate in-situ degraders and the metabolic pathways and functional genes of sulfonamide biodegradation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the fate of selected pharmaceuticals and estrogens and the characteristics of bulk organic matter during pellet softening and proposed a possible hybridization with nanofiltration (NF) treatment. A groundwater softening system called pellet softening was used to remove calcium ions from groundwater by crystallizing calcium carbonate on the surface of sand grains that were used as seeding material. This crystallization was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron micrographs were used to characterize the surface of the sand grains during pellet softening. The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix showed that humic-like substances were slightly removed and that specific UV absorbance values decreased after pellet softening. The humic fraction determined by liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection was slightly more attenuated than the fractions of biopolymers, building blocks, low molecular weight acids, and low molecular weight neutrals. Therefore, the aromatic content per unit of dissolved organic carbon was preferentially attenuated during pellet softening. The average removal efficiencies of the three estrogens and 12 selected pharmaceuticals during the softening process were 59 and 5.7%, respectively. However, there was a greater reduction of pharmaceuticals during NF.

AB Studies have shown the potential for antibiotic uptake into food crops from irrigation water and soils containing pharmaceuticals. The objective of the present study was to develop and compare methods quantifying uptake of antibiotics in food crops. Four methods were evaluated: freeze-and-thaw cell lysing, mechanical maceration, tissue sonication, and microwave-assisted solvent extraction. Four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole) were tested representing 4 classes of antibiotics. The methods were evaluated based on method detection limits, analyte recoveries, and sample preparation time. The 2 most viable methods, freeze-and-thaw lysing and mechanical maceration, were used on replicate lettuce (Lactuca sativa) samples grown using irrigation water spiked with 3 of the antibiotic contaminants. Only lincomycin and sulfamethoxazole were detected in lettuce samples at concentrations as high as 1757 ng/g and 425 ng/g, with detection limits of 57 ng/g and 35 ng/g, respectively. Freeze-and-thaw cell lysing provided the highest level of extraction efficiency on environmental samples and required the least amount of sample preparation while providing adequate detection limits and reproducible analyte recovery.

AB Idiopathic autism, caused by genetic susceptibility interacting with unknown environmental triggers, has increased dramatically in the past 25 years. Identifying environmental triggers has been difficult due to poorly understood pathophysiology and subjective definitions of autism. The use of antidepressants by pregnant women has been associated with autism. These and other unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals (UPPs) have also been found in drinking water from surface sources, providing another possible exposure route and raising questions about human health consequences. Here, we examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine, venlafaxine & carbamazepine) in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations. We conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three. We used gene-class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders. Only sets associated with idiopathic autism were unambiguously enriched. We found that UPPs induce autism-like gene expression patterns in fish. Our findings suggest a new potential trigger for idiopathic autism in genetically susceptible individuals involving an overlooked source of environmental contamination.

AB The shortage of water resource in the developing countries induced the search for alternative sources. Greywater alongside storm and ablution water might represent the best source of water because these waters have less contaminant than sewage. However, the separation of this water from the source point is the first step in the proper management which facilitates the treatment process. The selection of treatment technologies for greywater depends on the economic status and standards limits required for disposal or reuse of greywater which differs from one country to the others. In many of the developing countries, the treatment of greywater aims at achieving the basic requirements which lie in the reduction of the main parameters of greywater. The utilisation of flocculation and coagulants process might be effective for this purpose. Many of the natural coagulants have been reported to reduce the main parameters of greywater. In the developed countries, advanced technologies are used for removing of xenobiotics organic compounds (XOCs) and to produce high quality of the treated greywater. This chapter focuses on the treatment technology used for the treatment of greywater and their efficiency in the reduction of XOCs.

AB The non-ionic water-soluble X-ray contrast agent iomeprol (IOM) enters the water supply through sewage treatment plants, which can cause considerable environmental harm. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. I-24 (I-24) was tested for its ability to remove IOM from water via co-metabolic pathways. The optimum removal rate of IOM by I-24 was 38.43% +/- 3.70% when starch served as the source of external carbon, and its co-metabolism of IOM conformed to the first-order kinetics. The highest activity of intracellular enzyme (degrading enzyme) extracted from I-24 was 0.143 +/- 0.005 mU in starch condition. The Michaelis constant of the degrading enzyme was found to be 91.08 mu mol L-1. However, glucose and maltose showed the best promotive effects on the growth and electron transport activity of I-24, indicating that overgrowth may result in competitive inhibition and a reduced degradation rate of IOM. Adding I-24 and degrading enzymes to biological aerated filters increased IOM removal rates without affecting CODMn removal.

AB An experimental study of the homogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton degradation of 4-amidophenol (paracetamol, PCT) is presented. For all the operation conditions evaluated, PCT degradation is efficiently attained by both Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. Also, photonic efficiencies of PCT degradation and mineralization are determined under different experimental conditions, characterizing the influence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Fe(II) on both contaminant degradation and sample mineralization. The maximum photonic degradation efficiencies for 5 and 10 mg L-1 Fe(II) were 3.9 (H2O2 = 189 mg L-1) and 5 (H2O2 = 378 mg L-1), respectively. For higher concentrations of oxidant, H2O2 acts as a "scavenger" radical, competing in pollutant degradation and reducing the reaction rate. Moreover, in order to quantify the consumption of the oxidizing agent, the specific consumption of the hydrogen peroxide was also evaluated. For all operating conditions of both hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II) concentration, the consumption values obtained for Fenton process were always higher than the corresponding values observed for photo-Fenton. This implies a less efficient use of the oxidizing agent for dark conditions.

AB Desorption from soil clay components may affect the transport and fate of antibiotics in the environment. In this study, ciprofloxacin (CIP) desorption from a kaolinite and a montmorillonite was investigated under different pHs, different concentrations of metal cations of various valencies (Na+, Ca2+ and Al3+) and a cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA), and different desorption cycles. Desorption of CIP from kaolinite and montmorillonite was strongly pH-dependent and desorption isotherms were well fitted with the Langmuir equation. The percentage of CIP desorbed increased with increasing initial CIP loadings, desorbing cation concentrations, and desorption cycles. Comparatively, CIP was more readily desorbed from kaolinite than from montmorillonite. Moreover, the hysteresis index values were all negative, suggesting that the presence of metal cations and HDTMA in solution promoted CIP desorption from clay minerals, owing to cation exchange. The XRD analyses indicated that desorption of CIP occurred from both external and interlayer surfaces of montmorillonite. Formation of Al-CIP complex on solid surface and then detachment of Al-CIP from the solid surface may contribute to the higher CIP desorption by Al3+ in comparison to Na+ and Ca2+.

AB In this paper the results of a thorough evaluation of the environmental fate and effects of azilsartan are presented. Azilsartan medoxomil is administered as a pro-drug for the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. The pro-drug is converted by hydrolysis to the active pharmaceutical ingredient azilsartan. Laboratory tests to evaluate the environmental fate and effects of azilsartan medoxomil were conducted with azilsartan and performed in accordance with OECD test guidelines. The predicted environmental concentration (PEG) in surface water was estimated at 0.32 mu g L-1 (above the action limit of 0.01 mu g L-1), triggering a Phase II assessment. Azilsartan is not readily biodegradable. Results of the water sediment study demonstrated significant shifting of azilsartan metabolites to sediment. Based on the equilibrium partitioning method, metabolites are unlikely to pose a risk to sediment-dwelling organisms. Ratios of the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) to the predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) did not exceed the relevant triggers, and the risk to aquatic, sewage treatment plant (SIP), groundwater and sediment compartments was concluded acceptable. A terrestrial assessment was not triggered. Azilsartan poses an acceptable risk to the environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal and transformation of clofibric acid (CA), which is a metabolite of clofibrate drugs, in aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was studied in this paper. By the analysis of CA concentration in the sewage and sludge phase, the biological removal mechanism was shown to be important, achieving 10%-12% of removal efficiency. However, the adsorption effect was relatively weak. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that CA mainly produced three biodegradation metabolites: a-hydroxyisobutyric acid, lactic acid and 4-chlorophenol. The a-hydroxyisobutyric acid was the major metabolite, and the second most important was lactic acid. The two substances accumulated for a period, and were then gradually utilised by microorganisms. These results indicated that CA can be transformed into other products during biological treatment although it is refractory. Moreover, the concentration of 4-chlorophenol was very low. Microbial community distribution was analysed by high-throughput sequencing. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. After addition of CA, the component of both Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dropped. For genus level analysis, a new Porphyromonadaceae emerged in the SBR with CA.

AB The concentrations of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were simulated in the Grand River watershed using the PhATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model. PPCPs that were previously measured in the Grand River watershed were selected as the target compounds for this study. The application of the PhATE model was adapted to account for Canadian climatic conditions and its seasonal variability. In this regard, seasonal hydrological parameters (i.e., stream flow and velocity) were estimated based on historical data. Chemical loss parameters, including in-stream decay, human loss, and removal efficiency of treatment plants, were initially extracted from the literature and then calibrated to the site data. In general, the adapted PhATE model reasonably simulated pharmaceuticals with continuous use by humans such as ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil. Validation, which was performed only for ibuprofen, naproxen, and carbamazepine suggests that the calibrated model is able to reliably simulate concentrations. The model is the most accurate in validation when simulating carbamazepine which is the most persistent substance tested in this study, and as such, variations in its concentration primarily follow variation in stream flow.

AB The current study describes the catalytic ozonation of clofibric acid (CFA) under ambient conditions using copper oxide catalysts synthesized by different methods. The objective of this study is to provide novel catalysts and reaction mechanism for the degradation of emerging pharmaceutical compounds in aqueous solution. Among the various Cu catalysts screened in this study, the Cut-Ali oxide catalyst showed an excellent activity and stability in the degradation and mineralization of CFA. In situ attenuated total reflection IR (ATR-IR) spectroscopy was used to examine the interaction of ozone with the active sites of the catalyst in presence of water and to investigate the possible catalytic mechanism. The presence of Lewis acid sites in the Cut-Ali catalyst increased the amount of chemisorbed water enhancing stronger interaction of ozone to form surface activated species, resulting in higher catalytic activity. The results obtained from in-situ ATR-IR study indicate that surface hydroxyl groups and Lewis acid sites are responsible for promoting the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OHS) from aqueous ozone.

AB In the present study, the bivalve Scrobicularia plana and the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana were exposed to an increasing carbamazepine (CBZ) concentration gradient. Both species are among the most widely used bioindicators, and CBZ is one of the most commonly found drugs in the aquatic environment. After a chronic exposure (28 days), the results obtained revealed that CBZ induced biochemical alterations in both species. Our findings demonstrated that S. plana and D. neapolitana reduced the CBZ accumulation rate at higher CBZ concentrations, probably due to their capacity to decrease their feeding rates at stressful conditions. Nevertheless, this defence mechanism was not enough to prevent both species from oxidative stress. In fact, S. plana and D. neapolitana were not able to efficiently activate their antioxidant defence mechanisms which resulted in the increase of lipid peroxidation, especially at the highest CBZ concentrations. Comparing both species, it seems that S. piano was the most sensitive species since stronger biochemical alterations were observed in this species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the global adsorption rate of tetracycline on adsorbents obtained from treatment sludge. Experimental data on tetracycline concentration decay curves were interpreted with kinetic models (first-order, second-order, Langmuir, and intraparticle diffusion) and diffusional models (pore volume diffusion model and surface diffusion model). The first-order kinetic model provided the best interpretation of tetracycline adsorption kinetics on all adsorbents, and its rate constant varied in a linear manner the macro- and mesopore volume of the adsorbents. It was also found that the tetracycline adsorption rate is controlled by intraparticle diffusion and that diffusion in the pore volume represents >80% of total intraparticle diffusion. This indicates that surface diffusion does not play a major role in tetracycline diffusion on the different adsorbents. Furthermore, the effective tetracycline diffusion coefficient in the pore volume gradually increased with greater meso- and macropore volume and larger surface area of the adsorbent, indicating that the tetracycline adsorption rate is directly related to the accessibility of this molecule to the microporous structure of the materials.

AB The photocatalytic decomposition of cortisone 21-acetate (CA), a model compound for the commonly used steroid, cortisone, was studied. CA was photocatalytically decomposed in a slurry reactor with the initial rates between 0.11 and 0.46 mg L-1 min(-1) at 10 mg L-1 concentration, using the following heterogeneous photocatalysts in decreasing order of their catalytic activity: ZnO> Evonik TiO2 P25 >Hombikat TiO2 > WO3. Due to the lack of ZnO stability in aqueous solutions, TiO2 P25 was chosen for further experiments. The decomposition reaction was found to be pseudo-first order and the rate constant decreased as a function of increasing initial CA concentration. Changing the initial pH of the CA solution did not affect the reaction rate significantly. The decomposition reaction in the presence of the oxidizing sacrificial agent sodium persulfate showed an observed decomposition rate constant of 0.004 min(-1), lower than that obtained for TiO2 P25 (0.040 min(-1)). The highest photocatalytic degradation rate constant was obtained combining both TiO2 P25 and S2O82- (0.071 min(-1)) showing a synergistic effect. No reactive intermediates were detected using LC-MS showing fast photocatalytic decomposition kinetics of CA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical drug, and its presence in a trace amount in waste water makes severe environmental pollution. The degradation of DCF was investigated by a photocatalytic process in presence of ultra violet irradiation at room temperature using titania and titania-zirconia nanocomposite catalysts in a batch reactor. The composite catalyst was prepared by sol-gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy as well as BET surface area analyzer. The effect of various process parameters such as catalyst loading, initial concentration of DCF and pH of the experimental solution was observed on the degradation of DCF. The titania-zirconia nanocomposites exhibited reasonably higher photocatalytic activity than that of anatase form of titania without zirconia. The maximum removal of DCF of about 92.41 % was achieved using Zr/Ti mass ratio of 11.8 wt% composite catalyst. A rate equation was proposed for the degradation of DCF using the composite catalyst. The values of rate constant (k (c)) and adsorption equilibrium constant (K (1)) were found to vary with the catalyst content in the reaction mixture.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a simple extraction procedure and a multiresidual liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from various soil types. An extraction procedure for 91 pharmaceuticals from 13 soil types, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, was optimized. The extraction efficiencies of three solvent mixtures for ultrasonic extraction were evaluated for 91 pharmaceuticals. The best results were obtained using acetonitrile/water (1/1 v/v with 0.1 % formic acid) followed by acetonitrile/2-propanol/water (3/3/4 v/v/v with 0.1 % formic acid) for extracting 63 pharmaceuticals. The method was validated at three fortification levels (10, 100, and 1000 ng/g) in all types of representative soils; recovery of 44 pharmaceuticals ranged between 55 and 135 % across all tested soils. The method was applied to analyze actual environmental samples of sediments, soils, and sludge, and 24 pharmaceuticals were found above limit of quantification with concentrations ranging between 0.83 ng/g (fexofenadine) and 223 ng/g (citalopram).

AB Amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic to combat bacterial infections. However, this drug can cause serious problems when discarded in waterways due to its great bioaccumulation potential. This compound can be treated via advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are capable of converting amoxicillin into carbon dioxide and water. In this context, the use of ozone as an oxidizer has excelled in amoxicillin degradation. This paper aims at treating a synthetic solution of amoxicillin (0.1 g L-1) in a reactor with ozone bubbling. A Design of Experiment (DoE) with a response surface known as Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the treatment process. In addition, a Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method was used in the construction of a Pareto boundary chart. Results after 1-h treatment showed a reduction of 53% of the initial organic matter from a designed model using factors, such as pH, ozone generator power, and O-3 flow. A model was built from the CCD with score of 0.9929. Thus, the model was able to represent the real scenario with confidence.

AB Amoxicillin (AMO) degradation was investigated using electrolysis, ozonation, and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process. The E-peroxone process was found to be the most effective for AMO degradation. 67.8% total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization was obtained after 60 min by the E-peroxone process. In comparison, only 47.3% and 3.1% TOC mineralization were obtained using individual ozonation and electrolysis processes, respectively. It was found that hydroxyl radical production and O-3 utilization were both enhanced in the E-peroxone process. The effect of pH on the E-peroxone process was investigated, and the highest AMO removal rate was obtained at pH = 9, indicating pH control was crucial in the E-peroxone process. In addition, more oxidation typical intermediates were identified in the E-peroxone process than the ozonation process using UPLC-MS/MS. Different pathways of AMO degradation were proposed, involving the hydroxylation of the benzoic ring and N, the four-membered beta-lactamic ring opening, the oxidation of S, and other bond cleavage reactions. All these results above indicated that the introduction of electrolysis in ozonation has enhanced AMO cleavage and hence its degradation.

AB Gammarus spp. and Fucus vesiculosus from the Baltic Sea littoral community were exposed to 3 concentrations of the pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and propranolol. Both physiological and behavioural parameters were measured to examine potential effects in the organisms. For Gammarus spp., respiration, feeding rate and activity with and without predator cues were measured, and gross production to respiration ratio (GP/R) and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured for F. vesiculosus. The results showed that propranolol decreased the activity related to movement, and Gammarus spp. could not compensate for the reduced movement when subjected to predator cues. The feeding rates of Gammarus spp. exposed to propranolol were more than 2 times higher at all concentrations compared to the control. Ibuprofen did not significantly affect any of the measured parameters of Gammarus spp. The GP/R was lower in algae exposed to propranolol. The effects of propranolol on both behaviour and physiology of Gammarus spp., in combination with the stress responses in the algae, might cause unexpected indirect and cascade effects which eventually could have implications at both community and ecosystem scales.

AB Sewage effluents contain pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals, exposing aquatic organisms to complex mixtures. The consequences of exposure to combinations of different classes of drugs in fish are largely unknown. In this study, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males and females for two weeks to low, environmentally relevant concentrations of the endocrine disrupting chemical 17 alpha-etinylestradiol (EE2) and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, alone and in combination, and analyzed behaviors of importance for population fitness, scototaxis (light/dark preference), the novel tank test and shoal cohesion. Control water contained 0.4 ng/L EE2 and the measured exposure concentrations were 0.9 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.1) and 1 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.5). The measured concentrations of citalopram were 0.1 (nominal 0.1) and 0.4 mu g/L (nominal 0.5). Both EE2 exposures increased anxiety in males in the scototaxis test, with significantly longer latency periods before entering and fewer visits to the white zone of the tank. The combined exposures (0.9 ng/L EE2 + 0.1 mu g/L citalopram and 1 ng/L EE2 + 0.4 mu g/L citalopram) resulted in abolishment of effects of EE2, with shorter latency period and more transitions to white than for fish exposed to EE2 alone. In the novel tank test, the results surprisingly indicated lower anxiety after both EE2 and citalopram exposure. Significantly more transitions to the upper half of the tank observed in males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram alone compared to control males. Males exposed to EE2 (0.9 ng/L) had shorter latency period to the upper half. Combination exposure resulted in a longer latency and fewer transitions to the upper half compared to both control, EE2- and citalopram-exposed males. Males exposed to the combination spent significantly less time in the upper half than males EE2 or citalopram-exposed males. Females exposed to 1 ng/L EE2 had fewer transitions to the upper half than the control group and females exposed to 0.4 mu g/L citalopram. In the shoaling test, males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram + 0.9 ng/L EE2 showed more transitions away from peers than males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram alone. In conclusion, low concentrations of EE2, closely above the predicted no effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.1 ng/L, created anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish males. Citalopram showed marginal effects at these low concentrations but in the combination exposure the behavioral effects of EE2 were abolished. This is an initial effort to understand the effects of cocktails of anthropogenic substances contaminating aquatic environments.

AB Recently, the increased use of monocyclic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has resulted in their presence in the environment. This may have potential negative effects on living organisms. The biotransformation mechanisms of monocyclic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the human body and in other mammals occur by hydroxylation and conjugation with glycine or glucuronic acid. Biotransformation/biodegradation of monocyclic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the environment may be caused by fungal or bacterial microorganisms. Salicylic acid derivatives are degraded by catechol or gentisate as intermediates which are cleaved by dioxygenases. The key intermediate of the paracetamol degradation pathways is hydroquinone. Sometimes, after hydrolysis of this drug, 4-aminophenol is formed, which is a dead-end metabolite. Ibuprofen is metabolized by hydroxylation or activation with CoA, resulting in the formation of isobutylocatechol. The aim of this work is to attempt to summarize the knowledge about environmental risk connected with the presence of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, their sources and the biotransformation and/or biodegradation pathways of these drugs.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals in surface waters under solar irradiation was investigated. Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals caused by sun irradiation may be of major significance in the natural elimination process. Based on a data compilation from the literature, the lipid lowering agent metabolite clofibric acid, the iodinated X-ray contrast media iomeprol, which contribute to the adsorbable organic halogen compounds, and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were selected. The irradiation experiments were carried out in batch experiments with simulated UV-sunlight. The photodegradation of the pharmaceuticals showed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The objective of this investigation was to demonstrate that the extent of photoinduced degradation of pharmaceuticals can vary significantly for the different pharmaceuticals and it strongly depends on the water constituents present in solution. The influences of different initial pharmaceutical concentrations, the presence of other pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine or clofibric acid and the presence of natural organic matter on the photochemical degradation rate of pharmaceuticals in aqueous solutions were investigated. Analyses of the pharmaceuticals and their photodegradation products were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array and fluorescence detection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB BiOCl microspheres with exposed {001} facets have been synthesized through a simple solvothermal method. The adsorption and photocatalytic activities of BiOCl microspheres were evaluated by removal of ibuprofen (IBP) as the model reaction. Parameters including IBP concentration, BiOCl dosage, and inorganic ions were investigated to reveal the role of adsorption in BiOCl-based photocatalysis. We found that the high IBP removal rate by BiOCl is not due to photocatalytic oxidation but to surface adsorption. The combination of ICP/MS, IC, XPS, and FT-IR results directly proved that anion exchange between dissociated IBP and Cl accompanied by the formation of surface complex (O-Bi-OOC-C12H17) onto the BiOCl surface is the main adsorption mechanism. In addition, we also demonstrated that organic compounds with carboxyl group (-COOH) such as diclofenac, benzoic acid, and p-phthalic acid can be adsorbed by BiOCl while organic compounds without carboxyl group such as carbamazepine, nitrobenzene, and p-chloronitrobenzene cannot be adsorbed. We believe that the BiOCl adsorption behavior and mechanism should be considered when discussing its photocatalytic mechanism.

AB Increased consumption of pharmaceutical compounds compounded by their persistence in biological treatment processes and potential toxicity is becoming a serious concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the fate of an antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), in anaerobic digestion process and its impact on methanogenic metabolism. Biochemical methane potential of CBZ with or without glucose was studied for 40 days in designed batch experiments. About 67.98% and 66.37% of spiked CBZ (about 100 mu g1(-1)) were removed during this period from glucose amended or unamended sets, respectively. Loss of CBZ through adsorption onto suspended particles, as in sterilized seed sludge control (16.98%), was significantly lower in comparison to its biotic counterparts (P=0.002 and P=0.003). Analysis of methane or biogas production revealed no inhibitory effect of CBZ toward methanogenic process at its tested concentration. Differences in cumulative methane yields between glucose containing sets with or without CBZ were insignificant (P=0.885). This study suggests that any residual CBZ concentration lower than the present study, if detected in waste-water, might not significantly affect the methanogenic process.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are neurologically active drugs that can contaminate surface waters and have the potential to negatively affect aquatic organisms. In this investigation, the 48-h acute toxicity of mixtures (binary and quaternary) of four common SSRIs (fluoxetine [Prozac((R))], sertraline [Zoloft((R))], paroxetine [Paxil((R))], and citalopram [Celexa((R))]) were determined in the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia. Logistic regression was used to model mortality data and to investigate the applicability of concentration addition and independent action models to explain observed mortality. The concentrations estimated to induce 50% mortality in 48 h for the individual SSRIs sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and citalopram were 0.48 to 0.66, 1.23 to 1.84, 2.23 to 3.57, and 10.47 to 14.53 mu M, respectively. Concentration addition was a better predictor of mixture effects than independent action and suggested that the tested SSRIs have a similar mechanism of action. Results indicate that environmental hazard assessments should be conservative and consider that acutely toxic effects in aquatic organisms can be additive for each SSRIs in a mixture.

AB The level of fecal pollution in 17 sites in Puerto Rico was determined by Escherichia coli (E. coli) enumeration using an enzyme substrate medium and Quanti-Tray (R)/2000. Human fecal pollution was identified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of carbamazepine (CBZ) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of the human Bacteroides marker, HF183. Carbamazepine was detected in 16 out of 17 sites, including Condado Lagoon, a popular recreational area. Elevated E. coli levels (>410 CFU 100 mL(-1)) were detected in 13 sites. Average CBZ concentrations ranged from 0.005 mu g L-1 to 0.482 mu g L-1 and 7 sites were positive for HF183. Higher CBZ concentrations were associated with the detection of HF183 (Mann-Whitney test; U = 42.0; df = 7; 1-tailed P value = 0.013). This was the second study to determine surface water concentrations of CBZ in the Caribbean and the first in Puerto Rico. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behaviour and effects of atorvastatin (ATO), carbamazepine (CBZ), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated in spiked lake sediments, at concentrations up to 56.5 mg kg(-1) dry weight (dw), with the benthic invertebrates Chironomus dilutus and Hyalella azteca. Desorption constants were calculated in the presence and absence of animals, using linear isotherms, yielding K-d values of 28.2, 189.0 and 125.1 L kg(-1) (ATO), 73.7, 201.7 and 263.2 L kg(-1) (CBZ), and 114.9, 114.2 and 519.2 L kg(-1) (EE2) for C. dilutus, H. azteca, and without animals, respectively. For ATO and CBZ, K-d values were smaller in the presence of C dilutus, indicating greater desorption to the overlying water from bioturbation, which is consistent with the predominantly benthic occurrence of C. dilutus compared to H. azteca. In contrast, due to its greater hydrophobicity, bioturbation did not significantly affect desorption of EE2. No significant toxicity was observed, indicating decreased bioavailability of the chemicals sorbed to sediments compared with water-only toxicity assays. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The toxicity of fourteen widely used human pharmaceuticals was determined using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Stage 9 Xenopus blastulae were exposed for 96 h to single concentrations of commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), statin blood lipid regulators, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, a stimulant, and an anti-epileptic. Toxicity, teratogenicity, minimum concentration to inhibit growth, and types and severity of associated malformations were determined. EC(10)s ranged from 3.0 mg/l to > 100 mg/l and LC(10)s ranged from 3.6 mg/l to > 100 mg/l. Toxicity varied between and within compound class of pharmaceutical. The fluoroquinolones, stimulants, anti-epileptics, and antibiotics tested were determined to be nontoxic and non-teratogenic at singular, water-soluble concentrations. The hazard quotients (HQ) for the pharmaceuticals ranged from 6.10 x 10(-7) to 1.6 x 10-4, all of which are orders of magnitude below EPA's levels for concern for harm to aquatic animals. Thus, based on the data from the present study, concentrations of individual pharmaceuticals currently detected in surface water are far below concentrations of effective and lethal concentrations.

TI Degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane from wash water of ion-exchange resin

AB Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), widely used in industry as solvents and chemical intermediates in the production of synthetic resins, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, are highly toxic to the environment and public health. Various studies reported that Fenton's oxidation could degrade a variety of chlorinated VOCs in aqueous solutions. In acidic conditions, ferrous ion catalyzes the decomposition of H(2)O(2) to form a powerful (aEuro cent)OH radical. In this study, wastewater from wash of ion-exchange resin containing typical CVOC, 1,2-dichloroethane, was treated using Fenton's oxidation. To reduce environmental load and processing costs of wastewater, Fenton process as a simple and efficient treatment method was applied to degrade 1,2-dichloroethane of wash water.
   The water samples were collected from three different washing stages of ion-exchange resin. The degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane and total organic carbon (TOC) of wash water of ion-exchange resin by Fenton process was studied with response surface method (RSM). Design of the experiments was conducted by central composite face, and factors included in three models were Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses and treatment time. Relevant quadratic and interaction terms of factors were investigated.
   According to ANOVA, the model predicts well 1,2-dichloroethane reduction of all water samples and TOC reduction of samples 2 and 3. The Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses used in the present study were most suitable when 1,2-dichloroethane concentration of the wash water is about 120 mg L(-1). In that case, Fenton's oxidation reduced 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC up to 100% and 87%, respectively, according to the RSM model. With 90-min reaction time and H(2)O(2) dose of 1,200 mg L(-1), the required Fe(2+) doses for 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC were 300 and 900 mg L(-1), respectively. The optimal H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) stoichiometric molar ratio was between 4-6. Then, concentration of Fe(2+) was low enough and the amount of residual sludge can thus be reduced. It seems that most of TOC and part of 1,2-dichloroethane were removed by coagulation.
   Up to a certain extent, increase of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses improved the removal of 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC. High Fe(2+) doses increased the formation of ferric-based sludge, and excessive H(2)O(2) doses in sample 2 decreased the degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane. Excess amount of hydrogen peroxide may scavenge hydroxyl radicals, thus leading to loss of oxidative power. Also, the residual hydrogen peroxide of different samples increased with increasing H(2)O(2) dose and H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) molar ratio and decreasing treatment time probably also due to scavenging reactions. Due to the saturated nature of 1,2-dichloroethane, the oxidation mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction before addition of hydroxyl radical, thus leading to lower rate constants than for direct hydroxyl radical attack, which for one increases the treatment time.
   Complete removal of 1,2-dichloroethane was attained with initial concentration < 120 mg L(-1). Also, TOC degraded effectively. Wash water with higher concentration of 1,2-dichloroethane requires longer treatment times and higher concentrations of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) for sufficient 1,2-dichloroethane removal.
   Due to the results achieved in this study, Fenton's oxidation could be recommended to be used for organic destruction of wash water of ion-exchange resin. Residual sludge, the main disadvantage in Fenton process, can be reduced by optimizing the ferrous dose or by using heterogeneous treatment where most of the reusable iron remains in the solid phase.

AB Ozone, UV/ozone, ozone/persulfate (PS) and UV/ozone/PS systems were used to mineralize sulfonamides. Sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamerazine (SMR) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) were the target compounds. The novel contribution of this study is its determination of the effects of PS addition, sulfonamide structure, pH and salinity on sulfonamide mineralization in ozone-based systems. The mineralization rate of sulfonamides satisfied pseudo-first-order kinetics. The SMZ mineralization rate constant in ozone, UV/ozone, ozone/PS and UV/ozone/PS systems at pH 5 were 0.0058; 0.0101; 0.0069 and 0.0802 min(-1), respectively, and those at pH 7 were 0.0075; 0.0116; 0.0083 and 0.0873 min(-1), respectively. The increase in the number of methyl-substituents in the heterocyclic group of SMZ and the corresponding increase in the steric hindrance of radical addition, reduced mineralization rates below those of SMR and SDZ. The addition of PS promoted sulfonamide mineralization in the ozone-based systems; conversely, salinity inhibited sulfonamide mineralization.

ID SPIRODELA-POLYRHIZA
AB The duckweeds have fascinated many generations of biologists since 1960s because of their simplicity of body structure and extremely fast vegetative reproduction. Since the beginning of the era of plant molecular biology, duckweeds have emerged as model plants with important findings in basic research as well as plant-based applications. Recent advances in the omic-tools and techniques have rejuvenated research on duckweeds, resulting in a fast accumulation of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic resources to the field. This recent progress enables us to use duckweeds to address biological questions related to stress physiology, phytotoxicity, adaptive strategies of aquatic plants and the molecular interactions between aquatic microorganisms and plants. Throughout the past decades, unimaginably wide-range applications of duckweeds like wastewater purification, use of protein-rich biomass for animal feed and human nutrition, use of starch-rich biomass as source of renewable energy and as factories for producing plant-derived pharmaceuticals, to name a few, have been in development, or laboratory scale. We look forward to a deeper understanding of these wonderful plants and many new functional technologies on the horizon.

AB Nowadays, since the core-shell gold-magnetite nanoparticles include the saturation magnetisation (iron oxide) and plasmon surface (gold shell) properties, they have been considered in biological and biomedicine research areas. In the present work, multifunctional glutathione decorated gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (GSH-AuMNPs) were successfully synthesised and fully characterised. From the absorption peak at 525, the formation of the core-shell GSH-AuMNPs was confirmed. Although the saturation magnetisation value was slightly decreased during the formation process, they were easily recovered through magnetic decantation. The biocompatibility of the synthesised NPs was approved by the cytotoxicity researches. Furthermore, the GSH-AuMNPs indicated a good catalytic activity for the catalytic reduction of 2-nitrophenol by sodium borohydride and reused for six consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in its activity. Overall, this study introduced a unique structure with high catalytic activity, which could provide a useful platform for the biomedical, analytical, catalytic applications and wastewater treatment.

AB In the last years, increasing attention has been paid on the presence of antibiotics in aqueous environments due to their ecological damage and potential adverse effects on organisms. Membrane biofilm reactors (MBfR) have been gained a significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology in removing of organic micro-pollutants. In this study, the performance of H-2-MBfR for simultaneous removal of nitrate and chlortetracycline, formation of transformation products and community analysis of the biofilm grown on the gas permeable hollow fiber membranes was evaluated by considering effect of the hydraulic retention time, surface loadings of target pollutants and H-2 pressure. The results showed that the simultaneous chlortetracycline (96%) and nitrate removal (99%) took placed successfully under the conditions of 5 h HRT and 2 psi H-2 pressure. It has been determined that the main elimination process was biodegradation and Betaproteobacteria species was responsible for chlortetracycline degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Numerous efforts have been made to remove emerging trace organic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). This study examined the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) by Trametes versicolor laccase and its laccase-mediator systems. Experimental results showed that DEET was poorly removed by laccase alone. The poor removal efficiency of DEET by laccase may be attributed to the presence of strong withdrawing electron group (-CO-N [CH2-CH3](2)) in the chemical structure of DEET. Experimental results also indicated that DEET might be indirectly oxidized by laccase-mediator systems. More than 50% initial DEET amount was removed by laccase in the presence of a redox mediator, such as 2,2'-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid] (ABTS) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). However, laccase activity was considerably decreased in the presence of a redox mediator (ABTS or HBT). Further studies on identification of degradation byproducts and degradation pathways are recommended. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional treatment processes have presented low efficiency in removing antibiotics from water and effluents, wherefore the development of processes and technologies to comply with this matter is highly important. Membrane separation processes may be applied in the obtainment of high-quality reuse water, fully or partly removing the pharmaceuticals. Thus, this paper aims to assess the performance of two nanofiltration membranes in removing norfloxacin from a synthetic effluent simulating a pharmaceutical wastewater. Different solution concentrations, transmembrane pressures and pH were evaluated. Both membranes presented high selectivity to norfloxacin, such that the rejection of this antibiotic remained between 87 and 99.5%. The pH had an effect on membranes selectivity and permeability. The highest norfloxacin rejection and the lowest permeability were reached at pH 6.5, which may be related to electrostatic interactions between membrane surface and norfloxacin ionic species. Considering the elevated rejections obtained in this study (87-99.5%), the viability of nanofiltration stands out in removing norfloxacin from effluents.

AB Three broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin (AMX), florfenicol (FF) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), that inhibit bacteria via different target sites, were selected to evaluate the acute toxicity and long-term effects on anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) granules. The specific anammox activity (SAA) levels reduced by approximately half within the first 3 days in the presence of antibiotics but no nitrite accumulation was observed in continuous-flow experiments. However, the SAA levels and heme c content gradually recovered as the antibiotic concentrations increased. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) analysis suggested that anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria gradually developed a better survival strategy during long-term acclimatization, which reduced the antibiotic stress via increased EPS secretion that provided a protective 'cocoon.' In terms of nitrogen removal efficiency, anammox granules could resist 60 mg-AMX L-1, 10 mg-FF L-1 and 100 mg-SMZ L-1. This study supported the feasibility of using anammox granules to treat antibiotic-containing wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental awareness in both the public and regulatory sectors has necessitated proper treatment of medicinal components-rich pharmaceutical effluents. Even the presence of trace antiseptic may cause adverse health effects including development of "product resistant microbes" in the aquatic environment. The present study involves photomineralization of chlorhexidine, which belongs to the class of antiseptic drug components. This study details investigations on photocatalytic degradation of chlorhexidine in a slurry batch reactor using titanium dioxide photocatalyst. Emphases were given to study the effects of operating parameters on the degradation behavior of the targeted compound and characterization of degraded products. About 68.14% removal of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD) was found after 1 h at 25 degrees C with a substrate-to-catalyst ratio of 2.5:1 under UV intensity of 50 mu W.cm(-2) at pH 10.5. Though the product profile illustrates several degraded products, toxicological analysis on Bacillus subtilis exhibited no inhibition zone, suggesting the eco-friendly nature of the degraded products.

AB Integrating thermochemical conversion (TCC) technologies with current animal waste treatment practices can treat and reduce quantities of manure from consolidated animal feeding operations. Additionally, TCC technologies can produce value-added, renewable energy products. These products can meet heating and power needs or be catalytically converted into liquid fuels. The primary objectives of this study were to assess opportunities and obstacles in the treatment and energy conversion using currently available TCC processes. Both dry and wet livestock manures were assessed. Dry wastes like poultry litter and feedlot manures can be processed directly via pyrolysis and air/steam gasification technology. The solids in the aqueous waste streams from dairy and swine operations can undergo wet gasification or direct liquefaction processes. Alternatively, these solids can be separated and dried before conversion. Due to high ash and sulfur contents, pretreatment of manure is necessary to prevent catalyst poisoning and promote effective unit operation. While the energy input requirements for a conceptual wet gasification manure treatment system of a model swine farm is larger than a traditional anaerobic digestion operation, there are many significant advantages in implementing TCC technology including the following: compact design; faster treatment times; reduction of odors, BOD, and pharmaceutically activated compounds; and elimination of sludge.

AB Antibiotic-like organic pollutants are harmful for aquatic ecosystems and seriously disrupt the ecological balance. Herein, we design a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene oxide aerogel anchored with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (3D CoFe2O4/N-rGA) via simple hydrothermal method, which can be used for peroxomonosulfate (PMS) activation toward rapidly and highly efficient degradation of tetracycline (TC). Nitrogen doped into the graphene cellular network can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of the anchored CoFe2O4 by weakening the O-O band, creating new active sites and acting as an excellent electron bridge through synergistic effects. The degradation efficiency of TC is detected to be as high as 85% only within 10 s and the degradation rate can remain above 90% after five cycles under the presence of 3D CoFe2O4/N-rGA and PMS. The catalyst also has a high efficiency for various antibiotic and pharmaceutical wastewater containing multiple antibiotics degradation.

AB Erythromycin is an antibiotic considered as a recalcitrant pollutant because it is currently found in treated wastewaters. In addition, traces of antibiotics are a threatening ecological issue as these compounds are biologically active even at very low concentrations (ng L-1). In this work, we studied enzymatic degradation of this antibiotic in model aqueous solutions containing 20 mg L-1 erythromycin. We used as the biocatalyst an EreB esterase obtained from a genetically modified Escherichia coli W3110 strain carrying the EreB overexpression plasmid. Experiments were carried out with different reactor and biocatalyst configurations (free and immobilized by covalent grafting or adsorption). Free enzymes showed very high activity leading to erythromycin depletion. Experiments with the biocatalyst immobilized by adsorption using an enzymatic membrane reactor showed that even if EreB initially lost part of its activity, it was stabilized and able to continuously degrade erythromycin at a rate of 15.8 mg h(-1) for 100 h.

AB Amoxicillin, used to manage bacterial infection, is among the top five popular pharmaceuticals in the United States, based on the number of prescriptions. Problems with environmentally available drugs can arise chiefly; biological resistance in excess amounts becomes available in wastewater samples. Previously, we observed that Amoxicillin could be removed quantitatively from deionized water by passage over Octolig (R), a polythylenediimine covalently attached to high-surface-area silica gel. This study was concerned with testing the potential removal of Amoxicillin in different solutions (tap water, well water, river water, and the weakly saline water). These solutions were passed over chromatography columns at a rate of 10mL per minute; 50-mL fractions were collected and analyzed for total dissolved solids and pH as well as concentration. As noted in our previous work, the percentage removal was related to the length of the column, and this aspect was evaluated again. Consistent results were obtained for DI water, tap water, well water, and river water, indicating quantitative removal, and but not artificial bay water, presumably because of ion competition.

AB The usefulness of ultraviolet-C (UVC: 254nm) and vacuum UV (VUV: 185+ 254nm) photolysis for elimination and mineralization of four selected pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in mixed aqueous solution were tested in laboratory batch experiments. UVC photolysis was unable to eliminate moderate and refractory PhCs. Moreover, it was not at all useful for mineralization of the PhCs (<10% TOC removal, 30min reaction) and longer reaction period (i.e. 60min) had no significant positive impact on the mineralization efficiency. On the other hand, VUV photolysis eliminated the PhCs almost completely in a short reaction period irrespective of their nature, and 90% mineralization was achieved in an hour. The greatly enhanced elimination and mineralization efficiencies for VUV photolysis were attributed to accelerated direct and indirect photolysis reactions. Based on the results, it was concluded that VUV photolysis was very promising over UVC photolysis for mineralization of PhCs in mixed aqueous solution. However, more studies are necessary for practical applicability of the method in wastewater treatments.

AB The present paper presents the occurrence of 72 pharmaceuticals and 23 transformation products (TPs) in groundwaters (GWs) underlying the city of Barcelona, Spain. Thirty-one samples were collected under different districts, and at different depths. Aquifers with different geologic features and source of recharge were included, i.e., natural bank filtration, infiltration from wastewater and water supply pipes, rainfall recharge, etc. Antibiotics were the most frequently found compounds detected at levels reaching 1000 ng L-1. Natural bank filtration from the river that receives large amounts of effluents from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), turned out being the most influencing source of contamination, thus GW showed high range of compounds and concentrations as high as or even higher than in the river itself. In general, TPs were found at lower concentrations than the corresponding parent compounds, with some exceptions, such as 4OH propranolol and enalaprilat. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aquifer of the Tula Valley in Mexico is recharged by the infiltration of wastewater used for agricultural irrigation. This aquifer is considered to be a possible source of water for Mexico City, and although, in general, the water is good quality it still contains hardness and specific emerging pollutants. This research aims to identify a suitable treatment process based on membrane nanofiltration as it is a proven technology. Four nanofiltration membranes were compared using the critical flux concept in order to select the two that produced the largest amount of permeate. Membrane fouling was assessed by investigating the deposition of calcium using SEM images. To control hardness scaling, pretreatment with 150% of lime was employed. Finally, one membrane was selected based on its capability to remove carbamazepine, bisphenol A, triclosan, butilbenzylphthalate, and 4-nonylphenol. The selected membrane was operated at 800 kPa, producing 87.30 l m(-2) h(-1).

AB In this work, zebrafish embryo bioassays were performed to assess the efficiency of microalgae in the removal of acetaminophen from water. Chlorella sorokiniana (CS), Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) were the strains used for water treatment. Toxic effects on zebrafish embryo caused by effluents from microalgae treatment were compared with those observed under exposure to experimental solutions with known concentrations of acetaminophen. The three microalgae strains allowed for the reduction of acetaminophen concentration and its toxic effects, but CS was the most efficient one. At the end of the batch culture, a 67% removal was provided by CS with a reduction of 62% in the total abnormalities on the exposed zebrafish embryo. On the other hand, toxic effects observed under exposure to effluents treated by microalgae were alike to those determined for acetaminophen experimental solutions with equivalent concentration. Thus, it may be inferred that microalgae biodegradation of acetaminophen did not involve an increased toxicity for zebrafish embryo.

AB Three different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were applied to investigate the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) i.e. sulfamethoxazole (SMX), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) in synthetically prepared aqueous solutions. The degradation of these substances was carried out by ozonation, sonolysis and photocatalytic oxidation, as well as by different combinations of these processes. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the removal efficiency of each method and to assess the performance variation of sonolysis in combination with other AOPs. The best performances were achieved by sonocatalysis, which resulted in the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals in the range between 37% and 47%. Under similar experimental conditions, the removal of the selected ECs by single compounds by ozonation was slightly lower than the removal of respective compounds in the mixture. Moreover, pseudo first-order removal rate constants of photocatalytic mineralization were determined as 9.33x10(-2), 4.90x10(-3), 1.06x10(-2) min(-1) for SMX, DCF and CBZ, respectively.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) are one class of the most widely used antibiotics around the world and have been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water in recent years. Their transformation in waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and in water treatment plants (WTP), as well as, their fate and transport in the aquatic environment are of concern.
   The reaction of six sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine) with free chlorine was investigated at a laboratory scale in order to identify the main chlorination by-products. A previously validated method, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, was used to analyse SAs and their chlorination by-products. At room temperature, pH 6-7, reaction times of up to 2 h and an initial concentration of 2 mg/L of free chlorine, the majority of SAs suffered degradation of around 65%, with the exception of sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole (20%). The main reaction of SAs with free chlorine occurred in the first minute. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phytoremediation of selected pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen) using Armoracia rusticana and Linum usitatissimum cell cultures and by hydroponically cultivated Lupinus albus, Hordeum vulgaris, and Phragmites australis plants in laboratory conditions is described. During in vitro experiments, the best results for acetaminophen were achieved using Armoracia rusticana hairy root cultures, where 100% of the starting amount was removed from the media during eight days. Total removal of ibuprofen and diclofenac was achieved using a Linum usitatissimum suspension culture after one and six days, respectively. In the hydroponic arrangement, the best results were achieved for Lupinus, where acetaminophen was totally removed from media during two or four days in concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 mM, respectively. The best effectiveness of ibuprofen removal (50% of starting amount) was found in case of Phragmites. Effectiveness of all tested plants for diclofenac removal was low. The best removal was achieved using Phragmites in the case of 0.2 mM concentration67% of the starting amount and Hordeum for 0.1 mM starting concentration, 56%.

AB Sub and supercritical water oxidation (Sub- CWO & SCWO) technology has gained attention over the past few years due to near complete conversions at shorter residences times. A pharmaceutical sample containing variety of analgesics, antibiotics, antipyretics, antifungal, beta-blockers and drug intermediates contributing to overall total organic carbon (TOC) of 2017 +/- 49 mg/L was collected from a nearby pharmaceutical industry for this research. The sample was subjected to sub and supercritical water oxidation both in batch and continuous processes. A maximum removal efficiency of 80.1% was achieved with excess oxidant (oxidation coefficient (OC 3)) at 400 degrees C for 60 min residence time in batch reactor. The pharmaceutical sample was also processed in continuous supercritical water reactor by varying both temperature (400-550 degrees C) and oxidant coefficient (0-2) at 23 MPa for 60 s residence time. With the operating temperature of 550 degrees C and OC 2 resulted in maximum removal of the pharmaceutics with efficiency of 97.8%.

AB This study investigates removal of total nitrogen (TN) in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) supported with high-density polyethylene for biofilm formation and ibuprofen (IBU) as a carbon source. At first, the microorganisms have been acclimated for 45 days. In the optimum condition, TN removal of more than 80% was reached. Optimization results of simultaneous removal of IBU and TN showed that the obtained removal efficiencies for IBU and TN are close together and the correlation coefficients have high values. The obtained results show that MBBR bioreactor could remove 72.03 % IBU and 81.1 % TN at 145.15 h and TN concentration of 156.37 mg/L. Biodegradation constant (k(biol)) values were varying from 0.4 to 0.009 L/g biomass.d, which represents that IBU is a hard biodegradable or persistent substance. This study demonstrated that the proposed MBBR is highly effective for the simultaneous removal of IBU and TN in wastewater.

AB The performance of clofibric acid (CA) degradation in Milli-Qwater and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent by solar/TiO2 and solar/ZnO was investigated in summer and winter seasons. The effects of NO3- and HCO3- anions, humic acid (HA), and H2O2 on CA photocatalysis were evaluated. Significant difference in CA degradation in two seasons was observed. Both NO3- and HCO3- anions adversely affected CA degradation, particularly at high HCO3- concentration. CA degradation slightly increased with 0.5 mg L-1 HA in solar/TiO2 in summer, but was significantly inhibited in winter at 20 mg L-1 HA. However, the inhibitive effect of 20 mg L-1 HA on CA removal in solar/ZnO had no remarkable difference in two seasons. The degradation in solar/TiO2/H2O2 was similar to that in solar/TiO2, but was inhibited obviously in solar/ZnO/H2O2. When applying photocatalytic process into WWTP effluent, degradation rates were apparently lower compared to Milli-Qwater and temperature caused a great adverse effect on CA elimination.

The chromatographic separation was developed on spiked wellspring water samples and checked on model wastewater samples of veterinary pharmaceuticals before and after RO/NF membrane treatment (feed and permeate streams) and on process wastewaters of industrial origin. Chromatographic separation was performed on Varian ProStar HPLC/DAD with C-18 column (Microsorb-MV 100 C18, 150 x 4.6 mm; 5 mu m, Varian, USA). Detection and quantification was performed at 254 nm. The best separation was achieved with mobile phase 0.5% formic acid and 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 0.05 M ammonium acetate-methanol, 70 + 30, (v/v) after extraction procedure on polystyrenedivinylbenzene Varian Empore extraction disks. The extraction efficiency was checked by recovery experiments.

AB Water and wastewater treatment plants were not developed to remove pharmaceuticals from effluents. Consequently, pharmaceutical residues are being detected in many ecosystems worldwide. Pharmaceutical pollution is a diffuse issue that has the potential to unbalance ecosystems. It is a complex environmental problem that involves all sectors of society. In this article, we present: (1) an evaluation of the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) considering pharmaceutical pollution as a case study; (2) a narrative review regarding legislation of pharmaceutical disposal of several countries; and, finally, (3) reflections concerning alternatives for better management aiming to reduce pharmaceutical pollution. Regarding these three main aims, we found that: (1) pharmaceutical pollution is still a problem, so we are going against SDGs from this point of view (2) the lack of drug disposal regulation in some countries may have a global impact and harm many ecosystems worldwide; (3) the solutions indicated here would integrate the management and help to reduce drug pollution, consequently, moving towards SGDs.

AB De facto reuse is the percentage of drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intake potentially composed of effluent discharged from upstream wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Results from grab samples and a De Facto Reuse in our Nation's Consumable Supply (DRINCS) geospatial watershed model were used to quantify contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) concentrations at DWTP intakes to qualitatively compare exposure risks obtained by the two approaches. Between nine and 71 CECs were detected in grab samples. The number of upstream WWTP discharges ranged from 0 to >1,000; comparative de facto reuse results from DRINCS ranged from <0.1 to 13% during average flow and >80% during lower streamflows. Correlation between chemicals detected and DRINCS modeling results were observed, particularly DWTPs withdrawing from midsize water bodies. This comparison advances the utility of DRINCS to identify locations of DWTPs for future CEC sampling and treatment technology testing.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent that is discharged to soils with land-applied wastewater biosolids, is persistent under anaerobic conditions, and yet its impact on anaerobic microbial communities in soils is largely unknown. We hypothesized that triclosan enriches for Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi because these bacteria respire organochlorides and are likely less sensitive, relative to other bacteria, to the antimicrobial effects of triclosan. Triplicate anaerobic soil microcosms were seeded with agricultural soil, which was not previously exposed to triclosan, and were amended with 1mgkg-1 of triclosan. Triplicate control microcosms did not receive triclosan, and the experiment was run for 618days. The overall bacterial community (assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) was not impacted by triclosan; however, the abundance of Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi 16S rRNA genes (determined by qPCR) increased 20-fold with triclosan amendment compared with a fivefold increase without triclosan. This work demonstrates that triclosan impacts anaerobic soil communities at environmentally relevant levels.

AB A Mackay-type level II fugacity model has been used to predict the behaviour and final concentrations of cocaine (COC) and its main metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) in a regional environmental system defined according to the European guidelines on Risk Assessment. The model takes into account the initial COC intake, partial degradation of the parent compound to BE, treatment of wastewater and environmental fate of these substances. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) lie in the ng L-1 level, with the exception of the air compartment, where the concentrations are negligible. PECs in the water phase are in accordance with measured experimental concentrations in different European rivers. This case study shows that a simple level II fugacity model is suitable enough for modelling the environmental fate of high water soluble and low volatile organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products.

AB This study investigated the co-effect of microplastic polyvinylchloride and antibiotics tetracycline to partial nitrification process in treating high ammonia wastewater. The average ammonia oxidation rate of all reactors was 53.58, 56.17 and 42.08 mg.N/L.h in round 1, round 7 and round 13, respectively. The ammonia oxidation rate was reduced to 89.40%, 79.08%, 80.60%, 73.37%, 69.50%, 75.72%, 98.93% and 66.04% from 1st round of test to 13th round of test at reactor R1 to R8. The average nitrosation rate was always over 80% in all conditions tested. Tetracycline removal rate was attributed to sludge adsorption in all reactors and was increased continuously with the increment of tetracycline concentration. The nitrous oxide emission was keep decreasing from round 1 to round 13 in all reactors tested. The microbial community results revealed that with the existence of tetracycline and microplastics, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes were reduced and Proteobacteria were increased.

AB In this study, magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method by using ferric nitrate and cobalt nitrate as raw materials. Subsequently, physicochemical properties of the resulting CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were systematically studied by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and Vibration sample magnetometer measurement. Results indicated that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with cubic spinel structure possessed an average diameter of 6.9 nm, specific surface area of 103.48 m(2) . g(-1), saturation magnetization of 54.65 A . m(2) (emu . g(-1)) and coercivity of 1.76x10(4) A . m(-1). Furthermore, scavenging experiments revealed that sulfate radicals ((SO4-)-S-center dot) was the main active species derived from persulfates, in which 72.3% of diclofenac could be degraded within 30 min treatment. This study provides a promising strategy to synthesize versatile catalyst which would be potentially applied in pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Constructed wetlands remove trace organic contaminants via synergistic processes involving plant biomass that include hydrolysis, volatilization, sorption, biodegradation, and photolysis. Wetland design conditions, such as hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) and carbon loading rates (CLRs), influence these processes. Contaminant of emerging concern (CEC) removal by wetland plants was investigated at varying HLRs and CLRs. Rate constants and parameters obtained from batch-scale studies were used in a mechanistic model to evaluate the effect of these two loading rates on CEC removal. CLR significantly influenced CEC removal when wetlands were operated at HLR >5 cm/d. High values of CLR increased removal of estradiol and carbamazepine but lowered that of testosterone and atrazine. Without increasing the cumulative HLR, operating two wetlands in series with varying CLRs could be a way to improve CEC removal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photocatalytic, sonolytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C2NP) using heterogeneous (TiO2) was investigated in this study. Experiments were performed in slurry mode with artificial UV 125 watt medium pressure mercury lamp coupled with ultrasound (100 W, 33+3 KHz) for sonication of the slurry. The degradation of compound was studied in terms of first order kinetics. The catalyst concentration was optimized at 1.5 gL(-1), pH at 7 and oxidant concentration at 1.5 gL(-1). The results obtained were quite appreciable as 80% degradation was obtained for photocatalytic treatment in 120 minutes whereas, ultrasound imparting synergistic effect as degradation achieved 96% increase in 90 minutes during sonophotocatalysis. The degradation follows the trend sonophotocatalysis > photocatalysis > sonocatalytic > sonolysis. The results of sonophotocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical compound showed that it could be used as efficient and environmentally friendly technique for the complete degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants which will increase the chances for the reuse of wastewater.

AB The current work focuses on the production of glucose oxidase (GOD) in sterilized biosolid (BS) slurries containing BS and municipal wastewater effluent. Various parameters were optimized for maximizing the GOD production and the effects of biostimulation on GOD production was investigated by adding synthetic media components. The studies on inoculum characteristics at an inoculum age of 72 h and inoculum size of 20% (w/v) produced high GOD activities of around 6012 U/L in 25% (dw/v) BS media. Further, the effect of ultrasonication time was determined to release BS-bound GOD in order to maximize enzymes recovery. Using 1000 U/L of the BS-based GOD for 0.55 M glucose oxidation produced the maximum H2O2 concentration of 216 ppm. The produced H2O2 was utilized for bio-Fenton based advanced oxidation process for the partial removal of 15 pharmaceutically active compounds.

AB Losartan potassium (LOS) is a most globally consumed antihypertensive and emerging pharmaceutical contaminant of concern due to increasingly ubiquity in water and wastewater. For its effective environmental remediation, we propose the catalytic oxidation of losartan via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation using a metal-free N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (N-PC). We found out that N-PC exhibits both excellent adsorption capacity and catalytic oxidation efficiency with 100% LOS uptake within 240 min at 0.026 g/L of the N-PC. Fresh and used N-PC were scrutinized for textural properties and surface chemistry. The effects of PMS dose, temperature, pH, organic matter and coexisting anions on losartan decomposition were examined. Moreover, total organic removal was obtained and the catalyst was tested in three consecutive runs. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching assays revealed that the nonradical oxidation pathway plays a major role in LOS degradation by N-PC/PMS.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are common contaminants found in surface and ground-waters, often due to their inefficient removal from wastewater treatment plants. One way in which these compounds can be removed is via aerobic cometabolism, a process that involves oxygenases produced by microorganisms. Limited work has been done examining the efficacy of cometabolism in the removal of PhACs. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the use of an alkane (pentane) in the aerobic cometabolic transformations of paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and nimesulide. Both paracetamol and ibuprofen (single aromatic compounds) were readily transformed, withnet specific biodegradation rates equal to 1.6 and 3.2 mu mol/g(cell)/day, respectively. Conversely, the two aromatic ring PhACs showed slower (naproxen and nimesulide) or no transformation (diclofenac). In addition, four of the tested PhACs (ibuprofen, paracetamol, naproxen and nimesulide) did not inhibit pentane uptake.

DT Article
DE COD reduction; Active oxidation; Fenton reagent; H2O2/Fe+2; Atenolol
AB Active pharmaceutical intermediates (API) in waste waters have adverse effects on aquatic life and environment. The API have high COD value and low BOD3 and hence difficult to treat biologically. In this study, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) utilizing the H2O2/Fe+2, Fenton reactions were investigated in lab-scale experiments for the degradation of Atenolol containing waste water streams. The experimental results showed that the Fenton process using H2O2/Fe+2 was the most effective treatment process. With Fenton processes, COD reduction of wastewater can be achieved successfully. It is suggested that Fenton processes are viable techniques for the degradation of Atenolol from the waste water stream with relatively low toxic by-products in the effluent which can be easily biodegraded in the activated sludge process. Hence, the Fenton process with H2O2/Fe+2 is considered a suitable pretreatment method to degrade the active pharmaceutical molecules and to improve the biodegradability of waste water.

AB The present study provides results describing the successful photodegradation of a refractory pharmaceutical compound, named clofibric acid (CA) over different nanosized catalysts. Obtained data clearly showed that the investigated catalysts can be employed successfully for the elimination of CA. It was observed that the removal of the target molecule was enhanced in the presence of zinc oxide (100 mg/l) and UV-A. Indeed, under laboratory scale conditions, more than 93% of pollutant was eliminated after an irradiation time of 30 min using a stirred reactor artificially illuminated operating in batch mode. Additionally, the effect of different process parameters (catalyst load, pollutant concentration and light intensity) was studied in detail. The obtained data revealed that the removal of pollutant was effective after 15 min of reaction using a maximum catalyst concentration (1 g/l), 5 mg/l of clofibric acid and the maximum light intensity. Overall, this work confirms the relevance of the photocalytic process for the successful elimination of this refractory water pollutant.

AB A MnO2/CdTiO3 is prepared by a simple chemical method. The organic compound such as antibiotics is a contaminant found in large amounts in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. Pharmaceutical compounds are toxic. The nano-product was characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, DLS and UV-vis DRS revealed that the MnO2 nanoparticles were supported on the CdTiO3 surface. The crystallite size was found as 72.11 nm, and 38.13 nm for CdTiO3, and MnCdTi-1 nanocomposites, respectively. The prepared catalyst was used for photo-degradation of cephalexin under UV light irradiation. The result implies the complete degradation of cephalexin was carried out at 80 min for MnCdTi-2 nanocomposites (88.88%) due to this catalyst has the lowest band gap compared to the other catalyst. The MnO2/CdTiO3 was selected for fungicidal and bactericidal efficiency against Aspergillus flavus, and candida albicans and Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MnO2/CdTiO3-2 has great activity is compared with the other MnO2/CdTiO3-0 and MnO2/CdTiO3-1 samples.

AB Pharmaceuticals have low biodegradahility and can retain their chemical structure for long periods of time leading to an accumulation in the environment causing irreversible changes. Electrochemical oxidation has been proved to be an environmentally friendly and economically viable solution for biorefractory of organic molecules as well as for the disinfection of wastewaters. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of specific energy consumption for a given reduction of toxic organic compound loads in a continuous flow bipolar packed-bed electrochemical reactor and compare this with a classical parallel plate reactor. The energy cost for both the parallel plate and bipolar electrochemical reactors are similar (around 1.6 kWh m(-3)) lower than other advanced oxidation process reported in literature. However, the bipolar configuration is particularly suitable for low conductivity waste water and/or for avoiding the formation of organochloride compounds in a chloride rich wastewater.

In biofouling, they are responsible for the increase of friction resistance, change of surface properties such as hydrophobicity, roughness, colour, etc. In biocorrosion of metals they are involved by their ability to bind metal ions. In bloweathering, they contribute by their complexing properties to the dissolution of minerals. The EPSs represent a sorption site for pollutants such as heavy metal ions and organic molecules. This can lead to a burden in wastewater sludge; on the other hand, the sorption properties can be used for water purification. Other biotechnological uses of EPS exploit their contribution to viscosity, e.g., in food, paints and oil-drilling 'muds'; their hydrating properties are also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, EPSs may have potential uses as biosurfactants, e.g., in tertiary oil production, and as biological glue. EPSs are an interesting component of all biofilm systems and still hold a large biotechnological potential.

TI The role of adsorption in photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen under

AB The adsorption behavior and mechanism of ibuprofen (IBP) on BiOBr microspheres were investigated for revealing the role of adsorption in BiOBr-based photocatalysis under visible light irradiation. Parameters such as initial concentration of IBP, catalyst dosage, solution pH value, cations and anions that affect the adsorption and photocatalytic efficiency of IBP were studied. We observed that approximately 80% of the IBP removal rate contributed from BiOBr adsorption in photocatalysis process. This suggests that the removal rate of IBP by BiOBr is highly adsorptivity dependent, with higher removal rate at higher adsorptioh capacity. We believe that the anion exchange between Br and dissociated IBP followed by formation of Bi-O bond on the surface of BiOBr microspheres is the main acting force during the IBP adsorption, which was further proved by XPS and FT-IR analysis. Furthermore, the TOC removal rate difference between adsorption and photocatalysis was only 11%, which indicated that most of the removal rate contribution was from adsorption. Therefore, the BiOBr adsorption property should be preferentially considered when discussing its photocatalytic mechanism. Our current work is expected to offer new insight into BiOBr-based photocatalysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mediterranean rivers are characterized by a high flow variability, which is strongly influenced by the seasonal rainfall. When water scarcity periods occur, water flow, and dilution capacity of the river is reduced, increasing the potential environmental risk of pollutants. On the other hand, floods contribute to remobilization of pollutants from sediments. Contamination levels in Mediterranean rivers are frequently higher than in other European river basins, including pollution by pharmaceutical residues. Little attention has been paid to the transport behavior of emerging contaminants in surface waters once they are discharged from WWTP into a river. In this context, this work aimed to relate presence and fate of emerging contaminants with hydrological conditions of a typical Mediterranean River (Llobregat, NE Spain).
   River fresh water samples were collected twice a week over a period of 5 weeks at three sampling points. Sixty-six pharmaceutical compounds belonging to different therapeutical classes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
   Positive and negative correlations between the concentrations of the target analytes and hydrological variables like river flow and dissolved organic matter were observed pointing out the relevance of different hydrological phenomena like dilution effects or sediment re-suspension. Sensitivity calculations showed that the majority of compounds were sensitive to flow variations.

AB Mechanical harvest of massive harmful algal blooms is an effective measure for bloom mitigation. Yet subsequent processing of the resulting water from algae water separation after the harvesting becomes a new problem since individual algal cells or small algal aggregates are still present in the water. Here, we proposed a novel approach for effectively flocculating the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa with a removal efficiency of 97% in 6 h using hydrolyzed urine. Nitrogen and phosphorus were simultaneously reclaimed through struvite formation. The addition of Mg2+ promoted the flocculation efficiency and nutrient removal as well as the yield of struvite. Ca2+ could enhance the flocculation efficiency by forming calcium phosphate. During the flocculation process, no significant damage in algal cells was observed. This study provides a novel and sustainable potential for subsequent processing of the resulting water after algae water separation with simultaneous nutrient precipitation and reducing nutrient loads to wastewater treatment plants.

AB Forward osmotic membrane bioreactor is an emerging technology that combines the advantages of forward osmosis and conventional membrane bioreactor. In this paper, bisphenol A removal by using a forward osmotic membrane bioreactor and a conventional membrane bioreactor that shared one biologic reactor was studied. The total removal rate of bisphenol A by the conventional membrane bioreactor and forward osmotic membrane bioreactor was as high as 93.9% and 98%, respectively. Biodegradation plays a dominant role in the total removal of bisphenol A in both processes. In comparison of membrane rejection, the forward osmosis membrane can remove approximately 70% bisphenol A from the feed, much higher than that of the microfiltration membrane (below 10%). Forward osmosis membrane bioreactor should be operated with its BPA loading rate under 0.08 mg center dot g(-1)center dot d(-1) to guarantee the effluent bisphenol A concentration less than10 mu g center dot L-1.

AB The effective disposal of industrial pharmaceutical waste waters with the desired quality has become a challenge. Supercritical water oxidation which involves water beyond critical point has been preferred due to its near complete conversions. This research work made an attempt to degrade the organic matter into fuel gases by gasifying the pharmaceutical waste water stream over sub- to supercritical temperature range (200-400 degrees C). A maximum of 126.5 mmol/L of H-2 gas yield was obtained at 400 degrees C for 45 min. To achieve complete conversion, supercritical experiments have been performed in the presence of H2O2. The experiments resulted near complete conversion of 99.5% for an oxidation coefficient of 4 at 400 degrees C in 5 min. The experimental results conveyed that useful products (H-2, CO and CH4) can be attained with gasification in the absence of oxidant, while complete conversion can be achieved in the presence of oxidant in supercritical water.

AB Emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals are a class of compounds that are causing great concern due to several environmental problems. Conventional water and wastewater treatments do not achieve high removal efficiencies for many of these drugs. Therefore, the present work investigated the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) by heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2 irradiated with artificial UV light or solar radiation. The treated solutions were tested against Daphnia similis and Raphidocelis subcapitata, which are species commonly used as bioindicators of environmental conditions. The results indicated that IBP removal reached 92 % after 1 h of treatment using artificial UV and 1000 mg L-1 of TiO2, which was the optimum catalyst concentration in the range studied (20-1000 mg L-1). TOC removal reached up to 78 % after 60 min of treatment using TiO2/artificial UV. Ecotoxicological bioassays indicated that the treated solutions had acute effects, with 30 % immobilization of D. similis and 40 % growth inhibition of R. subcapitata.

Compounds found with highest median concentrations included: sulfadimethoxine (164 ng/L), sulpiride (77.3 ng/L), atenolol (52.9 ng/L), and indomethacin (50.9 ng/L). Antibiotic was the predominant class detected and contributed about half of the overall PPCPs contamination level. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were demonstrated to be the predominant pathways through which PPCPs entering into aquatic environment in all investigated areas. The ratio of persistent PPCPs like sulpiride and carbamazepine was identified to be feasible in tracing their contamination sources in rivers. Concentrations of most detected PPCPs showed significant positive correlations with total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Two groups of representative PPCPs were selected as the chemical indicators for predicting the overall PPCPs contamination, based on the significant correlations between PPCPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study aimed to synthesize a new magnetic photocatalytic nanosystem composed of Ag-CuFe2O4@WO3 and to investigate its photodegradation efficiency for two drug pollutants of Gemfibrozil (GEM) and Tamoxifen (TAM) under Ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. In this regard, the effect of pH, catalyst dosage, and drug concentration was thoroughly determined. The largest photodegradation level for GEM (81%) and TAM (83%) was achieved at pH 5, a photocatalyst dosage of 0.2 g/L, drug concentration of 5 mg/L, and contact time of 150 min. The drug photodegradation process followed the pseudo first-order kinetic model. In addition to the photodegradation effect, the nanocomposites were proved to be efficient in terms of antibacterial activity, proportional to the Ag doping level. The Ag-CuFe2O4@WO3 nanocomposite exhibited a stable, efficient performance without an obvious catalytic loss after five successive cycles. Taken together, the developed magnetic photocatalyst is able to simultaneously disinfect wastewater streams and to degrade pharmaceutical contaminants and thus shows a promising potential for purification of multi-contaminant water systems.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are widely used for desalination and water treatment. However, they insufficiently reject some small uncharged micropollutants, such as certain endocrine-disrupting, pharmaceutically active compounds and boric acid, increasingly present in water sources and wastewater. This study examines the feasibility of improving rejection of multiple micropollutants in commercial low-pressure RO membrane elements using concentration polarization- and surfactant-enhanced surface polymerization. Low-pressure membrane elements modified by grafting poly(glycidyl methacrylate) showed enhanced rejection of all tested solutes (model organic micropollutants, boric acid, and NaCl), with permeability somewhat reduced, but comparable with commercial brackish water RO membranes. The study demonstrates the potential and up-scalability of grafting as an in situ method for improving removal of various classes of organic and inorganic micropollutants and tuning performance in RO and other dense composite membranes for water purification.

AB The clofibric acid (CLF) is the active compound of blood lipid regulators, which act by lowering serum triglyceride production. This xenobiotic compound is highly persistent in the aquatic environment and passes unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants. There was demonstrated the implications of filamentous fungi in biodegradation of organic compounds with aromatic chemical structure because they are able to produce extracellular phenol oxidases. This work performed a screening of four white-rot fungi, Trametes versicolor, Trametes pubescens, Lenzites betulina and Irpex lacteus based on their potential for extracellular laccase biosynthesis and biodegradation of 15 mg L-1 of CLF, after 14 days of incubation in submerged aerobe conditions by cultivation on a minimal liquid medium containing pharmaceutically active compound. The obtained results reported the ability of the tested fungal strains to remove CLF in percentages varying from 32% to 54%. Further researches target the optimization of the biotechnological conditions for CLF biodegradation in order to enhance the bioremediation yield especially in poluated aquatic system.

AB High-pressure membrane processes, including nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, allow for the removal of a wide range of organic micropollutants (including pharmaceutical compounds) from water streams. Those processes also may be an effective method for in-depth treatment of water containing pharmaceutical compounds. The paper presents a comparison of retention of selected pharmaceuticals from the group of non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs, ie ibuprofen and diclofenac and psychotropic drugs carbamazepine, present in various aqueous matrices in the nanofiltration process. Deionized water based solutions as well as model and real wastewater effluents after biological treatment processes were subjected to the filtration process. The nanofiltration process was carried out in a cross-flow tubular membrane filtration system. Three polyamide membranes AFC30, AFC40 and AFC80 from PCI Membrane System Inc were used. It has been found, that the retention of pharmaceutical compounds increased with the membrane filtration time, regardless of the composition of the treated aqueous matrix. Moreover, the presence of inorganic compounds and high-molecular organic substances had a positive effect on the membrane separation process of micropollutants.

AB The removal of estrogen hormones from water and wastewater is of importance due to their adverse effects toward ecosystems and potential risks to human health. The ultrasound-induced destruction of estrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is studied in a batch reactor using a 1.1 W/mL sonication unit and in a continuous flow reactor using a 2.1 W/mL sonication unit. The estrogen compounds of interest are 17(x-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, estrone, equilin, gestodene, levonorgestrel, and norgestrel. Effects of process variables such as temperature, pH, and pressure are examined. The degradation of estrogens follows pseudo first-order kinetics. The reaction likely takes place in the interfacial region where supercritical environment is produced upon cavity implosion and in the bulk solution with radical species. Low solution pH is more favorable for destruction of estrogens. A kinetic degradation model is developed to predict the destruction of estrogen compounds. Low solution temperature shows favorable destruction of estrogens. Increasing the fluid pressure is detrimental to reaction efficiency.

AB In this overview chapter we will focus on the importance of emerging contaminants and their presence in the environment, as well as giving a description of this book. The environmental issue of emerging contaminants is tied to the analysis of wastewater samples using the new analytical methods of the last decade, especially LC/MS and LC/MS/MS. Thus, this book focuses on applications of LC/MS/MS to analyze unknowns in the aquatic environment. Emerging contaminants are defined as compounds that are not currently covered by existing regulations of water quality, that have not been previously studied, and that are thought to be a possible threat to environmental health and safety.. In particular the compounds that are addressed include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, and pesticide degradates. The book has three main sections that address these issues with special attention to the analytical methods of mass spectrometry (such as triple quadrupoles, ion-traps, and quadrupole time-of-flight analyzers). All the different important aspects on today's emerging contaminants have been covered throughout the chapters.

AB In China, more than 3.5 million tons of Camellia oleifera discarded shells are produced every year. This work first prepared phosphorus-containing biochar (PBC) from C. oleifera shells and was successfully applied to the efficient removal of tetracycline (TC) from solutions. The prepared PBC exhibits superior TC adsorption capacity of 451.5 mg/g, and TC uptake rapidly reached 315.5 mg/g at the first 5 min (C0 = 50 mg/L). Furthermore, PBC also shows excellent applicability to the broad range pH value (1?9) and superior selective removal in the presence of various high concentration coexisting ions (1 mM). Mechanisms underlying TC adsorption were also put forward, and analysis suggested that pyrophosphate-like surface functional groups (C-O-P bond) played a critical role in this process. Notably, treating pharmaceutical wastewater with PBC can efficiently reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration below the discharge standard of China (GB219042008).

AB Prazosin (PRZ), a drug used to treat hypertensive patients, is an emergent contaminant in water systems. PRZ is an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker used to treat anxiety, and is believed to reach the environment through human excretion, irresponsible disposal of unused medicine, and waste products from manufacturing plants. The purpose of this research was to isolate and characterize potential microbes for PRZ biodegradation and to identify the degradation pathway. After screening, isolated strain STP3 showed a capability for PRZ degradation and was chosen for further analysis. Resting cell assays with PRZ were conducted to identify the intermediate metabolites formed from biodegradation by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) analysis. Two metabolites degraded from PRZ by STP3 were successfully found, and as these metabolites are derived from the main structure of PRZ, their presence proved PRZ degradation. Draft genome sequencing analysis of STP3 was performed to identify potential enzymes for PRZ biodegradation based on the metabolites found.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) and regulated compounds (RCs) from three different WWTP effluents were measured in the current study. The efficiency of two tertiary treatments, Photobiotreatment (PhtBio) and Multi-Barrier Treatment (MBT), for removing contaminants was determined. Results indicated different percentages of removal depending on the treatment and the origin of the effluent. Risk Quotients (RQs) were determined for different species of algae, Daphnia, and fish. RQ results revealed diverse risk values depending on the bioindicator species. Tonalide, galaxolide (fragrances), and ofloxacin (antibiotic) were the most persistent and harmful substances in tested effluents. "Negligible risk" category was reached since a wide diversity of ECs were removed by MBT with high removal percentages. Contrarily, PhtBio was effective only in the depuration of certain chemical compounds, and its efficiency depended on the composition of the raw effluent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study deals with the evaluation of water quality of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in order to assess its suitability as a raw water source for drinking water production. Therefore, water samples from (1) surface water, (2) tap water, and (3) wastewater treatment plant effluents were taken randomly by 2011-2012 in the area of the TGR and were analyzed for seven different organic contaminant groups (207 substances in total), applying nine different analytical methods. In the three sampled water sources, typical contaminant patterns were found, i.e., pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in surface water with concentrations of 0.020-3.5 mu g/L and 0.004-0.12 mu g/L, disinfection by-products in tap water with concentrations of 0.050-79 mu g/L, and pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant effluents with concentrations of 0.020-0.76 mu g/L, respectively. The most frequently detected organic compounds in surface water (45 positives out of 57 samples) were the pyridine pesticides clopyralid and picloram. The concentrations might indicate that they are used on a regular basis and in conjunction in the area of the TGR. Three- and four-ring PAH were ubiquitously distributed, while the poorly soluble five- and six-ring members, perfluorinated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, were below the detection limit. In general, the detected concentrations in TGR are in the same range or even lower compared to surface waters in western industrialized countries, although contaminant loads can still be high due to a high discharge. With the exception of the two pesticides, clopyralid and picloram, concentrations of the investigated organic pollutants in TGR meet the limits of the Chinese Standards for Drinking Water Quality GB 5749 (Ministry of Health of China and Standardization Administration of China 2006) and the European Union (EU) Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption (The Council of the European Union 1998), or rather, the EU Directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union 2008). Therefore, the suggested use of surface water from TGR for drinking water purposes is a valid option. Current treatment methods, however, do not seem to be efficient since organic pollutants were detected in significant concentrations in purified tap water.

AB Field-effect transistors (FETs) are one of the most widely-used electronic sensors for continuous monitoring and detection of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds at low concentrations. FETs have been successfully utilized for the rapid analysis of these environmental pollutants due to their advantageous material properties like the disposability, rapid responses and simplicity. This paper presented an up-to-date overview of applied strategies with different bio-based materials in order to enhance the analytical performances of the designed sensors. Comparison and discussion were made between characteristics of recently engineered FET bio-sensors used for the detection of famous and selected pharmaceutical compounds in the literature. The recent progress in environmental research applications, comments on interesting trends, current challenge for future research in endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) detection using FETs biosensors were highlighted.

AB Fenton reactions are widely applied when degrading recalcitrant pollutants, but reusing the resulting ferric sludge remains a challenge. A novel concept for regenerating Fe(II) solution at pH 6 based on ferric sludge from neutral Fenton was herein proposed. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) with biocathode and citric acid was used for the first time to promote the regenerated rate of Fe(II) from ferric sludge. The concentration of dissolved Fe(II) reached 120 mg/L in biocathode, which was much higher than that obtained in abiotic cathode (<1 mg/L). The main chemical cost of regenerating Fe(II) was only 3.3% of the commercial Fe(II). Subsequently, the regenerated Fe(II) solution was used to activate H2O2, to remove pharmaceuticals from the municipal wastewater effluent. A wide range of pharmaceuticals was successfully removed at neutral pH in 60 min, and the efficiency of the treatment was similar to when the same dosage of commercial Fe(II) was applied.

AB A mobile pilot plant was set up in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in southwest Spain to address potential adverse effects of effluents as a whole contaminant, which are discharging into marine environments. Ruditapes philippinarum specimens were exposed to different effluent concentrations (50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.15%) during seven days. After effluent exposure, lysosomal membrane stability alterations (LMS), changes in the energy status storage (total lipids content (TLP) and in the mitochondria) electron transport (MET), inhibition of inflammatory mechanisms (cyclooxygenase activity (COX)), and neurotoxic effects (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were determined in exposed organisms. Furthermore, potential toxic reduction in the effluent was analysed by the application of an additional microalgae tertiary treatment called photobiotreatment (PhtBio). Results after PhtBio confirmed the toxic effect reduction in exposed organisms. Neuroendocrine effects, alterations in energy budget and in lipid storage revealed alterations in clam's health status causing stress conditions after effluent exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The parameter AOX (adsorbable organic halogens) indicates the total amount of organic halogens in an environment. Seawater and surface sediment samples from 12 sample sites in the Hangzhou Bay (HZB), China, were analyzed for AOX to investigate its contamination status. In this study, the AOX concentration ranged from 140.6 +/- 45.6 mu g/L to 716.1 +/- 623 mu g/L in seawater of the HZB, and from 11.3 +/- 2.4 mg/kg to 112.7 +/- 7.2 mg/kg in the sediment. Ocean currents, fluvial currents and the Yangtze River exerted profound influences on the distribution of AOX in the HZB. The point sources around the HZB, represented by wastewater treatment plants, discharged at least 645.4 t AOX into the HZB every year, most of which was generated by industrial activities rather than the human daily activities.

AB In this research, ZnO-ZnAl2O4 mixed phases were prepared by calcination of Zn-Al-CO3 layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursors. Firstly, a series of Zn-Al-CO3 LDH were synthesized at different Zn/Al molar ratios (r = 1, 3 and 5) and then calcined at different temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C) for 6 h. The materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA/DTA, ICP-AES and TEM. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated for the degradation of caffeine as a model pharmaceutical pollutant in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. The effect of the Zn/Al molar ratio, calcination temperature and initial pH of aqueous solution was investigated. The experimental results show that the sample obtained from the molar ratio of 3 and calcined at 500 degrees C with a large capacity of adsorption obtained by reconstruction process was photocatalytically much higher than standard Degussa P-25 titanium dioxide.

AB Visible light-induced photocatalysis is potentially advantageous and could be an efficient approach to degrade contaminants because it can be used to selectively target specific wavelength for decomposition of organic contaminants in water and wastewater. This study demonstrates the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) using [Pt(3,3'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bpy)(1,2-benzenedithiolate)] (Complex 1)-sensitized and [Pt(4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bpy)(1,2-benzenedithiolate)] (Complex 2)-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2) under blue or yellow light (420 or 580 nm, respectively) irradiation in water. The Complex 1-sensitized TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation of SMX reached almost 100 % removal under 420 nm irradiation for 3 h in water. In addition, the formation of hydroxyl radicals can be facilitated by bubbling O-2 during the photodegradation in which an effective decomposition of SMX was observed. Based on HPLC and UV-Vis studies of the decomposed products, it was found that SMX underwent cleavage of aromatic rings during the photodegradation process.

AB Phragmites australis carbon (PAC) was produced from Phragmites australis by phosphoric acid (H3PO4) activation. To achieve a better amoxicillin (AMX) adsorption performance, manganous dihydrogen phosphate (Mn(H2PO4)(2)) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) were impregnated, producing PAC-MP and PAC-MC, respectively. Adsorption studies were carried out in different initial AMX concentration (15-100 mg L-1), pH (2-10) and contact time (0-60 h) to evaluate AMX adsorption performance and mechanisms. The adsorption isotherms well agreed with the Langmuir model for the three adsorbents. The maximum AMX adsorption capacity on PAC, PAC-MP and PAC-MC was 110, 132 and 122 mg g(-1), respectively. Solution pH had a strong influence on AMX adsorption. For kinetic results, a significant desorption phenomenon was observed. Several possible mechanisms were elaborated which include electrostatic interaction, complexation and degradation of AMX molecules. On the whole, Mn-impregnated PAC showed superior AMX removal efficiency, which presents a promising modification method for activated carbon in the treatment of AMX containing wastewater.

AB Stream augmentation with tertiary treated municipal wastewater-i.e., recycled water - is increasingly considered as an ecologically beneficial way to utilize recycled water, especially in semi-arid regions of the American Southwest. There is concern that emerging contaminants, i.e. unregulated but biologically active organic compounds, may be present in recycled water and will impact on the aquatic environment and the underlying groundwater. Emerging contaminants include a wide variety of chemically disparate compounds, including pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, and residues of perfluorochemical surfactants (PFCs). This paper presents background data on the occurrence and transport of PFC in Upper Silver Creek (USC) and Coyote Creek, in San Jose, California. USC feeds into Coyote Creek, which discharges into San Francisco Bay. Augmenting the natural flow of Coyote Creek with highly treated recycled water is currently being considered as a means to provide more freshwater to the river ecosystem. The reach of interest is approximately 1,000m where USC flows on alluvial fan deposits. Data indicate that some PFCs are refractory

DE Sodium diclofenac; Photodegradation; Cobalt ferrite
AB Emerging pollutants, among them pharmaceutical compounds, are found in surface and ground waters, suggesting their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. In this paper, the removal of sodium diclofenac, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was explored by a heterogeneous Photo-Fenton process using CoFe2O4, H2O2 and Uv germicide radiation (254 nm). Cobalt ferrites, were obtained by Pechini method and calcined at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Uv visible spectroscopy, Mossbauer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperatureprogrammed reduction and specific surface area. The inverse spinel structure was obtained, and both materials presented good performance in the photo-Fenton reaction. A degradation mechanism based on the generation of *OH groups is suggested. The complete sodium diclofenac degradation and 86% of mineralization of the total organic carbon were obtained using cobalt ferrite calcined at 800 degrees C. This catalyst was used in three cycles, without activity loss showing a negligible Fe leaching. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plastic pollution in oceans is a global problem, with growing research efforts focusing on the threat of micro plastics (< 5 mm fractions). A source of microplastics pollution is derived from personal care products that contain polyethylene micro-spheres which are not captured by wastewater plants. In this work, ten personal care products (mainly scrubs) containing microplastics and marketed in Spain, were physico-chemically characterized. The obtained results proved that those microplastics had different particle size and are presented in high percentages in some cases, between 6 and 7% of the total product. Products with smaller particles usually showed higher concentrations than products with larger particles. Although all the microplastics were shown to be polyethylene, some impurities were observed that demonstrated the presence of silicates and oxides in the microplastics. Regards to morphology, the shape of the particles was irregular in general, although some completely spherical particles can be observed.

AB Removal of seven pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, naproxen, ranitidine and sulfamethoxazole) from water was investigated using three different microbial treatments with: (1) the microalga Chlorella vulgaris, (2) the fungus Aspergillus niger and (3) biopellets composed of both microorganisms. The three-day experiment was performed under laboratory conditions and pharmaceuticals were spiked at the environmentally relevant concentration of 10 mu g L-1. The biopellets and fungal treatments resulted in significantly lower ranitidine concentration compared with the initial value. Also, treatment with biopellets resulted in significantly lower final ranitidine concentrations compared to those found after control and microalgal treatments. Low removal rates were obtained for other substances, possibly because the amount of microbial biomass used was 16-500-fold lower than that normally used in activated sludge processes in wastewater treatments plants. Thus, the pharmaceutical removal potential, elimination potential and performance of biopellets should be further investigated at higher biomass concentrations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The visualisation of DNA damage response proteins enables the indirect measurement of DNA damage. Soon after the occurrence of a DNA double-strand break (DSB), the formation of gamma-H2AX histone variants is to be expected. This review is focused on the potential use of the gamma-H2AX foci assay in assessing the genotoxicity of environmental contaminants including cytostatic pharmaceuticals, since standard methods may not be sensitive enough to detect the damaging effect of low environmental concentrations of such drugs. These compounds are constantly released into the environment, potentially representing a threat to water quality, aquatic organisms, and, ultimately, human health. Our review of the literature revealed that this method could be used in the biomonitoring and risk assessment of aquatic systems affected by wastewater from the production, usage, and disposal of cytostatic pharmaceuticals.

Results point out that electrolytic technology can mineralize all organic contained in the urine very efficiently and that oxidation of the two pharmaceuticals is faster than that of the natural products contained in urine, opening the possibility of a selective treatment of the urine up to the point in which it can be merged safely with domestic wastewater without generating a negative impact on environment. Occurrence of perchlorate is the main drawback of this technology, although its impact is not believed to be as serious as the impact of the pharmaceuticals on environment.

AB A new and highly sensitive spectrophotometric based flow injection analysis method has been developed for the determination of copper (II). N, N'-o-phenylene-bis (3-methoxysalicylideneimine) (H2IF) was used as a new chromogenic reagent. The absorbance was measured at lambda(max) = 420 nm. Various factors affecting complex formation have been investigated. For example, the pH effect, reagent concentration was studied. Under optimum conditions, Beer's law was met in the range of 3.18-318 mu g L-1 copper (II) concentration. The system required no mixing chamber and allowed a sample throughput > 60 sample per hour for 20 mu L injection volume. The interaction of the various ions was investigated and the experimental results were reported. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the amount of copper (II) found in pharmaceutical samples and water samples. The validity and applicability of the method was confirmed by AAS and standard reference material SPS-WW2 (Wastewater) analysis.

AB Pharmaceuticals compounds are widely used to maintain human and animal health worldwide. After human consumption pharmaceutical compounds in the urban aquatic environment reach to the wastewater facilities and eventually find their way to the surface waters. Aim of this study was to determine the effects of various sludge retention times (SRT) and hydraulic retention times (HRT) using lab-scale continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for the removal of diclofenac and paracetamol in activated sludge. In order to find out removal rates of these pharmaceutical compounds, activated sludge reactor were operated at different sludge retention times (SRT: 10, 20, 30 days) and different hydraulic retention times (HRT: 12 and 24 hours). The highest removal rates were obtained under 30 days of SRT and 24 hours of HRT operating conditions. Maximum removal of 95% was observed for paracetamol and 44% for diclofenac. The operational implementation of SRT and HRT has been shown to increase the removal efficiency of pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Diclofenac, ibuprofen and ketoprofen are anti-inflammatory drugs intensively used both in human and animal treatment. Due to their high stability these compounds are partially removed by wastewater treatment plants and from this reason the development of some alternative treatments such as advanced oxidative processes are necessary. The main problems in the optimization of an advanced oxidative process rise from the difficulties which appear in the identification of degradation by-products necessary for the establishment of degradation pathway. In this paper a developed method for the simultaneous identification of Fenton degradation by-products of the three above mentioned pharmaceuticals is presented. The obtained results show the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry as a proper method for the analysis of the complex mixture of compounds resulted from the Fenton degradation process. Moreover, some compounds never mentioned in the scientific literature were identified.

AB This study evaluated the effect of continuous and batch feeding on the removal of 8 pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, salicylic acid, ketoprofen and clofibric acid) from synthetic wastewater in mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs). Both loading modes were operated at hydraulic application rates of 5.6 cm day(-1) and 2.8 cm day(-1). Except for carbamazepine, clofibric acid and naproxen, removal in CWs was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced under the batch versus continuous mode. For all compounds tested except naproxen, values for first-order decay constants (k) for drain and fill operation were higher than that for the continuous mode of operation. Correlation between the distribution coefficient (log D-ow) and removal efficiencies of pharmaceutical compounds in the CWs, showed that pharmaceutical removal efficiency was significantly (p < 0.1) and inversely correlated with log D-ow value, but not with log K-ow value.

AB The feasibility of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process to treat wastewaters containing antibiotics was studied in this work. Concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg L-1 for tetracycline hydrochloride and from 250 to 1000 mg L-1 for chloramphenicol were tested in batch assays. A strong inhibitory effect was observed for both antibiotics.
   A concentration of 20 mg L-1 of chloramphenicol was continuously added to an Anammox Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) system, causing a decrease of the nitrogen removal efficiency of 25%. The Specific Anammox Activity (SAA) of the biomass also decreased from 0.25 to 0.05 g N (g VSS d)(-1). Similar effects were observed when 50 mg L-1 of tetracycline hydrochloride were continuously fed. Both antibiotics did not cause any changes in the physical properties of the biomass. A previous degradation step could be necessary in order to treat wastewaters containing inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics by the Anammox process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fenton chemistry (Fe-II + H2O2 -> HO center dot/HOO center dot + H2O) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are used for treatment of wastewater and oxidation of organic molecules and play a key role in biological oxidation systems. This study shows that Fenton chemistry can be used for generation of reactive brominating species (RBS) under neutral conditions at room temperature. The in situ RBS are successfully used for three types of oxidative bromination reactions. This green and nonacidic new method addresses the safety and environmental challenges of existing oxidative bromination methods. Additionally, this neutral Fenton-bromide system addresses the long-lasting problem of many functional haloperoxidase mimics that required strong acids for oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. This new green and mild method for generating RBS will significantly benefit the wide applications of brominated organic compounds in organic synthesis and the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

AB The sonochemical degradation of trimethoprim (TMP), a widely used antibiotic, in various water matrices was investigated. The effect of several parameters, such as initial TMP concentration (0.5-3 mg/L), actual power density (20-60 W/L), initial solution pH (3-10), inorganic ions, humic acid and water matrix on degradation kinetics was examined. The pseudo-first order degradation rate of TMP was found to increase with increasing power density and decreasing pH, water complexity (ultrapure water > bottled water > secondary wastewater) and initial TMP concentration.
   TMP degradation is accompanied by the formation of several transformation products (TPs) as evidenced by LC-QToF-MS analysis. Nine such TPs were successfully identified and their time-trend profiles during degradation were followed. An in silico toxicity evaluation was performed showing that several TPs could potentially be more toxic than the parent compound towards Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.

AB A novel photo-Fenton catalytic system for the removal of organic pollutants was presented, including the use of photo-Fenton process and a submerged magnetic separation membrane photocatalytic reactor (SMSMPR). We synthesized TiO2-Fe3O4 composites as the photocatalyst and made full use of the magnetism of the photocatalyst to realize the recollection of the catalyst from the medium, which is critical to the commercialization of photocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment. The photo-Fenton performance of TiO2-Fe3O4 is evaluated with amoxicillin trihydrate (AMX) as a target pollutant. The results indicate that the TiO2-Fe3O4/H2O2 oxidation system shows efficient degradation of AMX. Fe3O4 could not only enhance the heterogeneous Fenton degradation of organic compounds but also allow the photocatalyst to be magnetically separated from treated water. After four reaction cycles, the TiO2-Fe3O4 composites still exhibit 85.2% removal efficiency of AMX and show excellent recovery properties. Accordingly, the SMSMPR with the TiO2-Fe3O4 composite is a promising way for removing organic pollutants.

ID SIMULATION
AB Fluidized beds with circulating flow, as the gas-solid contactors, are widely used in physical and chemical processes such as drying of solids, pharmaceutical industries, coating solids, granulation, and water and wastewater treatment industry. In this study, numerical simulation using FLUENT software was conducted to investigate the distribution of solid particles of fluidized beds with circulating flow. To conduct simulation, Eulerian-Eulerian with the help of kinetic theory of granular flow was used. Various values of particle-wall elastic modulus were studied. After selecting the appropriate model to predict the particles flow behavior, ozone decomposition reaction was carried out in fluidized beds with circulating flow and they were solved by FLUENT software. The results showed that the location of ring baffles has the greatest impact on fluctuation of system pressure drop, and adverse mix of gas and increase of solid materials are tangible by baffles, resulting from regulation of bed and accumulation of circulating particles beside the wall.

AB Sertraline ("Zoloft") is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) suspected of causing developmental abnormalities in some aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. SSRIs have been detected downstream from wastewater treatment plants, but the risks associated with environmental exposure have not been well documented. We tested the effects of sertraline on development of Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) larvae. Tadpoles hatched from wild-collected egg masses were exposed to concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mu g/L of sertraline through metamorphosis. We tracked tadpole development using image analysis (452 digital images) to estimate mass periodically during the tadpole stage, and we also recorded mass at metamorphosis. Time to metamorphosis did not differ between treatments, but sertraline-exposed tadpoles grew less when raised among conspecifics. However, this effect was not detected when the study was repeated with tadpoles raised individually. This indicates that the effects of sertraline and other SSRIs may be enhanced when tadpoles are raised under more stressful conditions.

AB Adsorption-assisted photocatalysis is a new approach to control water pollution. A novel metal organic framework MIL 53(Fe-Cu) was formulated via a single-step solvothermal route. The newly developed MOF was successfully utilized to treat pharmaceutical waste-containing effluent using a combined mechanism of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The in-depth characterization of the MOF ensured its favorable physicochemical properties such as high surface area, porous nature, favorable functional groups on its surface, thermal stability and photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, PL spectroscopy proved that MIL 53(Fe-Cu) offers a reduced rate of electron-hole recombination. The newly developed MOF presented the highest adsorption uptake of 190.40 mg g(-1) for ciprofloxacin and a maximum degradation of 74.48 and 57.88% in the presence of UV and visible radiations, respectively. This experimental investigation confirms that novel MIL 53(Fe-Cu) outperforms the traditional materials in treating the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Over the past decades, soluble compounds with iron in high oxidation state(s) (so-called ferrates) have turned out to be a highly promising and "green" oxidants deployed in water treatment technologies. Ferrates(IV, V, VI) have good oxidation properties, as indicated by the magnitude of the oxidation-reduction potential (an acidic reaction with an oxidation-reduction potential of 2.20 V, in the basic environment it is 0.72 V), making them interesting for oxidation of inorganic compounds including metals, the decomposition of broad range of organic pollutants including various types of micropollutants found in wastewater (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and drugs), and for disinfection. The important advantage of ferrates is also their minimal environmental load as the reactions result in the formation of benign iron hydroxides. The only limitation of using ferrates in practice is their demanding production as well as their instability due to the high electron affinity of hexavalent iron.

AB Although traditional water treatment systems can remove various substances from wastewater, these conventional systems fail to remove many chemical molecules that pose potential ecological and health risks. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) appear attractive to adsorption of many substances, but CNTs adsorbed with toxic substances becomes a nanocomposite still more toxic. Here, we employ zebrafish embryos as biosensor to examine how a hybrid micro/nanostructured carbonaceous material (HMNC) derived from a combination of activated carbon (AC) with hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can remediate waste-water contaminated with the pharmaceutical fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX). AC and HMNC are practically non-toxic to zebrafish embryos (LC50 > 1000 mg.L-1). HMNC addition to culture medium containing FLX significantly reduces sublethal effects and lethality. Interaction between FLX and HMNC involves chemical adsorption such that embryo co-exposure to HMNC adsorbed with FLX in the range of concentrations evaluated herein does not elicit any behavioral changes in zebrafish.

AB This study investigated the impact of sulphur content on the performance of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with an emphasis on the biological stability, contaminant removal, and membrane fouling. Removal of 38 trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) that are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater by AnMBR was evaluated. Results show that basic biological performance of AnMBR regarding biomass growth and the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was not affected by sulphur addition when the influent COD/SO42- ratio was maintained higher than 10. Nevertheless, the content of hydrogen sulphate in the produced biogas increased significantly and membrane fouling was exacerbated with sulphur addition. Moreover, the increase in sulphur content considerably affected the removal of some hydrophilic TrOCs and their residuals in the sludge phase during AnMBR operation. By contrast, no significant impact on the removal of hydrophobic TrOCs was noted with sulphur addition to AnMBR.

AB This study investigates biosorption of Oxytetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, using aerobic granular sludge as an adsorbent in aqueous solutions. A sequencing batch reactor fed by a synthetic wastewater was operated to create aerobic granular sludge. Primarily, the pore structure and surface area of granular sludge, the chemical structure and the molecular sizes of the pharmaceutical, operating conditions, such as pH, stirring rate, initial concentration of Oxytetracycline, during adsorption process was verified. Subsequently, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the adsorption were examined and adsorption isotherm studies were carried out. It was shown that the aerobic granular sludge was a good alternative for biosorption of this pharmaceutical. The pharmaceutical was adsorbed better at pH values of 6-8. The adsorption efficiency increased with rising ionic strength. Also, it was seen that the adsorption process was an exothermic process in terms of thermodynamics. The adsorption can be well explained by Langmuir isotherm model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The artificial sweetener sucralose has been detected in municipal wastewater effluent and surface waters at concentrations ranging from ng/L to low mu g/L. Few chronic ecotoxicological data are available in the peer reviewed literature with respect to sucralose. To address this data gap, 21 d Daphnia magna and 28 d Americamysis bahia (mysid shrimp) studies were conducted to assess the effects of sucralose on the survival, growth and reproduction of these organisms. Concentrations <= 1800 mg/L resulted in no statistically significant reduction in D. magna survival or reproduction. Survival, growth and reproduction of mysid shrimp were unaffected by <= 93 mg/L sucralose. The no observable effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) for the D. magna study were 1800 and >1800 mg/L, respectively. The NOEC and LOEC for the mysid study were 93 and >93 mg/L, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that the concentrations of sucralose detected in the environment are well below those required to elicit chronic effects in freshwater or marine invertebrates.

AB Diclofenac (hereafter DCF) is an extensively used anti-inflammatory drug; therefore, it is found in many sewage treatment plant effluents and it is one of the most usually reported environmental pharmaceutical contaminants. In this work, the degradation of diclofenac in pure water under UV light was studied, and the influence of some variables, such as humic acids (HA), nitrate anions (NO3-) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) on DCF photodegradation was investigated. The experimental activity was carried out in a batch reactor of 100 mL equipped with fixed UV light of 254 nm and an irradiation intensity of 400 mJ/m(2). Diclofenac initial concentration was equal to 10 mg/L in pure water, and its removal was evaluated by varying HA concentration in the range 1020 mg/L and NO3- concentration in the range 25-50 mg/L. Furthermore, the heterogeneous catalysis with TiO2 (150 mg/L) was studied. Temperature in all experiments was kept constant at 20 degrees C. Experimental results show that while HA have a significant influence on DCF photodegradation, nitrate and titanium dioxide seem to be ineffective, at least in the tested conditions. Finally, DCF photolysis modelling was carried out and a pseudo-firstorder kinetic model was used.

AB A modified version of the QuEChERS method has been evaluated for the determination of 21 pharmaceuticals and 6 personal care products (PPCPs) in drinking-water sludge samples by employing ultra high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The performance of the method was evaluated through linearity, recovery, precision (intra-day), method detection and quantification limits (MDL and MQL) and matrix effect. The calibration curves prepared in acetonitrile and in the matrix extract showed a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. MQLs values were on the ng g(-1) order of magnitude for most compounds. Recoveries between 50% and 93% were reached with RSDs lower than 10% for most compounds. Matrix effect was almost absent with values lower than 16% for 93% of the compounds. By coupling a quick and simple extraction called QuEChERS with the UPLC-MS/MS analysis, a method that is both selective and sensitive was obtained. This methodology was successfully applied to real samples and caffeine and benzophenone-3 were detected in ng g(-1) levels. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of human society entails increased industrial activity and consequently the release of a large number of chemical substances including solvents, detergents and pharmaceutical products which reach water bodies through the discharge of industrial effluents, damaging the organisms living in these ecosystems. This study aimed to determine oxidative stress induced on the common carp Cyprinus carpio by effluent from a pharmaceutical plant that manufactures nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The median lethal concentration and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed to the latter value (0.1173 %) for different exposure periods (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h), and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P<0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC particularly in gill of effluent-exposed specimens. SOD, CAT and GPx activity in gill also increased with respect to the control group. This particular industrial effluent is therefore concluded to induce oxidative stress on C. carpio, this damage being most evident in gill.

AB The number of anthropogenic compounds that occur in aquatic ecosystems today is in the thousands, many at trace concentrations. One group of compounds that has captured the interest of both the scientific community and the general public is pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), for example, hormones, chemotherapy drugs, antihistamines, stimulants, antimicrobials and various cosmetic additives. Toxicology of some PPCPs is currently understood, but their effect on ecological structure and function of aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. We review sources and fates of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems and discuss how methods developed to study aquatic ecosystem ecology can contribute to our understanding of the influence of PPCPs on aquatic ecosystems. We argue that aquatic ecology has a well-developed tool kit for measuring the transformation, fate, and transport of solutes using assays and experiments and that these methods could be employed to investigate how PPCPs impact ecological function. We discuss the details of these approaches and conclude that application of existing ecological methods to the study of this issue could substantially improve our understanding of the effect of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems.

AB In the present study, a multi-residue method based on a bag-solid phase extraction (bag-SPE) technique was evaluated for determination of 10 pharmaceuticals in surface water close to the effluent of a sewage treatment plant (STP) and along a coastal gradient from a STP effluent.
   The 10 compounds selected were caffeine, atenolol, metoprolol, oxazepam, carbamazepine, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and gemfibrozil. All analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry. The detection limits (LOD) ranged from 1.0 to 13 ng L-1. The method showed linear concentration ranges from 25 to 800 ng L-1 with regression coefficients (R-2) better than 0.9801. The recoveries of the selected analytes ranged from 11 to 65% with relative standard deviations (RSD) of <16% and inter-day variations of less than 18%. Isotopically labeled surrogate standards were used to compensate for sampling losses and matrix effects.
   Four of the selected 10 pharmaceuticals (caffeine, metoprolol, oxazepam and carbamazepine) were quantified, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 210 ng L-1 (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This opinion paper assesses for the UK, whether the current use of cytotoxic drugs, one of the most toxic pharmaceuticals in common use, could pose a risk to aquatic organisms and to humans through water recycling. A water quality model was set up for one of these drugs, 5-fluorouracil, in the Aire and Calder catchment in Northern UK. The study predicts 5-50 ng/L concentrations for long stretches of this catchment under tow flow conditions. Due to their mode of action, practically all. eukaryotic organisms are vulnerable to damage, with teratogenicity being the greatest concern at such levels. However, it is unclear to what extent the predicted low concentrations would affect flora and fauna in receiving waters but there may be an additive effect of a mixture of cytotoxic drugs which should be taken into account. The exposure of the pregnant mother, or more specifically her foetus, to these drugs via drinking water should be minimised. Current drinking water purification technology gives grounds for optimism on removal of these compounds, but no appropriate data exist yet. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of selected pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, carbamazepme and sulfamethoxazole) by chemical coagulation was studied. Jar test experiments were done in MilliQ water, in lake water and in commercial humic acid solutions using aluminium (pH 6) and ferric sulphate (pH 4.5). The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the studied water samples were determined by HPLC analysis and UV detection. In MilliQ water coagulation, the pharmaceuticals were poorly removed (<10%) with the exception of diclofenac, which was removed up to 66% with ferric sulphate. This compound was also the only pharmaceutical removed (30%) during the lake water coagulation with ferric sulphate. In the presence of dissolved humic matter, diclofenac as well as ibuprofen and bezafibrate could be removed by ferric sulphate coagulation. The removal of diclofenac reached a maximum of 77% while 50% of ibuprofen and 365 of bezafibrate were removed. Hence, a high amount of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter enhanced the removal of ionisable pharmaceuticals. The non-ionisable compounds, carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, were not affected by the coagulation processes studied. Although conditions such as high humic material content, low coagulation pH and ferric coagulant increase the removal of certain ionic pharmaceuticals, it can be concluded that by coagulation it is not possible to entirely remove pharmaceuticals from water.

AB Medical substances (pharmaceuticals) are a group of substances that until recently have been exposed to the environment with very little attention. The reason why they may be interesting as environmental micropollutants, is that medical substances are developed with the intention of performing a biological effect. Especially antibiotics used as growth promoters, as feed additives in fish farms are anticipated to end up in the environment. Very little is known about the exposure routes of the medical substances to the environment. Only few investigations have reported findings of medical substances in other field samples than sediment or treated waste water samples. Several substances seem to be persistent in the environment. This paper outlines the different anticipated exposure routes to the environment, summarises the legislation on the subject and gives an outline of present knowledge of occurrence, fate and effect on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments of medical substances. Present knowledge does not reveal if regular therapeutic use may be the source of a substance carried by sewage effluent into the aquatic system even though clofibrate, a lipid lowering agent, has been identified in ground and tap water samples from Berlin. Further research would be necessary to assess the environmental risk involved in exposing medical substances and metabolites to the environment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Due to their wide use, pharmaceuticals can be discarded, metabolized and excreted into the environment, potentially affecting aquatic organisms. Lipid-regulating drugs are among the most prescribed medications around the world, to control human cholesterol levels, in more than 20 million patients. Despite this massive use of lipid-regulating drugs, particularly simvastatin, the role of these drugs is not fully characterized and understood in terms of its potential toxicological effects at the environmental level. This work intended to characterize the toxicity of an acute (120 h post-fertilization) and chronic (60 days) exposure to the antihyperlipidemic drug simvastatin (in concentrations of 92.45, 184.9, 369.8, 739.6 and 1479.2 ng L-1), in the freshwater species zebrafish (Danio rerio). The concentrations hereby mentioned were implemented in both exposures, and were based on levels found in wastewater treatment plant influents (11.7 +/- 3.2 mu g L-1), effluents (2.65 +/- 0.8 mu g L-1) and Apies River (1.585 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1), located in Pretoria, South Africa and, particularly in the maximum levels found in effluents from wastewater treatment plants in Portugal (369.8 ng L-1). The acute effects were analysed focusing on behavioural endpoints (erratic and purposeful swimming), total distance travelled and swimming time), biomarkers of oxidative stress (the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), biotransformation (the activity of glutathione S-transferases) and lipid peroxidation (levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). Animals chronically exposed were also histologically analysed for sex determination and gonadal developmental stages identification. In terms of acute exposure, significant alterations were reported in terms of behavioural alterations (hyperactivity), followed by a general reduction in all tested biomarkers. Also, the analysis of chronically exposed fish evidenced no alterations in sex ratio and maturation stages. In addition, the analysis of chronically exposed fish evidenced no alterations in terms of sexual characteristics, suggesting that the chronic exposure of Danio rerio to simvastatin does not alter the sex ratio and maturation stages of individuals. This assumption suggests that simvastatin did not act as an endocrine disruptor. Moreover, the metabolism, neuronal interactions and the antioxidant properties of SIM seem to have modulated the hereby-mentioned results of toxicity. Results from this assay allow inferring that simvastatin can have an ecologically relevant impact in living organisms.

AB Environmental hazards are a consequence of the massive use of synthetic chemicals that are prevalent in nearly every aspect of modern life. The outburst of the so-called "emerging pollutants" (pharmaceuticals and pesticides among others) generates an additional problem due to the scarce available information on their impact on the environment or their interferences with the biological processes. Among them, paracetamol is one of the drugs the most widely found in hospital effluents, in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants, as well as in rivers. In this work, the feasibility of paracetamol degradation by different processes based on ultraviolet radiation is discussed: photolysis, photo-oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, photo-Fenton reaction, and heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 are evaluated. The best results are obtained with the photo Fenton process, for which more than 99% of the pharmaceutical is degraded within 5 minutes. At best experimental conditions the mineralization was superior to 75% after one hour of reaction.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a group of medications widely used by man to heal certain ailments. However, after consumption, they may be excreted in wastewaters with consequent environmental effects. NSAIDs are endocrine disruptors that can cause changes in animal physiology. The purpose of this study was to implement an analytical method that permits the determination of the presence of NSAIDs in water. Compound extraction was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using an Oasis HLB cartridge. Analytes were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The method was applied in water from the Maipo River and from a neighboring wastewater treatment plant in the Metropolitan Region of Pajaritos, Vina, Tuberia, Union and Gansos sampling points in Chile. This method turned out to be adequate for the determination of NSAIDs in water samples with recovery percentages above 80%. Naproxen and ibuprofen were mostly detected in the Maipo River water samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 0.83 mu g L-1.

AB The emerging contaminants are commonly derived from municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastewater sources and pathways. These compounds are polar and poorly biodegradable. The dynamic removal of atenolol from aqueous solutions by activated carbon in fixed bed column systems was investigated. As far as we know, this is the first study reporting the decontamination by adsorption in fixed bed of solutions containing atenolol, as model compound of beta-blockers, which are pharmaceutical pollutants with a high occurrence in natural waters. The performance of fixed bed columns was described through the breakthrough curves obtained from column experiments. The Bohart-Adams, Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were applied to predict different parameters of the column like service time (Bohart-Adams model), adsorption capacity (Thomas model) and time required for 50% breakthrough (Yoon-Nelson model). Also, the theoretical breakthrough adsorption curve has been obtained. For the last, an industrial scale adsorber was designed from characteristic parameters of the breakthrough curves obtained from experimental data.

AB Trace amounts of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters in the nano- to microgram per liter range, and in drinking water in the nanogram/L range. The environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in surface waters have been evaluated and generally found to be low if the wastewater is treated before release to the environment. The human health risks of trace amounts of pharmaceuticals in drinking water have however not been evaluated in any great depth. Preliminary screening level assessments suggest risk to be low - but the public and decision-makers are concerned and would like the matter investigated more thoroughly, especially with regards to mixture effects, chronic long-term effects and sensitive sub-populations. The World Health Organization is currently evaluating the need for credible health based guidance associated with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. The aim of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-science and the ongoing international debate on the topic.

AB The reactions of hetero-tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (H-TCAHs) with hypochlorite in an aqueous solution were investigated under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. H-TCAH-hypochlorite reaction products were determined by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses. For 20 mu M, 10H-phenothiazine, 10H-phenoxazine, and phenoxathiin reacted rapidly with active chlorine in neutral pH (7.0), but no phenazine-hypochlorite reaction was observed over pH values of 5-9 for 1 hr. The 10H-phenothiazine-hypochlorite reaction began by oxidation with active chlorine to form its dioxides, followed by chloro-substitution in water. The extent of the reactions depended on the chlorine dose, solution pH and compound structures. Ames assays for the chlorination byproducts of 10H-phenothiazine and 10H-phenoxazine also showed to be weak mutagenicity in TA98 and TA 100 strains without S9 mix, but no chlorination byproducts of phenoxathiin exhibited any mutagenicity in both tester strains with and without S9 mix.

AB Background and Objectives: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the major reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Thus, the investigation on ARB and ARGs from WWTPs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In order to uncover the resistome in a WWTP treating effluents from a pharmaceutical industry in China, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli strains were isolated and their whole genome sequences were obtained and analyzed. Moreover, metagenomic sequencing was applied to give a comprehensive view of antibiotic resistance in this WWTP.
   Methods: 18 ESBL-producing E. coli strains were isolated from a WWTP located in Taizhou, China on April, 2017. All strains were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The whole genome sequences were assembled using SPAdes software and annotated with RAST server. Sequence types (STs), plasmids, ARGs and virulence genes were predicted from the genomes using MLST, Plasmid Finder, ResFinder and Virulence Finder, respectively. Metagenomic DNA of the same sample was extracted and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform. Metagenomic sequences were assembled using SOAPdenovo software.
   Results: All 18 ESBL-producing E. coli strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, and ceftriaxone. Analysis of their genomes revealed that all strains carried beta-lactamase encoding genes and the most prevalent type was bla(CTX-M). Various virulence genes and ARGs confronting resistance to other types of antimicrobial agents were also predicted. Further investigation on the metagenomics data indicated 11 ARGs with high amino acid identities to the known ARGs. Five of these ARGs, aadA1, aac(6')-lb-cr, flo(R), sul2 and sul1, were also present in the genomes of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from the same sample.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed the resistome of a pharmaceutical WWTP by both culture-dependent and metegenomic methods. The existence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains, indicating that pharmaceutical WWTP can play a significant role in the emergence of ARB. The occurrence of ARGs annotated from the metagenomic data suggests that pharmaceutical WWTP can play a significant role in the emergence of ARGs. Our findings highlight the need for strengthening the active surveillance of ARB and ARGs from pharmaceutical industry.

AB The performance of levofloxacin (LFX) degradation in aqueous solutions in ferrous ion-activated persulfate (S2O82-/Fe2+), peroxide-activated persulfate (S2O82-/H2O2), and base-activated persulfate (S2O82-/OH-) systems was evaluated and compared. The LFX degradation by all studied activated persulfate systems was divided into two oxidation periods: a fast degradation of target compound within the first minute and subsequent gradual oxidation within the remaining reaction time. Notably, without consideration of the first minute, the rest of the LFX degradation in the S2O8 (2-)/Fe2+ and S2O82-/H2O2 system followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Among the studied activation techniques, the Fe2+-activated persulfate system demonstrated the highest efficacy in LFX degradation, mineralization and persulfate utilization, followed by the peroxide-activated persulfate oxidation. Generally, all studied sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation technologies proved to be promising tool for the treatment of LFX contaminated water/wastewater and, especially, groundwater.

ID COOLING PROCESS; LAYOUT; DECOMPOSITION
AB Vacuum distillation techniques are widely used in food, biological, pharmaceutical, and wastewater treatment industries. Because of its operation at low temperatures, vacuum distillation prevents the thermal decomposition of materials and alleviates corrosion processes; however, condenser size can be dramatically increased because of reductions in mean temperature differences under the vacuum operation. In batch vacuum distillation processes, vapor generation rate and mean temperature differences are changed with time. In view of these characteristics of batch operation, this paper suggests a novel methodology to minimize the condenser size in batch vacuum distillation processes. The target process is a sulfuric acid recycling system in semiconductor manufacturing plants. In this paper, an equation-oriented dynamic model is established and optimization problem is formulated. By solving the nonlinear programming problem, the condenser size is dramatically reduced when operation time is fixed. In contrast, operation time is greatly shortened when the installed condenser surface area is fixed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the modern pharmaceutical industry many flexible batch plants operate under an integrated business and production system, using ISA S95 and ISA S88 standards for models and terminology, and implementing flexible recipe-based production.
   In the environment of constantly changing market conditions, adjustment to surroundings is a business necessity. To support necessary production improvement, regulatory authorities have introduced the risk based approach for the control of process development, production based on the quality by design (QbD) principle, and process analytical technology (PAT).
   In this work, the method for practical implementation of an adaptable control recipe, that allows process improvement inside the previously established design space, is proposed, based on the neural network process model.
   Based on the neural network model, the three methods for recipe-controlled process improvement and optimization were introduced neural-based software sensor, generic neural model control, and process optimization using iterative dynamic programming.
   Suitability of the proposed method was tested in a mini reaction plant Chemreactor Buchi, running the wastewater treatment batch, controlled by the production recipe based on S88 standard.

AB This study investigated whether bioaugmentation improves sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation and nitrogen removal in the Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) system. The effects of the C/N ratio on SMX degradation and nitrogen removal were also evaluated. Using MBBR system operation experiments, the bioaugmented reactor was found to perform more effectively than the non-bioaugmentation reactor, with the highest SMX, nitrate-N, and ammonia-N removal efficiencies of 80.49, 94.70, and 96.09%, respectively. The changes in the sulfonamide resistance genes and bacterial communities were detected at various operating conditions. The results indicate that the diversity of the bacterial communities and the abundance of resistance genes were markedly influenced by bioaugmentation and the C/N ratio, with Achromobacter among the dominant genera in the MBBR system. The bio-toxicity of samples, calculated as the inhibition percentage (IP) toward Escherichia coli, was found to decrease to non-toxic ranges after treatment.

AB Recovering nitrogen from separately collected urine can potentially reduce costs and energy of wastewater nitrogen removal and fertilizer production. Through benchtop experiments, we demonstrate the recovery of nitrogen from urine as ammonium sulfate using electrochemical stripping, a combination of electrodialysis and membrane stripping. Nitrogen was selectively recovered with 93% efficiency in batch experiments with real urine and required 30.6 MJ kg N-1 in continuous-flow experiments (slightly less than conventional ammonia stripping). The effects of solution chemistry on nitrogen flux, electrolytic reactions, and reactions with electro-generated oxidants were evaluated using synthetic urine solutions. Fates of urine-relevant trace organic contaminants, including electrochemical oxidation and reaction with electro-generated chlorine, were investigated with a suite of common pharmaceuticals. Trace organics (<0.1 mu g L-1) and elements (<30 mu g L-1) were not detected at appreciable levels in the ammonium sulfate fertilizer product. This novel approach holds promise for selective recovery of nitrogen from concentrated liquid waste streams such as source-separated urine.

AB The effect of nitrification, nitratation and heterotrophic conditions on the biotransformation of several pharmaceuticals in a highly enriched nitrifying activated sludge was evaluated in this study by selective activation of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrifiers displayed a noticeable capacity to process ibuprofen due to hydroxylation by ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) to produce 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen. Naproxen was also biotransformed under nitrifying conditions. On the other hand, heterotrophic bacteria present in the nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) biotransformed sulfamethoxazole. In contrast, both nitrifying and heterotrophic activities were ineffective against diclofenac, diazepam, carbamazepine and trimethoprim. Similar biotransformation rates of erythromycin, roxithromycin and fluoxetine were observed under all conditions tested. Overall, results from this study give more evidence on the role of the different microbial communities present in activated sludge reactors on the biological removal of pharmaceuticals.

AB The aim of this work was to study the efficiency of ozone (O-3)/activated carbon (AC) coupling to remove metoprolol and fluoxetine. A kinetic study was performed at pH ranging from 3 to 9. Results were correctly modelled by a global first-order model (r(2)>0.99) and were compared to those obtained with the ozonation process. It was shown that O-3/AC coupling was the most efficient process. At pH 9, the degradation kinetic constant reached 0.72min(-1) with O-3/AC coupling while its maximum value was 0.34min(-1) with ozonation. In each experimental condition and for the two target compounds, this coupling allowed a fast and total pollutant removal. Moreover, its performances were not significantly influenced by the experimental conditions, contrary to the ozonation process which is strongly influenced by the pH and the nature of the pollutant. O-3/AC coupling remained efficient even if the operational parameters disfavour pollutant oxidation.

AB Fluidized beds are used for a variety of processes such as food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and energy production. Supersonic gas injection nozzles are used to grind particles in fluidized beds. For example, in the Fluid Coking process, which uses thermal cracking reactions to upgrade heavy oil, supersonic nozzles inject steam to control coke particle size. Maintaining a high attrition rate with a lower steam flowrate would reduce energy consumption, increase reactor throughput. and reduce sour wastewater production. The purpose of the present research is to study particle attrition with supersonic convergent-divergent nozzles in a fluidized bed at high temperatures, under conditions such as those encountered in the Fluid Coking process. According to the experimental results, the grinding efficiency is significantly improved by increasing fluidized bed temperature, attrition gas properties, or nozzle size. The experimental data further suggest that particle fragmentation is the dominant attrition process when using supersonic nozzles in a hot fluidized bed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tris(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were the most frequently detected organophosphates in groundwater samples. Highest individual organophosphate concentrations (>0.1 mu g L(-1)) were determined in groundwater polluted by infiltrating leachate and groundwater recharged via riverbank filtration of organophosphate-loaded recipients. In samples from springs and deep groundwater monitoring wells that are not affected by surface waters, organophosphate concentrations were mostly below the limit of detection. The occurrence (3-9 ng L(-1)) of TCPP and TCEP in samples from aquifers with groundwater ages between 20 and 45 years indicates the persistence of both compounds within the aquifer. At urban sites organophosphate-loaded precipitation, surface runoff, and leakage of wastewater influenced groundwater quality. For rural sites, where groundwater recharge is only influenced by precipitation, organophosphates were very rarely detectable in groundwater.

AB The occurrence of trace organic contaminants in drinking water supplies, wastewater effluents and the environment is amplifying interest in membrane treatment methods due to the removal of a wide variety of organic solutes. During operation, organic matter present in source water accumulates at a membrane's surface. This fouling layer could potentially influence the degree of removal of dissolved constituents including organic contaminants of concern. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of organic matter fouling on membrane characteristics and the rejection of non-ionic organic solutes.
   Three nanofiltration membranes (NF-90, TFC-S, and NF-270) were fouled with microfiltered secondary-treated wastewater effluent at bench-scale under constant-flux filtration. The membranes were characterized prior-to and after fouling in terms of surface charge, hydrophobicity, effective pore size distribution, and phenomenological model coefficients. Rejection experiments were subsequently conducted with eight non-ionic trace organic contaminants of varying size to determine how membrane fouling affects the rejection of environmentally relevant organic contaminants.
   The effect of membrane fouling was found to be dependent upon the membrane evaluated. Membrane fouling resulted in an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge for the TFC-S and NF-270 membranes, while the hydrophobicity decreased and surface charge increased for the NF-90 membrane. The effective pore size of the NF-90 membrane became slightly smaller with a larger deviation of pore sizes indicating that fouling affected the sieving mechanism of the membrane. However, the calculated effective pore size of the NF-270 membrane increased as characterization compound rejection was generally lower for the fouled membrane, which may be explained by cake-enhanced concentration polarization. The rejection of the non-ionic organic contaminants investigated by the NF-90 membrane was greater than 80% and was relatively unaffected by organic fouling. The NF-270 membrane provided variable rejection of the non-ionic organic contaminants and had markedly lower rejection for acetaminophen, bisphenol-A, and phenacetin after membrane fouling with effluent organic matter. Examination of rejection using the phenomenological model had advantages over examining rejection at a particular permeate flux, particularly, that rejection over a wide range of permeate flux (where rejection is variable) could be characterized by two model parameters.

AB Stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas can carry hazardous pollutants directly into aquatic ecosystems. These pollutants, such as metals, nutrients, aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, are very toxic to aquatic organisms. Recently, significant amounts of zinc oxide engineered nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have been detected in urban stormwater and its bioretention systems. This raises concerns about a potential increase of stormwater toxicity and reduced performance of the treatment infrastructures. To tackle these issues, we developed a simple, low-cost bioretention system to remediate stormwater and retain ZnO-NPs. This system retained up to 73% Zn, 66% Cu, and >99% Pb. However, the removal efficiency for Pb was lower after adding ZnO-NPs to the system, possibly due to the remobilization of Pb phosphates. The effect of ZnO-NPs on stormwater toxicity and metal accumulation in wetland plants was also evaluated.

AB Chitosan-glyoxal/Polyvinylpyrrolidone/MoS2 (CSG/PVP/MoS2) nanocomposites were synthesized via hydrothermal-ultrasonic method. The CSG/PVP/MoS2 nano catalyst was characterized by XRD, UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and diclofenac was used for the adsorption and photo-degradation test. SEM revealed the CSG/PVP/MoS2 nanocomposite has coarse and semi-flake structure and UV-vis absorbance spectra indicated its strong UV light response. Additionally, the CSG/PVP/MoS2 presents enhanced adsorption-photocatalytic activities in comparison to CSG/PVP, and the degradation was reaching 94.5%. Kinetic study results demonstrated that the diclofenac photo-degradation could be explained by pseudo-first-order model. The material may have great potential in wastewater treatment applications. The synthesized nanomaterials were tested for their antibacterial properties against microorganisms Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antimicrobial property CSG/PVP/MoS2 nanocomposite was observed with a maximum of zone inhibition. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Acute and chronic effect as well as biodegradation potential at different sludge retention times (SRTs) of a priority pollutant, diclofenac on denitrification process was assessed. The continuous amendment of the culture for 6 months with 1 mu g/L diclofenac resulted in 30% decrease in gas production. The average diclofenac removal observed in the diclofenac-acclimated culture was less than 15%. Batch tests showed that nitrate was removed in diclofenac free-control reactor at a higher rate compared to diclofenac amended reactor. Although, SRT did not have any progressive effect on diclofenac degradation, the system operated at low SRT was more sensitive to diclofenac and resulted in an increase in N2O emission. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operated at higher SRTs may tolerate and recover from the adverse effects of such micropollutants. The study can lead to other researchers to understand the fate and effect of other emerging pollutants in the anoxic unit of WWTPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUNDSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline is found to be one of the most persistent pharmaceutical drugs and it has been detected in effluents from wastewater treatment plants. This work evaluates the feasibility of homogeneous solar photo-Fenton oxidation for treating aqueous solutions containing sertraline.
   RESULTSThe influence of iron and H2O2 dosages was studied in order to optimize the reagents consumption. The beneficial role of simulated solar irradiation was noticeable and sertraline was readily oxidized; TOC removal up to 90% was achieved at a hydrogen peroxide dose as low as 40% of the stoichiometric amount for mineralization. Dechlorination was the first step of the proposed reaction pathway giving rise to the formation of by-products of much lower toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONSSolar simulated photo-Fenton allowed reduction of the doses of iron and H2O2 needed, and therefore the main operating cost associated with this process, without compromising the quality of the effluent in terms of ecotoxicity. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB To characterize a broad range of organic contaminants and their transformation products (TPs) as well as their loads, input pathways and fate in the water cycle, the Department of Environmental Chemistry (Uchem) at Eawag applies and develops high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) methods combined with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). In this article, the background and state-of-the-art of LC-HRMS/MS for detection of i) known targets, ii) suspected compounds like TPs, and iii) unknown emerging compounds are introduced briefly. Examples for each approach are taken from recent research projects conducted within the department. These include the detection of trace organic contaminants and their TPs in wastewater, pesticides and their TPs in surface water, identification of new TPs in laboratory degradation studies and ozonation experiments and finally the screening for unknown compounds in the catchment of the river Rhine.

AB The presence of substances of emerging concern-pharmaceuticals-in marine environments has been studied to a lesser extent compared to fresh and wastewaters. This is the first study of pharmaceutical distribution in the Russian part of the Baltic Sea. Among 18 pharmaceuticals previously detected in influent waters of Saint-Petersburg WWTPs, 7 compounds (caffeine [81% of samples], carbamazepine [81%], ketoprofen [60%], diclofenac [23 %], ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, and clarithromycin) were recorded in seawater samples in a range of measured concentrations from 0.1 to 4452 ng L-1. Antibiotics were presented in trace concentrations. In sediment samples, 6 pharmaceuticals (0.1-66.2 ng g(-1)) were detected. The most common was carbamazepine (80%). The remaining compounds were located in decreasing frequency as follows: ketoprofen, trimethoprim, drotaverine, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. Some specific features of the Gulf of Finland affecting the distribution of pharmaceutical concentrations were highlighted-among the most important, the megapolis of St. Petersburg with its population over 5 million and freshwater input by the Neva River (high urbanization of the territory with a potent dilution factor). We discussed the suitable set of anthropogenic markers for the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland.

AB In this study, the specific surface area, pore structure, surface functional groups and microstructure of the biochar derived from the pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge are analyzed. The results showed that the pyrolysis temperature had a great influence on the properties of sludge-based biochar (SBB), and the specific surface area of the SBB first increased and then decreased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. The maximum specific surface area was 214.97 m(2)/g at 600 degrees C, while the pore volume increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. The pickling process removed impurities in the SBB and increased the specific surface area of the material (319.80 m(2)/g). The effects of pyrolysis temperature, pH, adsorption time, and initial pollutant concentration on the adsorption process were also studied. The results showed that the adsorbents had good pH adaptability, and biochar produced at 600 degrees C had the best adsorption capacity (94.69 mg/g). Pickling increased the adsorption capacity to 157.38 mg/g. The results showed that pharmaceutical sludge has great potential as a raw material for the preparation of adsorbent. These benefits can compensate for the cost of sludge pyrolysis treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac is one of the most widely prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs worldwide. It is frequently detected in surface waters; however, whether this pharmaceutical poses a risk to aquatic organisms is debated. Here we quantified the uptake of diclofenac by the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) following aqueous exposure (0.2-25.0 mu g L-1) for 21 days, and evaluated the tissue and biomolecular responses in the kidney. Diclofenac accumulated in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in the plasma of exposed fish. The highest plasma concentration observed (for fish exposed to 25 mu g L-1 diclofenac) was within the therapeutic range for humans. There was a strong positive correlation between exposure concentration and the number of developing nephrons observed in the posterior kidney. Diclofenac was not found to modulate the expression of genes in the kidney associated with its primary mode of action in mammals (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases) but modulated genes associated with kidney repair and regeneration. There were no significant adverse effects following 21 days exposure to concentrations typical of surface waters. The combination of diclofenac's uptake potential, effects on kidney nephrons and relatively small safety margin for some surface waters may warrant a longer term chronic health effects analysis for diclofenac in fish.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has been of increasing concern around the world due to their ability to alter the structure of microbial communities and to promote the development of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Six major rivers in Central Taiwan were investigated for the occurrence of the eight most frequently prescribed quinolone and imidazole antibiotics using solid-phase extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Nalidixic acid, flumequine, ofloxacin, dimetridazole, and metronidazole were detected at 0.8-192ng/L in the water samples. The three most frequently detected antibiotics at all sampling sites were metronidazole, nalidixic acid, and flumequine (detection frequency (n=24) 19 sites). The highest concentration of flumequine was detected at 192 +/- 6.5ng/L in the Old Zhuoshui River. Compared to the available predicted no-effect concentration data, the risk quotients of flumequine and ofloxacin were estimated to be close to one. The Old Zhuoshui and Beigang Rivers were shown to be the two most contaminated rivers with the nearby animal husbandries being the important source of contamination. The information provided here warrants future attention and is useful for the development of regulation and remediation strategies.

AB In order to elucidate the capability of biomass developed in membrane bioreactors (MBR) to degrade and sorb emerging micropollutants, biodegradation (k(biol)) and sorption (k(sor)) kinetic constants as well as solid-liquid partition coefficients (K-d) of 13 selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were determined with MBR heterotrophic biomass adding a pulse (100 ppb of each compound) and following the liquid and solid phase concentrations over time. The results obtained were compared to literature data referring to conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems. Two experiments were performed: one in the MBR itself and the second one in a batch reactor with the same type and concentration of biomass as in the MBR. Overall, both biodegradation and sorption coefficients were in the same range as previously reported by other studies in CAS systems, indicating that MBR biomass does not show better capabilities for the biological degradation and/or sorption of PPCPs compared to the biomass developed in CAS reactors. Therefore, the higher PPCPs removal efficiencies found in MBRs are explained by the high biomass concentrations obtained at the long sludge retention times at which this type of reactors are usually operated.

AB This study focused on the degradation of the worldwide Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IBP) by gamma irradiation. Factors affecting IBP degradation efficiency were examined. The results showed that IBP concentration decreased with an increasing absorbed dose. When IBP concentration of 28.3 mg/L and an absorbed dose of 1.1 kGy were chosen, IBP degradation value was 100%. The degradation process of IBP could be depicted by first order reaction kinetics when the absorbed dose was less than 0.9 kGy. 0.1% H2O2 and humic acid additives enhanced IBP degradation process, while 0.5% H2O2 additive restrained the degradation of IBP. The additions of CO32-, NO3-, CH3OH and thiourea restrained the degradation process. The pH value affected the IBP degradation. The degradation efficiency was more efficient under acidic condition than in neutral or alkaline media. The solution pH value became lower with increasing absorbed dose after gamma irradiation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESMS) techniques were employed to identify the IBP derivatives. The mono- and quadric-hydroxylated of IBP and the products due to the oxidation of propanoic acid, and isobutyl substituents of IBP were identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Co-adsorption of norfloxacin (Nor) and Cu(II) on montmorillonite at pH 4.5, 7.0 and 9.0 was studied by integrated batch adsorption experiments and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Under such pH conditions the dominant species of Nor are cation (Nor(+)), zwitterion (Nor(+/-)), and anion (Nor(-)), respectively. Results indicated that Nor sorption decreased with an increase of solution pH. The presence of Cu(II) slightly suppressed the Nor(+) sorption at pH 4.5, while increased Nor(+/-) and Nor(-)sorption on montmorillonite at pH 7.0 and 9.0, respectively. In contrast, Nor increased Cu(II) adsorption at pH 4.5, but had little effect on the adsorption of Cu(II) on montmorillonite at pH 7.0 and 9.0. Spectroscopic results showed that, at pH 4.5, Nor(+) was sorbed on montmorillonite by the formation of outer-sphere montmorillonite-Nor-Cu(II) ternary surface complex. At pH 7.0, montmorillonite-Nor-Cu(II) and montmorillonite-Cu(II)-Nor ternary surface complexes co-exist. At pH 9.0, montmorillonite-Cu(II)-Nor ternary surface complex was likely formed, which was different to Cu(II)(Nor)(2) precipitate of the solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate both acute and chronic effects of clofibrate and clofibric acid on the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) of the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). AChE. commonly used as a biomarker of neurotoxicity, was determined in the total head. LDH, an important enzyme of anaerobic metabolism, was quantified in dorsal muscle, and CAT, enzyme which has been used as indicative parameter of peroxisome proliferation, was determined in the liver. Furthermore, alterations of body and liver weight were also deter-mined, through the calculation of the ratios final body weight/initial body weight, liver weight/final body weight, liver weight/gills weight and liver weight/head weight. Acute exposure of G. holbrooki to both clofibrate and clofibric acid induced a decrease in liver CAT activity, an increase in muscle LDH activity, while no effects were observed on AChE activity. However, chronic exposure did not alter significantly the enzymatic activities, suggesting reduced or null effects over these pathways, relative to effects reported in other species. No effects were observed for the calculated ratios, except a significant weight reduction for males chronically exposed to clofibrate. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The combined effects of erythromycin-tetracycline-sulfamethoxazole (ETS) and sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST) antibiotics on the performance of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors were studied. A control reactor was fed with wastewater that was free of antibiotics, while two additional reactors were fed with ETS and ST. The way in which the ETS and ST mixtures impact COD removal, VFA production, antibiotic degradation, biogas production and composition were investigated. The effects of the ETS mixtures were different from the ST mixtures, erythromycin can have an antagonistic effect on sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. The anaerobic pre-treatment of these antibiotics can represent a suitable alternative to the use of chemical treatments for concentrations at 10 mg/L of S and 1 mg/L of T; 2 mg/L of E, 2 mg/L of T and 20 mg/L of S for the ST and ETS reactors respectively, which corresponds to min 70% COD removal efficiency.

AB The uptake and metabolism of anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) was studied by exposing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to DCF intraperitoneally, and via water at concentration of 1.7 mu g L-1. The bile was collected and the formed metabolites were identified. The identification was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by an ion trap mass analyzer. The main metabolites found were acyl glucuronides of hydroxylated DCFs. In addition, one ether glucuronide of hydroxylated DCF was found. Also, unmetabolized DCF was detected in the bile. The total bioconcentration factors (BCFtotal-bile for DCF and its metabolites) in rainbow trout bile, varied between individuals and was roughly estimated to range from 320 to 950. These findings suggest that fish living downstream the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and which are chronically exposed to the drug may accumulate the drug and its metabolites in the bile.

AB Background The anti-diabetic pharmaceutical metformin is frequently analysed in the aquatic environment. Its impact on the fish microbiome is studied to get a deeper knowledge about the consequence of the metformin presence in river systems. Gut microbiome analyses were performed on larval brown trout with metformin including environmental concentrations. Therefore, the fish were exposed to metformin in concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L. Especially, the lower metformin concentrations were measured in river waters containing percentages of conditioned wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Results Two complementary molecular biological methods for population analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene regions V1-V3, i.e.: (1) 16S amplicon sequencing and (2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both analyses demonstrated significant microbiome alterations even at low metformin concentrations being analysed in German rivers. The amplicon sequencing revealed the most distinct shifts in the Firmicutes phylum, or more specifically, within the Bacillales order, which were most affected by metformin exposure. Within the Bacillales order, the Planococcaceae family, which is described to provide essential amino acids for the fish, completely disappeared after metformin treatment. Conversely, the percentage of other bacteria, such as Staphylococcaceae, increased after exposure to metformin. Similarity profiles of the microbiomes could be generated using the Sorensen index calculation after PCR-DGGE analyses and confirmed shifts in the composition of the brown trout intestinal microbiome after metformin exposures. In vitro gene expression analyses of virulence factors from fish pathogens, previously identified in the fish microbiomes DNA extracts, were conducted in the presence or absence of environmentally relevant concentrations. Here, marker genes of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila were detected and quantified via PCR approaches, firstly. An increased expression of the species-specific virulence genes was observed after normalisation with control data and ribosomal housekeeping genes. Conclusion Environmentally relevant concentrations of metformin can alter the composition in gut microbiome of brown trout in different ways. Both, the metformin-induced expression of virulence genes in fish pathogens in vitro and the impact of metformin on the microbiome composition in vivo in larval brown trout open the discussion about a possible long-term effect on the vitality, growth, and development in more mature brown trouts.

AB Cocoon cooking wastewater contains waste silkworm proteins including sericin, which is a valuable raw material for many industries including cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Sericin can be recovered via nanofiltration (NF) with high efficiency; however the process conditions need to be optimized to maximize separation. In this study, the effect of solution pH on NF performance was investigated for separation of silkworm proteins towards sericin enrichment. Solution pH (3.5-9.0) slightly influenced sericin rejection, which was higher than 80% in all cases. On the other hand, solution pH significantly influenced transmission of contaminant proteins, which was highest (0.52) at pH 3.5 and lowest (0.06) at pH 9.0. Increased transmission of contaminant proteins at acidic pH was attributed to possible effects of concentration polarization and increased ionic strength. Although acidic conditions (pH 4.5) favored sericin enrichment, the instantaneous purity of sericin in the retentate remained at 0.48-0.52 at pH 3.5-9.0. Furthermore, working at acidic pH caused severe fouling problems; more than threefold increase occurred in flux decline; with an increase of flux decline from 20% to 69% and fouling resistance from 3.8 x 10(13) m(-1) to 15.5 x 10(13) m(-1) (almost fourfold) when pH was reduced from 6.4 to 4.5. The contribution of fouling resistance to total resistance increased from 32-40% (pH 6.4) to 70% and 53% in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Concentrating the wastewater at pH 4.5 had adverse impacts on rejection performance of NF membrane; rejection of sericin and contaminant proteins decreased from 78% to 52% and from 33% to 9%, respectively, as volume reduction factor increased from 1.00 to 1.70. Correspondingly, sericin purity in the retentate decreased from 0.59 to 0.55. The pH adjustment had no benefit for separation of sericin from contaminant proteins, and hence it was decided not to apply pH adjustment in NF stage. Instead, a two-stage process, NF (at original pH of 6.4) plus ethanol-induced precipitation were adopted, which enabled enrichment of sericin 1 from 80.0% to 92.9%. The product was considered to be of high quality as it contained greater than 90% sericin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is hindered by uncertainties in system reliability, resilience and management associated with coupled biological and physical processes. To better understand how shallow unit process open-water wetlands self-colonize and evolve, we analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation. Our analysis was conducted across three parallel demonstration-scale (7500 m(2)) cells located within the Prado Constructed Wetlands in Southern California. They received water from the Santa Ana River (5.9 +/- 0.2 mg/L NO3-N), a water body where the flow is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from May to November. Phylogenetic inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial community facilitated early colonization. After approximately nine months of operation, coinciding with late summer, an anaerobic community emerged with the capability for nitrate attenuation. Varying the hydraulic residence time (HRT) from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the cells. The community that established at this time was comparatively stable for the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously formed approximately 550 km (350 miles) away in a pilot-scale (400 m(2)) wetland in Northern California. That system received denitrified (20.7 +/- 0.7 mg/L NO3-N), secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation. Establishment of a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50% of the analyzed bacterial sequences shared between the two sites. Additionally the same species of diatom, Stauirsa construens var. venter, was prolific in both systems as the putative dominant primary producer. Our results indicate that despite differences in scale, geographic location and source waters, the shallow open water wetland design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and functionality associated with the self-colonizing benthic biomat This resulting biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as HRT further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession.

AB This study is focused on the fouling of flat-sheet and hollow-fiber membranes in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). A comprehensive investigation including scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), zeta potential, optical profilometer and contact angle, and flux modelling was presented in this study. The effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulated on cake-layer were also considered. The cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane formed much more than that on the hollow-fiber membrane. The thickness of cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane was effectively decreased by physical stripping. However, proteins indicating structures of Amide I and Amide II, and carbohydrates were observed on the stripped hollow-fiber membrane. According to the flux modelling results, the cake-layer formation and intermediate-adsorption were found as effective mechanisms on both membranes. Especially, these mechanisms were more effective for the hollow-fiber membrane due to irreversible fouling.

AB With the recent emergence of endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs) as an important potable drinking water and reclaimed wastewater quality issue, our study has investigated the removal of EDC/PPCP`s of 27 compounds by nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes from various drinking water sources using a dead-end stirred-cell filtration system. Experiments were performed at environmentally relevant initial EDC/PPCP concentrations ranging typically from 2 to < 150 ng/L. EDC/PPCP retention was quantified by liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. We have observed a general separation trend due to hydrophobic adsorption as a function of octanol-water partition coefficient between the hydrophobic compounds and porous hydrophobic membrane during the membrane filtration. The results have showed that both hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion mechanisms are dominant to retain EDC/PPCP for the NF membrane, while the UF membrane retained typically hydrophobic EDC/PPCPs due mainly to hydrophobic adsorption.

AB A series of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes based on mixed matrix of chromium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3-Cr) photocatalyst and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) were systematically prepared by non-solvent induced phase inversion technique. Porous PVDF membrane and mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporated with 3-10 wt% SrTiO3-Cr were produced in the UF range using polyethylene glycol as a porogen additive. The crystal morphology and electronic property of as-synthesized Cr-doped SrTiO3 nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and UV-Vis DRS. We found that the SrTiO3-Cr nanoparticles are cubic perovskite structure of approximately 30-40 nm in size with a low band gap energy of 2.05 eV. The morphology, surface roughness, hydrophilicity and textural properties of SrTiO3-Cr/PVDF MMMs were comprehensively characterized using field emission-scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, sessile drop technique, and capillary flow porometer. The SrTiO3-Cr was observed to be homogeneously dispersed in all the MMMs and provided additional anti-fouling properties from Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein. The membrane UF property and tri-cycling performance were evaluated under three distinct protocols in (1) Dark, (2) constant UVA exposure, and (3) UVA during post-treatment clean only. By increasing the SrTiO3-Cr concentration, the MMMs displayed an improved homogeneity and macropore distribution with enhanced water permeability given by 51-110 LMH bar(-1) pure water flux and 37 to 45 LMH bar(-1) BSA water flux in the Dark. A consistently high BSA rejection of 95% and an improved anti-fouling property under constant UVA irradiation were achieved due to a combination of photo-induced hydrophilic and photocatalytic effect. Also, a significant improvement in UF performance in terms of membrane flux recovery was observed in the 3rd protocol signifying that the effect of protein fouling on membrane filtration was further reduced due to a lower degree of BSA fragment deposition in the membrane pores. The findings in this study dramatically lower the operational constraints (transmembrane pressure, membrane cleaning, use of UVA) in the protein filtration process and offer an innovative membrane material for the research of photo-induced, anti-fouling membranes for protein separation applications.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are released into the environment by domestic, hospital, and pharmaceutical industry wastewaters. Conventional wastewater treatment technology does not guarantee effluents of high quality, and apparently clean water may be loaded with pollutants. In this study, we assess the performance and efficiency of free and immobilised cells of microalgaeNannochloropsissp. in removing four pharmaceuticals, chosen for their occurrence or persistence in the environment. These are paracetamol, ibuprofen, olanzapine and simvastatin. The results showed that free microalgae cells remain alive for a longer time than the immobilised ones, suggesting the inhibition of cell proliferation by the polymeric matrix polyvinyl alcohol. Both cells, free and immobilised, respond differently to each pharmaceutical. The removal of paracetamol and ibuprofen byNannochloropsissp., after 24 h of culture, was significantly higher in immobilised cells. Free cells removed a significantly higher concentration of olanzapine than immobilised ones, suggesting a higher affinity to this molecule than to paracetamol and ibuprofen. The results demonstrate the effectiveness ofNannochloropsissp. free cells for removing olanzapine andNannochloropsissp. immobilised cells for removing paracetamol and ibuprofen.

AB The use of iron-based nanomaterials for environmental remediation processes has recently received considerable attention. Here, we employed core-shell magnetite-humic acids nanoparticles as a heterogeneous photosensitizer and iron source in photo-Fenton reaction for the degradation of the psychiatric drug carbamazepine (CBZ). CBZ showed low photodegradation rates in the presence of the magnetic nanoparticles, whereas the addition of hydrogen peroxide at pH = 3 to the system drastically increased the abatement of the contaminant. The measured Fe2+ and Fe3+ profiles point to the generation of Fe3+ at the surface of the nanoparticles, indicating a heterogeneous oxidation of the contaminant mediated by hydroxyl radicals. Products with a higher transformation degree were observed in the photo-Fenton procedure and support the attack of the HO center dot radical on the CBZ molecule. Promising results encourage the use of the nanoparticles as efficient iron sources with enhanced magnet-sensitive properties, suitable for applications in photo-Fenton treatments for the purification of wastewater.

AB The main objective of this work is the modelling and optimization of antidepressant drug fluoxetine degradation in aqueous solution by ozone/H2O2 process using central composite design. The operational parameters were ozone concentration, initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, reaction time and initial fluoxetine concentration. A good agreement between the predicted values of fluoxetine removal and experimental results were observed (R-2 = 0.976 and Adj-R-2 = 0.955). Pareto analysis indicated that all selected factors and some interactions were effective on the removal efficiency. It was found that the reaction time is the most effective parameter in the ozone/H2O2 process. The maximum removal efficiency (86.14%) was achieved at ozone concentration of 30 mg L-1, initial H2O2 concentration of 0.02 mM, reaction time of 20 min and initial fluoxetine concentration of 50 mg L-1 as the optimum conditions.

AB Granular mesoporous silica SBA-15 (GMS) synthesized by a new and facile one step method was investigated to remove a series of pharmaceutical compounds from aqueous solutions. Characterization results obtained from TEM, XRD, and surface and porosity analyzer reveal that GMS synthesized by using inorganic and organic binder has similar pore properties with the powder-type mesoporous silica SBA-15 and does not severely reduce the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume by preventing destruction of the pores after granulation step through new synthesis method. Evaluation of GMS as an adsorbent based on adsorption kinetic, isotherm, and effect of pH shows the great adsorption capacity for selected 12 selected pharmaceuticals removal in aqueous solution. In addition, the adsorption and regeneration efficiency of GMS was maintained for given adsorption-regeneration cycles. Moreover, the column experiment to remove pharmaceuticals in industrial pharmaceutical wastewater revealed that GMS has a great potential for its real field application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent studies have identified the occurrence of a vast number of pharmaceuticals into the municipal wastewater through excreted urine and feces. Some of these pharmaceutical compounds are degraded in the environment. However, there have been reports on the presence of pharmaceutical active compounds in drinking water. Concerns have been raised over the potential adverse effects of these pharmaceuticals on public health and the aquatic environment. In order to investigate the removal process of pharmaceutical enrofloxacin, a unit consisting of a structured packing rotating biological contactor (spRBC) was designed and constructed as a biological treatment unit. The removal rate reached a maximum of 70% in this biological unit. In the meantime, the effect of photolysis process on the effluent of the biological unit was also studied. In the direct photolysis, the removal performance reached 51% and by adding H2O2 the removal efficiency was increased to 87%. The removal efficiency for the entire system including spRBC and an ultraviolet radiation unit was 94%.

AB This study utilized spatial analysis to identify hotspots for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs) using data from potential sources including wastewater treatment plants, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)-permitted pollution sources, septic systems, and agricultural and grazing areas. The study area is Lake Mead, to which the return of treated effluent is one of the largest water reuse practices in the USA. Based on Getis-Ord's Gi(star) statistic, clusters of pollution sources were identified based on the values of each feature and its neighboring features. Spatial analysis was applied to evaluate the impact from point and nonpoint source pollution. The results of spatial statistical analyses were used to evaluate the existing sampling locations in Las Vegas Wash. The results indicated that sampling locations with highest concentrations of EDCs/PPCPs were close to the outlets of subbasins with high susceptibility to EDCs/PPCPs, which confirms the suitability of sampling locations.

AB The removal of an emerging pharmaceutical pollutant, sulfasalazine, which frequently detected in pharmaceutical industry wastewater as well as in drinking water, has been investigated by adsorption on a biosorbent, prepared from pomegranate peels in order to valorize food processing waste. After characterizing and determining the surface functions, morphology and textural properties of the biosorbent pomegranate peels, the effect of pollutant concentration, pH and adsorbent amount on the adsorption activity were evaluated by varying one parameter at a time. Results showed a quasi-total removal of sulfasalazine for a pH higher than 4.8, an initial pollutant concentration of 50 mg L-1 and an adsorbent mass of 0.5 g. The isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for sulfasalazine adsorption on the biosorbent have been estimated.

AB Dewatered municipal sludge was used as raw material to prepare activated carbon (SAC), and the SAC was modified by walnut shell and nano-titanium dioxide (MSAC). The results showed that the MSAC had a higher specific surface area (S-BET) (279.147 m(2)/g) and total pore volume (V-T) (0.324 cm(3)/g) than the SAC. Simultaneously, the functional groups such as C-O, C = O, and Ti-O-Ti on the surface of MSAC were enhanced due to modification. These physicochemical properties provided prerequisites for the diffusion and degradation of pollutants in MSAC. Furthermore, the MSAC was applied to adsorb amoxicillin (AMX) from aqueous solution, in batch experiments, the maximum removal rate (88.19%) was observed at an initial AMX concentration of 30 mg/L, MSAC dosage of 5.0 g/L, pH of 8, contact time of 180 min, and temperature of 25 degrees C. In addition, the adsorption process was well described by the Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption of AMX onto MSAC was dominated by multilayer chemisorption. Also, the adsorption thermodynamics suggested that the adsorption process of AMX onto MSAC was endothermic, feasible and spontaneous.

AB In the present study, cytopathology was investigated in the liver, kidney, gills and gut of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to five different concentrations (1, 5, 20, 100 and 500 mug/L) of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac under laboratory conditions. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) for cytological alterations in liver, kidney and gills was 1 mug/L. In the gut, however, no diclofenac-induced cytopathology occurred. As the most prominent reactions induced by diclofenac (1) in the kidney, a severe accumulation of protein in the tubular cells (so called hyaline droplet degeneration), macrophage infiltration and structural alterations (dilation, vesiculation) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the proximal and distal renal tubules were observed. Furthermore, shortening of podocytes and their retraction from the basal lamina, a thickening of the basal lamina, the formation of desmosomes, and necrosis of endothelial cells in the renal corpuscles occurred; (2) in the liver, the most striking reactions were the collapse of the cellular compartmentation as well as the glycogen depletion of hepatocytes; (3) in the gills, pillar cell necrosis, hypertrophy of chloride cells, and epithelium lifting became evident in the secondary lamellae.

AB This study aimed at investigating the levels and distribution of progesterone in receiving waters and wastewaters in Arusha, a fast-growing urban area and the third largest city in Tanzania. Specifically, the study was conducted along the Themi River and the adjacent waste stabilization ponds (WSPs). Progesterone was detected and quantified by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. For Themi River samples, the level of progesterone obtained ranged from 'no detection' to 439 ng/L with a mean value of 120.3 ng/L. The levels detected were significantly higher in the midstream than the upstream and downstream sections of the river (P<0.05). The higher values at the midstream were attributable to livestock, WSPs and household effluents; agricultural activities; and sewage infiltration. Progesterone levels in the present study, although not extremely high, correspond to those associated with harmful effects in other studies. Results for samples collected from the WSPs indicated a release of 215 ng progesterone per L of the receiving waters. Although progesterone removal efficiency by the WSPs was 75%, the amount released was still high enough to cause harm to aquatic organisms. Thus, more efficient techniques are required to adequately remove progesterone to the recommended levels.

AB The bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in the Ria de Aveiro, was selected to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) at environmentally relevant concentrations. CBZ is an antiepileptic drug widely found in the aquatic environment with toxic effects to inhabiting organisms. However, few studies evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of this drug. The experiment was performed 'by exposing mussels to 0.0, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 CBZ mu g/L, for 96 h and 28 days. To assess the toxicity of the drug, a battery of biomarkers related to mussels general physiological health status and oxidative stress was applied. CBZ was quantified in mussel tissues by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results obtained show that CBZ did not induce oxidative stress. However, our findings,demonstrated that the drug was taken up by mussels even though presenting low bioconcentration factor (BCF) values (up to 2.2). Furthermore, our results demonstrated that after a chronic exposure the physiological parameters, namely the condition and gonadosomatic indices, were negatively affected which may impair organisms' reproductive capacity with consequences to population sustainability.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 22 antibiotics, including eight fluoroquinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, were investigated in the urban surface waters in Beijing, China. A total of 360 surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area of Beijing monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely used and extensively distributed in the surface water of Beijing, and sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were the predominant antibiotics with the average concentrations of 136 and 132 ng L-1, respectively. A significant difference of antibiotic concentrations from different sampling sites was observed, and the southern and eastern regions of Beijing showed higher concentrations of antibiotics. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in the urban surface water was also studied, and the highest level of antibiotics was found in November, which may be due to the low temperature and flow of the rivers during the period of cold weather. Risk assessment showed that several antibiotics might pose high ecological risks to aquatic organisms (algae and plants) in surface water, and more attention should be paid to the risk of antibiotics to the aquatic environment in Beijing.

AB High biodegradation efficiencies of different emerging micropollutants were obtained with nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) working at high nitrogen loading rates (NLR), that boosted the development of biomass with high nitrifying activities (>1 g N-NH4+/g VSS d). Come-tabolic biodegradation seemed to be responsible for the removal of most compounds due to the action of the ammonium monooxygenase enzyme. NAS showed a different affinity for each compound, probably due to steric hindrance, activation energy limitations or the presence of specific functional groups. Increasing loading rates of micropollutants were removed at shorter hydraulic retention times, although the biodegradation efficiencies of compounds with slow/intermediate kinetics, such as fluoxetine, erythromycin, roxithromycin and trimethoprim, diminished due to kinetic and/or stoichiometric limitations. Solids retention time, always above the minimum to avoid the washout of nitrifiers, did not enhance the biodegradation of any of the selected compounds, with the exception of diclofenac. Regarding sorption, the solid liquid distribution coefficients (K-d) obtained in NAS were very similar to those found in conventional activated sludge by other authors. No correlation between K-d values and any of the operational parameters was found for the selected substances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seven transformation products of carbamazepine generated by at least one of three common water treatment technologies (W-radiation, oxidation with chlorine dioxide (ClO2), and biological treatment with activated Sludge) were identified by complementary use of ion trap, single quadrupole, and quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometers. Acridine was formed during all of the three treatment processes, while acridine 9-carbaldehyde was identified as an intermediate during ClO2 oxidation. Further treatment of acridine with ClO2 produced 9-hydroxy-acridine, UV-treatment resulted in the formation of acridone, hydroxy-(9H,10H)-acridine-9-carbaldehyde, acridone-N-carbaldehyde, and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H-quinazoline-2,4-dione, while biological breakdown of acridine yielded acridone. In parallel, the transformation product iminostilbene was observed during sample analysis. In addition,this study compared the treatment technologies according to the removal of carbamazepine and the production and decay of its transformation products. The most successful method for the removal of carbamazepine was UV treatment, while acridine and acridone were more susceptible to biological treatment. Therefore, based on the enhanced biodegradability of carbamazepine residues achieved by UV irradiation, we propose a coupled treatment technology involving an initial UV treatment step followed by biological treatment, which may satisfactorily remove the parent compound and its transformation products.

AB Oxolinic acid, flumequine, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol are antibiotics commonly used in farming. Because an important percentage of these antibiotics given to fish and cattle ends up, directly or indirectly, in the freshwater environment, suitable tools for the monitoring of these antibiotics are needed. A French river was chosen because of the location of four fish farms and a sewage plant on its main course. First, a passive monitoring program involving water, sediment, and autochthonous bryophytes was performed at 25 sampling sites tested once every three months for one year. Second, an active monitoring method was performed using moss bags for a one-month exposure period, both upstream and downstream of each potential source of antibiotics. Sediment and bryophyte samples, but not water samples, were found to be useful for monitoring environmental contamination by oxolinic acid, flumequine, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol. Sediments and bryophytes also appeared to be complementary media for dating the river's contamination by antibiotics. Data collected by both active and passive monitoring methods confirmed contamination of the river, mainly by flumequine and oxytetracycline, attributable to fish farming but also to terrestrial animal farming and perhaps human pharmaceuticals.

AB Acetaminophen is globally one of the most prescribed drugs due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties. However, it is highly toxic when the dosage surpasses the detoxification capability of an exposed organism, with involvement of an already described oxidative stress pathway. To address the issue of the ecotoxicity of acetaminophen, we performed acute exposures of two aquatic plant species, Lemna gibba and Lemna minor, to this compound. The selected biomarkers were number of fronds, biomass, chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay), and proline content. Our results showed marked differences between the two species. Acetaminophen caused a significant decrease in the number of fronds (EC50 = 446.6 mg/L), and the establishment of a dose-dependent peroxidative damage in L. minor, but not in L. gibba. No effects were reported in both species for the indicative parameters chlorophyll content and total biomass. However, the proline content in L. gibba was substantially reduced. The overall conclusions point to the occurrence of an oxidative stress scenario more prominent for L. minor. However, the mechanisms that allowed L. gibba to cope with acetaminophen exposure were distinct from those reported for L. minor, with the likely involvement of proline as antioxidant.

AB Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solar-energy-enabled photocatalysis is promising for sustainable water purification. However, photoreactor design, especially immobilizing nano-sized photocatalysts, remains a major barrier preventing industrial-scale application of photocatalysis. In this study, we immobilized photocatalytic graphitic carbon nitride on chitosan to produce g-C3N4/chitosan hydrogel beads (GCHBs), and evaluated GCHB photoreactivity for degrading phenol and emerging persistent micropollutants in a 3D printed compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor. The CPC photocatalytic system showed comparable performance with slurry reactors for sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine degradation under simulated sunlight, and it maintained the performance for contaminant removal in real water samples collected from water/wastewater treatment plants or under outdoor sunlight irradiation. Global drinking water production was estimated for the CPC system, and it holds promise for small-scale sustainable water treatment, including, but not limited to, the production of high-quality potable water for single houses, small communities, rural areas, and areas impacted by natural disasters in both developed and developing countries.

AB Diclofenac, both from human and veterinary consumption, may arrive in landfills or in the wastewater treatment plants, becoming an environmental pollutant. Therefore, we aimed to study the influence of diclofenac on plants growth and development. We chose as model plant the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that was watered with different concentrations of aqueous diclofenac solutions (0-0.4 g/L). The plants exhibited linear decreased values of net assimilation rates and stomatal conductance to water vapors with increased diclofenac's concentrations. Emission of 3-hexenol was determined to scale up with diclofenac concentration, therefore this compound may be proposed as stress marker. Also in the emission of bean plants were detected 3 different monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, camphene and 3-carene), their concentration increasing with elevated concentration of diclofenac. We can conclude that diclofenac may affect the plants photosynthetic parameters and also might disturb the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) in plastids.

AB The biofilter packed with pressmud and inoculated with activated sludge obtained from pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant was employed for the removal of ethyl acetate and xylene in this study. The effect of process variables like gas flow rates (0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 m3 h-1), inlet concentration of ethyl acetate (1.75, 3.0, 7.0 and 10.5 g. m-3) and xylene (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.2. g.m-3) on the performance of biofilters was validated. The removal efficiency exceeded 97% for ethyl acetate at inlet concentrations up to 3.0 g.m-3 and 95% for xylene at inlet concentrations up to 0.4 g m-3. The maximum elimination capacity of 165 g m-3 h-1 and 66 g m-3 h-1 for the mixture of ethyl acetate and xylene were obtained. A steady state mathematical model was tested and proved to adequately describe the experimental results at the two operating regimes for both ethyl acetate and xylene.

AB A strain of autotrophic micro-organism, Rhodococcus sp.zw11, was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater containing hydrogen sulphide (H2S)The shape, physiological and biochemical characteristics and oxidation capacity of Rhodococcus sp.zw11 were studied, and the effect of inlet concentration and volumetric loading of H2S on the removal efficiency was evaluated by the biotrickling filter inoculated with Rhodococcus sp.zw11. The results suggested that the optimal temperature of Rhodococcus sp.zw11 (aerobic bacilli, short rod and grain-negative) was from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C and the optimal pH was from 5.5 to 6.5. The criteria necessary for a scale-up design of the biotrickling filter were established, and pressure drops at the start and end of the experiment were investigated. The optimal inlet loading could be noted as 180 g/m(3)h, corresponding to H2S removal efficiency close to 100%. Furthermore, the inoculated biotrickling filter had good ability to resist shock loading, which was a potential industrialisation method to control H2S emissions.

AB This paper concerns the treatment of wastewaters produced during printing matrix washing and by dyestuff leakage in the silk and Lycra printing industry. The objective was to obtain effluent of a quality that would allow water reuse. The raw wastewaters contained a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen (from urea, ammonium sulphate and tartrate used for the dyestuff preparation together with organic compounds. A high BOD5/COD ratio determined the possibility of a biological treatment of the wastewaters by nitrification-denitrification. To achieve complete denitrification, however, it was necessary to add an external carbon source. A mixture of methyl and ethyl alcohols from pharmaceutical industry wastes was used to achieve a BOD5/N ratio of about 3.5. High temperature (23-26 degrees C) and low inhibition enabled good rates of treatment to be achieved in a single-sludge system, equal to 0.042 kgN/kg MLVSS x day and 0.12 kgN/kg MLVSS x day, respectively for nitrification and denitrification. After this stage the effluents were characterized by COD <120 mg/L, BOD5 <25 mg/L, N-NH4 <10 mg/L, N-NHO3 <12 mg/L, N-NO2 <0.3 mg/L values which meet Italian discharge standards. A subsequent quartz filtration and UV sterilization allowed the wastewaters to be reused for washing purposes within the factory. At the final stage of the wastewater treatment it was possible to economize by reusing industrial wastewaters by 30-40%. No problems connected with a gradual accumulation of the recalcitrant or toxic compounds were encountered in the reuse of treated wastewaters and their subsequent biological treatment during 10 months of full scale plant operation. Residual colour removal was however necessary if the wastewaters were also to be used for the preparing of dyes. Laboratory experiments to remove colour using ozone treatment were conducted. A dose of 20 mg/L of ozone was introduced prior to filtration. This step eliminated not only the residual colour but also the residual non-ionic surfactants. As the final result of the treatment it will be possible to use wastewaters not only for washing purposes but also for preparation of the printing colours; it is calculated that economies of 60-70% of process water will be possible.

AB Although hospital wastewaters (HWWs) are usually discharged in urban sewage systems, their separate treatment has several benefits, such as the specific treatment of potential toxics as well as avoidance of further dilutions. In this work, an integrated industrial pilot plant (2200 L) corresponding to the technology SeMPAC(R) is proposed and validated for such purpose. The process consists of a sequential batch reactor (SBR) connected to an external submerged microfiltration membrane, in which powdered activated carbon (PAC) is directly added into the biological reactor to enhance the removal of the organic micropollutants (OMPs). The combination of different redox conditions in the SBR, as well as the operation at long sludge retention times (SRTs) and high biomass concentrations favored OMP biotransformation in the SBR, being their final removal efficiencies enhanced clearly after PAC addition, especially for the recalcitrant compounds. A periodical renewal of the adsorbent is necessary to overcome its gradual saturation. The main operational conditions were influenced by (i) the recalcitrant OMP carbamazepine, which defines the PAC dosage; (ii) the easily degradable OMP ibuprofen, which can be used to optimize the duration of the aerobic cycle; and (iii) the denitrification efficiency, which defines the correct time length of the anoxic period.

AB In the aquatic environment, pharmaceutical drugs are submitted to degradation processes, where photodegradation is one of the most important mechanisms affecting the fate, persistence and toxicity of the compounds. Carbamazepine, a widely used antiepileptic, is known to suffer photodegradation in water bodies and generate photoproducts, some of them with higher potential toxicity than the parent compound. Therefore, to evaluate the toxic effects of CBZ when combined with its photoproducts, an acute exposure (96 h) with the edible clam Scrobicularia plana was performed using environmental concentrations of CBZ (0.00-9.00 mu g/L) irradiated (and non-irradiated) with simulated solar radiation. The analysis of the irradiated CBZ solutions by mass spectrometry revealed the formation of 5 photoproducts, including acridine (a compound known to be carcinogenic). Oxidative stress results showed that the exposure to CBZ photoproducts did not increase the toxicity to clams, by comparison with the parent compound. Lipid peroxidation levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were the most responsive parameters to these stressors and lipid peroxidation results appeared to show the presence of an antagonistic effect resulting from the mixture of CBZ and its photoproducts.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a chiral fluorinated pharmaceutical indicated mainly for the treatment of depression and is one of the most dispensed drugs in the world. There is clear evidence of environmental contamination with this drug and its active metabolite norfluoxetine (NFLX). In this study the enantioselective biodegradation of racemic FIX and of its enantiomers by Labrys portucalensis strain F11 was assessed. When 2 mu M of racemic FLX was supplemented as sole carbon source, complete removal of both enantiomers, with stoichiometric liberation of fluoride, was achieved in 30 d. For racemic FIX concentration of 4 and 9 mu M, partial degradation of the enantiomers was obtained. In the presence of acetate as an additional carbon source, at 4, 9 and 21 mu M of racemic FLX and at 25 mu M of racemic FIX, (S)-FLX or (R)-FLX, complete degradation of the two enantiomers occurred. At higher concentrations of 45 and 89 mu M of racemic FLX, partial degradation was achieved. Preferential degradation of the (R)-enantiomer was observed in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first time that enantioselective biodegradation of FIX by a single bacterium is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential fates in indirect potable reuse systems of 21 79 pharmaceutical compounds that currently have been used or may be introduced within the next five years were estimated using a modified quantitative structure activity relationship model. Over 90% of the pharmaceutical compounds analyzed were estimated in this study as non-persistent in indirect potable reuse systems where the final removal barrier was sub-surface transport. The removal mechanisms of biodegradation and sorption were considered in assessing their persistence. The percentage of compounds produced by biotechnology was expected to increase from less than 20% to greater than 60% in the near future and this should result in a trend of decreasing persistence for future compounds. The potential rejection in indirect potable reuse systems that use reverse osmosis (RO) as the primary barrier was statistically evaluated. In order to evaluate RO performance, a multiple linear regression analysis was done using SPSS (vet. 17) and the main rejection mechanism for low molecular weight compounds was electrostatic repulsion. Treatment by RO is capable of removing greater than 95% of future compounds and would be expected to perform as efficiently as with currently used compounds. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The worldwide detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment and drinking water has been a cause for concern in recent years. The possibility for concurrent formation of nitrosamine DBPs (disinfection by-products) during chloramine disinfection has become another significant concern for delivered drinking water quality because of their potent carcinogenicity. This study demonstrates that a group of PPCPs containing amine groups can serve as nitrosamine precursors during chloramine disinfection. Molar yields higher than 1% are observed for eight pharmaceuticals, with ranitidine showing the strongest potential to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The molar conversion increases with the Cl-2:N mass ratio, suggesting that dichloramine is relevant to the formation of NDMA from these precursors. Although the trace level of PPCPs in the environment suggests that they may not account for the majority of nitrosamine precursors during the disinfection process, this study demonstrates a connection between the transformation of PPCPs and the formation of nitrosamines during chloramine disinfection. This both expands the pool of potential nitrosamine precursors, and provides a possible link between the presence of trace levels of certain PPCPs in drinking water sources and potential adverse health effects.

AB This study investigated the potential effect of four frequently used inorganic regenerant properties (i.e., ionic strength, cation type, anion type, and regeneration solution volume) on the desorption and adsorption performance of 14 pharmaceuticals, belonging to 12 therapeutic classes with different predominant chemical forms and hydrophobicities, using polymeric anion exchange resin (AER)-packed fixed-bed column tests. After preconditioning with NaCl, NaOH, or saline-alkaline (SA) solutions, all resulting mobile counterion types of AERs effectively adsorbed all 14 pharmaceuticals, where the preferential magnitude of OH--type = Cl- + OH--type > Cl--type. During regeneration, ionic strength (1 M versus 3 M NaCl) had no significant influence on desorption performance for any of the 14 pharmaceuticals, while no regenerant cation (HCl versus NaCl) or anion type (NaCl versus NaOH and SA) achieved higher desorption efficiencies for all pharmaceuticals. A volumetric increase in 1 M or 3 M NaCl solutions significantly improved the desorption efficiencies of most pharmaceuticals, irrespective of ionic strength. The results indicate that regeneration protocols, including regenerant cation type, anion type and volume, should be optimized to improve pharmaceutical removal by AERs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As part of a proactive approach to environmental protection, emerging issues with potential impact on the environment is the subject of ongoing investigation. One emerging area of environmental research concerns pharmaceuticals like salicylic acid, which is the main metabolite of various analgesics including aspirin. It is a common component of sewage effluent and also an intermediate in the degradation pathway of various aromatic compounds which are introduced in the marine environment as pollutants. In this study, biotransformation products of salicylic acid by seaweed, Bryopsis plumosa, associated marine bacterium, Moraxella spp. MB1, have been investigated. Phenol, conjugates of phenol and hydroxy cinnamic acid derivatives (coumaroyl, caffeoyl, feruloyl and trihydroxy cinnamyl) with salicylic acid (3-8) were identified as the bioconversion products by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These results show that the microorganism do not degrade phenolic acid but catalyses oxygen dependent transformations without ring cleavage. The degradation of salicylic acid is known to proceed either via gentisic acid pathway or catechol pathway but this is the first report of biotransformation of salicylic acid into cinnamates, without ring cleavage. Besides cinnamic acid derivatives (9-12), metabolites produced by the bacterium include antimicrobial indole (13) and beta-carbolines, norharman (14), harman (15) and methyl derivative (16), which are beneficial to the host and the environment.

AB This study investigated, for the first time, the distribution and fate of 28 multiple-class veterinary pharmaceuticals and antibiotics (PhACs), and their corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), in a full-scale on-farm livestock waste treatment plant. The plant relies on several technologies, including: anaerobic digestion (AD), solid-liquid separation, and two stages reverse osmosis (RO) of the liquid digestate. Tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, lincosamide and pleuromutilin antibiotics, together with anti-helmintic (flubendazole) and anti-inflammatory (flunixin) drugs were the most frequently detected compounds in livestock waste and in slaughterhouse sludge. This last fraction is used as co-substrate in the AD process and showed to be an important input source of PhACs and ARGs. In terms of treatment performance, AD exhibited moderate to low PhACs and ARGs reduction, while a large fraction (<50%) of the PhACs present in the digestate were distributed onto the solid fraction, after solid-liquid separation. Both solid and liquid digestates had relatively high copy numbers of ARGs. Finally, RO showed high rejection percentages for all PhACs (<90%), with concentrations in the low ng L-1 range in permeates, for most target PhACs. Nevertheless, moderate copy numbers of ARGs were detected in permeates.

AB Immunosuppresive therapy following organ transplant frequently includes treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid derivatives. These pharmaceuticals may enter the environment through waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and may have a potentially harmful effect on aquatic biota. Tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and their metabolites were measured at specific points of a large Polish river (Vistula), a smaller river (Utrata) and in tap water samples from the Warsaw region. Analysis was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, after solid phase extraction for water samples, or QuEChERS extraction for sediments. Residues of tacrolimus were below quantitation limits in both water and sediment samples. However, in water samples mycophenolic acid concentrations were measured at up to 180 ng L-1 downstream of WWTP outfalls. No immunosuppressive drugs were detected in tap water. Concentrations of mycophenolic acid exceeded the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) value in some Polish surface water, and risk calculations predicted at least twice higher concentrations in some other countries of the European Union. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of these immunosuppressive drug concentrations in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recognition that pharmaceuticals, personal care product chemicals, and endocrine disruptors can cause deleterious effects has led to search new approaches for removing them from contaminated waters. The emergence of tailored nanomaterials, with magnetic properties and high adsorption capacity for a wide range of compounds, provides a new tool to deal with these complex emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). Magnetic permanently confined micelle arrays (Mag-PCMAs) synthesized with cationic surfactants can provide several sorption mechanisms for the multifunctional EOCs. The sorption onto Mag-PCMAs of seven EOCs and two more conventional contaminants was studied. The results indicate high sorption capacity for many of the EOCs. However, because of the complex nature of these EOCs, it is not possible to predict their adsorption based on a single physicochemical characteristic such as K-ow or pK(a). Sorption kinetics are relatively fast, within the typical range for water treatment processes. The low energy required for the synthesis of Mag-PCMAs, relatively low cost (similar to$4/kg), ease of recovery with a magnetic field, and regenerability make them a much more sustainable option than more traditional approaches for removing EOCs, such as high energy granular activated carbon adsorption or advanced oxidation processes.

AB Water pollution by various toxic substances remains a serious environmental problem, especially the occurrence of organic micropollutants including endocrine disruptors, pharmaceutical pollutants and naphthol pollutants. Adsorption process has been an effective method for pollutant removal in wastewater treatment. However, the thermal regeneration process for the most widely used activated carbon is costly and energy-consuming. Therefore, there has been an increasing need to develop alternative low-cost and effective adsorption materials for pollutant removal. Herein, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), a cheap and versatile material, was modified with methacrylate groups by reacting with methacryloyl chloride, giving an average degree of substitution of 3 per beta-CD molecule. beta-CD-methacrylate, which could function as a crosslinker, was then copolymerized with acrylamide monomer via free-radical copolymerization to form beta-CD-polyacrylamide (beta-CD-PAAm) hydrogel. Interestingly, in the structure of the beta-CD-PAAm hydrogel, beta-CD is not only a functional unit binding pollutant molecules through inclusion complexation, but also a structural unit crosslinking PAAm leading to the formation of the hydrogel 3D networks. Morphological studies showed that beta-CD-PAAm gel had larger pore size than the control PAAm gel, which was synthesized using conventional crosslinker instead of beta-CD-methacrylate. This was consistent with the higher swelling ratio of beta-CD-PAAm gel than that of PAAm gel (29.4 vs. 12.7). In the kinetic adsorption studies, phenolphthalein, a model dye, and bisphenol A, propranolol hydrochloride, and 2-naphthol were used as model pollutants from different classes. The adsorption data for beta-CD-PAAm gel fitted well into the pseudo-second-order model. In addition, the thermodynamic studies revealed that beta-CD-PAAm gel was able to effectively adsorb the different dye and pollutants at various concentrations, while the control PAAm gel had very low adsorption, confirming that the pollutant removal was due to the inclusion complexation between beta-CD units and pollutant molecules. The adsorption isotherms of the different dye and pollutants by the beta-CD-PAAm gel fitted well into the Langmuir model. Furthermore, the beta-CD-PAAm gel could be easily recycled by soaking in methanol and reused without compromising its performance for five consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles. Therefore, the beta-CD-PAAm gel, which combines the advantage of an easy-to-handle hydrogel platform and the effectiveness of adsorption by beta-CD units, could be a promising pollutant removal system for wastewater treatment applications.

Here, we used metagenomic approach to investigate the spatio-temporal variation of ARGs in two adjacent sub-watersheds viz. North River (NR) and West River (WR), China. The results demonstrated that Bacitracin (22.8 % of the total ARGs), multidrug (20.7 %), sulfonamide (15.2 %) and tetracycline (10.9 %) were the dominant ARG types. SourceTracker analysis indicated that sewage treatment plants as the main source of ARGs, while animal feces mainly contributed in spreading the ARGs in the upstream of NR. Random forest and network analyses confirmed that NR was under the influence of fecal pollution. PCoA analysis demonstrated that the composition of ARGs changed along with the anthropogenic gradients, while the Raup-Crick null model showed that homogenizing selection mediated by class 1 integron intI1 resulted in stable ARG communities at whole watershed scale. Structural equation models revealed that microbial community, grassland and several non-antibiotic micropollutants may also play certain roles in influencing the distribution of ARGs. Overall, the observed deterministic formation of ARGs in riverine systems calls effective management strategies to mitigate the risks of antibiotic resistance on public health.

AB The objective of this study was to identify sources of micropollutants in the Hudson River Estuary (HRE). We collected 127 grab samples at 17 sites along the HRE over 2 years and screened for up to 200 micropollutants. We quantified 168 of the micropollutants in at least one of the samples. Atrazine, gabapentin, metolachlor, and sucralose were measured in every sample. We used data-driven unsupervised methods to cluster the micropollutants on the basis of their spatiotemporal occurrence and normalized-concentration patterns. Three major clusters of micropollutants were identified: ubiquitous and mixed-use (core micropollutants), sourced from sewage treatment plant outfalls (STP micropollutants), and derived from diffuse upstream sources (diffuse micropollutants). Each of these clusters was further refined into subclusters that were linked to specific sources on the basis of relationships identified through geospatial analysis of watershed features. Evaluation of cumulative loadings of each subcluster revealed that the Mohawk River and Rondout Creek are major contributors of most core micropollutants and STP micropollutants and the upper HRE is a major contributor of diffuse micropollutants. These data provide the first comprehensive evaluation of micropollutants in the HRE and define distinct spatiotemporal micropollutant clusters that are linked to sources and conserved across surface water systems around the world.

AB OBJECTIVES: Ketoprofen is a common human medicine from a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which is provably detected in surface waters in concentrations ordinarily in mu g.L-1. The aim of this study was to compare the acute toxicity of ketoprofen to embryonic and juvenile stages of aquarium fish - zebrafish (Danio rerio).
   METHODS: Tests were performed according to the methods of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) No. 203 (Fish, acute toxicity test) and OECD No. 212 (Fish, short-term toxicity test on embryo and sac-fry stages).
   RESULTS: The results showed (mean +/- SD) LC50 value of ketoprofen to be 632.30 +/- 10.10 mg.L-1 in juvenile zebrafish and 6.44 +/- 2.22 mg.L-1 in embryonic stages of zebrafish. The results revealed statistically significantly higher sensitivity (p<0.01) of the embryonic stages of zebrafish to ketoprofen compared to its juveniles. The susceptibility of embryos depends on many factors, especially yet improperly developed enzymatic system in embryos, different ways of the absorption of the substance into the organism or differences in metabolism pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS: The acute toxicity of ketoprofen for juvenile stages of zebra:ish is low, but the substance seems to be toxic for embryonic stages.

AB Widespread detection of pharmaceutical compounds in water environment has been a serious concern recently, while conventional sewage treatments are ineffective for their elimination. But, advanced oxidation techniques are very promising to remove varieties of organic contaminants in water. This research aims to elucidate oxidation potentials of sixteen commonly used pharmaceutical compounds in mixed solutions by seven advanced oxidation techniques in laboratory batch experiments. The removal profiles exhibited four distinct patterns: a) easily degradable by all seven techniques, b) not easily degradable by all seven techniques, c) easily degradable by ozone-based techniques, but not by ultraviolet radiation-based techniques and d) easily degradable by ultraviolet radiation-based techniques, but not by ozone-based techniques. Ozone-based techniques rather than ultraviolet radiation-based techniques were very powerful for simultaneous removal of the compounds efficiently. Moreover, ozonation combined with ultraviolet radiation was the most appropriate technique for simultaneous removal of the tested compounds efficiently. Increased ozone dissolution and decomposition with ozone-based techniques did not always enhance the compounds' removal. Physicochemical properties of the compounds and solution pH also presumably played an important role on the removal which merits further attention.

AB An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) with six subsystems has been operated for six years (60,000 Ton day(-1)) and exhibited strong stability and high efficiency for removing conventional pollutants in tail water. This study was aimed to characterize the removal efficiency of antibiotics in relation to bacterial community structure and composition in this integrated constructed wetland. Water samples were taken from different ICW sites in two distinct seasons (i.e. winter and summer). The results showed that concentrations of antibiotics in ICW decreased from influent to effluent with varying removal rates among the different antibiotics (quinolones, ulfonamides and macrolides). The pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA revealed that the composition of dominant phyla could be grouped into four bacterial clusters and the key discriminant phyla, family or genera from each cluster was strongly associated with the specific physicochemical parameters of water or type of antibiotics. Members of the key phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Parcubacteria, and Actinobacteria) appeared to play an important role in antibiotics removal. In general, both the concentration of antibiotics and physicochemical parameters of water shaped the bacterial communities. These results improve our understanding of the interactions between antibiotics or water physiochemical parameters and bacterial communities in the integrated constructed wetland.

AB The abatement of valproic acid sodium salt (VA) via photo-Fentonprocess was investigated to evaluate the effect of irradiation type. Three different light sources have been used: UVA (black light blue lamps, BLB reactor), UVC (UVC reactor) and simulated sunlight in a Solarbox (SB). Using the highest concentrations of Fe2+ (10 mg L-1) and H2O2 (150 mg L-1),100% of VA degradation was observed in BLB and UVC devices, and 89.7% in Solarbox. Regarding mineralization, 67.4% and 76.4% of TOC conversion were achieved in BLB and UVC, respectively. In Solarbox, mineralization was negligible. Treated solutions under UVA or UVC radiation became biodegradable (BOD5/COD >= 0.25), which was not observed in Solarbox where BOD5/COD achieved was only 0.20. Regarding to toxicity (Vibrio Fischeri method), all processes have promoted the overall toxicity reduction of VA solution. Transformation products were identified by a LC-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, and degradation pathways were proposed. Operating costs and the energy needed by mg of VA removed were estimated and compared, for the different installations, showing that UVA can remove around 3 times more VA than SB and 2 times more VA than UVC, under the same conditions.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the algal contribution in a combined UV-algae treatment to remove the commonly used antibiotic cefradine. We evaluated the removal capacity of the individual alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), UV activated and combined UV-algae treatments. The toxic effect of the effluents treated by the above process on the standard test organismrotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) was also investigated. Our results showed that the individual algae treatment was inefficient at removing the antibiotic. Although the UV treatment decreased the antibiotic concentration efficiently (26.93% residue), it also increased the toxicity of the effluent (1.04 times of the parent compound). However, the relatively high removal efficiency (22.01% residue) and the reduced toxicity of the effluent (nearly half of that by the individual UV treatment) were obtained synchronously after the UV-algae combined treatment. The contribution of the algae was also confirmed by investigating the corresponding properties of the combined UV-activated sludge treatment and the combined UV-activated sludge-algae treatment. Our present study supported our hypothesis that (1) the performance of the individual algae treatment was inferior to the individual UV irradiation; (2) the algae treatment was necessary in a UV-algae combined treatment system to control the toxicity of the effluent after the UV treatment process.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals have been proposed as potential markers of human fecal contamination in recreational water. However, to date, there are no published studies describing their relationships with illness risks. Using a cohort of swimmers at seven U.S. beaches, we examined potential associations between the presence of chemical markers of human fecal pollution and self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) illness, diarrhea, and respiratory illness. Swimmers were surveyed about their beach activities, water exposure, and baseline symptoms on the day of their beach visit, and about any illness experienced 10-12 days later. Risk differences were estimated using model based standardization and adjusted for the swimmer's age, beach site, sand contact, rainfall, and water temperature. Sixty-two chemical markers were analyzed from daily water samples at freshwater and marine beaches. Of those, 20 were found consistently. With the possible exception of bisphenol A and cholesterol, no chemicals were consistently associated with increased risks of illness. These two chemicals were suggestively associated with 2% and 1% increased risks of GI illness and diarrhea in both freshwater and marine beaches. Additional research using the more sensitive analytic methods currently available for a wider suite of analytes is needed to support the use of chemical biomarkers to quantify illness risk and identify fecal pollution sources.

AB A bioanalytical approach was used to identify chemical contaminants at river sites located downstream from a pharmaceutical factory, where reproductive alterations in wild fish have been previously observed. By using polar organic compound integrative samplers (POCIS) at upstream and downstream sites, biological activity profiles based on in vitro bioassays revealed the occurrence of xenobiotic and steroid-like activities, including very high glucocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid, progestogenic and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-like activities (mu g standard-EQ/g of sorbent range), and weak estrogenic activity (ng E2-EQ/g of sorbent range). Chemical analyses detected up to 60 out of 118 targeted steroid and pharmaceutical compounds in the extracts. In vitro profiling of occurring individual chemicals revealed the ability of several ones to act as agonist and/or antagonist of different steroids receptors. Mass balance calculation identified dexamethasone, spironolactone, and 6-alpha-methylprednisolone as major contributors to corticosteroid activities and levonorgestrel as the main contributor to progestogenic activities. Finally, RP-HPLC based fractionation of POCIS extracts and testing activity of fractions confirmed identified compounds and further revealed the presence of other unknown active chemicals. This study is one of the first to report environmental contamination by such chemicals; their possible contribution to in situ effects on fish at the same site is suggested.

AB The occurrence and fate of eight PPCPs was studied in river waters from upstream to downstream of the three rivers in the Pearl River Delta, China. The correlations of PPCP levels and water quality parameters were also investigated. The analytes of the highest concentrations were caffeine, acetaminophen, and ciprofloxacin. Carbamazepine and erythromycin-H2O were detected at the lowest concentrations. The highest concentrations of PPCPs were found in the Shijing River, with 865 ng/L caffeine, 339 ng/L acetaminophen, and 304 ng/L ciprofloxacin. In general, the levels of PPCPs in the Zhujiang River were higher at sites where the metropolitan city Guangzhou is located and decreased from the epicenter along the river. Low levels of PPCPs were generally found in the Beijiang River. Positive correlations were found between PPCP levels, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and cumulative fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) volume. Among the four PPCPs evaluated (caffeine, acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole), caffeine had the best correlations with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. The prediction of PPCP concentrations at specified locations can be substantially simplified.

AB A finite element model was set-up to determine degradation rate constants for p-TSA during rapid sand filtration (RSF). Data used for the model originated from a column experiment carried out in the filter hall of a drinking water treatment plant in Berlin (Germany). Aerated abstracted groundwater was passed through a 1.6 m long column-shaped experimental sand filter applying infiltration rates from 2 to 6 in h(-1). Model results were fitted to measured profiles and breakthrough curves of p-TSA for different infiltration rates using both first-order reaction kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Both approaches showed that degradation rates varied both in space and time. Higher degradation rates were observed in the upper part of the column, probably related to higher microbial activity in this zone. Measured and simulated breakthrough curves revealed an adaption phase with lower degradation rates after infiltration rates were changed, followed by an adapted phase with more elevated degradation rates. Irrespective of the mathematical approach and the infiltration rate, degradation rates were very high, probably owing to the fact that filter sands have been in operation for decades, receiving high p-TSA concentrations with the raw water.

AB The behaviour of residues of phenazone-type pharmaceuticals during bank filtration was investigated at a field site in Berlin, Germany, where bank-filtered water is used for drinking water production. The concentrations of the pharmaceutical residues in the shallow, young bank filtrate (travel times < one month) were correlated to the prevailing hydrochemical conditions at the field site. In addition, their behaviour during passage through an undisturbed sediment core from the lake base at the site (clogging layer) was evaluated in the laboratory. Phenazone, 4-acetylaminoantipyrine (AAA), 4-formylaminoantipyrin (FAA) and 1,5-dimethyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP) were eliminated more efficiently under oxic conditions, while 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyloxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) was not eliminated at all. The redox conditions and the elimination of the respective pharmaceutical residues displayed strong seasonal variations. Oxic conditions were only encountered close to the shore in winter, when temperatures were low. The column study showed that the elimination is restricted to the uppermost decimetres of the lake base, where oxygen is present. While phenazone elimination is almost complete during aerobic rapid sand filtration in the waterworks, the compounds were found to be more persistent under anoxic field conditions.

AB In this work, a high porous activated carbon from Jacaranda mimosifolia was developed and employed for ketoprofen adsorption. After the pyrolysis process at 973.15 K, the material presented cavities with different sizes allocated on the particle surface. The material presented a pH at the point of zero charge of 4.1 with the best adsorption at pH 2. The best adsorbent dosage was 0.72 g L-1, corresponding to a removal of 96%. The system reached the adsorption equilibrium after 120 min and was described by the linear driving force model. The isotherms revealed that the adsorption capacity decreased with the temperature and followed the Langmuir model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 303.9 mg g(-1). This high capacity can be associated with the high surface area (928 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (0.521 cm(3) g(-1)) values. The thermodynamic values indicated that the adsorption system is spontaneous and exothermic. The enthalpy value indicates that the interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate are physical. Regeneration tests showed a decreasing percentage of removal of 7.86% after 5 cycles. Finally, the adsorbent showed efficiency when treating a simulated effluent containing drugs and inorganic salts, showing the removal of 71.43%.

AB Hybrid polycation-clay composites, based on methylated poly vinylpyridinium, were optimized as sorbents for secondary effluent organic matter (EfOM) including emerging micropollutants. Composite structure was tuned by solution ionic strength and characterized by zeta potential, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analyses. An increase in ionic strength induced a transition from a train to a loops and tails configuration, accompanied by greater polycation adsorption. Composite charge reversal (zeta potential -18 to 45 mV) increased the adsorption of EfOM and humic acid (HA), moderately and sharply, respectively, suggesting electrostatic and also nonspecific interactions with EfOM. Filtration of EfOM by columns of positively charged composites was superior to that of granular activated carbon (GAC). The overall removal of EfOM was most efficient by the composite with a train configuration. Whereas a composite with a loops and tails configuration was beneficial for the removal of the anionic micropollutants diclofenac, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen from EfOM. These new findings suggest that the loops and tails may offer unique binding sites for small micropollutants which are overseen by the bulk EfOM. Furthermore, they may explain our previous observations that in the presence of dissolved organic matter, micropollutant filtration by GAC columns was reduced, while their filtration by composite columns remained high.

AB A growing number of pharmaceuticals are found in surface waters worldwide, raising concerns about their effects on aquatic organisms and it is a major challenge to develop a rational strategy for prioritizing drugs on which to focus the most extensive environmental research efforts. However, in contrast to most other chemicals, very good understanding of the human potency of pharmaceuticals has been obtained through efficacy and safety testing. Assuming that a drug acts primarily through the same target(s) also in a non-target species, it would be possible to predict the likelihood for pharmacological interactions in wildlife. Among aquatic organisms, fish most often share drug targets with humans. In this study, we have calculated the predicted critical environmental concentration (CECs), i.e. the surface water concentration expected to cause a pharmacological effect in fish, for 500 pharmaceuticals, assuming equivalent pharmacological activity. The CECs are based on literature data on human potencies together with a predicted bioconcentration factor in fish for each drug based on lipophilicity. We propose that CECs could be used as preliminary indicators of specific drugs' potential to cause adverse pharmacological effects at specific water concentrations, used when selecting pharmaceuticals to include in screening campaigns and for assessing relevant detection limits.

AB We evaluated the occurrence of three antibiotics (roxithromycin, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol) in surface water and effluents from several sewage treatment plants (STPs) on the Han River, Korea. In addition, standard acute toxicity tests were conducted using the microbe Vibrio fischeri, freshwater macroinvertebrates Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa, and fish (Oryzias latipes) for these antibiotics. Antibiotics were more frequently detected at higher amounts in effluent samples and in samples collected during the low-flow season. For trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, the levels observed in surface water during low flow were, on average, 108 and 31 ng/L, respectively. These levels were comparable to those measured in the municipal effluents (average, 80 and 37 ng/L, respectively), suggesting the presence of other sources upstream (e.g., livestock wastes). For roxithromycin, surface water levels were approximately an order of magnitude lower than effluent levels. Adverse effects of roxithromycin, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol were observed at mg/L levels in standard acute aquatic ecotoxicity tests. Based on hazard quotients calculated for the three antibiotics, minimal risks to aquatic, systems are suggested. To further increase scientific understanding about the potential impacts of these pharmaceuticals in the environment, however, chronic ecotoxicology studies, with more subtle but ecologically meaningful end points or in combination with other mechanistically related contaminants, may be beneficial.

AB The contamination of surface water by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has attracted widespread attention, but data regarding their impacts on groundwater (GW) are sparse. In river-GW interaction areas, rivers are likely an important source of PPCPs in aquifers, especially rivers impacted by sewage treatment plant effluent. Understanding the characterization, transport, and risk is valuable for the effective protection of vital aquatic ecosystem services, environmental health, and drinking water supplies. To attain this objective, statistics with spatial analysis and ecological risk were used to assess the effects of artificial recharge (AR) engineering on 16 PPCPs in aquifers in North China. The results indicated that 15 PPCPs were detected in unconfined and confined aquifers, with a few PPCPs being detected up to 1,000 ng/L. The most frequently detected PPCPs were sulfisoxazole, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, and ibuprofen. In addition, the spatial and seasonal variations in most PPCPs were significant. Furthermore, the maximum concentrations were compared to the predicted no-effect concentrations to evaluate the ecological risk, and four PPCPs were found to be of medium or high ecological risk. This study highlights that AR engineering has a significant ecological effect on GW.

AB Among pharmaceuticals, the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment is a subject of special concern due to their environmental impact, namely the development of bacterial resistance. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics and it is regularly found, not only in effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs), but also in the aquatic environment. Photodegradation appears as an alternative process for the removal of this type of pollutants from contaminated waters. In order to be used for a remediation purpose, its evaluation under continuous flow mode is essential, as well as the determination of the final effluent antibacterial activity, which were assessed in this work.
   As compared with batch operation, the irradiation time needed for SMX elimination under continuous flow mode sharply decreased, which is very advantageous for the target application. Moreover, the interrelation between SMX removal, mineralization and antibacterial activity was evaluated before and during photodegradation in ultrapure water. Although mineralization was slower than SMX removal, bacterial activity increased after SMX photodegradation. Such increase was also verified in environmental water matrices. Thus, this study has proven that photodegradation is an efficient and sustainable process for both (i) the remediation of waters contaminated with antibiotics, and (ii) the minimization of the bacterial resistance.

AB Here, we evidenced the photo-induced degradation of mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, through the 254-nm light excitation of nitrite. The results demonstrated that the photodegradation of mefenamic acid was enhanced, and the mefenamic acid photodegradation rate significantly increased, from 0.00627 to 0.0350 min(-1) as the nitrite was increased from 0 to 0.5 mmol L-1. The photodegradation rate increased from 0.0287 to 0.0512 min(-1) as the pH was elevated, from 5.0 to 10.0. The actual second-order rate constant for the reaction of mefenamic acid with center dot OH was investigated to 1.079x10(10) M-1 s(-1) according to steady-state center dot OH concentration of 3.5x10(-14) mmol L-1 and the contribution to the rate of center dot OH of 67.1 %. The photoproducts were identified using HPLC/MS/MS, and possible nitrite-induced photodegradation pathways were proposed by hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, hydration, nitrosylation, and ketonized reactions. The toxicity of the phototransformation products was evaluated using the Microtox test, which revealed that the photoproducts were more toxic than mefenamic acid for the generation of nitrosation aromatic compounds.

AB Diclofenac, a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been found in many Sewage Treatment Plant effluents, rivers and lake waters, and has been reported to exhibit adverse effects on fish. Advanced oxidation processes, ozonation and H2O2/UV were investigated for its degradation in water. The kinetic of the degradation reaction and the nature of the intermediate products were still poorly defined. Under the conditions adopted in the present study, both ozonation and H2O2/UV systems proved to be effective in inducing diclofenac degradation, ensuring a complete conversion of the chlorine into chloride ions and degrees of mineralization of 32% for ozonation and 39% for H2O2/UV after a 90 min treatment.
   The reactions were found to follow similar, but not identical, reaction pathways leading to hydroxylated intermediates (e.g. 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]-5-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and C-N cleavage products (notably 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) through competitive routes. Subsequent oxidative ring cleavage leads to carboxylic acid fragments via classic degradation pathways. In the pH range 5.0-6.0 kinetic constants (1.76 x 10(4)-1.84 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) were estimated for diclofenac ozonation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flurbiprofen is a fluorinated, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical with potential application in a wide range of maladies. Currently, there is no information regarding its environmental fate. To address this, flurbiprofen is spiked at 500 and 50 ppm into activated sewage sludge taken from the municipal treatment plant of Ankara, Turkey. Flurbiprofen is partially degraded after 80 days, with removal proportion varying from 33% to 48%. Isolation of organisms able to use flurbiprofen as a sole carbon and energy source is unsuccessful. A transient, acid-labile yellow coloration appears in supernatants after addition of flurbiprofen. During disappearance, a novel potential metabolite is detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, a chemical that does not appear in killed controls or in nonflurbiprofen-amended controls. Mass spectra of the novel chemical obtained at low and high collision energies are consistent with 4-(1-carboxyethyl)-2-fluorobenzoic acid, suggesting the application of a canonical metabolic paradigm for halogenated biphenyl metabolism by bacteria in which the nonhalogenated ring is metabolized by dioxygenation and metacleavage, leaving the halogenated aromatic ring behind. This metabolite shows no signs of disappearance after the 80-day monitoring period, implying that the environmental release of flurbiprofen might be of concern.

AB Erythromycin mycelial dreg (EMD) is a bio-fermentation residue of the pharmaceutical industry that may be used as a nutrient resource. However, the contaminants present in EMD need to be considered and controlled at an acceptable level prior to utilization. In this study, heat-activated persulfate (PS) oxidation of EMD was developed to degrade the residual erythromycin (ERY) and inactivate the ERY-resistant genes. The effects of temperature, initial PS concentration, and pH on the removal of ERY in EMD were studied. The results revealed that 99.0% ERY was degraded by 25 g PS/kg EMD under 80 degrees C within 120 min. The apparent rate constant (k(app)) in the acidic condition was higher than that in the alkaline condition. The contribution of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) on ERY removal in EMD was found to be 36.8% and 29.4%, respectively. Six intermediate products (IPs) of ERY were clarified, and total organic carbon (TOC) was efficiently reduced by 99.4%. Finally, the detected ERY-resistant genes ere(B), erm(A), and erm(B) obviously presented a reduction during the heat-activated PS oxidation process.

AB A series of magnetic anion exchange resins (ND-1, ND-2 and ND-3) with different pore structure were prepared for ibuprofen (IBU) adsorption by using different amount of cyclohexanol as porogen in this work. For adsorption kinetics, resins with larger pore structure showed faster adsorption rates and higher equilibrium adsorption capacities because the internal diffusion process was facilitated by the increase of pore diameter and pore volume. As for adsorption isotherms, the experimental data was better fitted by Freundlich model especially for the resins with broader pores, suggesting that heterogeneous interactions took place in pores. The counter ion released by resin was measured, and ratios of equilibrium adsorption capacity to the counter ion were between 1.22 and 1.56, which confirmed that adsorption process was predominantly attributed to ion exchange while other interactions also existed. Hence, the co-existent anion reduced the adsorption amount of IBU onto resin by competing adsorption in ion exchange process, and the optimal pH ranged from 6 to 8. Resins with more open structure showed better regeneration abilities, of which the adsorption amounts witnessed no significant decrease during 7 circles of use, indicating the advantages of larger pore canal in the adsorption and regeneration behavior.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment In this work, the mechanism and toxicity of DCF degradation by ClO2 under simulated water disinfection conditions were investigated. Experimental results indicate that rapid and significant oxidation of DCF occurred within the first few minutes; however, its mineralization process was longer than its degradation process. UPLC-MS and (1) H NMR spectroscopy were performed to identify major disinfection byproducts that were generated in three tentative degradation routes. The two main routes were based on initial decarboxylation of DCF on the aliphatic chain and hydroxylation of the phenylacetic acid moiety at the C-4 position. Subsequently, the formed aldehyde intermediates were the starting point for further multistep degradation involving decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and oxidation reactions of C-N bond cleavage. The third route was based on transient preservation of chlorinated derivatives resulting from electrophilic attack by chlorine on the aromatic ring, which similarly underwent C-N bond cleavage. Microtox bioassay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of solutions treated by ClO2. The formation of more toxic mid-byproducts during the ClO2 disinfection process poses a potential risk to consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of four antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine and trimethoprim) and four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) using extended sludge age biological process was investigated. The sludge age of the biological system was greater than 200 d. Hydraulic retention time of 12 h was maintained throughout the experiment. The extended sludge age biological process is able to treat pharmaceuticals with good and steady removal efficiencies: 64-93% removal for antibiotics over 1-5 mu g L-1 influent concentrations and 94% to complete removal for acetaminophen and ibuprofen with a wide range of influent concentrations 1-100 mu g L-1. For ketoprofen and naproxen the removal efficiencies are 79-96% over a range of 1-15 mu g L-1 influent concentrations. The removal efficiency decreases with increasing initial concentrations for all target compounds except for ibuprofen. This indicates that the initial influent concentration is an important parameter for the studies of fate of pharmaceuticals. The amount of bio-mass and size of the reactor required to achieve good and steady removal efficiencies for known influent pharmaceutical concentrations are also suggested in this study.

AB Organic wastes are increasingly collected source separated, thus requiring additional treatment or recovery capacities for municipal biowastes, organic industrial wastes, as well as agroindustrial byproducts. In this study, we demonstrate that anaerobic digestion is preferentially suited for high-water-containing liquid or pasty waste materials. We also evaluate the suitability of various organic wastes and byproducts as substrates for anaerobic digestion and provide a current status survey of codigestion. Biodegradation tests and estimations of the biogas yield were carried out with semisolid and pasty proteins and lipids containing byproducts from slaughterhouses; pharmaceutical, food, and beverage industries; distilleries; and municipal biowastes. Biogas yields in batch tests ranged from 0.3 to 1.36 L/g of volatile solids(added). In continuous fermentation tests, hydraulic retention times (HRTs) between 12 and 60 d, at a fermentation temperature of 35degreesC, were required for stable operation and maximum gas yield. Laboratory experiments were scaled up to full-scale codigestion trials in municipal and agricultural digestion plants. Up to 30% cosubstrate addition was investigated, using municipal sewage sludge as well as cattle manure as basic substrate. Depending on addition rate and cosubstrate composition, the digester biogas productivity could be increased by 80-400%. About 5-15% cosubstrate addition proved to be best suited, without causing any detrimental effects on the digestion process or on the further use of the digestate.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical drugs has become a major environmental issue considering that these substances (or their metabolites) end up inevitably in sewage waters after excretion. In the wild, these chemicals may affect non-target organisms, and their potential toxicity is not sufficiently studied, a reality that is particularly true for marine organisms. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is known to be toxic in high dosages, namely, by triggering oxidative effects. These effects may be potentiated in marine organisms subjected to contamination resulting from large human settlements along coastal areas. In order to assess how different exposure regimes (acute vs. chronic) may affect aquatic wildlife, individuals of the gastropod species Phorcus lineatus were acutely (96 h) and chronically (28 days) exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of acetaminophen. The effects were evaluated through the quantification of selected biomarkers-catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and cholinesterase (ChE) activities. The results from acute exposure showed no significant effects in all three biomarkers, but chronically exposed organisms showed significant increases in the activities of CAT and ChEs. The data show that P. lineatus triggered a defensive biological response in the presence of acetaminophen, and also show that realistically low levels of acetaminophen can exert adaptive changes with unknown consequences.

AB Toxic effects evidenced in the environment are most often caused by mixtures of known and unknown pollutants. One of the key challenges in environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology is to characterize and identify those toxicants in relation with the effect. However, many of the current bottlenecks in the assessment of organic contaminants in our environment are related to the difficulty of evaluating various chemical classes and biological effects within complex mixtures and more precisely to link both approaches. To tackle these analytical challenges, the bioanalytical concept has emerged during the last decade. In this article, we describe through some outstanding examples the current limitations in the chemical-driven approach such as problems encountered for a correct evaluation of water quality when the continuous introduction of new chemicals has to be taken into account in monitoring for correct evaluation of this quality and could led to tremendous analytical costs or some of the integrated bioanalytical approaches as promising powerful tools to improve environmental risk assessment by taking into account the link presence/effect.

AB The ecotoxicity of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been evaluated using acute Daphnia and algal tests. Toxicities were relatively low, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values obtained using Daphnia in the range from 68 to 166 mg L-1 and from 72 to 626 mg L-1 in the algal test. Acute effects of these substances seem to be quite improbable. The quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approach showed that all substances act by nonpolar narcosis; thus, the higher the n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (log K-ow) of the substances. the higher is their toxicity. Mixture toxicity of the compounds could be accurately predicted using the concept of concentration addition. Toxicity of the mixture was considerable, even at concentrations at which the single substances showed no or only very slight effects, with some deviations in the Daphnia test, which could be explained by incompatibility of the very steep dose-response curves and the probit analysis of the data. Because pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment occur usually as Mixtures, an accurate prediction of the mixture toxicity is indispensable for environmental risk assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Significant amounts of cephalosporin mycelial dreg (CMD) are still being generated from biopharmaceutical processes, representing both an economic and environmental burden for pharmaceutical factories. This study investigates the microwave (MW) treatment of CMD at a relatively mild temperature (100 degrees C) within 15 min. The results reveal that the MW treatment disintegrates the CMD efficiently and that the residual cephalosporin C (CPC) is almost degraded after sufficient irradiation. MW heating temperature strongly influences the polymer's release. SCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand), soluble proteins and carbohydrates have significant positive correlations to the temperature (r = 0.993, 0.983 and 0.992, respectively; p <0.01). 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicate that the key organic matters relate to temperature as well as microwave energies. Furthermore, more than 99.9% of the residual antibiotics in CMD are degraded by MW irradiation without antibacterial activities that are proven by the possible degradation pathway we elucidate. These results suggest that microwave irradiation treatment not only disintegrates CMD and destroys mycelial cells but also degrades the residual cephalosporin antibiotics, which implies the possibility for practical applications.

AB Stirred tank reactors (STRs) and fixed-bed reactors (FBRs) were applied for the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and diazepam by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The operation of STRs with free pellets and immobilized fungus attained stable operation for 50 days. Both bioreactors achieved high removal efficiencies for diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen while partial removal of carbamazepine and diazepam. The configuration of the FBR maintained a steady and feasible operation for 100 days with complete removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen regardless of the aeration system (air or oxygen) and remarkably high removal percentages of carbamazepine and diazepam: 60-90%. The extraction of the target compounds from the biomass and the support showed low residual concentrations of all the compounds both on fungal pellets and on the support of the FBR. Only significant values were detected in the STR with immobilized mycelium, demonstrating partial adsorption. A tentative identification of the degradation products of the three anti-inflammatories was performed, indicating the presence of 4-hydroxy-diclofenac, 1-hydroxy-ibuprofen-, 6-O-desmethyl-naproxen, as the major degradation products of the three parent compounds.

AB The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac (DCF) and mefenamic acid (MFA) were treated with the white rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. DCF completely disappeared and MFA decreased by about 90% after 6 days of treatment. It was also confirmed that the fungus almost completely removed the acute lethal toxicity of DCF and MFA towards the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus after 6 days of treatment. Mass spectrometric and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that two mono-hydroxylated DCFs (4'-hydroxydiclofenac and 5-hydroxydiclofenac) and one di-hydroxylated DCF (4',5-dihydroxydiclofenac) were formed via fungal transformation. The four metabolites of MFA were identified as 3'-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid (mono-hydroxylated MFA), 3'-hydroxymethyl-5-hydroxymefenamic acid (di-hydroxylated MFA), 3'-hydroxymethyl-6'-hydroxymefenamic acid (di-hydroxylated MFA) and 3'-carboxymefenamic acid. These results suggest that hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) in P. sordida YK-624 may be involved in the elimination and detoxification of DCF and MFA. This notion was further supported by the fact that smaller decreases in DCF and MFA were observed in cultures of P. sordida YK-624 incubated with 1-aminobenzotriazole, a known inhibitor of CYP.

AB The occurrence of 70 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) was investigated in the Tone River. The river has the largest basin in Japan, and the water is utilized not only for farming, but also as a source of water supply. One day in both January and October 2006, surface waters in the river and its tributaries and effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) directly discharging into the Tone River were collected, the location of which ranged over 150 km along the river. The 70 PPCPs in the samples were concentrated by solid phase cartridge and were measured by LC-MS/MS using three analytical methods. Fifty-seven PPCPs were detected in one or more samples. Bezafibrate, caffeine, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, crotamiton and sulpiride were frequently detected. Mass flow profiles of some PPCPs (e.g., crotamiton) were comparable to cumulative inhabitants in the basin, suggesting that these PPCPs could be markers of population. Total load of each PPCP into the basin from upstream, the tributaries, and the STPs were calculated. The contribution of selected PPCPs from the tributaries with lower sewerage system coverage was dominant compared to those from upstream and the STPs, suggesting the installation of sewerage systems is necessary to reduce the load of PPCPs in the Tone River basin.

AB As part of achieving national environmental goals, the Swedish Government commissioned an official report from the Swedish Medical Products Agency on environmental effects of pharmaceuticals. Considering half-lives/biodegradability, environmental occurrence, and Swedish sales statistics, 27 active pharmaceutical ingredients were selected for environmental hazard and risk assessments. Although there were large data gaps for many of the compounds, nine ingredients were identified as dangerous for the aquatic environment. Only the sex hormones oestradiol and ethinyloestradiol were considered to be associated with possible aquatic environmental risks. We conclude that risk for acute toxic effects in the environment with the current use of active pharmaceutical ingredients is unlikely. Chronic environmental toxic effects, however, cannot be excluded due to lack of chronic ecotoxicity data. Measures to reduce potential environmental impact posed by pharmaceutical products must be based on knowledge on chronic ecotoxic effects of both active phan-naceutical ingredients as well as excipients. We believe that the impact pharmaceuticals have on the environment should be further studied and be given greater attention such that informed assessments of hazards as well as risks can be done.

Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) was evaluated in hemolymph applying the neutral red retention assay (NRRA); several biomarkers including ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase (DBF), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were studied in gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and gonad tissues. In crabs exposed to environmental concentrations of the drugs, retention time was reduced by 50%. EROD and DBFOD activities were induced by caffeine in muscle and hepatopancreas tissues (p < 0.05); GST activity was activated by ibuprofen in gill, hepatopancreas and muscle at the highest concentrations tested (p < 0.05). All tissues showed GPX activity and LPO induction (p < 0.05). Crabs exposed to caffeine and ibuprofen showed evidence of DNA damage mainly in hepatopancreas tissues (p < 0.05). Environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals induce LMS and the biochemical responses studied in this crab. This methodology is a suitable technique for assessing pharmaceutical toxicity in the marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychoactive pharmaceuticals are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, contributing to persistent measurable concentrations in aquatic systems. Typically, it is assumed that such contaminants have no human health implications because they exist in extremely low concentrations. We exposed juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to three pharmaceuticals, fluoxetine, venlafaxine and carbamazepine, individually and in a mixture, and measured their effect on the induction of gene expression in fish brains using microarray analysis. Gene expression changes were accompanied by behavioral changes and validated by qPCR analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to perform gene-class analysis of gene expression. testing for enrichment of gene sets known to be involved in human neuronal development, regulation and growth. We found significant enrichment of gene sets for each of the treatments, with the largest induction of expression by the mixture treatment. These results suggest that the psychoactive pharmaceuticals are able to alter expression of fish genes associated with development, regulation and differentiation of synapses, neurons and neurotransmitters. The results provide a new perspective for the consideration of potential consequence for human health due to environmental exposure to unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals.

AB The growth-inhibiting and binary joint effects of 12 antibacterial agents on the freshwater green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korschikov) Hindak were investigated over 72-h exposures. The toxicity values (the median inhibitory concentration value, in micromoles) in decreasing order of sensitivity were triclosan (0.0018) > triclocarban (0.054) > roxithromycin (0.056) > clarithromycin (0.062) > tylosin (0.20) > tetracycline (2.25) > chlortetracycline (3.49) > norfloxacin (5.64) > sulfamethoxazole (7.50) > ciprolloxacin (20.22) > sulfamethazine (31.26) > trimethoprim (137.78). Several of these antibacterial compounds would be toxic at the micrograms per liter concentrations reported in surface waters and sewage effluents. Simple additive effects were observed in binary mixtures of sulfonamides, and most tylosin, triclosan, or triclocarban combinations. Potentially synergistic effects were observed in binary mixtures of the same class, such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones, as well as in some combined drugs, such as trimethoprim and sulfonamides or tylosin and tetracyclines. Potentially antagonistic effects were only observed between tylosin and triclocarban, triclosan and norfloxacin, and triclocarban and norfloxacin. Although present at low concentrations in the aquatic environment, mixtures of these antibacterial agents can potentially affect algal growth in freshwater systems due to their combined action.

AB This study assessed the mechanisms using montmorillonite (MMT) for the uptake and removal of a beta-blocker metoprolol (MTP) from aqueous solution. Uptake of MTP was fast and equilibrium could be reached in 15 min and 4 h under initial MTP tartrate concentrations of 800 and 4000 mg/L, respectively. The MTP uptake capacity was as high as 412 mg/g (corresponding to 1544 mmol/kg), suggesting that MMT was a good candidate for beta-blocker removal. Equilibrium solution pH and ionic strength had strong influence on MTP uptake on MMT and MTP uptake was reduced under high pH and high ionic strength conditions. Desorption of exchangeable cations matched well with the amount of MTP uptake at low loading levels, suggesting cation exchange being responsible for the uptake of MTP. At higher MTP uptake levels, significant expansion of d(001) spacing was observed, confirming extensive intercalation and changes in interlayer configuration of MTP. The decomposition temperature of MTP intercalated into the MMT increased in comparison to that of crystalline MTP as revealed by thermogravimetric analyses. Band shift in FTIR analyses indicated that hydrogen bonding besides cation exchange and ion-dipole interaction was responsible for the high MTP loading levels.

AB Parabens and triclosan compounds are widely used in pharmaceutical products, personal care, food and various products of daily use. After use, the final destinations of these contaminants are domestic effluents and the environment if not collected or treated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of parabens and triclosan in environments in a subtropical region, more specifically in the metropolitan region of Curitiba (southern Brazil) and possible effects of these compounds in aquatic environments through risk assessment through the use of risk quotient (RQ). Samples were collected in 20 points for 4 campaigns. For the extraction of the compounds we used the extraction technique of solid phase extraction (SPE). The determination of the compounds was using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was observed high concentrations of parabens, especially MeP (up to 2875 ng L-1). Despite high concentrations of parabens, their presence has a low risk to aquatic organisms. Triclosan has been observed at higher concentrations (415 ng L-1), suggesting once again that these environments are impacted by human action. The RQ assessed that triclosan has a high risk for certain groups of organisms.

AB A liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of antibiotics in water was developed and applied to Brazilian surface waters. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefalexin (CEF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline (TET), and trimethoprim were selected as target compounds due to their high consumption pattern in Brazil. LC and MS conditions were optimized to produce the maximum analytic response for each compound. Anion exchange and polymeric solid-phase extraction cartridges, in series, were employed during the extraction procedures. Recovery, linear range, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification were calculated. LOD varied from 0.13 ng L-1 for CIP and NOR to 0.76 ng L-1 for TET. Surface water samples from the Atibaia watershed (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) were analyzed. Results showed that seasonal and anthropogenic aspects dictated the levels of antibiotics in the samples. An overall frequency of detection of 55% was observed during the rainy period, whereas a higher percentage (88%) was noticed for samples collected during the dry season. In the Atibaia River, sample concentrations ranged from 29 ng L-1 for CEF to 0.5 ng L-1 for NOR. In a sewage-affected stream, however, concentrations up to 2422 ng L-1 CEF were found.

AB The anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine is considered as an indicator of sewage water pollution: however, its uptake by plants and effect on metabolism have not been sufficiently documented, let alone its metabolite (10,11-epoxycarbamazepine). In a model system of sterile, hydroponically cultivated Zea mays (as C-4 plant) and Helianthus annuus (as C-3 plant), the uptake and effect of carbamazepine and 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine were studied in comparison with those of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were effectively extracted from drug-supplemented media by both plants, while the uptake of more hydrophobic carbamazepine was much lower. On the other hand, the carbamazepine metabolite, 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, was, unlike sunflower, willingly taken up by maize plants (after 96 h 88 % of the initial concentration) and effectively stored in maize tissues. In addition, the effect of the studied pharmaceuticals on the plant metabolism (enzymes of Hatch-Slack cycle, peroxidases) was followed. The activity of bound peroxidases, which could cause xylem vessel lignification and reduction of xenobiotic uptake, was at the level of control plants in maize leaves contrary to sunflower. Therefore, our results indicate that maize has the potential to remove 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine from contaminated soils.

AB Numerous antibiotics like sulfonamides have been found in effluents from drug manufacturers due to the fact that these pollutants cannot be removed completely in STPs. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange comprise some of the most promising techniques due to their low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This article studies the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a common antibiotic that prevents the formation of dihydrofolic acid and which is the most frequently detected as sulfonamide in municipal sewage. The SMX retention capacity of an anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP-500 (Lanxess Chemical), was initially determined. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied and equilibrium constants and diffusivity values were obtained using different models. Load and elution breakthrough curves were plotted to evaluate ion exchange operation in a fixed bed column. In the elution step, 100% SMX was recovered in all cycles and could be concentrated up to nine times, thus facilitating the treatment of this compound. Load and elution breakthrough curves were simulated using a fixed bed model in which axial dispersion was considered the parameter model fit. A good correlation between experimental results and the numerical solution of the fixed bed model demonstrates the validity of the model.

AB This study investigated the presence and distribution of 22 antibiotics, including eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, in the water, sediments, and biota samples from Baiyangdian Lake, China. A total of 132 samples were collected in 2008 and 2010, and laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the lake. Sulfonamides were the dominant antibiotics in the water (0.86-1563 ng L-1), while quinolones were prominent in sediments (65.5-1166 mu g kg(-1)) and aquatic plants (8.37-6532 mu g kg(-1)). Quinolones (17.8-167 mu g kg(-1)) and macrolides [from below detection limit (BDL) to 182 mu g kg(-1)] were often found in aquatic animals and birds. Salvinia natans exhibited the highest bioaccumulation capability for quinolones among three species of aquatic plants. Geographical differences of antibiotic concentrations were greatly due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Baoding City was likely the main source of antibiotics in the lake.

AB The present study aimed at understanding the impact of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) load on compost dynamics and fate of PPCPs during the composting. In addition, the compost dynamics during single PPCP degradation and multiple PPCPs degradation were investigated. Results revealed that co-composting could degrade the pharmaceutical, carbamazepine (CBZ) up to 83% during single pollutant degradation while it was 66% during multiple pollutant system, at an initial concentra-tion (IC) of 5 mg/kg dw. In case of personal care product, namely triclosan (TCS), single pollutant degra-dation resulted in 86% removal whereas the removal efficiency was 83% in multiple pollutant system. Relatively high concentration of CBZ showed a negative impact on compost dynamics compared to that of TCS. Higher IC resulted in lower temperature development and relatively lower pollutant removal. The study on pollutant transfer in compost solid surface and in leachate revealed that TCS was not leached out while the leaching of CBZ was significant during composting process. The various transformation prod-ucts formed during composting were identified and tentative pathways for CBZ and TCS degradation were proposed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity of carrot (Daucus corota L) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), two plants that are usually eaten raw, to uptake tetracycline and amoxicillin (two commonly used antibiotics) from irrigated water was investigated in order to assess the indirect human exposure to antibiotics through consumption of un-cooked vegetables. Antibiotics in potted plants that had been irrigated with known concentrations of the antibiotics were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction and analyzed on a liquid chromatographtandem mass spectrometer. The plants absorbed the antibiotics from water in all tested concentrations of 0.1-15 mg L-1. Tetracycline was detected in all plant samples, at concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 28.3 ng/g in lettuce and 12.0-36.8 ng g(-1) fresh weight in carrots. Amoxicillin showed absorption with concentrations ranging from 13.7 ng g(-1) to 45.2 ng g(-1) for the plant samples. The mean concentration of amoxicillin (27.1 ng g(-1)) in all the samples was significantly higher (p = 0.04) than that of tetracycline (20.2 ng g(-1)) indicating higher uptake of amoxicillin than tetracycline. This suggests that the low antibiotic concentrations found in plants could be important for causing antibiotics resistance when these levels are consumed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reactivity of three imidazolic, environmental persistent antimycotic drugs (clotrimazole, CTZ; ketoconazole, KTZ; and miconazole, MCZ) upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is discussed. First, precursor compounds were immobilized in a silicone support which was further exposed to UV light at two different wavelengths: 254 and 365 nm. After solvent desorption, degradation kinetics of the precursor pharmaceuticals, identification of the arising transformation products (TPs) and evaluation of their time-course were investigated by liquid chromatography (LC) with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) detection. The three antimycotics displayed similar stabilities when exposed to 254 nm light; however, CTZ was significantly more stable than MCZ and KTZ when irradiated with the 365 nm lamp. TPs identified in silicone supports resulted from de-chlorination, cleavage, intra-molecular cyclization and hydroxylation reactions. Many of these species were also detected when exposing other solid matrices, such as sand and agricultural soil, previously spiked with target compounds, to UV light. The 50% estimated lethal concentration, calculated using the 48-h Daphnia magna test, for the two main TPs of CTZ and MCZ, at both wavelengths, were lower than those corresponding to the precursor drugs.

AB Removal of a large suite of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) was measured through both pilot- and full-scale riverbank filtration (RBF) facilities. The pilot-scale RBF effectively reduced low ng/L concentrations of most compounds by greater than 90% following a 36-day experiment. Breakthrough of the conservative tracer occurred after 10 days and reached 90% recovery after 28 days. Only four compounds (diazepam, meprobamate, phenytoin and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) were between 20 and 80% removed, and three compounds (atrazine, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole) were less than 20% removed by the pilot. Removal of compounds through the pilot-scale RBF is consistent with results from two full-scale RBF systems: atrazine, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and sulfamethoxazole persisted through infiltration into drinking water, whereas caffeine, DEET, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, TCEP, triclosan and trimethoprim were removed. Removal during RBF was attributed to (1) microbial degradation for compounds which were either negatively charged or were neutrally charged and had low log K-ow values (such as acetaminophen, caffeine, and trimethoprim), or (2) adsorption for neutrally-charged compounds with high log K-ow values (including estradiol, estrone, ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine, oxybenzone, progesterone, testosterone, and triclosan).

AB Photolytic reactions are often complex, involving various competing or parallel pathways and leading to multiple reaction products. Removal of anthelmintic drugs (AD) - levamisole (LEV), albendazole (ABZ), praziquantel (PZQ), febantel (FEBA) from water and their photodegradation products with reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes were investigated in this work. Simulation of photodegradation of ADs was carried out under laboratory conditions with UV lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm for 4 h.
   Reverse osmosis (LFC-1 and XLE) and tight nanofiltration (NF90) membranes showed good removal (> 83%) of anthelmintic drugs in binary solutions and in mixture. Other nanofiltration (NF270, NF and DK) membranes had rejection between 22 and 45% for smaller drugs (LEV and ALB) and > 90% for PZQ and FEBA. These results show that main rejection mechanism in binary solutions was size exclusion and in mixture additional physico-chemical interactions had influence.
   After the UV treatment anthelmintic drugs were degraded into several photodegradation products (5 for LEV, 2 for ABZ, 1 for PZQ and 8 for FEBA). Reverse osmosis and NF90 membranes removed > 95% of all photodegradation products (except FEBA, around 70%) and other nanofiltration membranes between 33 and 99.99%.

AB Triclosan is widely used as a common bactericide and disinfectant, which can be found in surface and groundwater and also in sewage treatment plants, and its frequent use results in environmental impacts. Thus, there is a need to remove this emerging pollutant, and the adsorption process is a good alternative owing to its ease of operation and low cost. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the adsorption of triclosan, using Moringa oleifera Lam. seed husks functionalized with iron oxide nanoparticles. The kinetic study showed that the adsorption equilibrium occurred in 600 min with an adsorptive capacity of 29.57 mg g(-1), and the best fit was the pseudo-first-order model, and the adsorption isotherms were adjusted in the Langmuir model, obtaining a maximum capacity value of 103.45 mg g(-1). The values of the thermodynamic parameters indicated that biosorption occurred in a spontaneous, exothermic, and reversible manner, and the competition of ions showed that the salts did not interfere with the adsorption of the contaminant. The material was reused for a total of five cycles, indicating that the developed material has a high potential for removing emerging contaminants.

AB A multi-residue method for the extraction and clean-up of sediment samples was developed for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues. Sediment samples were collected in the proximity of sewage water plant in Stockholm, Sweden. Target analytes were the basic beta-blocker propranolol, the neutral neuroleptic carbamazepine and the acidic anticoagulant warfarin, the painkiller diclofenac and the lipid regulator gemfibrozil. The extraction solvent was optimised with regard to pH and organic modifer. Extraction and clean up were performed with liquid-liquid extraction and ultra-sonication followed by solid-phase extraction. One extraction solvent, containing acetone/McIlvaine buffer pH4, provided satisfactory extraction for all substances. LC/MSMS in the MRM mode was used for determination. The recoveries of the extraction and clean-up steps were 60-75% (+/- 2-8%) and LOQs were in the range 0.4-8 ng/g sediment (dry weight). The pharmaceuticals found in the sediment samples were propranolol and carbamazepine, representing substances with basic and neutral properties. Additionally, the samples were analysed with LC/QTOF for verification with the use of accurate mass measurement in the full-scan mode. Pharmaceuticals not represented in the original method were looked for. Non-target pharmaceuticals found using the LC/QTOF system were the basic beta-blocker metoprolol and the acidic painkiller naproxen.

AB Occurrences of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water and sewage water have been widely reported. Investigations show the presence of several classes of pharmaceuticals such as antirheumatics (e.g., diclofenac), analgesics (e.g., propyphenazone), and blood lipid regulators (clofibric acid), even in ground water. Compared to their occurrences in surface water, however, the reported incidences of drugs in ground water are much rarer. This may be due to the input, but also to transport processes and degradation in the aquifer.
   In field studies investigating ground water sampled at a bank infiltration site at Lake Tegel, Berlin, Germany, clofibric acid was found at concentrations up to 290 ng/L, and propyphenazone up to 250 ng/L. whereas concentrations of diclofenac were around the detection limit.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the ground water transport behavior of the pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, propyphenazone, and diclofenac with a laboratory soil column experiment. Results show that clofibric acid exhibits no degradation and almost no retardation (R-f = 1.1). Diclofenac (R-f = 2.0) and propyphenazone (R-f = 1.6) are retarded, whereas significant degradation was not observed for both pharmaceuticals under the prevailing conditions in the soil column. We conclude that the concentration distribution of the pharmaceuticals at the bank filtration site at Lake Tegel is controlled by sorption, desorption, and input variation, rather than by degradation.

AB The Leca River and two beaches close to the north and south margins of the estuary, nowadays an important seaport harbor, show signs of contamination. However, the chemical nature of that contamination is uncertain. Therefore, this study checked for the presence of 11 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) of animal (17 beta-estradiol and estrone), pharmaceutical (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol), and industrial (alkylphenols, alkylphenol ethoxylates, and bisphenol A) origins in water samples collected from six points at the river gradient and at two sites in the coastline (Atlantic Ocean). Along with the EDCs, evaluated by gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) during spring, summer, and autumn, physico-chemical parameters were also assessed and particular attention was given to dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Data showed the presence of high amounts of estrogens (up to 10 ng L-1 for estrone) and industrial compounds (up to 2 mu g L-1 for the nonylphenol ethoxylates) at both river and seacoast. Along with this, clear signs of hypoxia were found in the river (DO < 3 mg L-1 at several sampling sites). Taking into account these issues, it was concluded that there are local conditions for the occurrence of endocrine disruption in aquatic animals.

AB Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the oxidative degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in various waters, by Fe(II)-activated persulfate process. Results show that the Fe2+/S2O82- process is very effective for the elimination of CBZ and characterized by a two-stage kinetics (a rapid initial decay followed by a retardation stage). CBZ degradation reaction was observed to be pH dependent and the optimum pH is 3.0 in the range of 2.00-7.87. The concentration of Fe2+ and S2O82- exhibited a noticeable influence on CBZ removal efficiency, where [S2O82-] exerted more significant effects than that of [Fe2+]. The optimal molar ratio of CBZ, Fe2+, and S2O82- is found to be 1:5:40. The effect of various inorganic anions on CBZ removal was also evaluated under the optimal conditions. The anions NO3-, SO42- and H2PO4- caused a negative effect on the performance of this process, while Cl- interestingly accelerated CBZ degradation. The higher the Cl- concentration, the faster the CBZ decay rate. The intermediates were identified during CBZ degradation with and without the presence of Cl-. The evolution of intermediates for these two scenarios was compared. The decay pathways of CBZ were proposed accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Applying sewage sludge to soil is a common practice in many parts of the world. Thus, pharmaceutical compounds, such as azoles, can be released into the environment after sludge is applied to soil. To understand the fate of clotrimazole and fluconazole (pharmaceuticals used as antifungals in humans) in soil after its amendment with sludge, a reliable and sensitive method has been developed to determine these compounds in the solid and aqueous phases of soil. Desorption of clotrimazole from soil amended with sludge was negligible, whereas a rapid desorption of fluconazole was observed. Dissipation rates of these azoles were determined in amended soil incubated at 25 degrees C with moisture contents ranging from 4.5 to 20%. Clotrimazole was more persistent than fluconazole in dry soil, whereas the contrary occurred in wet soil. Partitioning soil:soil solution of these azoles varied with time and moisture contents. Clotrimazole was found in soil with negligible amounts in soil solution, whereas fluconazole was approximately partitioned 50:50 during the assay time (60d) at any soil moisture content. Occasional rainfall coupled with a relatively low binding soil capacity can result in the contamination of surface and groundwaters by fluconazole, whereas clotrimazole will remain in the soil.

AB This study investigated the transformation kinetics and pathways of four widely used macrolides (MLs), including roxithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin, in dissolved organic matter (DOM) solutions under simulated solar irradiation. The results suggest that the triplet excited state of DOM plays an important role in the photo-transformation of MLs. The transformation products (TPs) of MLs in the presence of natural organic matters were identified by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Statistical analysis data mining procedures, including Venn diagrams and hierarchical clustering, were used to extract the TPs of the MLs. Multiple TPs for the selected MLs (roxithromycin (39), azithromycin (22), erythromycin (19), and clarithromycin (19)) were identified based on the structural information within the MS2 spectra. Most of the TPs are reported here for the first time. These TPs were mapped to the "photometabolome" networks of the MLs via linkage analysis. The results suggest that demethylation and hydroxylation are the most common reactions during the phototransformation of MLs. The products formed via N-demethylation of the desosamine moiety constitute the most abundant TPs. Overall, the combination of statistical analyses and linkage analyses of HRMS data could be a useful and promising method for predicting the degradation processes of ML antibiotics.

AB Using a co-precipitation method, starch-Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (S-Mg/Al LDH) composites were synthesized. Their physicochemical properties were assessed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The quantification of six nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was conducted using real samples (e.g., hospital waste water, river water, sewage treatment plant water, and tablet formulations) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the development of this method, the system was optimized in terms of several key variables (e.g., pH, flow rate, and eluent type/volume). The developed method for NSAIDs exhibited good resolution, sensitivity, reproducibility, and specificity even in complex matrices with limits of detection between 4 and 20 pg/mL. Hence, S-Mg/Al LDH composites were proven to be efficient and fast solid phase extraction (SPE) sorbents for NSAIDs. In addition, each LDH-SPE cartridge showed good reusability without a noticeable change in performance (e.g., up to 30 cycles) and target recoveries between 99.5 - 82.9 %. This work should open up new opportunities for a sesnsitive and sustainable quantitative method for the determination of NSAIDs in complex samples.

AB Experimental studies were conducted to examine the oxidation of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug widely detected in surface waters and sewage treatment effluent, by potassium salts of permanganate (Mn(VII); KMnO4) and ferrate (Fe(VI); K2FeO4). Results show that both Mn(VII) and Fe(VI) rapidly oxidize carbamazepine by electrophilic attack at an olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring, leading to ring-opening and a series of organic oxidation products. Reaction kinetics follow a generalized second-order rate law, with apparent rate constants at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C of 3.0(+/- 0.3) x 10(2) M-1 s(-1) for Mn(VII) and 70(+/- 3) M-1 s(-1) for Fe(VI). Mn(VII) reaction rates exhibit no pH dependence, whereas Fe(VI) reaction rates increase dramatically with decreasing pH, due to changing acid-base speciation of Fe(VI). Further studies with Mn(VII) show that most common nontarget water constituents, including natural organic matter, have no significant effect on rates of carbamazepine oxidation; reduced metals and (bi)sulfide exert a stoichiometric Mn(VII) demand that can be incorporated into the kinetic model. The removal of carbamazepine in two utility source waters treated with KMnO4 agrees closely with predictions from the kinetic model that was parametrized using experiments conducted in deionized water at much higher reagent concentrations.

AB In this work, extraction of acetaminophen (ACTP), currently named as paracetamol, from aqueous solutions by emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) using Aliquat 336 as carrier was investigated. An ELM system is made up of hexane as diluent, Span 80 as the surfactant and potassium chloride as the inner aqueous solution. Influence of operating conditions that affects the permeation of ACTP such as surfactant concentration, extractant concentration, emulsification time, sulfuric acid concentration in external phase, acid type in external phase, internal phase concentration, type of internal phase, stirring speed, volume ratio of internal phase to membrane phase, treatment ratio, ACTP initial concentration and diluent type was examined. Additionally, the effect of KCl concentration in the internal aqueous phase on the stripping of ACTP and the reuse of the recovered membrane was studied. Under most favorable conditions, it was possible to extract practically all of ACTP molecules from the feed external solution. The recovery of the membrane phase was total and the extraction of ACTP was not decreased. The ELM treatment represents a very interesting advanced separation process for the removal of ACTP even from complex matrices such as natural water, sea water and sewage water effluent.

AB Laboratory-scale batch and soil columns experiments were conducted to investigate the attenuation of estrogens (17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) during managed aquifer recharge. The role of microbial activity in the removal of selected estrogens was evaluated by comparing the results from biotic and abiotic batch experiments. Moreover, batch experiments were carried out using the sand media prepared over different acclimation periods to investigate the impact of acclimation periods on the removal of selected estrogens. Batch studies showed that adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism in the removal of 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were attenuated by 99% and 96%, respectively, in batch experiments under oxic conditions. Redox conditions did not show any significant effect on the attenuation of 17 beta-estradiol. However, the net estrogenicity of 17 beta-estradiol remaining was lower under oxic conditions (130 ng estradiol-equivalents/L) than anoxic conditions (970 ng estradiol-equivalents/L). Column studies operated at 17 h of empty bed contact time also demonstrated that removal mechanism of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was more dependent on adsorption than biodegradation.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can be released to coastal waters and affect the endocrine system of marine organisms. To monitor their levels in seawaters, a simple, robust passive sampling method, the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique, was developed with XDA-1 resin as a binding agent. Six EDCs (including three estrogens, two pesticides and bisphenol A) were used to assess the performance of the DGT. The XDA-1 binding gel showed adequate ability for adsorbing EDCs in seawaters. The DGT sampler exhibited linear accumulation for the EDCs during a 15-day deployment and diffusion coefficients and sampling rates were calculated. The DGT measurement was independent of pH in the range 7.0-9.0 and ionic strength in the range 0.4-0.8 M. Field applications of this DGT in a coast of Dalian (China) showed comparable results to those from grab sampling. Five EDCs were detected with concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 19.4 ng L-1. This study is a first attempt to apply DGT sampler for determining EDCs in seawaters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of synthetic antibiotics with a broad active spectrum towards mycoplasma and bacteria (both Gram positive and negative). The contamination of environmental water samples with FQs has been a concern due to the extensive use of them in the veterinary and pharmaceutical industries. Reliable and simple analytical methods are needed for the monitoring of these FQs. An off-line procedure of immunoaffinity extraction (IAE) followed by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectroscopy (CE-MS) has been developed for simultaneous determination of eight typical FQs in environment water. A broad-specific polyclonal antibody was home-prepared and immobilized on a Sepharose 4B stationary phase for sample affinity extraction and the enrichment factor of our columns was about 100. CE-MS was subsequently applied to FQs separation and quantification. The immunoaffinity column was evaluated in the parameters of selectivity, binding capacity, elution protocol, and recovery. Under the optimized conditions, the developed method was successfully applied to analyze FQs spiked with 2.5 nM to 30 nM of environmental water from a local lake, providing satisfactory recoveries from 72% to 112%, and LODs and LOQs ranging from 1.2 nM to 5.0 nM and 4.0 nM to 17 nM, respectively.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazapine (CBZ) readily persists in sewage-water treatment plant wastewaters and finds its way into receiving water bodies. Our study sought to examine the bioaccumulation and toxicity of CBZ using an experimental aquatic trophic chain composed of the green alga. Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacean, Thamnocephalus platyurus, and the cnidarian. Hydra attenuata. Bioaccumulation of CBZ was estimated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and revealed bioaccumulation factors of 2.2 and 12.6, respectively, in algae and crustaceans. No significant bioaccumulation was observed in H. attenuata. In T. platyurus, a strong stimulation of global heme oxidase (HO) (76%), and glutathione-S-transferase activity (130%) but a drastic inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A-like activity was found which suggests alteration of enzyme activity by CBZ. However, in the hydranth H. attenuata, an increase in both global cytochrome and cytochrome P450 3A-like activity was found, while GST activity was inhibited. Lipid peroxidation was reduced in T. platyurus and H. attenuata suggesting that redox activity of the lipophilic CBZ was at play. This study highlighted the processes of carbamazepine toxicity transfer between trophic levels in aquatic organisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Geo-referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for European Rivers (GREAT-ER) model was developed as an aquatic chemical exposure prediction tool for use within environmental risk assessment (ERA) schemes and river basin management. The GREAT-ER software calculates the distribution of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) Of consumer chemicals in surface waters, for individual river stretches, as well as representative average PECs for entire catchments. The system uses an ARC/INFO-ArcView ((R)ESRI) based Geographical Information System (GIS) for data storage and visualization, combined with simple mathematical models for prediction of chemical rate. Use Of GREAT-ER 1.03 to derive PECs is illustrated for Ethinyl Oestradiol, Paracetamol, Aspirin. Dextropropoxyphene, Clofibrate and Oxytetracycline in three river basins, i.e. Aire (UK), Lambro (Italy) and Rur (Germany). In contrast with household consumer chemicals the transformation of pharmaceuticals in the human body needs to be incorporated in the emission estimation. The 'PECinitial' of these pharmaceuticals in surface waters ranges from > 1 mug/l (Oxytetracycline and Paracetarnol) down to < 1 ng/l (Ethinyl Oestradiol). Risk characterization employing PECs or measured environmental concentrations (MECs) and predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PTNECs) from available ecotoxicity data is also reported.

AB The present study was designed to identify recently (or rarely) recognized or unreported substances (RRS or URS) contained in the effluents from water treatment plants in two industrialized urban areas, Gumi and Daegu, in Korea. In addition to 30 initial targets, 72 substances were identified through suspect and non-target screening (SNTS). Among them were 4 RRSs and 22 URSs, respectively. The quantitative analyses were applied to 35 pharmaceuticals, 15 pesticides, 13 poly-/perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), 2 organophosphate flame re-tardants (OPFRs), 2 corrosion inhibitors, and 3 metabolites. The highest average concentration was observed for benzotriazole, followed by those for niflumic acid, and metformin. Effluents from Gumi mainly contained benzotriazole and metformin whereas niflumic acid and tramadol were the major components in effluents from Daegu. According to a scoring system based on risk relevant parameters, higher priorities were given to telmisartan, PFOA, and cimetidine. Yet, priorities for some substances were area specific (e.g., benzotriazole from Gumi, PFASs from Daegu), reflecting differences in industry profiles and populations. Many of the RRSs and URSs were recognized as potential hazards. The new identifications and evaluations should be taken into consideration for constant monitoring and management, as do the previously recognized contaminants.

AB The uptake of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) by carrot and lettuce was investigated. Degradation of PBDEs in soil in the absence of the plants was discarded. Different carrot (Nantesa and Chantenay) and lettuce (Batavia Golden Spring and Summer Queen) varieties were grown in fortified or contaminated compost-amended soil mixtures under greenhouse conditions. After plant harvesting, roots (core and peel) and leaves were analyzed separately for carrot, while for lettuce, leaves and hearts were analyzed together. The corresponding bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were calculated. In carrots, a concentration gradient of 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-138) became evident that decreased from the root peel via root core to the leaves. For decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) at the low concentration level (7 and 20 ng g(-1)), the leaves incorporated the highest concentration of the target substance. For lettuce, a decrease in the BCF value (from 0.24 to 0.02) was observed the higher the octanol-water partition coefficient, except in the case of BDE-183 (BCF = 0.51) and BDE-209 (BCF values from 0.41 to 0.74). Significant influence of the soils and crop varieties on the uptake could not be supported. Metabolic debromination, hydroxylation or methylation of the target PBDEs in the soil-plant system was not observed.

AB The occurrence and seasonal distribution of 14 pharmaceutical substances of different classes were investigated in two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) supplied by the two main Italian rivers, the Po and the Adige (Northern Italy). The therapeutic categories of the selected pharmaceuticals included anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, lipid regulators, diuretics, anti-epileptics, antibiotics and a steroidal hormone. The named compounds were assessed in samples collected from the river water inlet and after each purification stage (sand filtration, ozone treatment, granular active carbon (GAC)). Six of the 14 selected pharmaceuticals were found in all analysed samples, with concentration levels ranging from 1 ng l(-1) for atorvastatin to 69 ng l(-1) for atenolol in the drinking water produced. The granular active carbon stage resulted the most efficient in eliminating the examined chemicals from the water (removal range: 12-95%, average: 68%), while the sand filtration stage resulted the least effective treatment (removal range: 4-37%, average: 13%). The observed differences between winter and summer conditions, in terms of residual concentrations and number of detected analytes, seemed to depend mainly on the quality of the river water supplies. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported data on the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water obtained from the water treatment of these two rivers.

ID FORECASTS; MODELS; RISK
AB The heavy civil engineering industry (railways, sewage-treatment, chemical and pharmaceutical facilities, oil and gas facilities, etc.) is one of the major contributors to the British economy and generally involves a high level of investment. Clients in this industry are demanding accurate cost estimates, proper analysis of out-turn cost and cost escalation, and a high quality risk analysis throughout the construction processes. Current practices in the industry have suggested that there is a lack of structured methodologies and systematic cost escalation approaches to achieve an appropriate cost analysis at the outset Of projects and throughout the construction processes. In this context the prime objective of this research work is to develop a structured cost escalation methodology for improving estimating management and control in the heavy engineering industry construction processes. The methodology is composed of a forecasting model to predict cost indices of major items in industry and a risk knowledge-base model for identifying and quantifying causes of cost escalations. This paper reviews and discusses a knowledge based model for applying a cost escalation factor The cost escalation factor is made up of market variation, a risk element, and a component for bias. A knowledge elicitation strategy was employed to obtain the required knowledge for the model. The strategy included questionnaires, interviews, and workshops, and deliverables came in the form of influences and their effect on project cost escalation. From these deliverables, a decision support system and specifications for applying cost escalation to base estimates are presented.

AB Environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals were chosen according to human consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment like sewage plant effluents, rivers and groundwater to investigate their behavior during oxidative water treatment. Derived from data compilation in literature the lipid lowering agent clofibric acid and the analgesic agents ibuprofen and diclofenac were selected. Analyses of the acidic compounds were carried out after solid-phase extraction and online derivatization in the GC injector by means of single ion monitoring (SIM) GC/MS. Oxidation experiments with the aim to degrade the pharmaceuticals were carried out in bench scale using ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide (advanced oxidation process). Under the specific reaction conditions only diclofenac was degraded by ozone to about 3% of its initial concentration. The combined application of ozone and hydrogen peroxide leading to OH-radical formation improved the degradation efficiency of all investigated compounds. The application of increased oxidant concentration resulted in a better degradation of all compounds to more than 90% at a concentration of 3.7 mg l(-1) ozone and 1.4 mg l(-1) hydrogen peroxide and to more than 98% at a concentration of 5.0 mg l(-1) ozone and 1.8 mg l(-1) hydrogen peroxide. At the applied conditions no reaction products could be detected by GC/MS analyses after derivatization of acidic functional groups. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most used pharmaceutical drugs, due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties that turn it into a primary choice in varied pathologies and conditions. However, and despite its massive use, acetaminophen is not exempt of adverse effects, especially when administered in over dosage, which are related to the formation of toxic metabolites by oxidative pathways. It is thus possible to observe that toxicity caused by acetaminophen is usually mediated by reactive oxygen species and can result in multiple effects, ranging from protein denaturation to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. The occurrence of acetaminophen has been reported in the aquatic environment, being important to address the potential exertion of toxic effects on nontarget environmentally exposed organisms. The present study intended to characterize the effects of acute acetaminophen exposure on physiological traits (antioxidant defense, oxidative damage) of two species of bivalves, namely, the edible clams Venerupis decussata and Venerupis philippinarum. Results showed a significant increase in all oxidative stress biomarkers, evidencing the bioactivation of acetaminophen into a deleterious prooxidant, triggering the onset of deleterious effects. Furthermore, strong interspecific differences were observed among responses of the two tested species, which was a major issue due to intrinsic ecological implications when one considers that both species share the same habitat.

AB In the present investigation, the most commonly used pharmaceutical drug Ibuprofen (IB) was exposed to an Indian major carp Cirrhinus mrigala under static bioassay method to estimate its toxicological effects for a period of 35 days. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) of IB to the fish C. mrigala for 24h was found to be 142 ppm. In sublethal treatment (1/10th of LC 50 24h value, 14.2 ppm), a significant decrease in erythrocyte (RBC), mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and plasma protein levels were observed throughout the study period when compare to that of their respective controls. In contrast, haemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean cellular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), leucocyte (WBC), plasma glucose and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were increased in this study period. On the other hand, a mixed trend was noticed in aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) enzyme activity. Alterations of these parameters can be effectively used as potential biomarkers in monitoring of IB toxicity in the aquatic organisms. However, more detailed studies on these specific biomarkers are needed to assess the impacts of human pharmaceutical drugs in the field of pharmacotoxicology and aquatic toxicology.

AB Vacuum collected black (toilet) water contains hormones and pharmaceuticals in relatively high concentrations (mu g/L to mg/L range) and separate specific treatment has the potential of minimizing their discharge to surface waters. In this study, the fate of estrogens (natural and synthetical hormones) and pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, metoprolol, propranolol, cetirizine, doxycycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) in the anaerobic treatment of vacuum collected black water followed by nitrogen removal by partial nitritation-anammox was investigated. A new analytical method was developed to detect the presence of several compounds in the complex matrix of concentrated black water. Detected concentrations in black water ranged from 1.1 mu g/L for carbamazepine to >1000 mu g/L for paracetamol. Anaerobic treatment was only suitable to remove the majority of paracetamol (>90%). Metoprolol was partly removed (67%) during aerobic treatment. Deconjugation could have affected the removal efficiency of ibuprofen as concentrations even increased during anaerobic treatment and only after the anammox treatment 77% of ibuprofen was removed. The presence of persistent micro-pollutants (diclofenac, carbamazepine and cetirizine), which are not susceptible for biodegradation, makes the application of advanced physical and chemical treatment unavoidable.

AB The uptake of polar organic contaminants into polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) varies with environmental factors, such as water flow rate To evaluate the influence of water flow rate on the uptake of contaminants into POCIS, flow-controlled field experiments were conducted with POCIS deployed in channel systems through which treated sewage effluent flowed at rates between 2.6 and 37 cm/s Both pharmaceutical POCIS and pesticide POCIS were exposed to effluent for 21 d and evaluated for uptake of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting substances (EDS). The pesticide POCIS,had higher uptake rates for PPCPs and EDS than the pharmaceutical POCIS, but thew are some practical advantages to using pharmaceutical POCIS. The uptake of contaminants into POCIS increased with flow rate, but these effects were relatively small (i e., less than twofold) for most of the test compounds There. was no relationship observed between the hydrophobicity (log octanol/water partition coefficient. log K-OW) of model compounds and the effects of flow rate on the uptake kinetics by POCIS These data indicate that water flow rate has a relatively minor influence on the accumulation of PPCPs and EDS into POCIS.

AB In this study, adsorption affinity of a raw clinoptilolite (RC) modified with Saponin (RC-Saponin) and Brij 35 (RC-Brij) surfactants was investigated to adsorb estriol (E3) from wastewater. The effect of pH, amount of sorbent, contact time, and temperature was evaluated. The results for RC and RC-Saponin confirmed that the Langmuir isotherm had an excellent agreement with the experimental data. However, for RC-Brij, the Freundlich model had excellent correlation with the experimental data. The results indicated that RC-Saponin was a more effective adsorbent compared to the two other samples. Moreover, the lumped technique was used to solve the bed equations, to predict the trend of the breakthrough curve, to obtain model parameters. The agreement between experimental data and kinetic models indicated that the intra-particle diffusion model had a better behaviour compared to other models. The thermodynamic parameters of Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes were obtained.

AB Catalytic oxygen (O-2) activation for oxidative removal of pollutants under ambient condition is important for pollution control. Herein, we report a hybrid of MnO catalyst confined in a porous carbon matrix on a graphite felt support (MnO@C/GF) for electro-activation of O-2 toward degradation of various pollutants at ambient condition. The electro-assisted catalytic wet air oxidation (ECWAO) process on anodic MnO@C/GF is able to completely mineralize dyes and typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Mechanistic studies indicate the oxidation of the organic pollutants in the ECWAO process involves chemisorption of O-2 on MnO, activation of the chemisorbed oxygen species via electro-oxidation reaction, and oxidation of organic pollutants by the activated chemisorbed oxygen species. The carbon matrix prevents MnO leaching during the ECWAO process, thus endowing the composite with excellent stability and reusability. The process demonstrates high efficiency, low energy input and environmental friendliness, exhibiting a great potential for practical wastewater treatment.

AB Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated with Ni-Co alloy nanoparticles (NiCo@NCNTs) were readily synthesized by annealing Ni/Co salts with dicyandiamide. The magnetic nanocarbons were assembled as a flat membrane for heterogeneous degradation of organic toxins. The synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and metal alloy encapsulation significantly enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of NCNTs in catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for purification of an emerging pollutant, ibuprofen. The hybrid catalyst yielded a fast reaction rate of 0.31 min(-1), which was 23.4 and 5.8 times higher than that of pristine CNTs and monometallic (Ni or Co) encased CNTs, respectively. The robust membrane catalysis was further confirmed by degrading other organic aqueous pollutants, such as naproxen, sulfachloropyridazine, phenol, methylene blue, and methyl orange. Mechanistic investigation was performed using electron paramagnetic resonance and competitive radical screening tests, which indicated that radical (center dot OH and SO4 center dot-) oxidation and nonradical pathway co-existed and played critical roles for catalytic degradation. The study provides a novel advanced oxidation system with catalytic membrane for wastewater remediation.

AB Antibiotics are emerging pollutants released into the environment through wastewater and manure or effluents from livestock plants. Compared to the wide literature on the effects of antibiotics on the development of drug resistant bacteria and on the adverse effects on animals and human beings, the effects on plants are less investigated. Here we evaluated the effects of four antibiotics (cloramphenicol: CAP, spiramycin: SPR, spectinomycin: SPT, vancomycin: VAN) belonging to different chemical groups, on seed germination and root development of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. San Marzano). Specifically, seed germination and root elongation kinetics, as well as the number of mithotic figures in root apical meristem, were studied in relation to different concentrations of each antibiotic (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 mg L-1) for 10 and 7 days, respectively. Results showed that seed germination was not affected, but root development (root elongation kinetics and cell division) was impaired at concentrations from 10 mg L-1 (SPT) and 100 mg L-1 (CAP) to 1000 mg L-1 (SPR and VAN).

AB The aim of our study was to assess the aerobic biodegradation of four selected sulfonamides (sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine and sulfathiazole) using water samples drawn from highly polluted rivers. Additionally, we aimed to identify the factors that have a significant effect on the process efficiency.
   The 19 water samples were collected from Brynica and Czarna Przemsza rivers (in Poland) at the same location at approximately monthly intervals. A characteristic feature of the results is the presence of significant differences between the rates of sulfonamides biodegradation in particular samples.
   The sulfonamide most resistant to biodegradation was sulfamethoxazole, whereas sulfathiazole was most biodegradable. Seasonal variations and related microbial population changes had the most significant effects on sulfonamides biodegradation, e.g., the studied process was highly inhibited during wintertime. A decrease in the biodegradation rate in the river water could be caused by an accidental water pollution by industrial wastewater with heavy metals, an increase in salinity and a decrease in pH, and turbidity.

AB A simple and cost effective analytical system combining flow injection (FI) continuous liquid-liquid extraction and sequential injection colorimetric detection was exploited. The standard or sample was injected into a reagent stream to form a less polar ion-association compound in the aqueous phase before merging with organic solvent to produce tiny segments of aqueous and organic phases alternately. The extraction occurred at the interface of the two phases while they were flowing through an extraction coil to be collected in a test tube. Phase separation occurred in the test tube, then the organic phase was aspirated by a sequential injection (SI) system to monitor the absorbance signal with a simple LED-LDR colorimeter. The extraction and detection processes could be operated independently. That means that while the detection of the signal was in operation, a new sample could be immediately injected for the new cycle of extraction to minimize the use of chemicals and time consumption. The system has been successfully demonstrated for the determination of anionic surfactant in wastewater samples and diphenhydramine hydrochloride in pharmaceutical samples.

AB The effect of colloids on the occurrence, phase distribution and photolysis of twenty-seven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) was studied in domestic and livestock wastewaters (DW and LW), respectively. Filtered water (<1 mu m) was separated into permeate (<1 kDa) and retentate (1 kDa-1 mu m) by cross flow ultrafiltration. Results indicated that total concentration of EOCs ranged from 1220 ng L-1 in permeate of DW to 5065 ng L-1 in retentate of LW. The average EOC fraction associated with colloids was 13.5% and 14.4% in OW and LW. Most of the EOCs exhibited pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics in all water samples. Control experiments using glass and quartz reactors showed that UV light was more effective on the photolysis of most EOCs. The EOCs photolysis in the three fractions of DW and LW could be accelerated or inhibited compared to ultrapure water with the enhancement factor ranging from -0.94 to 7.33. The impact of colloids on the photolysis of EOCs depended on the compound and the source of water. The photolysis of most EOCs in permeates and filtrates was generally accelerated, while inhibited in the retentates, which could be attributed to the relatively high dissolved organic carbon contents in retentates.

AB Due to differences in stereostructure, enantiomeric compositions and enantiomeric ratios (ERs) of chiral compounds can be used to discriminate environmental processes such as abiotic and biotic degradation/transformation. In this study, the ERs of two chiral polycyclic musks, 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN), were investigated in the sediments of Zhujiang River and Dongjiang River in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), as well as in those of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai City. The results indicated that ERcis of HHCB varied significantly, ranging from 1.09 to 1.53 and 1.40 to 1.48 in the PRD and Suzhou Creek samples, respectively, whereas ERtrans of HHCB exhibited limited variation, ranging from 0.98 to 1.10 and 0.98 to 1.05 for Pearl River and Suzhou Creek samples, respectively. In addition, ERs of AHTN varied substantially from 1.10 to 1.34 and 1.17 to 1.28 in the PRD and Suzhou Creek, respectively. These results suggest that HHCB in the sediment in the study area underwent biotic degradation and the preferential biotransformation isomer was (4R,7S)-HHCB, while AHTN simultaneously underwent a certain degree of biotic degradation/transformation.

AB Clofibric acid is the active metabolite of several fibrate drugs prescribed to reduce blood cholesterol levels. It is persistent and widely detected in the environment. Clofibric acid toxicity was assessed using three estuarine organisms: an alga (Dunaliella tertiolecta), a crustacean (Palaemonetes pugio), and a fish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Mortality and sublethal physiological responses (protein, lipid, cholesterol, and cytochrome P450 levels) were examined. Clofibric acid did not significantly affect cell density or growth rate of D. tertiolecta (concentrations <= 1000 mu g/L). Survival of P. pugio and E heteroclitus were also unaffected at clofibric acid concentrations <= 1000 mu g/L. In addition, no significant changes in the sublethal test endpoints were found. An additional chronic (17-day) exposure of F heteroclitus to clofibric acid (10 mu g/L) was conducted and found no effects on survival or sublethal endpoints. The rabbit polyclonal CYP450 4A antibody did cross react with E heteroclitus, demonstrating that a CYP4A-like isoform is present in this teleost species and may be used in future induction studies. Clofibric acid, however, did not alter CYP4A levels in F heteroclitus. Measured concentrations in the environment have not exceeded 10 mu g/L. Therefore, the results of this study indicate a low risk of adverse effects from environmental exposure to clofibric acid for the species tested. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A hierarchical polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane functionalized with catalytic zero valent iron nanoparticles via polydopamine/polyethyleneimine was successfully fabricated. The catalytic membrane exhibited excellent degradation performance for toxic 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), Rhodamine B (RB), and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2-CP). With a trace amount of H2O2 flowing over the surface of the catalytic membrane, highly active sites were monitored. The active surfaces generated a large amount of center dot OH radicals via decomposition of H2O2. The radicals unselectively oxidized a wide range of recalcitrant organic pollutants. Specifically, similar to 80% RB and almost 100% 4-NP and 2-CP were degraded within 30 min in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, total organic carbon analysis revealed that recalcitrant RB, 4-NP and 2-CP molecules could be partially mineralized into carbon dioxide and water inside the membrane. The degradation mechanism was related to a Fenton-like reaction. The catalytic membrane showed high regeneration ability with approximately 100% activity retention after four consecutive use cycles.

AB In this study, a comparison between electrochemically activated peroxomonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) using carbon anodes was conducted for the first time. PMS activation was achieved using graphite (GR) and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) anodes, which significantly promoted the degradation of organic pollutants sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The radical probing and scavenging experiments demonstrated that SO4 center dot- was the dominant reactive species (64.93% relative contribution ratio). By contrast, nonradical oxidation accounted for 95.79% relative contribution ratio to organic pollutants degradation in electrochemically activated PDS process under the identical conditions. The structure difference between PDS (-O4S-SO4-) and PMS (HO-SO4-) led to their various reactivities. The electrochemically activated PMS molecule (PMS*, acting as nonradical oxidation) had higher reactivity and lower stability than electrochemically activated PDS molecule (PDS*, acting as nonradical oxidation), thus to quickly decomposed to SO4 center dot-. Interestingly, electrochemically activated PMS (radical oxidation system) exhibited stronger resistance towards water background components than PDS (nonradical oxidation system), being suitable to treat the complicated water and wastewater containing various ions and organic compounds.

AB A combination of thermophilic aerobic membrane reactor (TAMR) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) was studied by means of two pilot plants at semi-industrial scale in order to simulate the new configuration adopted in a full-scale facility for the treatment of high strength aqueous wastes. Aqueous wastes with high contents of organic pollutants were treated by means of the TAMR technology, progressively increasing the organic load (3-12 kg(COD)m(-3) d(-1)). A mixture of municipal wastewater and thermophilic permeate was fed to the CAS plant. The main results are the following: achievement of a high COD removal yield by both the TAMR (78%) and the CAS (85%) plants; ammonification of the organic nitrogen under thermophilic conditions and subsequent mesophilic nitrification; capacity of the downstream mesophilic process to complete the degradation of the organic matter partially obtained by the TAMR process and precipitation of phosphorus as vivianite and carbonatehy-droxylapatite in the TAMR plant.

AB A comprehensive analytical procedure for a reliable identification of nontarget polar contaminants in aquatic sediments was developed, based on the application of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOFMS). The procedure was applied for the analysis of freshwater sediment that was highly impacted by wastewater discharges from the pharmaceutical industry. A number of different contaminants were successfully identified owing to the high mass accuracy of the QTOFMS system, used in combination with high chromatographic resolution of UHPLC. The major compounds, identified in investigated sediment, included a series of polypropylene glycols (n = 3-16), alkylbenzene sulfonate and benzalkonium surfactants as well as a number of various pharmaceuticals (chlorthalidone, warfarin, terbinafine, torsemide, zolpidem and macrolide antibiotics). The particular advantage of the applied technique is its capability to detect less known pharmaceutical intermediates and/or transformation products, which have not been previously reported in freshwater sediments.

AB An anaerobic immobilized fixed bed bioreactor system was studied for treatment of herbal-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The biofilm loss rate (R-S), shear stress (a), biofilm thickness (L-i) and biomass concentration (X-t) were investigated for various flow rates applied to the bioreactor during the experimental studies. Some relationships applicable to a fixed bed reactor were obtained between biofilm loss rate, shear stress, biofilm thickness and specific flow rate (Q) with good accuracy. It was evident that shear stress and biofilm loss rate increased with increase in biofilm thickness. A similar trend was also observed with an increase in flow velocity. It was found that shear stress plays a major role in the biofilm detachment mechanism, The biofilm. thickness determined in the present investigation was,in the range of 0.5 nun to 3.5 mm, and the biofilm. loss rate was estimated in the range of 1.7 x 10(-4) to 73 x 10(-4) kgCOD m(-2)d(-1) at flow rate ranging between 5.0 and 50 1 d(-1).

AB Many pharmaceutical industry processes use halogenated aromatics, other than chlorinated, as solvents or starting materials, and these can often exhibit inhibitory effects affecting normal process operation of biological Wastewater TreatmentPlants (WWTPs). A mixed culture, initially selected for growth at the expense of chlorobenzene as the sole source of carbon and energy, was enriched with a mixture containing bromobenzene, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene and iodobenzene. After three weeks of continuous operation in a stirred tank bioreactor, none of these halogenated compounds were detected in the growth medium. The complete mineralization of each of the compounds with concomitant release of stoichiometric amounts of halide was then investigated individually in batch experiments. Mineralization of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene up to their maximum solubility level (in minimal salts media) was achieved, while fluorobenzene was not biodegraded but simply volatilized. The complete mineralization of iodobenzene up to 150 mgl(-1) (in 18 hours) with complete recovery of iodide is particularly interesting since published literature shows no previous report of similar results. Preliminary characterization has shown that the cultures responsible for iodobenzene and bromobenzene biodegradation are strains of Pseudomonas putida.

AB Carbamazepine, a widely consumed psychotropic pharmaceutical, is one of the most commonly detected drugs in the environment. To better assess the environmental persistence of carbamazepine in aqueous matrices, the effect of pH and dissolved oxygen on the direct photodegradation rate of this pharmaceutical was evaluated in this study, using simulated solar irradiation. In order to follow the degradation and the emergence of photoproducts, a micellar electrokinetic chromatography based method was developed, consisting on the use of a dynamically coated capillary column. The developed methodology showed good repeatability and efficiency in the separation of carbamazepine and photoirradiation products. Also, seven photodegradation products were identified by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), including the known carcinogenic acridine that was produced under all the pH and oxygenation levels studied and one newly identified photoproduct.
   This paper gives new insights into the role of dissolved oxygen on the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine. The results indicate that acidic pH, combined with the absence of dissolved oxygen in the aqueous matrix, results in very high direct photodegradation rates. At basic pH, dissolved oxygen does not interfere with the process and very low rates were observed. At environmentally relevant conditions, carbamazepine was shown to persist in the environment from 4.5 to 25 days. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low levels of pharmaceuticals have been detected in many countries in surface waters. As a wide range of pharmaceuticals can reach aquatic environments, a selection of molecules to survey is the first step before implementing a monitoring program. We used a simple equation to calculate Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs), adapted from the European Medicine Agency model used for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of human pharmaceutical. Excretion fractions for pharmaceuticals were determined for 76 compounds. Using year 2004 French drug consumption data, we determined aquatic PECs for 112 parent molecules and several metabolites. Considering excretion fractions of pharmaceuticals can lead to drastically reduce predicted concentrations reaching the aquatic environment and help to target environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and metabolites. Calculated PECs using the described methodology are consistent with French field measurements. The simple model for calculating PECs can be used as a valuable estimation of the exposure. Risk quotient ratios were also calculated. Due to the lack of ecotoxicological data, the use of PEC/PNEC ratios is not enough informative to prioritize pharmaceuticals likely to pose a risk for surface waters. Alternative ways to prioritize risk to pharmaceuticals, combining PEC, pharmacological, and ecotoxicological data available from the literature, should be implemented.

AB This chapter explores the possibilities of using coffee processing by-products (e.g., coffee husks, coffee grounds and coffee beans) for environmental applications (e.g., adsorption of heavy metals, dye removal etc.). The elaboration of char from coffee processing by-products is presented and some applications devoted to the removal of cations and dyes from wastewater. The preparation of activated carbon (AC) is detailed. Chemical and physical activation methods are described as well as the characteristics of the AC obtained (textural, structural properties and surface chemistry). The role of the activation process on the adsorption of cations, anions, and organic molecules (pharmaceutical products, pesticides, micropollutants) contained in water is discussed. The use of AC for gas treatment is detailed, especially for acid pollutants (H2S, NO2) and CO2 coming from postcombustion. The last part of this chapter is devoted to the preparation of AC for catalytic application (decomposition of organic molecules). For this specific application, AC has to be functionalized (sulfonation of the surface, or impregnation of K and Fe) in order to obtain catalytic properties.

AB This study evaluated the toxicity and cellular stresses of carbamazepine (CBZ) on Chlamydomonas mexicana and Scenedesmus obliquus, and its biodegradation by both microalgal species. The growth of both microalgal species decreased with increase of CBZ concentration. The growth of S. obliquus was significantly inhibited (97%) at 200 mg CBZ L-1, as compared to the control after 10 days; whereas, C. mexicana showed 30% inhibition at the same experimental conditions. Biochemical characteristics including total chlorophyll, carotenoid contents and enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) for both species were affected by CBZ at relatively high concentration. C. mexicana and S. obliquus could achieve a maximum of 35% and 28% biodegradation of CBZ, respectively. Two metabolites (10,11-dihydro-10,11-expox ycarbamazepine and n-hydroxy-CBZ) were identified by UPLC-MS, as a result of CBZ biodegradation by C. mexicana. This study demonstrated that C. mexicana was more tolerant to CBZ and could be used for treatment of CBZ contaminated wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to find out whether the use of a combination of nanofiltration (NF) and solar photo-Fenton is more efficient than photo-Fenton alone as a tertiary treatment. Five different pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole) dissolved (100 mu g L-1) in natural water were preconcentrated by NF and treated by solar photo-Fenton. Photo-Fenton was operated at pH 5 with 5 mg L-1 of Fe2+. The NF system consists of two membranes operating simultaneously with a total surface area of 5.2 m(2). The photo-Fenton experiments were carried out in a 3 m(2) CPC solar pilot plant with a 35 L total volume. Hydrogen peroxide consumption and the pharmaceutical removal rate were used as the key evaluation parameters. It was demonstrated that at higher initial concentrations of microcontaminants, hydrogen peroxide is used more efficiently and NF pretreatment also reduced the photo-Fenton treatment time. Combined NF and photo-Fenton treatment was therefore found to be a promising approach for wastewater containing extremely low concentrations of microcontaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In an effort to validate the use of ozone for contaminant oxidation and disinfection in water reclamation, extensive pilot testing was performed with ozone/H2O2 and biological activated carbon (BAG) at the Reno-Stead Water Reclamation Facility in Reno, Nevada. Three sets of samples were collected over a five-month period of continuous operation, and these samples were analyzed for a suite of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), total estrogenicity, and several microbial surrogates, including the bacteriophage MS2, total and fecal coliforms, and Bacillus spores. Based on the high degree of microbial inactivation and contaminant destruction, this treatment train appears to be a viable alternative to the standard indirect potable reuse (IPR) configuration (i.e., membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, UV/H2O2, and aquifer injection), particularly for inland applications where brine disposal is an issue. Several issues, including regrowth of coliform bacteria in the BAG process, must be addressed prior to full-scale implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological treatment processes are probably important for preventing the proliferation of steroidal compounds in the environment, and a growing number of reports suggest that nitrification may play a role in removing these chemicals from wastewater. The link between nitrification and biotransformation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was investigated using enriched cultures of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizers. Batch experiments showed that ring A of EE2 is the site of electrophilic initiating reactions, including conjugation and hydroxylation. Ring A was also cleaved before any of the other rings were broken, which is likely because the frontier electron density of the ring A carbon units is higher than those of rings B, C, or D. EE2 and NH3 were degraded in the presence of an ammonium monooxygenase (AMO) containing protein extract, and the reaction stoichiometry was consistent with a conceptual model involving a binuclear copper site located at the AMO active site. Continuous tests showed a linear relationship between nitrification and EE2 removal in enriched nitrifying cultures. Taken together, these results support the notion that EE2 biotransformation can be cometabolically mediated under operating conditions that allow for enrichment of nitrifiers.

AB Patent data present a number of advantages compared to other alternative measures of innovation. This paper presents research on the use of environmentally relevant technology patent data using a comprehensive analysis method to analyze the development of green technology innovation in China in 1990-2015. From the analysis, it can be concluded that during the period of 2000-2015, China's environmental-related technology innovation made great progress and was at the forefront of green technology growth; in particular, the areas of water and wastewater treatment, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, lighting, improvements related to bulk or fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles, and other technologies made great achievements. These technologies are closely related to environmental policies, such as climate change mitigation and green industry transformation, for which China has been advocating for more than a decade. However, after analyzing China's green development, it was found that, although some of the indicators, environmental-related patents, and green developments have made great progress, complete reliance on green technology is far off in the future.

AB Biophenols are highly prized for their free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities. Olive mill wastewaters (OMWWs) are rich in biophenols. For this reason, there is a growing interest in the recovery and valorization of these compounds. Applications for the encapsulation have increased in the food industry as well as the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields, among others. Advancements in micro-fabrication methods are needed to design new functional particles with target properties in terms of size, size distribution, and functional activity. This paper describes the use of the membrane emulsification method for the fine-tuning of microparticle production with biofunctional activity. In particular, in this pioneering work, membrane emulsification has been used as an advanced method for biophenols encapsulation. Catechol has been used as a biophenol model, while a biophenols mixture recovered from OMWWs were used as a real matrix. Water-in-oil emulsions with droplet sizes approximately 2.3 times the membrane pore diameter, a distribution span of 0.33, and high encapsulation efficiency (98% +/- 1% and 92% +/- 3%, for catechol and biophenols, respectively) were produced. The release of biophenols was also investigated.

AB Antibiotics are currently considered to be an emerging threat to the aquatic environment if left untreated. Persistence of antibiotic compounds has been detected in vast aquatic environments, including wastewater. This involves the development and increase of antibiotic resistance and bacterial presence in the aquatic communities. Several previous studies have been conducted for the removal of micro-contaminants by ozonation. The comprehensive study on residual antibiotics effect to antibiotic resistance transfer before and after oxidation has not yet been explored. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to (1) investigate the antibiotic resistance growth under the presence of tetracycline in short and long period without oxidation process and to (2) look into the amount of residual tetracycline that persists after oxidation and its possible effect in potentially influencing antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transfer among bacteria. As shown in the results, a few ppm or few hundred ppb of tetracycline, regardless of ozonation, enhanced the ARG transfer compared to control. These results implied that ARG transfer can be enhanced by incomplete removal of micro-contaminants in the environment.

AB Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), photolysis (PL), and photocatalysis (PC) were applied to increase the biodegradability of wastewaters effluents sampled from a plant collecting both municipal wastewaters and aqueous waste. In PEC, the catalyst was a porous TiO2 photoanode obtained by plasma electrolytic oxidation and electrically polarized during operation. In PC a dispersion of TiO2 powders was used. The same irradiation shielding, and similar catalyst surface areas were set for PC and PEC, allowing a straightforward evaluation of the catalytic effect of the electrical polarization of TiO2 during operation. Results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color removal rates follow the order: PEC > PL and PEC > PC. The specific biodegradability rate (SBR) increased following the same order, the PEC process allowing SBR values more than twice higher than PL and PC. The operating costs were calculated based on the electrical energy per order of COD, color, and SBR values, demonstrating that at the laboratory scale the energy demand of PEC is significantly lower than the other two tested processes.

AB Global increase in the use of pharmaceutically-active compounds (PhACs), and their insufficient removal in wastewater treatment plants, have resulted in their continuous release into the marine environment. We investigated the use of the solitary ascidians Herdmania momus, Microcosmus exasperatus, and Styela plicata as bioindicators of three common PhACs in the Israeli coastal waters: Bezafibrate, carbamazepine and diclofenac. Both the Mediterranean and the Red-Sea coasts were found contaminated with PhACs, detected at all 11 sampling sites, with four sites contaminated with all three studied PhACs. Diclofenac was most frequent, present in nine of the 11 sites with concentrations reaching 51.9 ng/g of dry weight sample (dw). Bezafibrate and carbamazepine reached concentrations of 47.8 ng/g dw and 14.3 ng/g dw, respectively. The alarming detection of such high concentrations of PhACs in ascidians along Israel's coasts demonstrates both the extent of PhACs contamination in the region, and the potential of ascidians as bioindicators, and emphasizes the urgent need for additional research into PhAC contamination sources and effects.

AB This paper describes the development of an integrative embryo-toxicity assay in Japanese medaka allowing analysis of several toxicological endpoints together in a same individual. In this assay, embryos are topically exposed, and survival, hatching success, malformations, biometry, behaviour, and target gene expression are subsequently analysed in each individual. This assay was applied to oxazepam, an anxiolytic pharmaceutical compound currently found in wastewater treatment plant effluent. Even if oxazepam accumulation in embryos was very low, it caused spinal and cardiac malformations, delayed growth, erratic swimming and deregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and mitochondrial metabolism. Relationship between gene deregulation, abnormal behaviour, and developmental anomalies was demonstrated. This assay is sensitive enough to detect adverse effects at low chemical concentrations and at multiple endpoints in a unique fish embryo. This integrative embryo-toxicity assay is a powerful tool to characterize the spectrum of effects of new chemicals and also to link effects induced at different molecular, tissue and physiological levels.

AB In this work, we reported the successful conversion of the industrial SLS originated from black liquor to low-cost porous carbon with tunable microstructure and ultrahigh adsorption performance of tetracycline (TC) from water via pre-carbonation and KOH activation. Comparatively, LCA-850-4 with a very high specific surface area (2805.8 m(2)/g) and pore volume (1.45 cm(3)/g) showed a maximum adsorption of 1173 mg/g at 298 K, which was far higher than other reported adsorbents. LCA-850-4 exhibited excellent adsorption over a broad pH range. Kinetics and isotherm data was well fitted to the pseudo-second order rate and Langmuir model, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. The results are of importance to indicate LCA-850-4 with fast kinetics and excellent reusability possessed the huge potentials in practical pharmaceutical antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB Tramadol is a widely used analgesic with additional antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. This compound has been reported in continental waters reaching concentrations of mu g/L as a consequence of its inefficient removal in sewage treatment plants and increasing use over time. In this study, European chubs (Squalius cephalus) were exposed to 1 mu g/L of tramadol in water for 42 days with a subsequent 14 days of depuration. Our results revealed that chubs exposed to this analgesic underwent changes in their behaviour as compared to the control group. The behavioural outcome was also influenced by the individual concentration of tramadol in brain tissue. In particular, experimental fish presented anxiolytic-like effects, characterized by less bold and less social individuals. Exposed animals were less frequently out of the shelter and moved a shorter distance, indicating that they explored the new environment less during the boldness test. In the novel object recognition experiment, although they distinguished the new item, they examined it less and displayed a reduced activity. Shoal cohesion was disrupted as observed in an increased distance between individuals. After the depuration phase, this alteration remained whereas the boldness effect disappeared. Moreover, the degree of behavioural changes was correlated with the concentration of the substance in brain. According to our findings, chronic presence of tramadol in the environment can impact the fitness of exposed aquatic fauna by altering evolutionary crucial behaviours.

AB Medicininal compounds and their metabolites are known to end up in sewerage and may slip through the cleaning process. Azole antimycotics are frequently used in hospitals, in particular for patients with cancer or immunosuppression. The aim of the study was to determine whether measurable azole antimycotic concentrations were introducted in the sewarage drain of an acute care hospital with special interest in oncology and hematology and the extent of removal of antimycotics by the sewerage treatment plant. For this, the concentrations of three commonly used azole antimycotics were measured in the effluent of the sewerage drain at the University Hospital Dresden, as well as in the influent and effluent of the main sewerage treatment plant of the city. To extrapolate the theoretical influent to the sewerage treatment plant, prescription from the region's main health insurance the AOK Sachsen and the hospital consumption data were used. Measurable concentrations were obtained for fluconazole and ketoconazole in the influent and effluent of the sewerage treatment plant. Voriconazole's concentrations were under the lower limit of quantification. To determine the azole clearance of the treatment plant a sludge sample was investigated. Sufficient clearance was detected for ketoconazole but not for fluconazole. The consumption and prescription rates were collected and correlated with the measured concentrations. In result, only fluconazole's concentrations provided a good match with the prescription and consumption data.

AB The occurrence of PPCPs in macroalgae, barnacle and fish samples fromcontaminated coastalwaters of the Saudi Red Sea is reported. Solvent extraction followed by solid phase extraction was applied to isolate the compounds, and their quantification was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Atenolol, ranitidine, chlorpheniramine, DEET, and atrazinewere detected in one ormore macroalgae at bLOQ concentration, whereas caffeine, methylparaben, and carbamazepine were present atmaximum concentrations of 41.3, 44.3, and 1.7 ng/g (on a dryweight basis= dw), respectively. Eleven PPCPswere detected in the barnacle samples at concentrations between < LOQ and maximum concentration of 17.9 ng/g dw for amitriptyline. Furthermore, 17 compoundswere detected in several or all of the five fish species studied with amaximumconcentration of 82.1 ng/g dw for metronidazole in Silver Biddy. The bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for selected PPCPs were determined and compared. The occurrence and enrichment of PPCPs inmacroalgae and barnaclesmight indicate that a newroute for uptake of such chemicals bymarine biota is available, specifically in contaminatedwaters where a continuous supply of non-persistent contaminants such as PPCPs is available for long-termexposure of local benthic organisms.

AB Salicylic add (SA) is a pharmaceutical drug that may exert toxic effects by its own: however, simultaneous exposure of plants to SA and to other substances, often results in the significant changes in the patterns of toxic response/resistance to these other sources of chemical stress. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the capacity of SA of modulating Lemna minor responses co-exposed to the pharmaceutical drug, diclofenac - DCF. To attain this objective, L minor was exposed for 7 days, to DCF alone, and to combinations of DCF with SA. After exposure, biochemical, physiological and population endpoints were analyzed as follows: catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activities, pigments content (chlorophyll a (Chl a), b (Chl b) and total (TChl), carotenoids (Car) and [Chl a]/[Chl b] and [TChl]/[Car] ratios), and growth specific rate, fresh weight and root length. Single exposures to DCF were capable of causing effects in all analyzed endpoints. However, coexposure of DCF with SA partially reverted these effects. Finally, we may suggest that SA is capable to prevent the toxicity of DCF in macrophytes, by modulating the toxic response of exposed plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a microcosm experiment was conducted to merely mimic thermophilic phase in aerobic composting with pig manures in order to explore: (i) the effect of thermophilic phase in composting on the abundances of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs); and (ii) the impacts of the treated manures on the abundances of TRGs in soil. It was found that 4 days of thermophilic process reduced the abundance of TRGs in pig manures by similar to 1 lg unit compared to the samples without treatments, suggesting that other phases in composting may play significant roles in removal of TRGs. Once pig manures with thermophilic treatment were applied to soil, TRGs abundances decreased to the levels in unfertilized soil. With correlation analyses, it was concluded that pig manure derived tetracycline-resistant bacteria (TRB) and nutrients exerted different effects on TRGs abundances in soil. In conclusion, short-term thermophilic treatment cannot remove tetracycline resistance genes in pig manures but exhibits controlling effects on their accumulation and spread in soil. Nutrients enrichment in soil following manuring of treated pig manures, together with a large proportion of gram-positive TRB left in treated pig manures with less risk to TRGs spread, contributed to the controlling effects.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 19 antibiotics including ten sulfonamides, four quinolones, three tetracyclines and two macrolides in water, sediment, and biota samples from the Liao River Basin, China were investigated in the present study. The samples were collected in May 2012, and laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the Liao River Basin. Macrolides made up the majority of antibiotics in the water ranging from not detected (ND) to 3162.22 ng L-1, while tetracyclines and macrolides were the predominant antibiotics in the sediments, ranging from ND to 404.82 mu g kg(-1) (mean 32.11 mu g kg(-1) dw) and ND to 375.13 (mean 32.77 mu g kg(-1) dw), with detection frequencies of 37.3% and 38.1%, respectively. In biological samples, quinolones were the most frequently detected antibiotics (57.1-100%), with concentrations ranging from 286.6-1655.3 mu g kg(-1). The highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of 45407 L kg(-1) was found for enrofloxacin. The phase distribution calculation showed that tetracyclines were the most strongly adsorbed antibiotics in the sediment, with the highest pseudo-partitioning coefficient values, ranging from 1299 to 1499 L kg(-1). The geographical differences of antibiotic concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities and the sewage discharges from the local cities along the rivers.

DE EDTA; emission factors; industrial sources; waste water
ID METAL-EDTA COMPLEXES; SEDIMENTS; DTPA; FATE
AB Ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a complexing agent and has the ability to form stable water-soluble complexes with metal ions. It is used in a variety of industrial applications including pulp and paper, metal, textile, leather rubber, pharmaceuticals, food, polymer production and others. Most of these applications are water based and lead to emissions into the waste water and reach sewage treatment plants. Industrial sources and municipal waste waters were monitored simultaneously. Mixed samples were taken over periods of one week at nine sample sites. The concentrations of EDTA were measured in waste water samples by gas chromatography using N-selective detection. The results showed that, although, the concentrations and loads were variable the paper manufacturing industry was the major EDTA contributor to the influent of the waste water treatment plant and contributed more than 98% of the total load. All the other sources including two household areas, were comparably low. In waste water of households concentrations between 10 and 70 mug/l EDTA could be detected. Concentrations of EDTA from different industrial waste water sources ranged from 28 up to 3980 mug/1. Influent and effluent concentrations of the WWTP were usually high in the range of 500-940 and 390-760 mug/l; respectively. Elimination rates averaged 15%, the calculation is based on emission loads. Specific emission factors were calculated based on population equivalents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Horizon scanning is a systematic approach increasingly used to explore emerging trends, issues, opportunities, and threats in conservation. We present the results from one such exercise aimed at identifying emerging issues that could have important scientific, social, technological, and managerial implications for the conservation of inland waters in Canada in the proximate future. We recognized six opportunities and nine challenges, for which we provide research implications and policy options, such that scientists, policy makers, and the Canadian society as a whole can prepare for a potential growth in each of the topic areas we identified. The issues spanned a broad range of topics, from recognizing the opportunities and challenges of community-enabled science and the need to consider the legal rights of nature, to the likely increase of pharmaceuticals in wastewater due to an aging population. These issues represent a first baseline that could help decision makers identify and prioritize efforts while simultaneously stimulate new research avenues. We hope our horizon scan will pave the way for similar exercises related to the conservation of biodiversity in Canada.

AB Chitin and chitosan are biopolymers that have diverse applications in medicine, agriculture, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, wastewater treatment and textiles. With bio-origins, they easily blend with biological systems and show exemplified compatibility which is mandatory when it comes to biomedical research. Chitin and chitosan are ecofriendly, however the processes that are used to recover them aren't ecofriendly. The focus of this work is to attempt an ecofriendly, sustainable phytomediated one pot recovery of chitosan from commercial chitin and from crab and shrimp shells and squid pen solid wastes. Graviola extracts have been employed, given the fact file that their active ingredients acetogenins actively interact with chitin in insects (resulting in its application as an insecticide). With that as the core idea, the graviola extracts were chosen for orchestrating chitin recovery and a possible chitin to chitosan transformation. The results confirm that graviola extracts did succeed in recovery of chitosan nanofibers from commercial chitin flakes and recovery of chitosan particles directly from solid marine wastes of crab, shrimp and squids. This is a first time report of a phyto-extract mediated novel chitosan synthesis method.

AB Novel thermally responsive mesoporous silica nanosphere molecularly imprinted polymers (T-MMIPs) were prepared via a two-step precipitation polymerization process for selective adsorption and removal of dichlorophen (DCP) in aquatic environments. The innovative part was that T-MMIPs were first used for the identification and separation of DCP. The obtained materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and XRD. Static adsorption, kinetic, temperature sensitivity, and selective recognition experiments were implemented to test adsorption performance of T-MMIPs and T-MNIPs (thermally responsive mesoporous silica nano-sphere molecularly nonimprinted polymers). Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were found more consistent with experimental data, and T-MMIPs had a higher selective adsorption capacity and better temperature response. T-MMIPs have the best adsorption performance, and their adsorption equilibrium capacity can reach 108.35 mg/g at 298 K. In addition, regeneration and real-sample experiments demonstrated that T-MMIPs have good repeatability and practicality. Therefore, this study provides a potential application for the adsorption of dichlorophen in wastewater environments.

AB Maprotiline was identified as a compound of potential interest further to a suspect screening test carried out for a list of more than 40,000 substances based on specific occurrence, hazard and risk indicators. Despite the high frequency of appearance of this drug in wastewater treatment stations, his environmental fate is still unknown. Herein, we investigated for the first time the maprotiline degradation pathways in river water spiked with the drug at a concentration close to those detected in natural waters. Preliminary photocatalytic experiments in ultrapure water produced 32 transformation products (TPs) resulted mainly from the multiple hydroxylation/oxidation in different positions of the drug molecule. From the river water experiments, 12 TPs were formed by photolysis matching with those observed in ultrapure water experiments, and 2 were also formed resulted from biotic degradation. Employing HPLC-HRMS, we were able to elucidate the chemical structures of TPs and assess the overall degradation mechanism. Preliminary bioassays suggested lower toxicity of TPs relatively to the parent compound. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study was aimed to characterize the adsorptive properties of pharmaceutical-based activated charcoals (Biocarbon and Dyna) for the adsorption of reactive orange 16 (RO16) and rhodamine B (Rh B). A commercial activated (CAC) was employed for comparison. The materials were characterized for textural properties and functional groups. Batch adsorption was evaluated at different concentrations of dyes and contact times. The adsorption data were analyzed using isotherm and kinetics models. Result shows that the specific surface area is in the order of CAC > Biocarbon > Dyna. The surface area of CAC is 909 m(2)/g, renders a higher removal of RO16 of 69.4 mg/g, while Biocarbon displays a higher removal of Rh B of 54.5 mg/g, despite a lower surface area of 172 m(2)/g. The adsorption data fitted well with Langmuir model and pseudo-kinetics models. The adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceutical-based activated charcoals are unique and may not necessarily dependent on surface area alone. The charcoals demonstrate a promising attribute as dyes adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption of 30 environmentally relevant micro-pollutants (MP) from four surface waters was investigated at the pilot-scale with empty bed contact times (EBCTs) of 7 and 15 min. An increase in background dissolved organic matter resulted in more and earlier MP breakthrough. Compared to an EBCT of 7 min, MP breakthrough at an EBCT of 15 min demonstrated 52% later breakthrough on average for five MPs on a throughput basis. A regression model was developed with data from three waters to predict MP throughput in bed volumes to 10% breakthrough (BV10%) based on the influent dissolved organic carbon concentration and the MP pH-dependent octanol-water partition coefficient, polarizability, and molecular volume. The regression model over predicted full-scale BV10% values when applied to a wastewater-water impacted water source and to GAC with a larger particle diameter, for which a particle size adjustment was able to account for most of the difference.

AB Effective removal of aging biofilm deserves to receive more attention. This study aimed to characterized aging biofilm from a full-scale moving bed biofilm reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater and evaluate the hydrolysis effects of biofilm by different enzymatic treatments. Results from FTIR and biochemical composition analyses showed that it was a predominately organic-based biofilm with the ratio of total protein (PN) to polysaccharide (PS) of 20.17. A reticular structure of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) with filamentous bacteria as the skeleton was observed on the basal layer through SEM-EDS test. Among the four commercial proteases and amylases from Genencor (R), proteases were shown to have better performances than amylases either on the removal of MLSS and PN/MLSS or on DOC (i.e., dissolved organic carbon)/MLSS raising of biofilm pellets. Difference of dynamic fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matters after treated by the two proteases indicated distinguishing mechanisms of the treating process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel ZnIn2S4/TiO2 composite catalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in four actual water bodies was investigated through a batch experiment under the irradiation of an iodine-gallium lamp with the wavelength of 350 similar to 450 nm, and the effects of suspended solid (SS), inorganic salt (IS) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on CBZ degradation were mainly discussed. Under the optimal mass ratio and dosage of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 catalyst, the influential sequence was DOM > IS > SS for the water of Chanhe River, and IS > DOM > SS for other three water bodies from the third wastewater treatment plant of Xi'an city, China. The photocatalytic degradation of CBZ in aquatic environment followed pseudo-first-order kinetics model, and the rate constant K enhanced 2 similar to 5 times and the half-life reduced from 10 similar to 20 min to 4 similar to 5 min after the removal of SS+IS+DOM from the real water bodies.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely used in wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In this work, the OH-initiated transformation as well as the hydrolysis of a typical PPCPs, aspirin, was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and laboratory experiments. For DFT calculations, the frontier electron densities and bond dissociation energies were analyzed. Profiles of the potential energy surface were constructed, and all the possible pathways were discussed. Additionally, rate constants for each pathway were calculated with transition state theory (TST) method. UV/H2O2 experiments of aspirin were performed and degradation intermediates were identified by UPLC-MS-MS analysis. Different findings from previous experimental works were reported that the H-abstraction pathways at methyl position were dominated and OH-addition pathways on benzene ring were also favored. Meantime, hydroxyl ASA was confirmed as the main stable intermediate. Moreover, it was the first time to use DFT method to investigate the hydrolysis mechanisms of organic ester compound.

AB The improved activity of alga is critical for the biological enhanced treatment to remove contamination. Organisms usually perform compensatory responses, resulting from unfavorable conditions. This study investigates the effect of the artificially controlled culture before the treatment, which provoked the possible algal compensatory response and helped the algae to perform a better removal capability of the antibiotic ceftazidime in the subsequent treatment process. The removal efficiency could be improved up to 99.15% in 6 h when the algae were under the artificial controlled light conditions before the treatment process. In addition, higher removal efficiency of N and P (98.57% and 99.98%) was obtained after the artificial control. This suggests that the algae displayed a sequence of response during the exposure to the antibiotic after the artificial controlled culture in three steps: compensatory response, adsorption-consumption acceleration and acclimation. It might be the first time that the artificial conditions changing were controlled to improve the removal efficiency. Our study pointed out a new method for biological enhancement technologies in the antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB This study addresses the occurrences and natural fates of chemotherapeutics and controlled drugs when found together in hospital effluents and surface waters. The results revealed the presence of 11 out of 16 drugs in hospital effluents, and the maximum detected concentrations were at the mu g L-1 level in the hospital effluents and the ng L-1 level in surface waters. The highest concentrations corresponded to meperidine, morphine, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. The sunlight photolysis of the target compounds was investigated, and the results indicated that morphine and codeine can be significantly attenuated, with half-lives of 0.27 and 2.5 h, respectively, in natural waters. Photolysis can lower the detected environmental concentrations, also lowering the estimated environmental risks of the target drugs to human health. Nevertheless, 5-fluorouracil and codeine were found to have a high risk quotient (RQ), demonstrating the high risks of directly releasing hospital wastewater into the environment.

AB Urine source separation (NoMix technology) followed by processing the concentrated nutrient solution has the potential to become a cost-efficient alternative to conventional end-of-pipe nutrient elimination. A choice of processing technologies can only be made for specific scenarios, and there is currently no methodology for analyzing generic situations. In setting up a formalized decision-support methodology (based on STEEPLED analysis), we discuss how to create such generic scenarios, how to couple them with process engineering objectives, how to define the technology requirements, and finally how to produce a realistic subset of technology alternatives. The methodology is tested in five real scenarios. We also touch on the criteria for a final choice of technology taking into account large uncertainties about the performance of real technologies. We conclude that technology development is one of the most important requirements for implementing urine source separation in practice. There is an urgent need to develop cost-efficient processing technologies that satisfy the requirements of stakeholders. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The preoxidation of a highly polluted waste pharmaceutical fermentation broth using wet air oxidation (WAO) has been studied as a possible method for the effective removal of organics. The applied (pre)treatment method should enhance the biotreatability of the pharmaceutical fermentation broth in terms of reduced initial toxicity and higher biodegradability. Preliminary experiments in the pilot biological treatment plant were successful only at low organic loads, whereas the system collapses at higher ones. The characterization of the fermentation broth was started by common physicochemical analysis, whereas several bioassays were used to determine its impact on biological treatment plants and the environment. Toxicity prior to and after WAO was determined using the acute Vibrio fischeri test, measurement of inhibition Of O-2 consumption, and the Daphnia magna acute test. Ready biodegradability of the treated and untreated broth has also been assessed. WAO experiments were accomplished in the 2 L batch reactor at different temperatures (240/280 degrees C) and operating pressures. WAO experiments confirmed reduction of the toxicity toward microorganisms, whereas oxidized wastewater was more toxic to daphnids. Biodegradability of the oxidized broth has also been enhanced. Further work has been focused on designing appropriate combination of WAO and biological processes.

AB Large volumes of wastewaters containing proteins (mainly sericin), salts and tensioactives are produced in the degumming process (washing) of both yam and tissues made from natural silk. These wastewaters bearing a COD above 6000 mg/l are generally treated in biological plants with increasing costs. Sericin represents, on the contrary, a valuable by-product that can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical production. To reduce treatment costs and at the same time to recover sericin and reuse process water, a hybrid membrane process is under study. Laboratory and field experiments show that ultrafiltration of the degumming waste solution with different membranes (with molecular weight cut-off in the 20-30,000 dalton range) allows recovery of more than 97% of the sericin but the permeate COD level exceeds 800 mg/l whose value is still too high for water reuse. A final reverse osmosis treatment on the ultrafiltration permeate allows reaching a low COD level (50 mg/l) and recovery of more than 70% of the wastewater for process reuse. Alternative process flow sheets for the silk degumming solution treatment are discussed on the basis of the obtained results.

AB A high surface area activated carbon was produced from the seed of Butia catarinensis (Bc), which was utilized for removing captopril from synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewaters. The activated carbon was made by mixing ZnCl2 and Bc at a proportion of 1:1 and pyrolyzed at 600 degrees (ABc-600). The material was characterized by the Boehm titration, hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, elemental analysis, TGA, FTIR, and N-2 isotherm (surface area (SBET), total pore volume (TPV), and pore size distribution (PSD)). The characterization data showed that the adsorbent displayed a hydrophilic surface due to the presence of several polar groups. The carbon material presented a TPV of 0.392 cm(3) g(-1), and SBET of 1267 m(2) g(-1). The equilibrium and kinetics data were suitably fitted to Liu isotherm and Avrami-fractional-order. The employment of the ABc-600 in the treatment of synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewater exhibited high effectiveness in their removals (up to 99.0 %).

AB In this work the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction technique (DLLME) is presented as an important alternative to the classical extraction methods and was used to extract and concentrate estrogens' before its quantification by HPLC in environmental water samples. For the evaluation of the analytical methodology, the following conditions were used: sample volume 8 mL, extraction solvent 200 mu L of chlorobenzene, and dispersive solvent 2000 mu L of acetone. The enrichment factor (EF) was 140 for estrone, 202 for 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 199 for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Limit of detection was 20 ng L-1 for E1, 3.1 ng L-1 for E2, and 2.7 ng L-1 for EE2. Repeatability and intermediate reproducibility presented values of relative standard deviation lower than 10%. Finally, recovery tests were performed to evaluate the water matrices' effects on the extraction performance, resulting in recoveries between 76 and 110% in surface water and between 84 and 109% in wastewater.

TI Applied Injected Air into Subsurface Drip Irrigation: Plant Uptake of
   Pharmaceuticals and Soil Microbial Communities
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article

AB The growing global food security crisis is complicated by the need for increased crop production with less arable land and limited water resources. Reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation is becoming more common, often paired with other conservation measures such as subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). Passively injecting air into SDI systems increases crop yields and overcomes root zone wetting issues. However, when used with treated irrigation water, contaminants in the water might be taken up by the crops. This paper investigates the impact of air-injected water containing caffeine, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil on plant uptake and soil microbial communities in Salanova lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Aerated lettuce yielded higher plant mass and root length. The use of air-injected water reduced the uptake of caffeine and gemfibrozil and increased the uptake of carbamazepine. Gemfibrozil and carbamazepine were primarily detected in leachate, while caffeine was observed in the soil samples. Injected air significantly impacted (p-value < 0.001) the fate and transport of gemfibrozil. Injection of pharmaceutically active compounds and the presence/absence of injected-air created a variation in soil microbial communities. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The formation of carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during chloramination at drinking water treatment plants has raised concerns as more plants have switched from chlorine to chloramine disinfection. In this study, a source of NDMA precursors that has yet to be investigated was examined. Veterinary antibiotics are used in large quantities at animal agricultural operations. They may contaminate drinking water sources and may not be removed during wastewater and drinking water treatment. Ten antibiotics used in animal agriculture were shown to produce NDMA or N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) during chloramination. Molar conversions ranged from 0.04 to 4.9 percent, with antibiotics containing more than one dimethylamine (DMA) functional group forming significantly more NDMA. The highest formation for most of the compounds was seen near pH 8.4, in a range of pH 6 to 11 that was investigated. The effect of chlorine-to-ammonia ratio (Cl-2/NH3), temperature, and hold time varied for each chemical, suggesting that the effects of these parameters were compound-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB The degradation of 30 trace organic contaminants (TrOC) by a white-rot fungus-augmented membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated. The results show that white-rot fungal enzyme (laccase), coupled with a redox mediator (1-hydroxy benzotriazole, HBT), could degrade TrOC that are resistant to bacterial degradation (e.g. diclofenac, triclosan, naproxen and atrazine) but achieved low removal of compounds (e.g. ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and amitriptyline) that are well removed by conventional activated sludge treatment. Overall, the fungus-augmented MBR showed better TrOC removal compared to a system containing conventional activated sludge. The major role of biodegradation in removal by the MBR was noted. Continuous mediator dosing to MBR may potentially enhance its performance, although not as effectively as for mediator-enhanced batch laccase systems. A ToxScreen3 assay revealed no significant increase in the toxicity of the effluent during MBR treatment of the synthetic wastewater comprising TrOC, confirming that no toxic by-products were produced.

TI Sorption and high dynamics of micropollutants in sewers

ID SYSTEMS
AB Down-the-drain household chemicals are mostly discharged intermittently (i.e. with water pulses, e. g. pharmaceuticals from toilet flushing) and well soluble micropollutants can, therefore, be subject to significantly high short-term fluctuations. It is not known how these fluctuations are attenuated by sorption to sewer sediments or biofilm. First, we investigated in this paper the effect of sorption for substances with high, medium and low affinity to particulate matter based on computational experiments. For substances with high K-oc we found that the additional attenuation of a load pattern due to sorption is in the same order of magnitude as caused by dispersion in a typical main sewer. The mass flux between wastewater and the first biofilm layer was identified as the most sensitive parameter. Furthermore, the interplay of systematic, slow diurnal variations does not affect short-term fluctuations. Second, during rain events partial erosion of the biofilm can lead to increased micropollutant loads for substances with high K-oc. This increase is in the same order of magnitude as diurnal variations of the loads in the liquid phase and the TSS.

AB The present work discusses the efficiency of the electrodialytic (ED) process to remove emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) from effluent. The ED process was carried out in a cell of two-compartments (2 C-cell) with effluent in either the anode or cathode compartment, separated from the electrolyte compartment through an anion or a cation exchange membrane (AEM and CEM, respectively). As effluent destination might be soil irrigation, and having in mind the nutrient recycling, phosphorus was also monitored in the process.
   The ED removals showed to be dependent of EOCs characteristics and cell design. Removals were higher when using an AEM (60-72%) than a CEM (8-63%), except for caffeine when the effluent was placed in the cathode, that did not show any removal. When using an AEM with the effluent placed in the anode compartment, all the EOCs (including caffeine) were removed between 57-72%, mainly through electrodegradation phenomena.
   Regarding phosphorus, a polarity switch may be done to a 2 C-cell with a AEM, depending on the effluent final use. This technology is still in its first steps and, in both cases, further optimization of ED parameters is needed. Still, this technological innovation and cross-cutting research envisages the promotion of economic, social and environmental benefits.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are known to be persistent. Their presence after conventional treatments in sewage treatment plants may harm aquatic environments. The simultaneous degradation of the pharmaceuticals gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen involving photo-Fenton processes was evaluated using different sources and concentrations of iron (Fe2+, Fe3+ and the iron complexes of oxalate- FeOx), initial pH (2.6, 5.0 and 7.0) and concentrations of H2O2. The classic photo-Fenton reaction (at initial pH 2.6, using Fe2+ and Fes+) showed a limited efficiency in promoting gemfibrozil degradation, which, based on evidence provided by LC-MS measurements, is related to the formation of associations between this compound and iron ions. The simultaneous degradation of gemfibrozil and the other compounds was improved using FeOx (1.0 mg L-1- in iron) at an initial pH of 2.6 and 2.0 mg L-H2O2. In addition, using this catalyst it was possible to efficiently degrade the pharmaceuticals at an initial pH of 5.0, reaching complete degradation of these compounds with a treatment time varying between 20 and 60 min and generating a low toxicity effluent. These results highlight the potential applicability of ferrioxalate as a photocatalyst in the photo-Fenton process as an alternative method to degrade this kind of pollutant at a pH near neutrality.

AB C-14-sulfamethoxazole biotransformation, sorption and mineralization was studied with heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass under aerobic and anoxic conditions, as well as with anaerobic biomass. The C-14-radiolabelled residues distribution in the solid, liquid and gas phases was closely monitored along a total incubation time of 190 h. Biotransformation was the main removal mechanism, mineralization and sorption remaining below 5% in all the cases, although the presence of a carbon source exerted a positive effect on the mineralization rate by the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. In fact, an influence of the type of primary substrate and the redox potential was observed in all cases on the biotransformation and mineralization rates, since an enhancement of the removal rate was observed when an external carbon source was used as a primary substrate under aerobic conditions, while a negligible effect was observed under nitrifying conditions. In the liquid phases collected from all assays, up to three additional peaks corresponding to C-14-radiolabelled residues were detected. The highest concentration was observed under anaerobic conditions, where two radioactive metabolites were detected representing each around 15% of the total applied radioactivity after 180 h incubation. One of the metabolites detected under anoxic and anaerobic conditions, is probably resulting from ring cleavage of the isoxazole ring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands constitute one of the most efficient ecosystems with a great capacity to recycle the organic matter and able to attenuate or mitigate the chemical pollution. However, limited information exists on the ecotoxicological effects that may be caused due to the presence of these pollutants in wetland sediments. In this work, a bioassay-directed approach was used to identify toxicologically active compounds retained in sediments from a surface flow constructed wetland located in the North-Eastern of Spain. Sediment fractionation was accomplished by pressurized-liquid extraction (PLE) followed by semipreparative normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC). During the extraction procedure, different solvents were sequentially applied in order to selectively extract the compounds as a function of their polarity. The cytotoxicity of the resulting fractions was assessed on the fish hepatoma cell line PLHC-1 by using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, while the presence of CYP1A inducing agents was determined by measuring the activity 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in exposed cells. Identification of the compounds was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), polycyclic musk fragrances and pesticides were identified in the most toxic fractions.

AB This paper describes a TiO2 nanoparticles assembled sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) nanocomposite synthesized via an in-situ method. The as-prepared materials were thoroughly characterized (XRD, FT-IR, XPS, UV-DRS, SEM and mapping analysis). The TiO2@SCN nanocomposite exhibits higher photocatalytic activity towards tetracycline (TC) degradation under visible light compared to individual components. The TiO2@SCN nanocomposite catalyst had good stability and reusability for five consecutive photocatalytic degradation experiments. These performances could be attributed to effective charge separation and less recombination of electron and hole pairs of TiO2@SCN nanocomposite which was confirmed by higher photocurrent and lower impedance results. The role of catalysts weight, pH, and effect of TC concentration were optimized and discussed. Further, radical scavenger studies were clearly identified the elections and superoxide radicals act as the main role for the photo-degradation of TC. It is hoped that our work could offers to develop various nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants and energy applications.

AB The effects of bioaugmentation with immobilized Penicillium restrictum on the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ERY) and tetracycline (TC) antibiotics as well as membrane biofouling was studied using hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor (HF-MBR). Bioaugmentation with P. restrictum led to a significant change in the antibiotic removal efficiency and relative abundance of aerobic microbial community, most probably as a result of its quorum quenching activity. Furthermore, in addition to its role in the increase of SMX and ERY removal efficiencies and the decrease of their sorption on solid phase, bioaugmentation significantly reduced the transmembrane pressure which in turn reduced membrane clogging. The most abundant phyla in sludge and biofilm samples in the presence of P. restrictum were observed to be Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Differences in bacterial compositions and their specificity in biodegradation of antibiotics in different reactors showed that bacteria were specifically selected under the pressure of antibiotics and growing fungus.

AB Parabens are widely used as preservatives in personal care products, food, and pharmaceuticals. This paper presents the results of the photochemical degradation of four hazardous water contaminants (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben) using an ultraviolet (UV) radiation source in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and/or titanium dioxide. Oxidation kinetics and overall performance of the removal process for the four parabens in Milli-Q water using different advanced oxidation processes (namely, UV/H2O2, UV/TiO2, and UV/TiO2/H2O2) were studied. The most efficient oxidation system to remove these pollutants was UV/TiO2/H2O2. A factorial central composite orthogonal and rotatable design of experiments was used to improve the parabens removal using the UV/TiO2/H2O2 process. Initial concentrations of H2O2 and TiO2 were the selected operational variables to optimize the process in Milli-Q water. Similarly, experiments were carried out under optimal conditions in different surface water matrices, namely, Guadiana River water (Badajoz, SW Spain), Pena del Aguila reservoir water (Villar del Rey), and wastewater treatment plant effluent (Badajoz).

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a chloramination disinfection by-product (DBP) with an uncertain regulatory future. While extensive literature exists on NDMA formation potentials (FP) for natural waters and for model compounds considered as NDMA precursors, less data exists on the kinetics of NDMA formation in surface and wastewaters. NDMA formation kinetics experiments were conducted in seven source waters at two monochloramine doses. NDMA formation was modeled by a simple, second-order model, using the measured NDMA(max) and monitored monochloramine concentrations at selected reaction times. The model fits NDMA formation well (R-2 > 0.88) in all source waters. While the extent of NDMA formation was highly variable, the rate constant (k(app)) values from different waters fell in a narrow range (0.01-0.09 M-1 s(-1)). This suggests that a common precursor or rate limiting step for NDMA formation likely exists despite the differences in matrices. Although further studies are needed to validate the model over a wider range of water conditions such as pH and N: Cl-2 ratios, the model could help water utilities to predict NDMA formation in distribution systems.

AB We assessed the tolerance acquired by stream biofilms to two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen and diclofenac. Biofilms came from a stream system receiving the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The response of biofilms from a non-polluted site (upstream the WWTP) was compared to that of others downstream with relevant and decreasing levels of NSAIDs. Experiments performed in the laboratory following the pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach determined that both algae and microbial communities from biofilms of the sites exposed at the highest concentrations of ibuprofen and diclofenac acquired tolerance to the mixture of these NSAIDs occurring at the sites. It was also observed that the chronic pollution by the WWTP effluent affected the microbial metabolic profile, as well as the structure of the algal community. The low (at ng L-1 level) but chronic inputs of pharmaceuticals to the river ecosystem result in tolerant communities of lower diversity and altered microbial metabolism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a methodology for quantifying the spatial distribution of EDCs in a river mixing zone. The core of the technical analysis is based on a two-dimensional steady-state analytical model characterized by ambient turbulence in the receiving water. This model was first calibrated with mass transport data from field measurements for a conservative substance (electrical conductivity) and then used to predict aqueous-phase EDC concentrations throughout a WWTP mixing zone. To demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology for water quality management purposes, the modeling framework presented in this paper was used to determine a lumped in-stream attenuation rate constant (k(d) = 3d(-1)) for 17 beta-estradiol under natural conditions. This rate constant likely accounts for the combined contributions of physical sorption, photolysis, microbial and chemical degradation, and the measured value is highly consistent with previously published results from bench-scale removal experiments.

AB The present study aimed to investigate Klebsiella sp. SQY5-mediated tetracycline (TEC) degradation, nitrogen (N) conversion, and mechanisms underlying this process as influenced by various carbon and N sources under aerobic conditions. Effects of additional organic carbon sources on TEC degradation and N conversion processes were explored, and we found that 34.71% of TEC was degraded at removal rates of 0.97 mg.L-1.h (-1) for NH4+-N and 1.97 mg.L-1.h(-1) for NO3--N. A study examining powder natural algal powder in aquaculture wastewater as a carbon source for TEC degradation and denitrification process was also discussed. It suggested that 49.95% of TEC and 60.45% of NO3--N were removed with a reduction and denitrification rate of 0.11 mg.L-1.h(-1) and 1.34 mg.L-1.h(-1), respectively, within 72-108 h. Mechanisms underlying TEC degradation and N conversion processes were also proposed, and analysis indicated that specific functional genes played an important role in this process.

AB A facile one-pot spray-drying process was developed for fabrication and in situ crosslinking of chitosan microspheres to improve the adsorption capacity by microscopic design. A fully biobased nature was achieved by utilizing genipin (GP) as a crosslinking agent and chitosan-derived nanographene oxide (nGO) as a property tuner. The produced chitosan microspheres were further proven as powerful adsorbents for common wastewater contaminants such as anionic dyes and pharmaceutical contaminants, here modeled by methyl orange (MO) and diclofenac sodium (DCF). By regulating the amount of GP and nGO, as well as by controlling the process parameters including the spray-drying inlet temperature and postheat treatment, the surface morphology, size, zeta potential, and adsorption efficiency of the microspheres could be tuned accordingly. The adsorption efficiency for MO and DCF reached 98.9 and 100%, respectively. The microspheres retained high DCF adsorption efficiency after six adsorption and desorption cycles, and the recyclability was improved by the incorporated nGO. The fabricated microspheres, thus, have great potential as reusable and eco-friendly adsorbents.

AB As reuse of municipal water resource recovery facility (WRRF) effluent becomes vital to augment diminishing fresh drinking water resources, concern exists that conventional barriers may prove deficient, and the upcycling of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) could prove harmful to human health and aquatic species if more effective and robust treatment barriers are not in place. A multiple month survey, of both primary and secondary effluents, from three (3) WRRFs, for 95 CECs was conducted in 2014 to classify CECs by their persistence through conventional water reclamation processes. By sampling the participating WRRF process trains at their peak performance (as determined by measured bulk organics and particulates removal), a short-list of recalcitrant CECs that warrant monitoring to assess treatment performance at advanced water reclamation and production facilities. The list of identified CECs for potable water reclamation (indirect or direct potable reuse) include a herbicide and its degradants, prescription pharmaceuticals and antibiotics, a female hormone, an artificial sweetener, and chlorinated flame retardants.

AB A biochar supported calcined-Mg/Al layered double hydroxides composite (CLDHs/BC) was synthesized by a one-pot slow pyrolysis of LDHs preloaded bagasse biomass. Multiple characterizations of the product illustrated that the calcined-Mg/Al layered double hydroxides (CLDHs) were successfully coated onto the biochar in slow pyrolysis of pre-treated biomass. The as-synthesized CLDHs/BC could efficiently remove antibiotic tetracycline from aqueous solutions. The coating of CLDHs significantly increased the adsorption ability of biochar, and CLDHs/BC exhibited more than 2 times higher adsorption capacity than that of the pristine biochar (BC) in the tested pH range. The maximum adsorption capacity of CLDHs/BC for tetracycline was 1118.12 mg/g at 318 K. The experimental results suggested that the interaction with LDHs on biochar played a dominant role in tetracycline adsorption, accompanied with pi-pi interaction and hydrogen bond. This study provides a feasible and simple approach for the preparation of high-performance material for antibiotics contaminated wastewater treatment in a cost-effective way.

AB In search of new options to achieve removal of pharmaceuticals in the environment, combined ultrasound and ozonation has become a focus of intense investigation for wastewater treatment. In this study, three pharmaceuticals were selected as model compounds for degradation experiments: diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ). Comparison of the degradation rates for both ozonation and combined ultrasound/ozonation treatments was performed on single synthetic solutions as well as on a mixture of the selected pharmaceuticals, under different experimental conditions. For single synthetic solutions, the efficiency removal for ozonation reached 73%, 51% and 59% after 40 min for DCF, SMX and CBZ, respectively. Comparable results were obtained for pharmaceuticals in mixture. However, the combined ultrasound/ozone treatment was found to increase degradation efficiencies for both DCF and SMX single solutions up to 94% and 61%, respectively, whereas lower removal yields, up to 56%, was noted for CBZ. Likewise, when the combined treatment was applied to the mixture, relatively low removal efficiencies was found for CBZ (44%) and 90% degradation yield was achieved for DCF.

AB In the engineering practice, there are two basic alternatives of physicochemical treatment for the removal of volatile compounds from process wastewaters: stripping with air or stripping with steam. In this work, these alternatives are investigated and compared in the case of a real industrial problem that is typical for the fine chemical industry and general conclusion is drawn. The removal of the organically bound halogens, called adsorbable organically bound halogens, is investigated. The two alternatives, air and steam stripping, are first modeled in the professional software environment of ASPEN Plus(A (R)). The model is validated on the data of an existing air stripper for the removal of organic halogens. Same organic halogens removal is applied for the design of a steam stripper. It is proved that the steam stripping shows better operability and economic performance than the air stripping; moreover, the volatile and/or adsorbable organically bound halogen compounds can be recovered in the distillate and they can be reused improving the sustainability.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a conventional bioreactor (CBR) were operated under various conditions to manipulate the biomass characteristics and evaluate the ensuing effects on the partitioning and sorption hysteresis of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). When the biomass was grown without nitrogen limitation, the biomass mean particle size had a dramatic effect on the observed partitioning coefficient (K-d) and on sorption hysteresis index (HI). MBR K-d (0.33-0.57 L/g) values were equal to or larger than those of the CBR (0.25-0.33 L/g). Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, the correlations between the biomass particle size and K-d and HI were poor, likely because of extracellular polymeric substances. The K-d and HI were determined for initial EE2 concentrations between 100 and 1000 mu g/L. Changing the SRT did not manipulate particle size, and the effects on K-d and HI were not dramatic. This study also numerically explored the impacts of sorption hysteresis on the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phenolic derivatives are compounds used in the production of pesticides, pharmaceutical products and several other industrial applications. These compounds are discharged into freshwater from industrial effluents, domestic sewage, urban and agricultural run-offs which leads to pollution. Water at six sampling locations along the course of Buffalo River; namely Buffalo river estuary (BRE), Mdantsane (MSN), Zwelitsha (ZW), King William's Town (KWT), Izele Town (IZ) and Maden dam (MD) in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were evaluated for phenolic contamination using eleven phenolic derivatives of United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) priority pollutants. Samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction technique, derivatized with acetic anhydride and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The levels of the individual pollutants in the river water were higher in summer (< LOD to 12246 ng/L) than in autumn (< LOD to 713 ng/L). Their concentrations were found higher than the USEPA recommended limit (500 ng/L) in most of the sampling sites. The most prominent pollutant was 2-NP. However, the cancer risk assessment values and hazard quotient were below USEPA maximum limits of 10(-6) and 1, respectively. Conclusively, the concentrations of these organic pollutants could be a threat to public health and should be managed to be below the recommended limit though the present levels are unlikely to cause cancer to both human and wildlife.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products are used extensively worldwide and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. In this study, antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservative compounds were analyzed in surface water and sediment from the Kaveri, Vellar and Tamiraparani rivers, and in the Pichavaram mangrove in India by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The mean concentration of carbamazepine recorded in the Kaveri River water (28.3 ng/L) was higher than in the other rivers and the mangrove. Because carbamazepine is used only in human drugs, this may reflect the relative contributions of human excretions/sewage in these rivers. The mean triclosan level in the Tamiraparani River (944 ng/L) was an order of magnitude greater than in the other water systems, and the concentrations at two of the sites reported here (3800-5160 ng/L) are, to our best knowledge, among the highest detected in surface waters. Sediment levels were, however, comparable with other sites. We conclude that industrial releases are likely major contributors of triclosan into this river system. Among parabens, ethyl paraben was predominantly observed. Hazard Quotients suggest greater environmental risks for triclosan than for carbamazepine and parabens. This is the first study on antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservatives in rivers and mangroves from India. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The data set presents the occurrence of 59 currently used pesticides (CUPs) and 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), from wetland areas, in Saudi Arabia, impacted by wastewater discharge. Wetlands are valuable ecosystems, but are very fragile and easily affected by anthropogenic pressure [1-6] . The occurrence of organic contaminants provides understanding about their fate and possible risk for humans and environment. Up to our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of the mentioned organic pollutants in shallow lakes in Saudi Arabia, and the first time these compounds are analyzed in wild flora. Samples of water, sediment, soil and plants were extracted via ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) and solid phase extraction (SPE). The compounds determination was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Interpretation and discussion of the present dataset can be found in the article entitled "Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and microplastics contamination assessment of Al-Hassa irrigation network (Saudi Arabia) and its shallow lakes" [1] .

AB A model describing ibuprofen and ketoprofen biodegradation by activated sludge from three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) was developed in this study. This model successfully described the biodegradation profiles observed at two different initial concentrations of each compound, where a lag-phase was observed prior to the biodegradation of each compound. Twelve ibuprofen and ketoprofen degrading isolates were identified in this study from the WWTP sludge showing the best removal performance. One of these isolates was characterised via another model, where biodegradation was dependent on biomass growth rate as well as the ibuprofen concentration. The fact that different models were needed to describe the biodegradation by activated sludge and a pure culture suggests that the biodegradation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depends on the microbial community, thus pharmaceutical biodegradation models may require adaptation depending upon the system. This study provides an advance towards modelling pharmaceutical biodegradation in WWTPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing concern regarding the presence of unregulated trace organic chemicals in drinking water supplies that receive discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. In comparison to conventional and advanced drinking water treatment, riverbank filtration represents a low-cost and low-energy alternative that can attenuate total organic carbon (TOC) as well as trace organic chemicals (TOrC). This study examined the role of predominant redox conditions, retention time, biodegradable organic carbon, and temperature to achieve attenuation of TOC and TOrC through monitoring efforts at three full-scale RBF facilities in different geographic areas of the United States. The RBF systems investigated in this study were able to act as a reliable barrier for TOC, nitrogen, and certain TOrC. Temperature (seasonal) variation played an important role for the make-up of the river water quality and performance of the RBF systems. Temperatures of less than 10 C did not affect TOC removal but resulted in diminished attenuation of nitrate and select TOrC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) and the synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), are present in municipal sewage discharges. To better understand possible interactions between them, male goldfish were exposed to an ethanol control or to nominal concentrations of FLX (0.54 mu g/L) and EE2 (5 ng/L) alone and in combination for 14 days. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess effects on hepatic gene expression and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the plasma proteome. The results showed an increase in estrogen receptor alpha (esr1) and vitellogenin (vtg) gene expression by 1.9-2.4-fold in the FLX and EE2 groups, but this did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, co-exposure up regulated esr1 and vtg gene expression by 5.5- and 5.3-fold, respectively. Fluoxetine and EE2 alone did not affect estrogen receptor beta (esr2), but the co-exposure down regulated esr2 expression by 50%. There was a significant increase in the number of plasma proteins that were related to endocrine system disorders in the FLX and FLX plus EE2 groups. The level of VTG protein was increased in the plasma from goldfish exposed to EE2, FLX, and FLX plus EE2. Our study demonstrates that low concentrations of FLX and EE2 in a simple mixture produce strong estrogen-like effects in the male goldfish.

Estrogen concentrations in the aqueous and solid phases in each reactor of AAO system were analyzed separately. E2 was not detected in the final effluent. The anaerobic, anoxic and oxic reactors accounted for 71%, 7% and 22% of the overall E2 removal, respectively. The overall EE2 removal efficiency was about 80%, and the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic reactors were responsible for 44%, 8% and 48% of the overall EE2 removal, respectively. In anaerobic unit, sorption was the dominant mechanism for the removal of E2 and EE2. While E2 was degraded in all the three units of the AAO system, EE2 was only degraded in the anoxic and aerobic units. Biodegradation is important for the fate of E2 compared to sorption. Of the total influent E2 in the AAO system, 99.99% was biodegraded and 0.01% remained in the waste sludge. Nevertheless, both sorption and biodegradation play important roles in the removal of EE2. Of the total influent EE2, 79.1% was degraded by activated sludge, 19.9% was discharged in the effluent and 1% remained in the waste sludge.

AB An analytical procedure for the determination of 10 drugs belonging to three different therapeutic groups was analysed. Several compounds were investigated which comprise of beta-blockers: sotalol (SOT), metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), carvedilol (CAR); corticosteroids: prednisolone (PRE), dexamethasone (DEX); analgesic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID): paracetamol (PAR), metamizole (MTZ), aspirin (ASP) and ketoprofen (KET). Reversed-phase liquid chromatography with gradient elution, fluorescence (FL) and diode array detectors (DAD) was applied for the selective investigation of the drugs. Three solvents were used as the mobile phase: methanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and acetonitrile. The solid phase extraction (SPE) method using the Oasis HLB column was proposed for the preconcentration step. The recovery level for most of the drugs was above 80%. The low values of limits of detection (LOD) for PAR, SOT, MTZ, MET, SAL, PRO, PRE, CAR, DEX and KET were achieved: 106 ng L(-1), 1,048 ng L (1), 2.48 ng L (1), 2.17 ng L (1), 16.5 ng L (1), 1.10 ng L (1), 160 ng L (1), 6.62 ng L (1), 76.5 ng L (1) and 45.2 ng L (-1), respectively. The suggested method was used for the determination of drugs in spiked surface water.

AB Pharmaceuticals are an increasing problem in waterways due to improper disposal and lack of removal at wastewater treatment plants. Long-term exposure impacts to humans are unknown but have been observed in model organisms (i.e., fish), impacting reproduction, changing temperament, and causing organ damage. The application of activated carbon (AC) for organic contaminant removal is widespread and applied successfully for water treatment. The objective of this study is to rapidly adsorb ibuprofen using AC to determine the feasibility as a point-of-entry treatment option for removal of pharmaceuticals in the toilet. AC factors analyzed include type of AC raw material, adsorbent particle size, contact time, and competitive adsorption of ibuprofen and common toilet bowl cleaner components such as chlorine and methylene blue dye. A coconut-based AC with a high surface area adsorbed the highest quantity of ibuprofen. There was no significant impact to ibuprofen adsorption upon the introduction of other compounds to the solution, thus demonstrating rapid adsorption and the potential for application at the point-of-entry.

AB Macrolide antibiotics and azole fungicides are detected widely in the aquatic environment as a result of their increased use in humans and animal livestock disease and their incomplete removal by wastewater treatment plants. In most cases, ecotoxicological tests are performed by using individual chemical substances, but because of the coexistence of a number of chemicals in the environment, organisms are exposed to many chemicals simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to evaluate effects of chemical interactions, adding to potential hazards of individual chemical. Here, we investigated the synergetic effects of combined chemicals (the azole fungicide ketoconazole and either of two macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin and clarithromycin) in growth inhibition testing using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata according to OECD Test guideline 201. Combination index plots, isobolograms, and curve-shift analyses revealed that the combination of macrolide antibiotic and ketoconazole at various ratios resulted in strong synergism that enhanced growth inhibition of P. subcapitata, suggesting the necessity of investigating potential hazard of combined chemicals for regulatory purposes.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate the achievable limits of aerobic sludge stabilization applied on waste-activated sludge generated in domestic, tannery, and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. Stabilization study involved monitoring of conventional parameters and model evaluation of oxygen uptake rate and particulate components of waste sludge. Multi-component biomass approach was adopted based on death-regeneration mechanism. The results showed that sludge stabilization efficiency ranged between 25% and 30%, which was closely related to the fate of different particulate fractions of biomass, that is, viable biomass, hydrolysable particulates, and microbial metabolic products. Model calibration exercises yield in rate coefficient ranges of 0.18-0.32/day for biomass decay and 0.60-0.65/day for hydrolysis of non-biomass components. Degradation rates of particulate metabolic products were estimated as 0.035, 0.04, and 0.01/day for domestic, tannery, and pharmaceutical sludge, respectively. Relatively low degradation rates compared to conventional biological treatment processes confirmed reduced microbial activity in the course of aerobic stabilization.

AB A tertiary treatment step is required in current wastewater treatment plants to remove trace pollutants and thus to prevent their extensive occurrence in the aquatic environment. In this study, natural MnOx ore and natural zeolite were separately used to pack two lab-scale aerated biofilters, which were operated in approximately 1.5 years for the removal of frequently occurring pharmaceuticals, including carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DFC), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), out of synthetic and real secondary effluents. Mn2+ was added in the feeds to promote the growth of iron/manganese oxidizing bacteria which were recently found to be capable of degrading recalcitrant pollutants. An effective removal (80-90%) of DFC and SMX was observed in both biofilters after adaptation while a significant removal of CBZ was not found. Both biofilters also achieved an effective removal of spiked Mn2+, but a limited removal of carbon and nitrogen contents. Additionally, MnOx biofilter removed 50% of UV254 from real secondary effluent, indicating a high potential on the removal of aromatic compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research was carried out on a full-scale pure oxygen thermophilic plant, operated and monitored throughout a period of 11 years. The plant treats 60,000 t y(-1) (year 2013) of high-strength industrial wastewaters deriving mainly from pharmaceuticals and detergents production and landfill leachate. Three different plant configurations were consecutively adopted: (1) biological reactor i final clarifier and sludge recirculation (2002-2005); (2) biological reactor + ultrafiltration: membrane biological reactor (MBR) (2006); and (3) MBR + nanofiltration (since 2007). Progressive plant upgrading yielded a performance improvement chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was enhanced by 17% and 12% after the first and second plant modification, respectively. Moreover, COD abatement efficiency exhibited a greater stability, notwithstanding high variability of the influent load. In addition, the following relevant outcomes appeared from the plant monitoring (present configuration): up to 96% removal of nitrate and nitrite, due to denitrification; low-specific biomass production (0.092 kg(VSS) kgCOD(removed)(-1)), and biological treatability of residual COD under mesophilic conditions (BOD5/COD ratio = 0.25-0.50), thus showing the complementarity of the two biological processes.

AB The Fenton-like degradation of nalidixic acid was studied in this work. The effects of Fe3+ concentration and initial H2O2 concentration were investigated. Increasing the initial H2O2 concentration enhances the degradation and mineralization efficiency for nalidixic acid, while Fe3+ shows an optimal concentration of 0.25 mM. A complete removal of nalidixic acid and a TOC removal of 28 % were achieved in 60 min under a reaction condition of [Fe3+] = 0.25 mM, [H2O2] = 10 mM, T = 35 A degrees C, and pH = 3. LC-MS analysis technique was used to analyze the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation pathways of nalidixic acid were proposed according to the identified intermediates and the electron density distribution of nalidixic acid. The Fenton-like degradation reaction of nalidixic acid mainly begins with the electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radical towards the C-3 position which results in the ring-opening reaction; meanwhile, hydroxyl radical attacking to the branched alkyl groups of nalidixic acid leads to the oxidation at the branched alkyl groups.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine is one of the most abundant pharmaceuticals in the German aquatic environment. The effect of low carbamazepine concentrations (1-50 mu g L-1) is discussed controversially, but ecotoxicological studies revealed reproduction toxicity, decreased enzymatic activity and bioaccumulation in different test organisms. Therefore, as a preventive step, an efficient and cost-effective technique for wastewater treatment plants is needed to stop the entry of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment. Cavitation, the formation, growth, and subsequent collapse of gas- or vapor-filled bubbles in fluids, was applied to solve this problem. The technique of Hydrodynamic-Acoustic-Cavitation was used showing high synergistic effect. Under optimized conditions carbamazepine (5 mu g L-1) was transformed by pseudo-first order kinetics to an extent of >96% within 15 min (27% by hydrodynamic cavitation, 33% by acoustic cavitation).

AB The aim of this investigation was to study the degradation of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in aqueous solution by heterogeneous photocatalysis (UV-C/TiO2). To perform the investigation, aqueous solutions containing the contaminant were exposed to UV radiation in the absence or presence of TiO2 in suspension or supported on a Fe-Cr metal alloy plate. TBP analyses before and after the treatment were performed by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) in order to quantify the contaminant degradation. The results showed that the TiO2 photocatalytic system was able to remove TBP from the solution and the formation of some by-products was observed. TiO2 photocatalytic systems were able to reduce acute toxicity in an Artemia Salina bioassay according to the increase in LC50 from 10.2 +/- 0.5%(v/v) to 16.9 +/- 0.6 %(v/v) for the immobilized system and to levels which were not possible to detect by the applied method any more for the suspension system.

AB Competitive sorption of sulfamethazine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfathiazole (STZ) and chloramphenicol (CP) toward functionalized biochar (fBC) was highly pH dependent with maximum sorption at pH similar to 4.0-4.25. Equilibrium data were well represented by the Langmuir and Freundlich models in the order STZ > SMX > CP > SMT. Kinetics data were slightly better fitted by the pseudo second-order model than pseudo first-order and intra-particle-diffusion models. Maximum sorptive interactions occurred at pH 4.0-4.25 through H-bonds formations for neutral sulfonamides species and through negative charge assisted H-bond (CAHB) formation for CP, in addition to pi pi p electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions. EDA was the main mechanism for the sorption of positive sulfonamides species and CP at pH < 2.0. Sorption of negative sulfonamides species and CP at pH > 7.0 was regulated by H-bond formation and proton exchange with water by forming CAHB, respectively. The results suggested fBC to be highly efficient in removing antibiotics mixture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to develop a predictive framework to assess the removal and fate of trace organic chemicals (TrOCs) during wastewater treatment by anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The fate of 27 TrOCs in both the liquid and sludge phases during AnMBR treatment was systematically investigated. The results demonstrate a relationship between hydrophobicity and specific molecular features of TrOCs and their removal efficiency. These molecular features include the presence of electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) or donating groups (EDGs), especially those containing nitrogen and sulphur. All seven hydrophobic contaminants were well removed (>70%) by AnMBR treatment. Most hydrophilic TrOCs containing EDGs were also well removed (>70%). In contrast, hydrophilic TrOCs containing EWGs were mostly poorly removed and could accumulate in the sludge phase. The removal of several nitrogen/sulphur bearing TrOCs (e.g., linuron and caffeine) by AnMBR was higher than that by aerobic treatment, possibly due to nitrogen or sulphur reducing bacteria.

AB Submersed fixed-film reactors are ideal for the pretreatment of industrial effluents. The advantages lie not only in the investment costs, but also in the operating costs. The pretreatment plants can be subject to higher loads than are possible with the activated sludge process. Consequently, considerably less space is required. And, last but not least, it is also possible to treat normally non-degradable industrial effluents. The prerequisites are that system related general structural requirements are fulfilled and suitable materials are used for the fixed-film reactor.
   They also offer considerable advantages in terms of operation compared to the activated sludge process, since both a higher oxygen transfer rate and yield are achieved, less sludge is produced and fewer personnel are required. All in all, the upstream submerged fixed-film reactor has proven to be an extremely reliable process, requiring little maintenance, that can cope, to a far-reaching degree, with load fluctuations of all types and reduce these. As a result, the operation of downstream treatment stages is also stabilized.

AB Activated sludge (AS) is the mainly used biological process in water treatment; therefore, assessing the influence of various operating conditions on this process is relevant. This study aimed to evaluate at laboratory-scale the influence of the gas-to-liquid volume ratio (RG) and the stirring speed (SS) on the biodegradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) by activated sludge. For this purpose, a central composite design (CCD) was used in association with response surface methodology (RSM). Batch cultures were carried out at room temperature for 21 days in a mineral medium of initial pH 7, containing CBZ at an initial concentration of 5 mg L-1 and a given amount of AS (achieving 0.05 AU at 600 nm). The two parameters SS and R-G/L have been varied in the ranges of 80 to 320 rpm and 0.2 to 5, respectively. The pH, the (600 nm)-absorbance and the concentration of CBZ in the medium were monitored and their kinetics were modeled and linked to the operating conditions using principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained results showed that a low content of oxygen has a high positive effect, while an extreme stirring speed has a tiny negative effect on the process yield.

AB This study investigated the level of bisphenol A (BPA) in surface water used as potable water, drinking water (tap and bottled mineral water) and human plasma in the Langat River basin, Malaysia. BPA was present in 93% of the surface water samples at levels ranging from below limit of quantification (LOQ; 13 ng/L) to 215 ng/L while six fold higher levels were detected in samples collected near industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant outlets. Low levels of BPA were detected in most of the drinking water samples. BPA in tap water ranged from 3.5 to 59.8 ng/L with the highest levels detected in samples collected from taps connected to PVC pipes and water filter devices. Bottled mineral water had lower levels of BPA (3.3 +/- 2.6 ng/L) although samples stored in poor storage condition had significantly higher levels (113 +/- 5.3 ng/L). Meanwhile, only 17% of the plasma samples had detectable levels of BPA ranging from 0.81 to 3.65 ng/mL The study shows that BPA is a ubiquitous contaminant in surface, tap and bottled mineral water. However, exposure to BPA from drinking water is very low and is less than 0.01% of the tolerable daily intake (TDI). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last years, extensive research has documented endocrine-disrupting activities for a significant number of substances including, among others, hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and surfactants. Nonetheless, for most endocrine disruptors, toxicological profiles are still incomplete or even lacking. A systematic review has shown that a number of endocrine disruptors with steroid-modulating effects may also exert mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. For trenbolone, an androgenic compound, there is controversy about its genotoxic properties in the literature, apparently with a strong dependence on the choice of the test system. Since fish and other aquatic animals are at risk of exposure to run-offs from cattle feedlots or sewage-discharge sites containing trenbolone, potential consequences to aquatic ecosystems need to be assessed. To this end, the potential genotoxic hazard of trenbolone was tested in vitro in the permanent rainbow trout-liver cell-line RTL-W1, as well as in primary cell cultures derived from zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after in vivo exposure. In either test system, a potential genotoxic hazard characterized by biphasic dose-response curves could be documented even at exposure concentrations of 30 mu g/L. These results thus confirm the conclusion that the steroid trenbolone may act as a genotoxic substance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Predicting concentrations of trace organic compounds in municipal
   wastewater treatment plant sludge and biosolids using the PhATE (TM)
   model
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents the capability expansion of the PhATE (TM) (pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation) model to predict concentrations of trace organics in sludges and biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). PhATE was originally developed as an empirical model to estimate potential concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in US surface and drinking waters that could result from patient use of medicines. However, many compounds, including pharmaceuticals, are not completely transformed in WWTPs and remain in biosolids that may be applied to land as a soil amendment. This practice leads to concerns about potential exposures of people who may come into contact with amended soils and also about potential effects to plants and animals living in or contacting such soils. The model estimates the mass of API in WWTP influent based on the population served, the API per capita use, and the potential loss of the compound associated with human use (e.g., metabolism). The mass of API on the treated biosolids is then estimated based on partitioning to primary and secondary solids, potential loss due to biodegradation in secondary treatment (e.g., activated sludge), and potential loss during sludge treatment (e.g., aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion, composting). Simulations using 2 surrogate compounds show that predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) generated by PhATE are in very good agreement with measured concentrations, i.e., well within 1 order of magnitude. Model simulations were then carried out for 18 APIs representing a broad range of chemical and use characteristics. These simulations yielded 4 categories of results: 1) PECs are in good agreement with measured data for 9 compounds with high analytical detection frequencies, 2) PECs are greater than measured data for 3 compounds with high analytical detection frequencies, possibly as a result of as yet unidentified depletion mechanisms, 3) PECs are less than analytical reporting limits for 5 compounds with low analytical detection frequencies, and 4) the PEC is greater than the analytical method reporting limit for 1 compound with a low analytical detection frequency, possibly again as a result of insufficient depletion data. Overall, these results demonstrate that PhATE has the potential to be a very useful tool in the evaluation of APIs in biosolids. Possible applications include: prioritizing APIs for assessment even in the absence of analytical methods; evaluating sludge processing scenarios to explore potential mitigation approaches; using in risk assessments; and developing realistic nationwide concentrations, because PECs can be represented as a cumulative probability distribution. Finally, comparison of PECs to measured concentrations can also be used to identify the need for fate studies of compounds of interest in biosolids. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2012; 8: 530542.

AB The degradation of pefloxacin (PEF) solution using the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was studied in this paper. It was found that input power, gas velocity, initial concentration and discharge gap have distinct effects on the degradation ratio of PEF, and the degradation rate reached 96.1% after 25 min of treatment with input power of 0.7 W, oxygen flow rate of 125 mL min(-1), initial concentration of 120 mg L-1 and discharge gap of 2.5 mm. Furthermore, it was proved that O-3 and H2O2 an important role in the PEF degradation process by measuring the O-3 and H2O2 concentrations in the solution under air and O-2 atmosphere. The addition of tert-butanol inhibited the degradation of PEF, which proved that center dot OH is the primary active species in degradation process. Additionally, the intermediate products generated in the degradation process of PEF were analyzed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Based on the above analysis results, the possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed.

AB To study the effects of exposure of fish to opioid drugs, we exposed Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) over a full life cycle to codeine spiked into river water at nominal concentrations of 100, 1,000 and 25,000 ng/L and to fentanyl spiked into river water at nominal concentrations of 5, 25 and 1,000 ng/L. The measured concentrations during medaka exposures were consistent with the nominal concentrations. Treatments with codeine at all test concentrations reduced the number of eggs produced by female medaka, as well as the number of mature oocytes observed histologically in the ovaries. Exposures to codeine also resulted in altered concentrations of hormones within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, including reduced levels of 17 beta-estradiol in female medaka. Fentanyl did not affect reproduction or the levels of hormones in medaka at the concentrations tested. Monitoring of surface waters in southern Ontario, Canada downstream of wastewater treatment plants showed that the test concentrations of fentanyl and codeine were environmentally relevant. The results of this work contribute to the literature on the impacts of opioids and other drugs of abuse released into surface waters.

AB Wastewater reclamation plants using reverse osmosis as the final polishing treatment produce reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC), which consists of high salinity, nutrients and (recalcitrant) organics. The ROC collected from the water reclamation plant in Sydney was treated with a micro filtration (MF)-GAC hybrid system that removed natural and synthetic organics prior to its discharge into the environment. The MF-GAC hybrid system's performance was studied in terms of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) development, and organics removal. These features were measured using liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), Fluorescence Excitation-Emission matrix (F-EEM), and Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Adding GAC into the membrane reactor reduced the TMP by reducing membrane fouling both through mechanical scouring and pre-adsorption of organics. F-EEM confirms the removal of humics-like and fulvic-like compounds by GAC from ROC. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were also removed by the MF-GAC hybrid system.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) enter the soil environment via irrigation with treated wastewater, groundwater recharge, and land application of biosolids. The transformation and fate of PPCP/EDCs in soil affects their potential for plant uptake and groundwater pollution. This study examined four PPCP/EDCs (bisphenol A, diclofenac, naproxen, and 4-nonylphenol) in soil by using C-14-labeling and analyzing mineralization, extractable residue, bound residue, and formation of transformation products. At the end of 112 d of incubation, the majority of C-14-naproxen and C-14-diclofenac was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14, while a majority of C-14-bisphenol A and C-14-nonylphenol was converted to bound residue. After 112 d, the estimated half-lives of the parent compounds were only 1.4-5.4 d. However a variety of transformation products were found and several for bisphenol A and diclofenac were identified, suggesting the need to consider degradation intermediates in soils impacted by PPCP/EDCs.

AB The process of embalming human remains as part of the funeral home industry, entails replacing blood with embalming fluid. Typically the unused/excess fluids are disposed of directly to the sewershed or septic system. The presence of select contaminants in sewer discharges from 8 funeral homes (facilities) in York Region, Ontario during active embalming processes was studied. A wide range of contaminants including embalming fluids (formaldehyde and triclosan); metals, conventional parameters, persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated byphenyls), nonyl phenols and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were measured in the final embalming effluent and compared to regulatory sewer limits where available. Two main constituents of embalming fluids-formaldehyde and triclosan-were detected at maximum concentrations of 561,000 mu g/L and 505 mu g/L respectively. Other persistent organic pollutants detected in embalming effluent included banned pesticides lindane (83 ng/L) and metabolites of DDT (DDE; 2,300 ng/L). Elevated APIs found in over-thecounter drugs and products were also frequently detected at elevated concentrations (oxybenzone, hydrocortisone, lidocaine, naproxen, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin and DEET). Most contaminants did not exceed regulatory sewer limits where available, however others including biochemical oxygen demand (cBOD(5)) and conventional parameters were consistently above regulatory limits. Large amounts of formaldehyde and triclosan may pose a risk to receiving sewersheds and receiving sewage treatment plants due to their antimicrobial activities.

AB This study investigated the performances of nanofiltration (NF-NF 90, NF 270, MPF34, DK and Duracid) and reverse osmosis (RO-BW30 and SG) as surface water treatments to reject pharmaceutical compounds at very low concentrations, on water permeability and on their desalting ability. The Doce river in Brazil was chosen as the background matrix for this study (geographical coordinates 18 degrees 51'50.45 '' S and 41 degrees 56'46.86 '' W), this river is a source of drinking water and used for sewage disposal without previous treatment. Five pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were detected recurrently and were investigated in this study: Betamethasone, Fluconazole, Phenylbutazone, Prednisone and Metformin. The results obtained suggest that NF may be the better option. The NF rejection efficiencies are very close to those achieved by RO membranes. Among the evaluated NF membranes, the DK membrane was selected as being the most suitable since it showed high desalting ability and PhAC rejection associated with high permeate flux, low fouling potential and specific energy consumption. The flux decline was dependent on the surface water composition but generally occurred due to concentration polarization. DK membrane showed high rejection of the charge of hydrophilic neutral PhAC evaluated, but limited rejection of Betamethasone, a more hydrophobic neutral compound. The rejection of this hydrophobic neutral compound was affected by water composition and membrane fouling.

AB Anticancer drugs, used in chemotherapy, have emerged as new water contaminants due to their increasing consumption trends and poor elimination efficiency in conventional water treatment processes. As a result, anticancer drugs have been reported in surface and even drinking waters, posing the environment and human health at risk. However, the occurrence and distribution of anticancer drugs depend on the area studied and the hydrological dynamics, which determine the risk towards the environment.
   The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the risk of anticancer drugs in Portugal. This work includes an extensive analysis of the consumption trends of 171 anticancer drugs, sold or dispensed in Portugal between 2007 and 2015. The consumption data was processed aiming at the estimation of predicted environmental loads of anticancer drugs and 11 compounds were identified as potentially priority drugs based on an exposure-based approach (PECb> 10 ng L-1 and/or PECc> 1 ng L-1). In a national perspective, mycophenolic acid and mycophenolate mofetil are suspected to pose high risk to aquatic biota. Moderate and low risk was also associated to cyclophosphamide and bicalutamide exposition, respectively. Although no evidences of risk exist yet for the other anticancer drugs, concerns may be associated with long term effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, photolytic and photocatalytic removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under UVC radiation (lambda = 254 nm) was investigated. The light intensity distribution inside the batch photoreactor was characterized by azoxybenzene actinometry. The intensity of incident radiation was found to be a strong function of position inside the reactor. 12 mg L-1 of SMX was completely removed within 10 min of irradiation under UVC photolysis, compared to 30 min under TiO2 photocatalysis. COD measurement was used as an indication of the mineralization efficiency of both processes and higher COD removal with photocatalysis was shown. After 6 h of reaction with photolysis and photocatalysis, 24% and 87% removal of COD was observed, respectively. Two of the intermediate photo-products were identified as sulfanilic acid and 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole by direct comparison of the HPLC chromatograms of standards to those of treated solutions. Ecotoxicity of treated and untreated solutions of SMX towards Daphnia magna was also investigated. It was found that a 3:1 ratio of sample to standard freshwater and a high initial concentration of 60 mg L-1 of SMX were used to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The photo-products formed during photocatalytic and photolytic processes were shown to be generally more toxic than the parent compound. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Fouling and scaling are common phenomena that accompany membrane filtration and are caused by the presence of organic and inorganic matter in water, which may affect the removal of low-molecular mass organic micropollutants. Comparative filtration of deionized water containing selected phytoestrogens (biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol) was carried out using one new membrane and one contaminated with organic or inorganic matter. Two commercial Osmonics DS membranes were selected for the research, reverse osmosis DS3SE and nanofiltration DS5DK. Filtration was carried out in the dead-end mode. Higher removal of phytoestrogens was caused by reverse osmosis and retention depended on the molar mass of the compound. The decrease in membrane efficiency associated with fouling or scaling brings about an increase in the retention coefficient of phytoestrogens during both reverse osmosis and nanofiltration. The highest increase in phytoestrogen retention was found for the nanofiltraton membrane which was more susceptible to fouling than the osmotic one. This confirms the effect of membrane porosity on the phenomenon studied. The increase in micropollutants removal observed after fouling or scaling was caused by the modification of the membrane surface, hindered diffusion of the compound, and intensified or limited adsorption of micropollutants on the membrane surface.

AB In present study, we investigated the enantioselective behaviors of the chiral antidepressant venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine in loath Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (M. anguillicaudatus), as well as effects of microplastic on toxicity, distribution and metabolism through a 40-day co-exposure. The contents of SOD and MDA in loach liver elevated when the loach was exposed to venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Moreover, co-exposure with microplastic might lead to more adverse effect against loach. The distribution of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were both detected in loath tissues and liver subcellular. The concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were lower in water in microplastic-present treatment. Whilst, more contaminants were accumulated in liver through the "vehicle" (microplastic). Enantioselective behavior of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine occurred with R-enantiomers being preferentially degraded. With microplastic present, the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine in loath tissue amplified more than 10 times. In liver subcellular structure, microplastic may help to transport more compounds into subtle areas and postpone the contaminants metabolism in organisms. The present study for the first time gained an insight into the potential ecological effects and environmental behaviors of combined pollutions of chiral pharmaceuticals and microplastic, which could supply important information for environment risk assessment of concurrent organic pollutants and microplastic.

AB The photocatalytic oxidation of carbamazepine (CBZ, an antiepileptic drug frequently detected in surface water and WWTP effluent) in WO3 suspension under the irradiation of 420 nm lamps has been investigated. The addition of S2O82- to this process can significantly accelerate the CBZ degradation. It was interesting to observe that conventional radical quenchers like methanol and ethanol promoted the photocatalytic oxidation of CBZ at low concentration (<100 mM), while the tert-butanol inhibits or accelerates the CBZ degradation depending on its concentration. To explore this, the decomposition of CBZ with and without the presence of methanol was investigated in details through the comparison of evolution of intermediates/products, and the comparison of generated radicals by ESR spectroscopy in the process. Sulfate radicals are believed to play a major role during CBZ decay with the presence of methanol in this process. It was found the rate enhancement of methanol is likely due to the competition between quenching effect and cleaning effect on the catalyst surface. In addition, the reaction mechanism reveals that CBZ degradation is mainly dominant by the electrophilic attack of radicals at olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring, leading to ring-opening and formation of various intermediates.

AB The presence of PPCPs (Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products) in water sources and drinking water has concerned researchers in recent times. This study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of 6 PPCPs (namely paracetamol, diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, benzophenone-3 and methylparaben) in the Lobo reservoir, their degradation products, and how efficiently they were removed by 22 ecological filters, considering individual and mixture of compounds. There were 3 spiking events of PPCPs (2 mu g L-1) in the ecological filter influents conducted with a lag period of 15 days between spikes. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the filters at 3, 6 and 24 h after each spiking event. All target PPCPs were identified in the Lobo reservoir water in the range of mu g L-1. The personal care products were detected with 100% frequency in the samples, and in higher concentrations compared to the pharmaceuticals. Degradation products of diclofenac and benzophenone-3 were identified in the water samples. Results of this investigation show that ecological filtration was an effective process (70-99%) to remove 2 mu g L-1 of the selected PPCPs, and demonstrated that the filters were resilient to individual compounds and to their mixtures.

AB The river Yamuna is a major tributary of river Ganges and is a major source of freshwater in the National Capital Territory (NCT) catering 16.8 million people. This is the first report on occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk assessment of various pharmaceuticals active compounds (PhACs) in the Yamuna river. In this study, spatial and temporal distribution of nine PhACs "aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, caffeine, ranitidine, diclofenac, carbamazepine, codeine, and diazepam", belonging to different therapeutic groups have been reported. Nine PhACs were analyzed in all the samples collected from the NCT stretch of river Yamuna. No specific trend in the distribution of the pharmaceutical residues was observed, however, the results revealed comparably higher PhACs contamination at YMN-2 (downstream Wazirabad, at this point, Najafgarh drain joins river Yamuna). Ecotoxicological risk assessment was carried out using Hazard quotients (HQ) for normal and worst case scenarios. The HQ showed that the levels of PhACs present in the samples were insufficient to cause acute toxicity to the flora and fauna of the river Yamuna. However, such residues could possibly cause chronic toxicity to the aquatic life and human beings as a huge amount of water of the river Yamuna is used for the drinking purposes in the NCT Delhi, the state capital of India.

AB The pharmaceutical compounds are emerging pollutants for which the international scientific community has paid special attention in recent years, because these substances can have adverse effects on living organisms in the aquatic environment. In this paper we developed a chromatographic method for the quantification of trace class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs in river water. The present method is a simple and economical way to perform a preliminary screening of eight widely used pharmaceuticals in water. To isolate the analytes from river aqueous matrix we used solid-phase extraction testing three specific types of adsorbents (LiChrolut EN, OASIS HLB and Supelclean ENVI-18). The extract obtained was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with multi waved detector. To reach the sensitivity required in this field, and to be able of determining the low pharmaceuticals concentration levels commonly present in water, a pre-concentration of 1,000 times has been applied. The detection limits in water samples ranged between 0.04 mu g/L and 0.6 mu g/L and the best recoveries were obtained for LiChrolute EN adsorbent (72% and 107%). In the next step of project we need to confirm the identity of the compounds detected in the samples by powerful LC MS technique.

AB Pharmaceuticals reach terrestrial environments through the application of treated wastewaters and biosolids to agricultural soils. We have investigated the toxicity of 15 common pharmaceuticals, classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), blood lipid-lowering agents, beta-blockers and antibiotics, in two photosynthetic organisms. Twelve pharmaceuticals caused inhibitory effects on the radicle and hypocotyl elongation of Lactuca sativa seeds. The EC50 values obtained were in the range of 170-5656 mg L-1 in the case of the radicle and 188-4558 mg L-1 for the hypocotyl. Propranolol was the most toxic drug for both root and hypocotyl elongation, followed by the NSAIDs, then gemfibrozil and tetracycline. Other effects, such as root necrosis, inhibition of root growth and curly hairs, were detected. However, even at the highest concentrations tested (3000 mg L-1), seed germination was not affected. NSAIDs decreased the photosynthetic yield of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but only salicylic acid showed EC50 values below 1000 mg L-1. The first effects detected at low concentrations, together with the concentrations found in environmental samples, indicate that the use of biosolids and wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals should be regulated and their compositions assessed in order to prevent medium- and long-term impacts on agricultural soils and crops.

AB The adsorptive removal of five sulfa drugs (sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethizole, sulfadimidine and sulfamethoxazole) from an aqueous solution using a high-silica zeolite (HSZ-385) was investigated. pH greatly affected adsorption efficiency, and the amounts of all sulfa drugs adsorbed on HSZ-385 decreased at pH levels below and above their pK(a,1) and pK(a,2) values, respectively. We hypothesized that sulfa drugs in the neutral form would more readily adsorb onto HSZ-385 compared to those in the cationic and anionic forms, with adsorption predominately occurring via hydrophobic interactions. The Langmuir model was suitable for describing the adsorption of neutral sulfa drugs on HSZ-385, and a pH-dependent adsorption model was developed by considering the acid-base equilibria of the sulfa drugs. The calculated and experimental results corresponded well, strongly supporting our suggestion that the dominant adsorbed species was the neutral form and that the adsorption mechanism was based on hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the adsorption rate of the sulfa drugs on the zeolite was kinetically evaluated using a pseudo-second-order model, and a high adsorption rate was observed. The adsorption of sulfa drugs reached equilibrium within 15 min, indicating that HSZ-385 is a promising adsorbent for removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous media. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antibiotics are widely used, and there is a serious concern about its adverse impacts on the environment and human health. To our knowledge, prior to this work, there was no evidence of the potential presence of antibiotics in groundwater in China, despite populous speculations. This study reported the detection of 35 target antibiotics of 6 groups (chloramphenicois, lincosamides, marcrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines), in shallow groundwater samples collected in northern and southwestern China. Thirty-four of thirty-five target antibiotics were detected in the groundwater samples; 73 of 74 monitoring wells contained at least one antibiotic; and at least two antibiotics were detected in 72 of the 74 wells. Ofloxacin (1199.7 ng/L), lincomycin (860.7 ng/L), and norfloxacin (441.9 ng/L) as well as antibiotics with the highest detection frequency such as sulfapyridine (70%), norfloxacin (69%), and lincomycin (64%) were detected at elevated concentrations. The highest detection frequency and concentration of lincosamides were observed in those groundwater samples, but no clear distribution patterns were observed for the six antibiotic groups. Moreover, shallow groundwater in southwestern China seemed to contain most antibiotics, likely due to the high antibiotics discharge and frequent exchange of groundwater with surface matrices. The findings from this work suggest that groundwater in China has been widely contaminated by antibiotics, and presumably other pharmaceutical compounds that have not been investigated to date.

AB A technical scale (0.12 m(3)) activated soil filter (bio filter) has been used to eliminate diverse xenobiotics (organic micro-pollutants) such as organophosphate flame retardants, and -plasticisers, musk fragrances, DEHP, benzothiazoles and triclosan from water. Model experiments to treat combined sewer overflow, storm water and a post treatment of waste water were performed in controlled laboratory experiments. The indicator compounds were typical for waste water. Diverse chemical compound groups and a wide spectrum from the lipophilic (pK(ow) = 5.9) to the hydrophilic (pK(ow) = 2.6) were included. The system consisted of a layer with high organic content (with vegetation to prevent clogging), a sand filter and a gravel drainage layer. The organic layer was spiked with activated sludge to enhance biomass and biodegradation potential. Usually the elimination rates varied from 64% to 99%, with only one compound reaching as little as 17%. For a technical suitability assessment it was calculated how long these filters would be stable in eliminating organic compounds from water. The estimated operating times for such systems was found to be about 100 years for a stack height of 2 m a year in regard to most compounds in this study (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Residual diclofenac sodium (DS) in water is a potential hazard. The electrostatic attraction between amino group of adsorbents and carboxyl group of DS under acidic conditions can effectively remove DS from water. Herein, a novel core-shell adsorbent of poly(vinyl alcohol)/chitosan/amino-grafted silica@polyethylenimine (PVA/CS/SAP@PEI) gel bead was prepared to efficiently uptake DS from wastewater. In this study, the gel bead was characterized using FTIR, XPS, SEM, EDS, and C-13 NMR. The experimental data shows that there is a strong correlation between adsorption capacity. The adsorption data fitted well with the Freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order model. The results of thermodynamics show that the adsorption process is spontaneous, endothermic, and increases entropy. The maximum adsorption capacity for DS was calculated as 493.81 mg/g at pH 5 (308 K). The adsorbent still exhibited excellent adsorption capacity after recycling five times, showing it has excellent potential for practical applications.

AB A variety of organic compounds and their metabolites used in pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP's) are continuously introduced into the environment by domestic or industrial wastewater. Solid phase extraction (polymeric dinivylbenzene cartridge) and stir bar sorptive extraction (polydimethylsiloxane phase) methodologies were optimized for the determination of some selected PPCP's in aqueous matrices. Carbamazepine, beta estradiol, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) champhor, benzophenone-1 and ibuprofen were extracted from aqueous samples and methanol was used as conditioning/eluting solvent. The variables involved in the extraction of the analytes in the original sample were studied, pH between 3 and 6 and sample volume between 50 and 500 mL were considered. Three concentration levels were extracted at the optimal conditions of pH 5 and 500 mL of sample volume with a recovery up to 89%. The determination was performed in a GC-MS, and a derivatization step using BSTFA+ TMCS (99: 1) was needed previous to the injection. Real samples from Maipo River and Villarrica Lake were analyzed with the optimized method, and concentrations below the detection limit were detected.

AB This study aimed to isolate and characterize a microbial culture able to degrade sulfonamides. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX)-degrading microorganisms were enriched from activated sludge and wastewater. The resultant mixed culture was composed of four bacterial strains, out of which only Achromobacter denitrificans PR1 could degrade SMX. This sulfonamide was used as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy with stoichiometric accumulation of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole. Strain PR1 was able to remove SMX at a rate of 73.6 +/- 9.6 mu mol(SMX)/g(cell) (dry) (weight) h. This rate more than doubled when a supplement of amino acids or the other members of the mixed culture were added. Besides SMX, strain PR1 was able to degrade other sulfonamides with anti-microbial activity. Other environmental Achromobacter spp. could not degrade SMX, suggesting that this property is not broadly distributed in members of this genus. Further studies are needed to shed additional light on the genetics and enzymology of this process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro estrogenic and the cytotoxic activity of six cytostatics (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and imatinib) belonging to the five classes of Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) detected in wastewater systems. The estrogenic activity was assessed by YES-assay on Saccharomyces cerevisiae-RMY326 and E-screen on MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic activity was assessed by MIT Cell Proliferation Assay on the MCF-7 and the MDA-MB-231 cells.
   The results of estrogenic activity, detected by E-screen and expressed as EC50, showed a high potential of imatinib (10(-7) mu M) followed by cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Capecitabine was poorly estrogenic while etoposide and doxorubicin EC50 values were not possible to determine. Cytotoxicity was found at concentrations far from those detected in effluents. The potential endocrine activity of the most active drugs could be associated with human and wildlife risk when considering their occurrence in the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern were measured in mussels collected along the California coast in 2009-2010. The seven classes were alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), other flame retardants, current use pesticides, perfluorinated compounds (PFC), and single walled carbon nanotubes. At least one contaminant was detected at 67 of the 68 stations (98%), and 67 of the 167 analytes had at least one detect (40%). Alkylphenol, PBDE, and PFC concentrations increased with urbanization and proximity to storm water discharge; pesticides had higher concentrations at agricultural stations. These results suggest that certain compounds; for example, alkyiphenols, lomefloxacin and PBDE, are appropriate for inclusion in future coastal bivalve monitoring efforts based on maximum concentrations >50 ng/g dry weight and detection frequencies >50%. Other compounds, for example PFC and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), may also be suggested for inclusion due to their >25% detection frequency and potential for biomagnification.

AB In the study, a novel electrochemically modified carbon nanofibrous anodic membrane (G/SnO2/CFs) is observed to be effective toward electrochemical oxidation of main emerging and refractory pharmaceutical. By innovatively incorporating graphene/tin dioxide (G/SnO2) into carbon nanofibers (CFs), the electrooxidative performance and conductivity can be improved significantly by the significant electrooxidation capacity of SnO2 and excellent electrical conductivity of graphene. Herein, the electrochemical filtration and degradation efficacy of the PAN-based G/SnO2/CFs microfiltration (MF) membrane filter was evaluated by the electrochemical degradation performance of refractory toxic organic - sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The study proved that, the increased anodic membrane amount and flow-through mode lead to enhanced degradation performance. 9 non-toxic smaller intermediates of SMX were identified by LC-MS/MS, so that the SMX transformation pathway was proposed. The excellent SMX degradation performance (85% removal efficiency) and membrane stability (10 cycles up to 50 h reaction) suggests the potential of G/SnO2/CFs MF membrane filter to treat the refractory toxic organic from wastewater.

AB A visible-light Z-scheme g-C3N4/Fe-0/TiO2 anodic catalyst was tested with cathodic WO3 in photocatalytic Fuel Cell (PFC) that efficiently degrades berberine chloride and simultaneously generate electricity at pH 2,5,7 and 13. The Stainless-steel mesh electrodes loaded with prepared catalyst were irradiated by visible-light in single chamber PFC. The highest removal of berberine Chloride, cell voltage, and power density were 91%, 0.8 V, and 16.4 W/m(2) at a current density of 2.02 mA/cm(2), respectively after 90 min irradiation in 0.05 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with 10 Omega external resistance. The impacts of pH and initial concentration of BEC on photocatalytic degradation and cell voltage were evaluated. The cell current density is enhanced while the photocatalyst activity increased. The constructed PFC maintained high-performance after 5 uses. Its use in degrading wide spectrum refractory pollutants and generate electricity is expected for the proved catalyst design, paired electrodes and high PFC performance for practical wastewater treatment.

AB Currently, due to the global shortage of water, the use of reclaimed water from the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) for the irrigation of crops is an alternative in areas with water scarcity. However, the use of this reclaimed water for vegetable irrigation is a potential entry of pharmaceutical products into the food chain due to the absorption and accumulation of these contaminants in different parts of the plants. In this work we carried out an analysis of five machine learning techniques (Random Forest, support vector machine, M5 Rules, Gaussian Process and artificial neural network) to predict the uptake of carbamazepine and diclofenac in reclaimed water-irrigated lettuces with the consequent saving of environmental and economic costs. For the different combinations of input and output, the prediction results using the of machine learning techniques proposed on the pharmaceutical components in reclaimed water-irrigated lettuces are satisfactory, being the best technique the Random Forest that obtains a model fit value (R-2) higher than 96.5% using a single input in the model and higher than 97% using two inputs in the model.

AB The biomass growth, pharmaceutical removal and light conversion efficiency of Chlorella sorokiniana under the presence of paracetamol (PC) and salicylic acid (SaC) were assessed and compared at two different concentrations of these pharmaceuticals (I: 25 mg l(-1), II: 250 mg l(-1)). Microalgae were resistant to these concentrations and, moreover, their growth was significantly stimulated (p <= 0.05) under these drugs (biomass concentration increased above 33% PCI, 35% SaCI, 13% PCII and 45% SaCII, as compared with the respective positive controls). At the steady state of the semicontinuous culture, C sorokiniana showed removal efficiencies above 41% and 69% for PCI and PCII, respectively; and above 93% and 98% for SaCI and SaCII, respectively. Under an irradiance of 370 mu E m(-2) s(-1), higher quantum yields were reached by microalgae under the presence of drugs, either at dose I or II, than by the respective positive controls. These results point to C. sorokiniana as a robust strain for the bioremediation of paracetamol and salicylic acid concentrated wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Na-montmorillonite (Mont) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB-Mont) and tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB-Mont) was used to remove salicylic acid (SA) under batch kinetic and different solution conditions. The adsorption capacity of CTAB-Mont (202.1 mg/g) was larger compared to TMAB-Mont (10.2 mg/g) under the same conditions. Characterization of the modified Monts was performed with X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, elemental analyses, zeta potential, and molecular simulation by the Forcite module of Materials Studio 5.0 software. The Freundlich isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit the experimental data well. The results indicated that the adsorption mechanism of SA absorbed on CTAB-Mont is based on strong interaction of SA with the exposed siloxane surface and also on pi-pi interaction of SA with the absorbed SA molecules in the interlayer. The arrangement of molecules in the interlayer was studied by molecular simulation and the results were consistent with the experimental results. The consistency verified the hypothesized adsorption mechanism.

AB The biocide triclosan (TCS, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is commonly used in several personal care products, textiles, and children's toys. Because the removal of TCS by wastewater treatment plants is incomplete, its environmental fate is to be discharged into freshwater ecosystems, where its ecological impact is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of TCS on the antioxidant enzymatic chain of the freshwater mollusk zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). We measured the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in zebra mussel specimens exposed to 1 nM, 2 nM, and 3 nM TCS in vivo. The mussels were exposed for 96 h, and the enzyme activities were measured every 24 h. We measured clear activation of GST alone at all three dose levels, which shows a poor induction of the antioxidant enzymatic chain by TCS. CAT and SOD were activated only at 3 nM, while GPx values overlapped the baseline levels.

AB Fertilisers may contain pollutants that are applied to the field together with the nutrients. Comparing fertilisers is difficult because of their different concentrations of nutrients and pollutants. In this study an already existing model was taken. It was further developed to compare nutrient fluxes (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S; humus) and pollutants (heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) of pig and cattle slurry as well as human urine. The data used is taken from literature and, in the case of pharmaceuticals in urine, daily excretion rates were calculated. An amount of 19m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) undiluted urine can be applied, limiting factor is sulphur. Without taking over-fertilisation into account, an addition of mineral fertiliser is required to any organic fertiliser application. In general, heavy metal, antibiotic, and hormone fluxes are higher by using animal manure then urine as fertiliser. However, additional loads of other pharmaceuticals consumed by humans have to be considered. Overall, the model is a suitable tool worthwhile to be extended in aspects of hygiene, environmental impacts as for example, degradation processes as well as ecotoxicology.

AB Recent studies indicate that the pharmaceutical fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is discharged in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents to surface waters. Few data on environmental fluoxetine exposure and hazard to aquatic life are currently available in the literature. Here, we summarize information on fluoxetine detection in surface waters and review research on single-species toxicity test, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) reproduction and endocrine function, and freshwater mesocosm community responses to fluoxetine exposure. Based on results from our studies and calculations of expected introduction concentrations, we also provide a preliminary aquatic risk characterization for fluoxetine. If standard toxicity test responses and a hazard quotient risk characterization approach are solely considered, little risk of fluoxetine exposure may be expected to aquatic life. However, our findings indicate that: (1) the magnitude, duration and frequency of fluoxetine exposure in aquatic systems requires further investigation; (2) mechanistic toxicity of fluoxetine in non-target biota, including behavioral responses, are clearly not understood; and (3) an assessment of environmentally relevant fluoxetine concentrations is needed to characterize ecological community responses.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is a widespread water treatment process utilised in water reuse applications. However, the improper discharge of RO concentrate (ROC) containing organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals into the environment may cause potential health risks to non-target species and particularly those in aquatic environments. A study was conducted using a submerged membrane-filtration/granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption hybrid system to remove organic micropollutants from a water treatment plant ROC by initially adding 10 g GAC /L of membrane reactor volume with 10% daily GAC replacement. The percentage of dissolved organic carbon removal varied from 60% to 80% over an operation lasting 10 days. Removal of organic micropollutants was almost complete for virtually all compounds. Of the 19 micropollutants tested, only two remained (the less hydrophobic DEET 27 ng/L and the hydrophilic sulfamethoxazole 35 ng/L) below 80% removal on day 1, while five of the most hydrophobic micropollutants were detectable in very small concentrations (<5-10 ng/L) with >89%->99% being removed. High percentages of micropollutants were removed probably because of their high hydrophobicity or they had positive or neutral charges and therefore they were electrostatically adsorbed to the negatively charged GAC.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in waters and soils is of particular concern because these compounds can be biologically active, even at environmental concentrations. Most pharmaceutical contaminants result from inefficient removal of these compounds during wastewater treatment. Although microorganisms able to biodegrade pharmaceuticals compounds have been described, the isolation and characterization of new bacterial strains capable of degrading drugs remain important to improve the removal of this pollutant. In this work, we describe the Sphingomonas wittichii strain MPO218 as able to use ibuprofen as the sole carbon and energy source. The genome of MPO218 consists of a circular chromosome and two circular plasmids. Our analysis shows that the largest plasmid, named pIBU218, is conjugative and can horizontally transfer the capability of growing on ibuprofen after conjugation with another related bacterium, Sphingopyxis granuli TFA. This plasmid appears to be unstable since it undergoes different deletions in absence of selection when growth on ibuprofen is not selected. This is the first described example of a natural and conjugative plasmid that enables growth on ibuprofen and is another example of how horizontal gene transfer plays a crucial role in the evolution of bacteria.

AB In this work, a novel catalyst of Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 was prepared and the degradation of thymol in reverse osmosis concentrate using ozonation was explored. The operational parameters, such as ozone dosage (8-48 mg.min(-1)), initial thymol concentration (20-100 mg.L-1), initial pH value (3-11), and catalyst Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 dosage (0.2-1.0 g), were studied focusing on the thymol degradation and COD removal. The results indicated that the increase in ozone dosage, initial pH value, and Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 dosage accelerated the thymol degradation and COD removal, while the increase in initial thymol concentration hampered the effect of ozonation. A pathway of thymol degradation by catalytic ozonation was proposed based on the intermediates detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer and ion chromatography. This paper can provide basic data and technical alternative for pollutant removal from reverse osmosis concentrate by ozonation.

AB Environmental release of veterinary pharmaceuticals has been of regulatory concern for more than a decade. Monensin is a feed additive antibiotic that is prevalent throughout the dairy industry and is excreted in dairy waste. This study investigates the potential of dairy waste management practices to alter the amount of monensin available for release into the environment. Analysis of wastewater and groundwater from two dairy farms in California consistently concluded that monensin is most present in lagoon water and groundwater downgradient of lagoons. Since the lagoons represent a direct source of monensin to groundwater, the effect of waste management, by mechanical screen separation and lagoon aeration, on aqueous monensin concentration was investigated through construction of lagoon microcosms. The results indicate that monensin attenuation is not improved by increased solid-liquid separation prior to storage in lagoons, as monensin is rapidly desorbed after dilution with water. Monensin is also shown to be easily degraded in lagoon microcosms receiving aeration, but is relatively stable and available for leaching under typical anaerobic lagoon conditions.

AB Surface waters in urban areas are contaminated by ibuprofen (IBP), a popular and extensively used anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic response in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. roots with the aim of revealing genes that are potentially involved in IBP detoxification and elucidating the effect of IBP on plants. IBP upregulated 63 and downregulated 38 transcripts (p-value < 0.1, fold change >= 2) after 2-day exposure to a 5-mu M (1.03mg/L) concentration of IBP under hydroponic conditions. Although the IBP concentration used in the experiment was highly relative to the concentrations found in rivers and wastewater, the number of genes with transcriptional changes was relatively low. The upregulation of cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and UDP-glycosyltransferases indicates the occurrence of IBP oxidation in the first phase, followed by conjugation with glutathione and sugar in the second detoxification phase. ABC transporters could be involved in the transport of IBP and its metabolites.

AB A rotating suspension cartridge reactor immobilized with white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was employed to treat synthetic wastewater containing 1000 mu g l(-1) of the recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compound carbamazepine. The reactor was continuously operated for 160 days under non-sterile conditions. After one month of fungal adaptation, the removal efficiency for carbamazepine exceeded 90% through such strategies as the immobilization of P. chtysosporium on the polyurethane foam cubes (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm(3)), the pattern of liquid/air flow inside the cartridge created through the application of intermittent operational mode, and the gradual cut of external carbon source loading in the influent. Both nutrients and oxygen were effectively transferred to fungi, which contributed to the excellent bioreactor treatment performance for the long-term continuous operation. The bacterial contamination occurring in the bioreactor was effectively suppressed, providing a feasible alternative to treat recalcitrant compounds under non-sterile conditions.

AB This study aims to demonstrate that a combined system of membrane bioreactor (MBR) with electrooxidation (EO) can be a promising technology to treat compounds such as carbamazepine (CBZ). The MBR showed high capacity to remove the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and low capacity for the degradation (20% of removal), after 120 d of operation; which presumably indicates that CBZ was not toxic for microorganisms, despite its poor degradation. On the other hand, the EO system was capable to completely degrade CBZ (99.99% of removal). In addition, the MBR achieved 83% of conversion efficiency of NH4+ to NO3- or NO2-; and only 20.5% of PO4- removal. A toxicity test using Dapnia magna and Vibrio fischeri was carried out. Results indicated that MBR is an efficient method to decrease wastewater toxicity but during electrooxidation treatment higher toxicity was obtained, probably due to the generation of more toxic compounds than the initial pollutants.

AB The removal of selected surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), coconut diethanol amides (CDEA) and alkylphenol ethoxylates and their degradation products were investigated using a two membrane bioreactor (MBR) with hollow fiber and plate and frame membranes.
   The two pilot plants MBR run in parallel to a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. A total of eight influent samples with the corresponding effluent samples were analysed by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS-MS).
   The results indicate that both MBR have a better effluent quality in terms of chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD), NH4+, concentration and total suspended solids (TSS). MBR showed a better similar performance in the overall elimination of the total nonylphenotic compounds, achieving a 75% of elimination or a 65% (the same elimination reached by CAS).
   LAS and CDEA showed similar elimination in the three systems investigated and no significant differences were observed. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All. rights reserved.

AB Many of the human pharmaceuticals detected in municipal wastewater effluent, surface water, and groundwater contain functional groups that could undergo transformation reactions during chlorine disinfection. To assess the potential importance of these reactions to the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals, the rate of transformation of a group of compounds was measured over a pH range of 5-10. Several of the pharmaceuticals reacted rapidly with free chlorine (i.e., HOCl/OCl-) and would be expected to undergo transformation under the conditions typically encountered in many chlorine disinfection systems. For compounds containing aromatic ether functional groups, the rate of transformation was strongly affected by the other substituents on the ring. The amine-containing pharmaceuticals underwent a rapid reaction with hypochlorous acid to form chlorinated amines, which could be converted back into the parent compound by reaction with thiosulfate. In the absence of thiosulfate, the chlorinated amines slowly decomposed to form species that could not be converted back into the parent compound. The reaction rates of the pharmaceuticals with combined chlorine (i.e., chloramines) were significantly slower, and transformation of the compounds would not be expected under the conditions encountered during chloramination.

AB The 350 ML per d Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) tertiary facility produces "Class A" water for the city of Melbourne, Australia, which is used for irrigation, dual reticulation and fire fighting. The ETP process utilizes ozone and biological media filtration as part of the advanced treatment train for secondary treated waste-water. An extensive sampling campaign was carried out to evaluate the removal of hundreds of contaminants of concern through various steps in the treatment train, as well as identify the formation of any byproducts of the treatment process. Degradation of contaminants throughout the treatment was mainly controlled by the ozone process. Chemicals with moderate to high reaction rates with ozone and/or (OH)-O-center dot radical (10 M-1 s(-1) <= k(O3) or k(O3) < 10 M-1 s(-1) and k. OH = 5 x 109 M-1 s(-1)) were removed by the tertiary treatment to below the detection limit. However, the advanced treatment train resulted in some contaminants increasing in concentration (i.e. NDMA and desisopropyl atrazine) and other newly forming contaminants, such as trihalomethanes and chloral hydrate. The resulting levels of contaminants of concern remaining in the ETP final effluent were below levels of relevance based on guidelines for reuse in irrigation or discharge to the environment.

AB In complement to the initial study assessing the impact of hazardous events on membrane bioreactor (MBR) bulk performances, detailed assessment of the consequences of similar events has now been conducted on the removal of a wide range of trace organic chemical contaminants. The investigated chemicals include 12 steroidal hormones, 4 xenoestrogens, 2 pesticides, 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Under salinity, DNP, ammonia and organic carbon shock conditions, overall removal of hydrophobic chemicals (log DpH7 >= 2.5) was not or only slightly affected. Since these chemicals are largely adsorbed to biomass, these results imply that biotransformation within the biomass structure itself was maintained. However, removal of hydrophilic chemicals (log D-pH7 <2.5) was commonly observed to be impeded under shock load conditions, indicating loss of bioactivity. This was observed primarily for chemicals which have low or moderate biotransformability. In comparison, easily biotransformable chemicals were largely removed. The susceptibility of less readily biotransformable hydrophilic chemicals to shock loads was due to their reliance upon specific organisms or metabolic pathways for their biotransformation. The results of these experiments show that hydrophilic chemicals with low biotransformability (e.g., sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, gemfibrozil and naproxen) could be sensitive indicators for monitoring impacts of hazardous events on removal of trace organic chemicals by MBRs.

AB The need for more effective drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases as well as for general applications including wound healing and burn surgery, has guided efforts for the discovery of new compounds of medical interest. Microorganisms found in textile industrial waste have the ability to produce a variety of enzymes and/or secondary metabolites including molecules of pharmaceutical interest. The present work investigated the biotechnological potential of filamentous fungi isolated from textile industry wastewater for the production of collagenase and antimicrobial metabolites. From 28 isolates assayed, Sarocladium sp. ITF33 showed specific collagenolytic activity with values of 7.62 and 9.04 U mg(-1) for the intracellular and extracellular fractions, respectively. The isolate Penicillium sp. ITF28 showed the best antimicrobial activity, reaching MIC ranging from 1.0 to 0.0625 mg mL(-1) against five pathogenic bacteria. Molecular analyzes suggest that the isolate Sarocladium sp. ITF 33 can be considered a species not yet described. The results of the present work encourage studies of characterization and purification of the enzymes and secondary metabolites produced by the isolates found aiming future applications in the medical and pharmaceutical fields.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have drawn popular concerns recently as an emerging class of aquatic contaminants. In this study, adsorption and degradation of four selected PPCPs, metronidazole, tinidazole, caffeine and chloramphenicol, have been investigated in the laboratory using two agricultural soils in China and sediment from Changjiang River. Adsorption tests using a batch equilibrium method demonstrated that adsorption of all tested chemicals in soils could be well described with Freundlich equation, and their adsorption affinity on soil followed the order of chloramphenicol > caffeine > tinidazole > metronidazole. Generally, higher K-f value was associated with soils which had higher organic matter contents (except for caffeine acid in this study). Degradation of selected PPCPs in soils generally followed first-order exponential decay kinetics, and half-lives ranging from 0.97 to 10.21 d. Sterilization generally decreased the degradation rates, indicating that microbial activity played a significant role in the degradation in soils. The degradation rate constant decreased with increasing initial chemical concentrations in soil, implying that the microbial activity was inhibited with high chemical loading levels.

AB This study compared the performances of two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors to remove 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol. Both SBRs were operated to achieve organic carbon oxidation and nitrification. However, the overall bacterial population in both SBRs was targeted to be different by feeding the SBRs with peptone and glucose. Furthermore, the reactors were also run at different solid retention times (SRTs) to evaluate the effect of SRI on estrogen removal. The more diverse heterotrophic and ammonia oxidizing bacterial community in the peptone fed SBR1 had superior estrogen removal than the glucose fed SBR 2 which enriched less diverse community, particularly for 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol. Under a solids retention time (SRT) of 40 days, the total 17 beta-estradiol mass was 30% of the amount under the SRT of 20 days, and the total 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol mass was likewise 40% of the amount under the shorter SRT.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotic is used extensively and, is obtained to reasoninfluences neurologically on living microorganisms. In the present study, the photocatalyst/H(2)O(2)underUV light photo-degradation of Enrofloxacin was studied. In addition to that, ZnS on Cu(2)Tequantum dots was gathered via a simple synthesis method. The ZnS/Cu(2)Tenanocomposites were characterizedby dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopytothe evaluation of theoptical, and morphological properties.The Box-Behnken design method was used for Experiments optimizationusing response surface methodology (RSM). Several factors like ZnS/Cu(2)Teconcentration, H(2)O(2)concentration, and initial pH on the optimisation ofEnrofloxacinphoto-degradation were evaluatedwiththe polynomial regression method. At optimum process factors (ZnS/Cu2Te: 50 mg/L, H2O2: 100 mg/L, and pH: 6), the Enrofloxacinphoto-degradation was achieved 84.58% during 40 min as process time.The photo-degradationanalyzed for severaldecompositionprocesseslike as, H2O2, UV/H2O2, UV+ZnS/Cu2Te, and UV+ZnS/Cu2Te+H2O2 were carried out at the optimum factors. In this study,the Statistical evaluation was carried out for the optimisation of photo-degradation processes for the removalof pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The present study deals with removal of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C2NP) as a model contaminant from pharmaceutical and pesticide industries using titanium dioxide nanoparticles as an adsorbent. 4C2NP is recalcitrant and persistent toward biodegradation and its generation in aqueous environment during formulation, distribution and field application of pesticides is often unavoidable. Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of contact time, nano-titanium dioxide dosage, initial pH, initial 4C2NP concentration and temperature on adsorption efficiency. The results showed that the adsorption capacity was increased with increasing 4C2NP concentration and temperature. Optimum conditions for 4C2NP adsorption were found to be initial pH a parts per thousand 2, nano-titanium dioxide dosage a parts per thousand 0.01 g/250 mL and equilibrium time a parts per thousand 1 h. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles recorded a maximum capacity of 86.3 mg/g at optimal conditions. The linear correlation coefficients of Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were obtained. The results revealed that the Freundlich isotherm fitted the experimental data better than the other isotherm models.

AB The release of pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments is a serious concern due to the persistence and potential health and environmental risks of these substances. Surface and ground waters are polluted with a variety of pharmaceuticals due to insufficient water purification processes in wastewater treatment plants. Here, we report a simple procedure for the production of composite materials consisting of zero-valent iron embedded in few-layer graphene, Fe/graphene, through induction annealing at 900 degrees C. Zero-valent iron was observed as magnetic 1 mu m-sized crystals embedded in the graphene matrix appearing in the alpha- and gamma-forms. This Fe/graphene composite was applied as an adsorbent for the removal of tetracycline (a pharmaceutical) from water. The Fe/graphene showed high tetracycline removal efficiency (422 mg/g) under optimized conditions. Furthermore, the Fe/graphene possessed self-regenerating features prolonging its lifetime and total removal capacity up to 660 mg/g, thus making it a potential material for removing tetracycline from water.

AB In this study, the effect of aeration rate in terms of specific aeration demand per membrane area (SADm) on the anti-biofouling properties of cellulose acetate (CA) nanocomposite membranes (CA/ND-NH2) in a membrane bioreactor system was investigated. The amount of EPS and soluble EPS under high aeration rate conditions was observed to be higher than under low aeration rate conditions. The results obtained showed that either lower or higher aeration rates had a negative impact on membrane permeability. The high aeration rate resulted in a severe breakage of sludge flocs, and promoted the release of soluble EPS from the microbial flocs to the bioreactor tank. By increasing the aeration rate, the COD removal increased and decreased respectively for the membranes and the activated sludge. It was finally concluded that higher anti-biofouling properties of neat CA and nanocomposite membranes were obtained under optimal aeration rate conditions (SADm = 1 m(3) m(-2) h(-1)).

AB This paper investigates removal efficiencies of ozone and hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on pharmaceuticals (antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in water solution, which are commonly presented in outflow of wastewater treatment plant. It is proved that AOPs are able to satisfactory remove these substances from water and interrupt its entrance to aquatic environment. Balance between removal efficiencies and costs is the main issue of current research into removing xenobiotics from wastewaters. To investigate justification of using costlier processes for reaching higher effectivity, sets of trials were performed. Artificially contaminated drinking water matrix was treated by various combinations of AOPs (O-3, H2O2, UV, O-3/UV, H2O2/UV, O-3/H2O2) in flow through AOPs pilot unit. Evaluation of removal efficiencies for each AOPs combination was made. Study proves that AOPs are capable of pharmaceuticals removal, especially ozone-based processes which showed very high rate in removal of studied substances in comparison to hydrogen peroxide-based processes. However, coupling ozone with UV or hydrogen peroxide did not result in significant increase of pollutant removal and justification of higher costs is debatable.

AB In membrane processes, various agents are used to enhance, protect, and recover membrane performance. Applying these agents in membrane modification could potentially be considered as a simple method to improve membrane performance without additional process. Citric acid (CI) and sodium bisulfite (SB) are two chemicals that are widely used in membrane feed water pretreatment and cleaning processes. In this work, preadsorptions of CI and SB were developed as simple methods for polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane modification. It was found that hydrogen bonding and Van Der Waals attraction could be responsible for the adsorptions of CI and SB onto membranes, respectively. After modification with CI or SB, the membrane surfaces became more hydrophilic. Membrane permeability improved when modified by SB while decreased a little when modified by CI. The modified membranes had an increase in PEG and BSA rejections and better antifouling properties with higher flux recovery ratios during filtration of a complex pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, membrane chlorine tolerance was elevated after modification with either agent, as shown by the mechanical property measurements.

AB In this work, lanthanum vanadate (LaVO4) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized to develop stable nanocomposites of CNTs/LaVO4 with mass ratios of 0.1% and 0.3%. The nanocomposites were employed to investigate the photocatalytic degradation of a sulphonamide antibiotic namely sulfamethazine (SMZ) in both suspension and dip coating modes. The characterization by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectrometry revealed successful synthesis of the composites. Operating parameters (such as solution pH, catalyst dose and light intensity) were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. Radical scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radicals, holes and superoxide radicals contributed to the degradation of SMZ. In order to examine the treatment performance in the dip coating mode, CNTs/LaVO4 was immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane. The reusability of immobilized CNTs/LaVO4 was evaluated in five consecutive runs revealing high stability of the composite after long periods of photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, a possible degradation pathway was suggested based on a rigorous identification of the transformation products by mass spectrometry.

AB The increasing levels of diclofenac sodium (DS) detection in aquatic environments have been causing great concern, thus the efficient removal of DS is of urgent importance. In this study, for the first time a composite with MgAl/layered double hydroxide supported on Syagrus coronata biochar was fabricated, characterized and used for diclofenac sodium adsorption. The physicochemical characterizations, including X-ray, FT-IR, N-2 adsorption and microscopy, confirmed the composite was successfully synthesized. Adsorption batch experiments demonstrated a high DS removal efficiency (higher of 82% for 200 mg.L-1 of DS). Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicated the limiting adsorption mechanism was chemisorption providing maximumadsorption capacity of 138.83 and 168.04 mg.g(-1) at 30 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Thermo dynamics suggested DS adsorption was spontaneous, exothermic and created modification in the adsorbent structure. All these findings suggested that the composite is an efficient and promising material for DS-contaminated water treatment, achieving superior adsorption capacity compared with other adsorbents (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB An effective catalyst of MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 composite was synthesized by solvothermal method. The resultant MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 was used for advanced oxidation degradation of tetracycline (TC) for the first time. The results indicated that the MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 showed higher TC degradation efficiency than pure MIL-101(Fe) or TiO2 with the persulfate. Using 1 g L-1 MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 and persulfate at pH 7, 90.15% degradation rate was achieved under xenon lamp irradiation in 5 min for 20 mg L-1 TC. TiO2 introduced in the composite played an important role in the degradation process, in which TiO2 had a synergetic effect with Fe3+ to generate Fe2+, Ti3+ and radicals. Fe2+ reacted with persulfate to produce Fe3+ and a number of (OH)-O-center dot to degrade TC. This reaction process was so fast that MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 with persulfate could degrade TC fairly rapidly. A novel TiO2-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) composite was more efficient for degrading pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB This paper deals with an experimental and modelling study on the electrochemical oxidation of refractory pharmaceuticals using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Different parameters have been investigated, such as the role of salts (sulfates), the presence of other organics, and the influence of applied current intensity. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Salbutamol (SALBU) were used for models of pharmaceuticals, and urea as a model for a common organic. The complete removal of pharmaceuticals was observed in all electrolyses under galvanostatic conditions. The presence of common organic waste or other pharmaceutical has no significant impact on the degradation of the CIP target molecule. A mathematical model predicting the temporal concentration variation of organics with electroxidation time has been developed. In this model, different oxidation pathways have been considered: the transfer of electrons (direct oxidation) or of oxygen atoms via the reaction with either hydroxyl radicals or/and with strong electrogenerated oxidants. Excellent correlation with experiments is obtained under all experimental conditions.

AB Two different types of mesoporous adsorbents and one microporous adsorbent were used for the adsorption of chlorhexidine gluconate and Cetrimide. Chlorhexidine gluconate and Cetrimide are widely used in antiseptic solutions, mouthwashes, and germicidal hand rinses, etc. Scanning electron microscopy images, N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, Fourier transform infrared spectra and points of zero charge illustrate that significant changes occur on the activated carbon after functionalization with NH4OH when compared to the precursor granular activated carbon (GAC). The adsorption capacity of the novel alkali functionalized activated carbon (FAC-NH3) was found to be comparable with the highly expensive mesoporous aluminosilicate MCM-41 for both chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide. For a wide concentration range, adsorption with FAC-NH3 is approximately three times more in comparison to GAC for both compounds. Chlorhexidine gluconate forms surface complexes with the functional groups present in the super microporous FAC-NH3. This fact is also supported by kinetic studies, where pseudo first-order and second-order models, intra-particle diffusion, and Boyd's plots showed evidences to support chemisorption, on top of pure physical adsorption.

AB Out of 10 bacterial strains isolated out of wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry the most efficient bacterium, which could tolerate 5,000 mgl(-1) of phenol in the minimal medium, was identified to be Corynebacterium sp.DST1 through 16S rDNA analysis. This strain could remove 99.4% of phenol from the minimal medium containing 4,000 mgl-1 of phenol. The ortho catalytic pathway using the enzyme catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase was found to be the major pathway for phenol degradation in the bacterium. The gene for catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase (catA) could also be amplified using degenerate primers. Corynebacterium sp.DST1 cells were attached to sawdust and removal of phenol from industrial effluents was evaluated. About 92.7% of phenol could be removed from the effluent of a heavy electrical industry. The results of this study not only suggest the potentiality of the strain to remove phenol efficiently from crude industrial effluents but also display a cheap method of bioremediation using sawdust.

AB We applied zebrafish whole genome microarrays to identify molecular effects of diazepam, a neuropharmaceutical encountered in wastewater-contaminated environments, and to elucidate its neurotoxic mode of action. Behavioral studies were performed to analyze for correlations between altered gene expression with effects on the organism level. Male zebrafish and zebrafish eleuthero-embryos were exposed for 14 d or up to 3 d after hatching, respectively, to nominal levels of 273 ng/L and 273 mu g/L (determined water concentrations in the adult experiment 235 ng/L and 291 mu g/L). Among the 51 and 103 altered transcripts at both concentrations, respectively, the expression of genes involved in the circadian rhythm in adult zebrafish and eleuthero-embryos were of particular significance, as revealed both by microarrays and quantitative PCR. The swimming behavior of eleuthero-embryos was significantly altered at 273 mu g/L. The study leads to the conclusion that diazepam-induced alterations of genes involved in circadian rhythm are paralleled by effects in neurobehavior at high, but not at low diazepam concentrations that may occur in polluted environments.

AB A mixture of water, pyridine and acetonitrile is obtained as a by-product during the pharmaceutical industry. Azeotropic-extractive distillation (AED) and azeotropic-pressure swing distillation (APSD) are used to separate this mixture. In this work, we perform an optimization study of the total energy consumption of both processes by using a single factor analysis and response surface methodology (RSM). Compared to single factor optimization, the results showed that the energy saving optimized by RSM of AED and APSD was 37.27% and 27.36% respectively. The heat exchange network is optimized according to ASPEN ENERGY ANALYSIS. The results showed that the energy saving of AED and APSD after heat transfer optimization was 12.3% and 33%, respectively. By comparing the energy consumption of the two processes, it was found that the optimized AED process had an energy saving of about 1.05% compared with APSD. However, since there is no extractant entrainment in the APSD process, the APSD process is finally selected. ? 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently the pharmaceutical compounds also called as "emerging pollutants" are becoming a vital class of pollutants due to their non-biodegradable nature. They are introduced into the food chain through aquatic life and suffer biomagnification thereafter, as a result of which they are of important concern. The methods conventionally applied hitherto for the treatment of water fail when applied for removal of such bio-recalcitrant compounds. Herein comes the importance and relevance of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). So as to make sure that the fluid after treatment that is let flow into the stream is safe from the environment point of view, detailed study and chemical analysis of the water after treatmentis done. This paper presents a review of the type of water pollutants degradable and treatable efficiently by Non-thermal Plasma (NTP) and recent works where application of NTP is studied for removal of persistent organic and bio-recalcitrant pollutants. The analytical measures and parameters to compute the degradation efficiency of NTP tool based waste water treatment is also reviewed making a comparative study with the efficacy of the conventional methods of treatment.

AB The decolorization of Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) from aqueous solutions using the Fenton oxidation process was researched. The effects of different operating parameters, e.g., H2O2, Fe(II), initial dye concentration, pH, and solution temperature, on the decolorization of RB19 were investigated. Increasing, the H2O2 concentration and temperature increased the rate of the decolorization; however, increasing initial RB19 concentration reduced the decolorization. Additionally, modeling of the decolorization obtained by the Fenton oxidation process was researched based on deep neural networks (DNN) architecture providing the best performance in terms of optimum hidden layers and neuron numbers in addition to ideal activation and optimization function pairs. The performances of the models were analyzed on the training, validation, and test data. According to the experimental results, the seven hidden layers DNN model with "relu" activation function and "RMSProp" optimization function provided the best performance with root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.39 and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.99.

AB The presence of endocrine disrupting compounds in water receptor bodies, such as drugs, currently has in scientific field a great focus of studies focused on advanced water treatment techniques that enable the decontamination of water sources and public supply. In this context, this study focused on the characterization and evaluation of photocatalytic activity of catalysts calcined and uncalcined synthesized TiO2 and the commercial sol-gel route from caffeine degradation. The photocatalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), photoacoustic spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). They seek to evaluate the main textural, structural, chemical, and morphological differences that the method of synthesis can promote in obtaining a titanium oxide-based catalyst. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that the synthesis method significantly influences the activity of the materials and that calcined TiO2 catalyst prepared using the sol-gel method has promising photocatalytic capabilities for the elimination of drugs such as caffeine when present in wastewater.

AB Anchovies are filter-feeding fish that inhabit nearshore environments worldwide. With increasing human pharmaceutical use, drugs that alter neurological functioning are becoming more prevalent in aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluent, creating the need for tests that can reliably determine sublethal effects of these drugs on coastal fish populations. In this study, we used Caribbean anchovies (Anchoa spp.) as a tropical marine fish model to test drug-induced alterations of locomotion and shoaling behaviour with a video-based analysis system. Consistent with its anxiolytic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio), ethanol decreased shoal cohesion in anchovies. We also characterized the effects of drugs known to modulate the dopaminergic system in zebrafish and rodents. A D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) and a D1 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390) increased the time anchovy spent in the center of the arena, but neither drug had an impact on shoal cohesion. Finally, the D1 receptor agonist caused significantly lower meandering compared with fish treated with the D1 receptor antagonist and ethanol. This study suggests that anchovy is a suitable Caribbean marine model for toxicology studies.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the marine environment is of great concern. This study was done to determine the emergence of eight pharmaceuticals and eleven ultraviolet filters (UV-Filters) in 5 rivers/streams discharging into the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, a focus was put on the influence of wastewater treatment plant as indirect source and the occurrence of the PPCPs in close beach proximity. Two pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, salicylic acid) and two UV-filters (2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, octocrylene) were detected in all analyzed water samples, with concentration ranging from 0.6ng/L to 836.3 ng/L. In all rivers the PPCP concentration decreases towards the Baltic Sea. Sulfamethoxazole was detected at comparable concentration along the coast, which leads to the assumption of stable concentration in beach proximity. Along the coast UV-filters appeared in varying concentrations, leading to the conclusion that the direct input into the marine environment plays a bigger role than the indirect input.

AB Urine, which is an important waste biomass resource, is the main source of nitrogen in sewage and contains large quantities of emerging contaminants (ECs). In this study, we propose a new method to efficiently remove urine, simultaneously eliminate ECs, and control the generation of toxic chlorate during urine treatment using a photoelectrocatalytic-chlorine (PEC-Cl) system. A type-II heterojunction of WO3/BiVO4 was used as a photoanode to generate chlorine radicals (Cl center dot) by decreasing the oxidation potential of WO3 valence band for the highly selective conversion of urine to N-2 and the simultaneous degradation of ECs in an efficient manner. The method presented surprising results. It was observed that the amount of toxic chlorate was significantly inhibited by circumventing the over-oxidation of Clby holes or hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Moreover, the removal of urea nitrogen reached 97% within 90 min, while the degradation rate of trimethoprim in urine was above 98.6% within 60 min, which was eight times more than that in the PEC system (12.1%). Compared to the bare WO3 photoanode, the toxic chlorate and nitrate generated by the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode decreased by 61% and 44%, respectively. Thus, this study provides a safe, efficient, and environmentally-friendly approach for the disposal of urine. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of antimicrobial agent triclosan (TCS) in the global aquatic and terrestrial environment is an emerging concern. While risk assessment for TCS is available in certain countries, no studies have attempted to assess the risk of TCS worldwide. This could be due to lack of method to characterize the global exposure. The present study therefore proposed a probabilistic-based approach to approximate the percent-ranked measured environmental concentrations (MECs) by estimating exposure concentration distribution (ECD) for different environmental compartments on a global scale, incorporating approximate 1200 single MECs. Hazard of TCS was assessed from species sensitivity distribution as well as predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from ecotoxicological and toxicological endpoints. We draw on experiences from previous risk assessment exercises and present a holistic approach for characterizing the risk of TCS to microorganism in sewage treatment plant, aquatic and soil organisms, avian and mammalian species, and humans. Using the approach, we estimated risk of TCS to organisms dwelling in sediment and living in surface waters, and the risk quotients (MEC/PNEC) were within the range of 0.95-33.3 and 0.49-9.5, respectively. While the risk quotients for other environmental compartments were below a value of 1, there are large uncertainties likely due to an insufficient dataset of exposure and hazard of TCS.

AB The distributions of 31 pharmaceuticals grouped into nine therapeutic classes, including six anticancer drugs, were investigated in the waters and sediments of an urban river in Japan. The coefficients of sorption (logK(d)) to the river sediments were also determined from the results of a field survey and laboratory-scale experiment. Three anticancer drugs-bicalutamide, doxifluridine, and tamoxifen-were detected in the river sediments at maximum concentrations of 391, 392, and 250 ng/kg, respectively. In addition, the transformation products of psychotropic carbamazepine (2-hydroxy carbamazepine, acridine, and acridone) were detected in the range of 108 ng/kg (2-hydroxy carbamazepine) to 2365 ng/kg (acridine), and the phytoestrogen glycitein was detected in the range of N. D. to 821 ng/kg. The logK(d) values of the targeted pharmaceuticals in river sediments in the field survey ranged from 0.5 (theophylline) to 3.3 (azithromycin). These results were in accord with those of the laboratory-scale sorption experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of the anticancer drugs bicalutamide and tamoxifen, the transformation products of carbamazepine (2-hydroxy carbamazepine, acridine, and acridone), and the phytoestrogen genistein in river sediments.

AB This work presents for the first time the development of a method for the analysis of cinnamaldehyde and diallyl disulfide in soil by ultrasound assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The optimized method was applied in a laboratory-scale study of mobility of these substances applied within a bio-pesticide embodiment on three different soil textures, fine sand, sandy loam, and silty clay loam.
   Two initial soil moistures were approached, 20 and 90 % field capacity, in order to cover different climatic site scenarios (dry-wet locations). After the application, which was carried out as a pulse on the top soil surface, three different sprinkler irrigation regimes (1x, 2x, and 3x field capacity water volume) were simulated. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate.
   The results have shown that irrigation pushes the compounds down, and their mobility is soil texture dependent, with the sandy loam having the least resistance to leachability. In any case, cinnamaldehyde is shown to be more prone to leach down than diallyl disulfide. Mass balances in each scenario were also discussed.
   When these bio-pesticides are used for agricultural purposes, the irrigation regime should be adjusted so that the pesticides reach the target location without causing unnecessary environmental contamination.

AB The frequent detection of antibiotics in water bodies gives rise to concerns about their removal technology. In this study, the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of norfloxacin (NOR), a typical fluoroquinolone pharmaceutical, by the UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) was investigated. NOR could be degraded effectively using this process, and the degradation rate increased with the increasing dosage of PDS but decreased with the increasing concentration of NOR. In real water, the degradation of NOR was slower than that in ultrapure water, which indicated that laboratory results cannot be directly used to predict the natural fate of antibiotics. Further experiments suggested that the degradation of NOR was the most fast under neutral condition, the existence of HA or FA inhibited the degradation of NOR, and the presence of inorganic ions (NO3-, Cl-, CO32- and HCO3-) had no significant effect on degradation of NOR. Total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate (40%) indicated NOR was not completely mineralized, and six transformation products were identified, and possible degradation pathways of NOR had been proposed. It can be prospected that UV/PDS technology could be used for advanced treatment of wastewater containing fluoroquinolones.

AB Residual diclofenac sodium (DS) in the environment is harmful to human health. A promising method for DS removal is the use of adsorbents functionalized with amino groups that can form an ionic bond with the carboxyl group of DS at a suitable pH. In this work, a novel composite adsorbent composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and chitosan (CS) has been synthesized and functionalized by ethylenediamine (ED) in both layers. Characterization methods, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were used to confirm the morphology and synthetic mechanism of the double- amino-functionalized adsorbent. Based on the optimization of adsorption conditions and modeling of the adsorption mechanism, the DS adsorption process on CNC-ED@CS-ED involves chemical adsorption, and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model is 444.44 mg/g. CNC-ED@CS-ED exhibits good adsorption capacity and high sustainability; thus, it is a promising composite material for the removal of DS from wastewater.

AB The development of practicable and retrievable adsorbents with high adsorption capacity is a technical imperative for water treatment. Herein, we reported a new convenient macroscopic granular adsorbent for the removal of tetracycline (TC) from water by immobilizing porous carbons (PCs) which were obtained via one-step in situ pyrolysis from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt dihydrate (EDTA-2K center dot 2H(2)O) into carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMCS) gel beads utilising molecular cross-linking. A remarkable similarity can be observed between multivariant gel beads and EDTA-2K center dot 2H(2)O derived porous carbons (EPCs) according to the characterization results. The adsorption performance was evaluated using batch adsorption studies of TC in aqueous solution: the kinetic results could be fit well by a pseudo-second-order model and intraparticle diffusion was treated as the rate-controlling step; equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 136.9 mg g(-1) at 298 K. Importantly, these results indicate that the as-prepared gel beads could be used as facile adsorbents in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Simultaneous nitrification/denitrification and trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal during waste-water treatment by an integrated anoxic-aerobic MBR was examined. A set of 30 compounds was selected to represent TrOCs that occur ubiquitously in domestic wastewater. The system achieved over 95% total organic carbon (TOC) and over 80% total nitrogen (TN) removal. In addition, 21 of the 30 TrOCs investigated here were removed by over 90%. Low oxidation reduction potential (i.e., anoxic/anaerobic) regimes were conducive to moderate to high (50% to 90%) removal of nine TrOCs. These included four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (primidone, metronidazole, triclosan, and amitriptyline), one steroid hormone (17 beta-estradiol-17-acetate), one industrial chemical (4-tert-octylphenol) and all three selected UV filters (benzophenone, oxybenzone, and octocrylene). Internal recirculation between the anoxic and aerobic bioreactors was essential for anoxic removal of remaining TrOCs. A major role of the aerobic MBR for TOC, TN, and TrOC removal was observed.

AB This paper presents a study of the combined process of adsorption and biodegradation in solid biologically activated carbon (AC) for the removal of salicylic acid aimed at determining the influence of the presence of biofilm on the process. Adsorption on AC and biodegradation of free cell cultures were studied separately so as to compare their performance with that of the combined biosorption system. The formation of bacterial biofilm on the surface of the carbon was investigated. The study was carried out using a range of synthetic solutions containing between 15 and 500 mg/L salicylic acid simulating an industrial effluent from the pharmaceutical industry. An individual bacterium, Pseudomonas putida (DSM 4478), was used to study the differentiated effects. Filtrasorb 400 and GAC 830 ACs were used in the adsorption processes and Filtrasorb 400 in the biofilm formation and combined biosorption processes. As regards, combined adsorption/biodegradation results indicated that the bioactivated carbon system outperformed the combination of conventional AC and biological water treatment processes when working with high pollutant concentrations.

AB A novel composite catalytic membrane is developed by blending silicon oxide coated ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4@SiO2) nanoparticles in polyether sulfone (PES) membrane as Fenton-like catalysts via liquid-induced phase separation (LIPS) method. By introducing Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles in PES membrane matrix, the surface hydrophilicity, porosity and mean pore diameter of as-prepared composite catalytic membranes are improved due to the hydrophilic nature of the SiO2 coating layer on the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles. The as-fabricated catalytic membrane can filter large particles above similar to 100 nm and shows a high water flux of 2084 kg m(-2) h(-1) under 0.1 MPa. Importantly, the composite catalytic membrane shows efficient catalytic performance and satisfactory stability in the degradation of organic pollutants based on the Fenton-like reaction mechanism. The proposed strategy for membrane fabrication and the experimental results in this study provide valuable guidance for developing high-flux catalytic membranes with efficient catalytic performances for treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater.

AB A facile, environmental-friendly Ag3PO4-PN photocatalyst was synthesized by a simple precipitation method at room temperature in the presence of ammonia and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). As-synthesized samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS). The enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency of Ag3PO4-PN is strongly dependent on the excellent photo-absorption capacity, sharp edges and corners, and synergistic effect of PVP and NH3 center dot H2O. The effects of catalyst dosage, TC concentration and solution pH were explored with tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) as target contamination. The mineralization was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and determination of the concentration of inorganic ions such as NO3 (-) and Cl-. Radical detection experiment indicated the h(+) and center dot O2- are major active species in the degradation of TC by Ag3PO4-PN. Moreover, photocatalyst stability and regeneration experiments exhibited the favorable stability and rejuvenation ability, suggesting a promising prospect of practical application of Ag3PO4 in the wastewater treatment.

AB A progressive freeze concentration process, unidirectional downward freezing (UDF), was investigated for removal of five commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, acetylsalicylic acid, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole) in water. The feed water with the pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) at concentrations from ng/L to mg/L range was frozen at -7 and -15 degrees C. The separation efficiency of PhACs in the single stage and two-stage UDF was examined. By freezing only 80% (volume) of the feed water and without washing of the ice, about 84-92% reduction of the drug content in ice was achieved in the single stage UDF and about 99% reduction in the two-stage UDF. The partitioning behavior of the PhACs in the ice and liquid phases seems different from the solutes in glucose solutions or liquid foods reported in the literature. A strong linear relationship between the PhACs concentration and their TOC concentration was established, suggesting that TOC, a parameter commonly used to measure WWTP effluent quality might be used to monitor the level of PhACs in WWTP effluent.

AB Fouling of sodium alginate, calcium and alum coagulant in dead-end nanofiltration membranes was systematically investigated in this study. Alginate was used as a model component of polysaccharide, one of the most ubiquitous components of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the secondary wastewater effluent. Fouling mechanism and specific cake resistances were determined using the membrane fouling index (MFI) equation, and the compressibility of cake layer in each system was analyzed. We have found that calcium improved permeate flux and reduced the resistances, in contrary to previous researches. The dominant fouling mechanism in the presence of alginate and/or calcium was cake formation without compression, whereas when alum was present there might exist more than one fouling mechanisms. It is further observed that calcium and alum had synergistic effects in lowering the resistances and changing the characteristics of the cake into more compressible. Based on our findings, a schematic model of fouling mechanisms in these systems was proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR's) offer many advantages and few disadvantages to the wastewater treatment process selection. Due to the relatively recent surge of interest in SBR's, few plants have been on-line long enough for Engineers to have developed a thorough understanding of all design aspects and considerations. The author has been involved directly in the design, equipment supply, start-up and operation of almost 60 SBR's of all sizes. About two thirds of the installations are municipal and one-third of these installations are industrial sites involving wastes from food processors, dairies, distilleries, petro-chemical manufacturers, landfill leachate, tanneries, Government munition plants and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The control of filamentous bulking has also been excellent with SBR's.
   This paper will consider the mechanical, process and control aspects for design of an SBR. The mechanical aspects will include HRT and basin sizing, selection of aeration equipment and effluent decanters. The process parameters discussed will include loading rates and F:M considerations, MLSS concentration, oxygen requirements and D.O. uptake rate, flow proportional aeration, the benefits of an anoxic fill cycle, and finally, nutrient removal. Control considerations are briefly discussed.

AB The ubiquity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) in surface waters urges insights into their fate in the aqueous euphotic zone. In this study, eight FQs (ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, levofloxacin, sarafloxacin, difloxacin, enrofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and balofloxacin) were exposed to simulated sunlight, and their photodegradation was observed to follow apparent first-order kinetics. Based on the determined photolytic quantum yields, solar photodegradation half-lives for the FQs in pure water and at 45 degrees N latitude were calculated to range from 1.25 min for enrofloxacin to 58.0 min for balofloxacin, suggesting that FQs would intrinsically photodegrade fast in sunlit surface waters. However, we found freshwater and seawater constituents inhibited their photodegradation. The inhibition was further explored by a central composite design using sarafloxacin and gatifloxacin as representatives. Humic acids (HA), Fe(III), NO3-, and HA-Cl- interaction inhibited the photodegradation, as they mainly acted as radiation filters and/or scavengers for reactive oxygen species. The photodegradation product identification and ROS scavenging experiments indicated that the FQs underwent both direct photolysis and self-sensitized photo-oxidation via center dot OH and O-1(2). Piperazinyl N-4-dealkylation was primary for N-4-alkylated FQs, whereas decarboxylation and defluorination were comparatively important for the other FQs. These results are of importance toward the goal of assessing the persistence of FQs in surface waters.

AB In this work, carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation over defective Fe3O4@SiO2/d-TiO2/Pt photocatalyst was studied. Within the titania structure, Ti vacancies and Pt nanoparticles were introduced to enhance the photocatalyst's light absorption and influence charge carriers' mobility. For the carbamazepine degradation, process parameters, e.g., temperature, flux intensity, photocatalyst loading, aeration, pH, and addition of H2O2, were optimized for 4 or 5 different levels, with the quadratic model including 2-factor interactions determined to analyze the effect of these parameters. Carbamazepine presence and by-product formation were monitored using the HPLC-DAD system together with additional HPLC-TOFMS analysis for further identification of created compounds. Acridine was selected as an additional factor, indicating differences in the performed process of photolysis and photocatalytic CBZ degradation. Pure TiO2 exhibited the highest efficiency of CBZ degradation under alkaline conditions, while the performed optimization shows that a combination of H+ and H2O2 addition is crucial to achieve high CBZ removal and its mineralization in the presence of Fe3O4@SiO2/d-TiO2/Pt photocatalyst. The obtained results were discussed concerning photocatalyst structure, generation of reactive oxygen species inside H+/H2O2/photocatalyst system, and the possible effect of introduced Ti vacancies. In terms of reusability, the performance of Fe3O4@SiO2/d-TiO2/Pt photocatalyst was stable after 8 subsequent cycles of carbamazepine degradation.

AB Rare-earth elements have gained significant attention as they are currently widely used in high tech, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Here we used the fiddler crabs Leptuca leptodactyla as bioindicators to verify the presence of rare-earth elements in two mangrove areas of the Ubatuba, northern littoral of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The specimens were collected in the mangrove areas of the Tavares River and Quiririm-Puruba river system, separated by season (dry and rainy). A total of 243 individuals were collected and analyzed. For determination and quantification of the elements we used the instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) technique. In both the dry and rainy season, the elements La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb and Sc were detected in samples of both mangroves, with La and Ce presenting higher concentrations. Samples from Tavares River mangrove had higher concentration levels of rare-earth elements than those of the Quiririm-Puruba river system. That is probably due to the central geographic position of the Tavares River in Ubatuba, which crosses a large portion of the city and receives a great amount of sewage. On the other hand, the Quiririm-Puruba river system has less anthropogenic inputs, thus, it receives much fewer rare-earth elements when compared to the Tavares River. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The concentrations of six sulfonamides (SAs) and three tetracyclines (TCs) were investigated in Jiulongjiang River during the low water season and the high water season. They were monitored in both surface water and sediment. Total concentrations of all these antibiotics varied from 31 to 25 771 ng g(-1) in sediment samples. In water they ranged from 60 to 2607 ng L-1 during the low water season and from ND (not detected) to 134 ng L-1 during the high water season. At the sites nearby breeding farms, chlorotetracycline was found to have the highest concentration of 1036 ng L-1 in water and 14 666 ng g(-1) in sediments. According to the published data, the concentrations of sulfamethazine, sulfameter and TCs at these sites were higher than that in most rivers. The concentrations during the low water season were tens to hundreds of times higher than that in the high water season. The lower concentrations of TCs in the high water season might result from both dilution and photo-degradation, while dilution and bio-degradation might lead to the lower concentrations of SAs. However, further study is needed to clarify the specific reasons. Concerning the relationship between sediment and water samples, the pseudo-partitioning values of TCs were much higher than SAs. It indicates that the TCs are prone to accumulate in the sediment.

AB Pharmaceuticals have special attention of researchers over the world due to their possible effect on the environment and humans. This paper focuses on the photolysis of nitrofurantoin in different water matrices. Nitrofurantoin photodegradation has been indicated as a pseudo-first order photoreaction. The indirect photodegradation rate of nitrofurantoin (river water, k(1) = 0.0088 min(-1) and synthetic wastewater, k(1) = 0.0154 min(-1)) was slower than its direct photolysis rate (ultrapure water, k(1) = 0.0176 min(-1)). The highest value of quantum yield of nitrofurantoin photodegradation (phi = 0.2047) was observed at pH = 4, while at higher pH-values it decreased. Furthermore, the mechanism of nitrofurantoin photodegradation is proposed. Heterocyclic ring opening and further hydrolysis, nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution and homolytic N-N bond cleavage are suggested as three main initial processes of nitrofurantoin photodegradation. Acute toxicity study of nitrofurantoin and its photoproducts with regard to luminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri showed that the toxic effect of nitrofurantoin (EC50 = 4.0 mg L-1) decreases by photolysis.

AB Adsorption is used extensively to deal with increasingly serious water pollution. In this paper, beta-cyclodextringraphene oxide aerogel microspheres (CD-GAM) with 3D porous structure was prepared by electrospraying combining with freeze-casting and sequently mild self-assembly. Owing to the integration of graphene oxide (GO) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), the CD-GAMs exhibit excellent broad-spectrum adsorption capabilities for dyes and organic micropollutants, including anionic dyes of methylene blue (439 mg/g) and Rhodamine B (388 mg/g), cationic dyes of acid red 87 (234 mg/g) and methyl orange (167 mg/g), organic micropollutants aromatic model compound of carcinogen 2,4-dichlorophenol (17 mg/g), pharmaceuticals of propranolol hydrochloride (49 mg/g), contraceptive ethynyl estradiol (19 mg/g) and plastic components bisphenol A (38 mg/g). The adsorption capacity of CD-GAM for most pollutants reach equilibrium within 10 min. In addition, the CD-GAM maintained stable regenerative adsorption capacity more than 80 % in five cycles. The broad-spectrum adsorbent CD-GAM is an ideal choice for removing complex and diverse pollutants from wastewater.

AB This baseline assessment reports on the occurrence, distribution, and sources of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in tropical coastal sediments of anthropogenically impacted Klang River estuary, Malaysia. Bisphenol A was the highest concentration detected at 16.84 ng g(-1) dry weight, followed by diclofenac (13.88 ng g(-1) dry weight) and El (12.47 ng g(-1) dry weight). Five compounds, namely, amoxicillin, progesterone, diazinon, bisphenol A, and El, were found in all sampling stations assessed, and other compounds such as primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, E2, and EE2 were ubiquitously present in sediment samples, with percentage of detection range from 89.04% to 98.38%. Organic carbon content and pH were the important factors controlling the fate of targeted compounds in the tropical estuarine sediment. On the basis of the literature from other studies, the sources of EOCs are thought to be from wastewater treatment plants, domestic/medical waste discharge, livestock activities, industrial waste discharge, and agricultural activities.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) are useful in monitoring for a wide range of chemicals in aquatic systems; however, a lack of available uptake rate data for compounds of environmental interest is one limitation in the application of these samplers to environmental studies. In this study, laboratory calibration experiments were conducted with POCIS for 65 compounds at 25 degrees C under flowing conditions to determine chemical-specific uptake rates (R-s). Experimental uptake rates measured in this study ranged from 0.034 to 1.33 L/d, and uptake rates were determined for 36 compounds with no previously reported values. Experimentally determined uptake rates were applied to data obtained from POCIS samplers deployed downstream of three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharges and in four surface waters influenced by agricultural runoff. Time-weighted average concentrations for atrazine and metolachlor determined using uptake rates generated in this study compare well with results from composited grab sampling previously conducted in agricultural watersheds in Nebraska, USA.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites constitute a class of xenobiotics commonly found in aquatic environments which may cause toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Several different lipophilic molecules, including some pharmaceuticals, can bind to fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), a group of evolutionarily related cytoplasmic proteins that belong to the intracellular lipid-binding protein (iLBP) family. An oyster FABP genome-wide investigation was not available until a recent study on gene organization, protein structure, and phylogeny of Crassostrea gigas iLBPs. Higher transcript levels of the C. gigas FABP2 gene were found after exposure to sewage and pharmaceuticals. Because of its relevance as a potential biomarker of aquatic contamination, in this study, recombinant FABP2 from C. gigas (CgFABP2) was successfully cloned, expressed, and purified, and in vitro and in silico assays were performed using lipids and pharmaceuticals. This is the first characterization of a protein from the iLBP family in C. gigas. Homology modeling and molecular docking were used to evaluate the binding affinities of natural ligands (palmitic, oleic, and arachidonic acids) and pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, sodium diclofenac, and acetaminophen). Among the tested fatty acids, CgFABP2 showed preference for palmitic acid. The selected pharmaceuticals presented a biphasic-binding mode, suggesting a different binding affinity with a preference for diclofenac. Therefore, the approach using circular dichroism and in silico data might be useful for ligand-binding screening in an invertebrate model organism.

AB Prophylactic usage and high persistent nature of several antibiotics have put selective pressure on the native microbial population that led to the emergence, propagation, and persistence of antibiotic resistance in nature. The surveillance of antibiotic resistome pattern and identification of points of intervention throughout the different environmental habitats will help to break the flow of antibiotic resistance from environmental bacteria to human pathogens. The present study compares the occurrence, diversity, and abundance of ARGs in industrial sludge, wetland sludge, and sediment sample contaminated with pharmaceutical discharge. Metagenomes were mined for the presence of ARGs against the ResFinder 3.2 database using BLASTn program. Pharmaceutical sample (2.52%) showed high degree of ARG abundance and richness as compared with ETP sludge (2.28%) and wetland sludge samples (1.29%). The modern resistome pattern represented by critically important resistance genes against tetracycline (tetA, tetC, tetW, tetT, and tetS/M) and quinolone (qnrS, qnrVC, and qnrD) was identified in pharmaceutical sediment sample. However, effluent treatment plant (ETP) sludge sample showed abundance of multidrug efflux pumps indicating the presence of primitive resistome profile. In conclusion, the indiscriminate distribution pattern of antibiotic resistance genes in three selected environmental sites suggests enrichment and distribution of environmental niche-driven resistance. The study also suggests effluent discharge site from pharmaceutical industries and ETPs as pivotal points of intervention for the mitigation of antibiotic resistance.

AB The removal of five selected pharmaceutical compounds was investigated in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating synthetic sewage. Trimethoprim (Tmp) and sulfamethoxazole (Smx) were consistently removed at efficiencies of 94.2 +/- 5.5%, and 67.8 +/- 13.9%, respectively, while in contrast, only marginal removals of carbamazepine (Cbz) (0.3 +/- 19.0%) and diclofenac (Dcf) (15.0 +/- 7.2%) were achieved. Finally, three distinct stages of triclosan (Tcs) removal were observed: 82.3 +/- 15.0% within the first 10 days; 54.4 +/- 10.4% in the following 30 days; and 31.4 +/- 12.6% in the last 30 days. Adsorption to the sludge was the major contributing factor for its initial high removal. When powdered activated carbon (PAC) was added to the AnMBR, the removal of all five pharmaceuticals improved, especially for Smx and Tcs, which showed removal efficiencies of 95.5 +/- 4.6% and 93.2 +/- 6.6%, respectively. Higher removals of Cbz (92.4 +/- 53%) and Dcf (82.6 +/- 11.1%) were also observed, but only within the initial 5 days of PAC addition, and enhancement in their biotransformation by PAC adsorption was determined to be the major contributing factor for these improved removals.

AB We investigated the distributions of 12 antibiotics (viz., sulfonamides, macrolides, and trimethoprim) in the water from the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and compared them with those in the Tamagawa River, Japan. In Vietnam, only a few antibiotics (viz., sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, and erythromycin-H2O) were detected in the river and canals from urban and rural sites, at concentrations of 7-360 ng/L. This contrasts with the results from the Japanese urban river, where more antibiotics (sulfa methoxazole, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin) were detected at concentrations ranging from 4 to 448 ng/L. The concentrations of sulfonamides in the Mekong Delta were comparable to those in the Tamagawa River, whereas macrolide concentrations were lower than those in the Tamagawa River. The ubiquitous occurrence of sulfamethazine, used as a veterinary medicine, in the waters in Vietnam at relatively high concentrations (15-328 ng/L) was unique. Extremely high concentrations of sulfamethazine [(18.5-19.2) x 10(3) ng/L] were detected in pig farm wastewaters, and relatively high concentrations were observed in canals near chicken and pig farms. All these data suggested the potential utility of sulfamethazine as a molecular marker of livestock-source contamination. The present study demonstrated widespread inputs of veterinary medicines to waters in Vietnam.

AB The effects of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) were studied in three freshwater invertebrate species representing different taxonomic groups, life histories, and habitats in aquatic ecosystems. The oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was exposed by way of CBZ-spiked sediments at nominal concentrations between 0.625 and 10 mg/kg dry weight (dw) for 28 days. At the end of the test, reproduction and biomass were monitored as end points. The nonbiting midge Chironomus riparius was exposed to CBZ in a series of tests at nominal CBZ concentrations in sediment ranging from 0.16 to 100 mg/kg dw at 20 degrees C and 23 degrees C. Emergence and gender ratio were monitored at the end of the test. The freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum as the third test species was used in a chronic reproduction test for 28 days at aqueous CBZ concentrations from 0.4 to 250 mg/L. Whereas for the oligochaete and the snail no effects were observed, C. riparius exhibited a significant and concentration-dependent decrease of emergence in all test series. No observed effect concentrations and 10% effect concentrations were in the range of 33 to 140 and 70 to 210 mu g/kg dw, respectively, based on measured CBZ concentrations in sediments. These low values indicate that CBZ may pose a potential threat for the survival of C. riparius and probably also for other aquatic insect populations in the field.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their active metabolites are one of the significantly emerging environmental toxicants. The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient. The most important and distinct features of pharmaceuticals are that they are deliberately designed to have an explicit mode of action and designed to exert an effect on humans and other living systems. This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Brief ideas about toxicity endpoints, available ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems employed for rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are also discussed.

AB Pharmaceuticals have recently been regarded as contaminants of emerging concern. To date, there is limited knowledge about antibiotic-degrading microorganisms in conventional activated sludge treatment systems and their characteristics toward antibiotic degradation especially in the presence of a pharmaceutical mixture. As such, antibiotic-degrading microorganisms were investigated and isolated from the activated sludge, and their degradation capabilities were evaluated. Two strains of cefalexin-degrading bacteria CE21 and CE22 were isolated and identified as Pseudomonas sp. in the collected activated sludge. Strain CE22 was able to degrade over 90% of cefalexin, while CE21 was able to remove 46.7% of cefalexin after incubation for 24h. The removal efficiency of cefalexin by CE22, different from that of CE21, was not significantly affected by an increase in cefalexin concentration, even up to 10 ppm, however the presence of 1 ppm of other pharmaceuticals had a significant effect on the degradation of cefalexin by CE22, but no significant effect on CE21. The degradation product of cefalexin by the two strains was identified to be 2-hydroxy-3-phenyl pyrazine. Our results also indicated that CE21 and CE22 were able to degrade caffeine, salicylic acid and chloramphenicol. Moreover, CE21 was found to be capable of eliminating sulfamethoxazole and naproxen.

AB Numerous antibiotics such as sulfonamides have been found in effluents from drug manufacturers. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange comprise some of the most promising techniques for the retention of these compounds from wastewaters due to their low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This article studies the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), the most common sulfonamide antibiotics detected in municipal sewage. Lewatit MP500 (Lanxess Chemical) ion exchange resin was used to remove SMX, SMZ present in solutions. Batch experiments were carried out in cylindrical stirred tanks. Binary system solutions of equal mass concentration were prepared containing 30-250 mg/L of each compound, SMX and SMZ, and tested with an L/S ratio (mL solution/g resin) = 1000 obtained in previous experiments. Also, the adsorption of SMX mixed with trimethoprim (TMP) in batch experiments was analyzed due to the fact that both compounds are usually administered together. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied in order to characterize the operation. The adsorption equilibrium constants for SMX and SMZ were determined using a modified extended Langmuir model for multicomponent equilibrium sorption. Kinetics was analyzed using the pore diffusion model. Finally, several loading and elution cycles were carried out in fixed bed to obtain the breakthrough curves, comparing the experimental data to predicted values from a fixed bed model.

AB A three-level Box-Behnken factorial design combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied as a tool to study the laccase-catalyzed removal of three estrogenic compounds: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and ethinylestradiol (EE2), in a continuous enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR). Three main factors affecting the treatment efficiency were considered: enzyme activity, hydraulic residence time (HRT) and oxygenation rate. As expected, laccase activity and HRT showed large effects and, interestingly, the relevance of oxygen in improving the oxidation kinetics through raising the dissolved oxygen above saturation levels was demonstrated. When considering elimination rates as the response, optimal conditions were: 1,000 U/L of laccase, 1 h HRT and 60 mgO(2)/(L.h) of oxygenation rate, predicting 2.82-3.24 mg eliminated/(L.h), (71-81% of oxidation). These optimum conditions were successfully validated, and 75% of estrogenicity reduction was achieved. On the other hand, only 100 U/L were found as optimal to maximize the efficacy of the enzyme: E1 was oxidized by 0.06 mg/(L.h.U), although the removal of estrogenicity decreased to 60%. The methodology was also applied to maximize the reduction of estrogenic activity: the highest values assayed [1,000 U/L, HRT 4 h and 60 mgO(2)/(L.h)] provided 99% detoxification.

AB We investigated the adsorption and decomposition of sulfamethazine (SMT), which is used as a synthetic antibacterial agent and discharged into environmental water, using high-silica Y-type zeolite (HSZ-385), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and TiO2-zeolite composites. By using ultrapure water and secondary effluent as solvents, we prepared SMT solutions (10 mu g/L and 10 mg/L) and used them for adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition experiments. When HSZ-385 was used as an adsorbent, rapid adsorption of SMT in the secondary effluent was confirmed, and the adsorption reached equilibrium within 10 min. The photocatalytic decomposition rate using TiO2 in the secondary effluent was lower than that in ultrapure water, and we clarified the inhibitory effect of ions and organic matter contained in the secondary effluent on the reaction. We synthesized TiO2-zeolite composites and applied them to the removal of SMT. During the treatment of 10 mu g/L SMT in the secondary effluent using the composites, 76 % and more than 99 % of the SMT were decomposed within 2 and 4 h by photocatalysis. The SMT was selectively adsorbed onto high-silica Y-type zeolite in the composites. Resultantly, the inhibitory effect of the coexisting materials was reduced, and the composites could remove SMT more effectively compared with TiO2 alone in the secondary effluent.

AB In the present study, the photoinduced degradation of the antidepressant drug sertraline under artificial solar radiation was examined. Photolysis was studied under different experimental conditions to explore its photolytic fate in the aqueous environment. Photolytic degradation kinetics were carried out in ultrapure water, wastewater effluent, as well as in the presence of dissolved organic matter (humic acids), bicarbonate and nitrate ions which enabled their assessment on sertraline photo-transformation. The reaction of sertraline with photoactive compounds accelerated sertraline transformation in comparison with direct photolysis. Moreover, TiO2-mediated photocatalytic degradation of sertraline was investigated, and focus was placed on the identification of by-products. As expected, photocatalysis was extremely effective for sertraline degradation. Photocatalytic degradation proceeded through the formation of forty-four transformation products identified by HPLC-HRMS and after 240 min of irradiation total mineralization was achieved. Microtox bioassay (Vibrio fischeri) was employed to assess the ecotoxicity of the photocatalysis-treated solutions and results have indicated that sertraline photo-transformation proceeds through the formation of toxic compounds.

AB Cleft lip and cleft palate also known as orofacial cleft is a congenital malformation involving the partial or total lack of anatomical continuity of craniofacial tissue. The most common environmental factors that may cause orofacial clefts include pharmaceuticals, alcohol, addictive drugs, and tobacco smoke. Living in the area of industrial factories, garbage, ironworks, crematoria, wastewater treatment plants, and plastic waste landfills also has a significant impact on the development of the craniofacial defects. Some of the main factors causing the formation of congenital craniofacial defects are dioxins, of which emission to the environment is an important environmental and health problem. Dioxins are a diverse group of organic chemical compounds, derivatives of oxanthrene and fumarates, which are organoleptically imperceptible. Acting mainly through induction of inflammation, they influence a number of metabolic processes, including the process of bone mineralization and embryonic development. In this work, we highlight the problem of orofacial cleft including the impact of dioxin on development of this defect and the recommended prevention.

AB Pharmaceutical pollutants are commonly detected in surface waters and have the potential to affect non-target organisms. However, there is limited understanding of how these emerging contaminants may affect macroinvertebrate communities. The pharmaceutical carbamazepine is ubiquitous in surface waters around the world and is a pollutant of particular concern due to its recalcitrance and toxicity. To better understand the potential effects of carbamazepine on natural macroinvertebrate communities, we related stream macroinvertebrate abundance to carbamazepine concentrations. Macroinvertebrate and water samples were collected from 19 streams in central Indiana in conjunction with other stream physiochemical characteristics. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to relate macroinvertebrate richness to carbamazepine concentrations. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively correlated with increasing concentrations of carbamazepine. From the SEM we infer that carbamazepine influences macroinvertebrate richness through indirect pathways linked to Baetidae abundance. Baetidae abundance influenced ephemeropteran abundance and FBOM percent organic matter, both of which altered macroinvertebrate richness. The pharmaceutical carbamazepine may alter freshwater macroinvertebrate species composition, which could have significant consequences to ecosystem processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tonalide (AHTN), a typical polycyclic musk and an emerging pollutant, was found to be enriched in waste activated sludge (WAS). However, the research of its effect on WAS anaerobic digestion was seldom available. This research therefore investigated the effect of AHTN on WAS anaerobic digestion and the underlying mechanism through batch experiments using either real WAS or synthetic wastewaters as the digestion substrates. The results indicated that when the concentration of AHTN increased from 0 to 1000 mg/kg TSS in WAS, the methane production increased linearly from 125.0 +/- 2.2 to 162.9 +/- 1.6 mL/g VSS, while the AHTN concentration further increased to 2000 mg/kg TSS, the methane production decreased to 146.2 +/- 2.1 mL/g VSS. At the same time AHTN can facilitate the utility of volatile fatty acid (VFAs), especially acetate and propionate. It was further found that the degradation efficiency of AHTN in anaerobic digestion was 42.7%. The mechanism investigation demonstrated that AHTN can promote the solubilization, homoacetogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes, leading to an increase in methane production. Further analysis revealed that methanogenic archaea mainly belonged to the genera of Methanosaeta and Metheanobacterium, and their relative abundance increased accordingly with the addition of AHTN.

AB Sertraline is a widely-used antidepressant that is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It has been detected in biosolids and effluents from sewage treatment plants. Since sertraline can reach agriculture land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water, the persistence and dissipation pathways of H-3-sertraline were determined in laboratory incubations using three agriculture soils varying in textures and properties. The total solvent extractable radioactivity decreased in all three soils with times to dissipate 50% of material (DT50) ranging from 48.1 +/- 3.5 (loam soil) to 84.5 +/- 13.8 (clay soil) days. Two hydroxylated sertraline transformation products were identified in all three soils by high performance liquid chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS), but the accumulation did not exceed 10% of the initial parent concentration. The addition of liquid municipal biosolids to the loam soil had no effect on the rate of sertraline dissipation, or production of transformation products. In summary, sertraline was persistent in agricultural soils with major dissipation pathways including the production of non-extractable soil-bound residues, and accumulation of hydroxylated transformation products. The biologically active sertraline transformation product norsertraline was not detected in soil. Crown Copyright (C), 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The electrochemical abatement of the drug ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid) from aqueous solution has been carried out by anodic oxidation. The electrolyses have been performed at constant current using a small, undivided cell equipped with a Pt or thin-film boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon felt cathode. The results have shown that ibuprofen has been destroyed under all the conditions tested, following pseudo-first-order kinetics; however, BDD enables higher removal rates than Pt, because the former produces greater quantity of (OH)-O-center dot. Using BDD anode, the pseudo first order rate constant increased with applied current and when NaCl replaced Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte, while it is almost unaffected by ibuprofen concentration. Mineralization of ibuprofen aqueous solutions was followed by total organic carbon (TOC) measurements.After 8 h of electrolysis, TOC removal varied from 91 % to 96 % applying a current in the range of 50-500 mA. The reaction by-products were quantified by chromatographic techniques, and in particular, aliphatic acids (oxalic, glyoxylic,formic, acetic,and pyruvic) have been the main intermediates formed during the electrolyses. The absolute rate constant for the oxidative degradation of ibuprofen have also been determined, by competition kinetic method, as 6.41 x 10 (9) M-1 s(-1).

AB Four drugs, erythromycin, fluoxetine, naproxen and gemfibrozil, belonging to different therapeutic classes, were chosen to examine their toxicity to selected plankton organisms from different trophic levels: algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Ankestrodesmus falcatus), protozoa (Paramecium caudatum), rotifera (Brachionus calyciflorus) and cladocera (Daphnia longispina). LC50 values for three of the drugs were between 12 and 82 mg l(-1), with algae and protozoans being most sensitive. Fluoxetine showed LC50 values between 40 and 830 mu g l(-1), algae again being most sensitive. The lower test concentrations of fluoxetine enhanced the growth rates of both B. calyciflorus and D. longispina. Even at low test concentrations, erythromycin decreased the growth rates of all the tested organisms. Paramecium caudatum was the species most sensitive to naproxen exposure. After 24 h, gemfibrozil had the least effect on all tested organisms. All the surviving tested organisms underwent oxidative stress to different degrees as a result of drug exposure. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase was reduced, and lipid peroxidation levels were elevated in all tested species after exposure, compared to their levels in the control group. Although the test concentrations were above those commonly found in the environment, the occurrence of sublethal effects at all test concentrations suggests that the potential risk for non- target organisms warrants further investigation.

AB A single run optimization chromatographic method for the determination of 15 emerging contaminants in surface water was optimized using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection through ultraviolet-diode array (UV-DAD) or fluorescence (FLD). Selected compounds included acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, progesterone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, levonorgestrel, diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, 4-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol and bisphenol A. Quality parameters of the proposed method showed a linearity r(2) > 0.996, coefficient of variation lower than 5%, recoveries between 80 to 120% for a spike of 10 mu g L-1 for each of the 15 compounds. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) was 38 ng L-1 for caffeine, whereas the highest value was 170 ng L-1 for ibuprofen. The method was applied to the spatial and seasonal monitoring of these compounds in the Atibaia River, which is the main drinking water source for Campinas City (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Among the 15 selected emerging contaminants, 10 were detected at least once. The lowest concentration determined was 0.096 mu g L-1 for diclofenac, whereas caffeine showed concentrations as high as 127 mu g L-1.

AB In order to improve the understanding of the fate and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the environment there is a need to investigate in-stream depletion mechanisms, e. g. phototransformation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in natural surface waters. In this study, abiotic and biotic degradation of selected beta-blockers was measured simultaneously in non-sterilised and sterilised river waters and deionised water (DIW) under simulated sunlight (lambda: 295-800 nm) and dark conditions, and at environmentally relevant concentrations, i.e. <= ppb levels. Results suggested that the overall degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics under the solar simulation conditions and was between two and ten times faster in river waters than in DIW. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.07) between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and overall first order degradation rate constants for the tested beta-blockers (n = 4-6), suggesting coloured DOC triplet-induced or reactive transient mediated oxidation mechanisms in river waters. Phototransformation was the main depletion mechanism for the beta-blockers tested over a 2 to 7 day period. Slow hydrolysis was observed for metoprolol only. Loss due to biodegradation in river waters was not observed for propranolol but was found for metoprolol and atenolol at a very slow rate within the study period. However, biodegradation of metoprolol was accelerated under the light conditions, implying that photo-induced intermediates could be more easily biodegraded in river waters.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used as antidepressant medications. primarily in the treatment of clinical depression. They are among the pharmaceuticals most often Prescribed in the industrialized countries. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are compounds with an identical mechanism of action in mammals (inhibit reuptake of serotonin), and they have been found in different aqeous as well as biological samples collected in the environment. In the present study, we tested the toxicities of five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) as single substances and of citalopram, fluoxetine. and sertraline in binary mixtures in two standardized bioassays. Test organisms were the freshwater algae Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. In algae, test median effect concentrations (EC50s) ranged from 0.027 to 1.6 mg/L, and in daphnids, test EC50s ranged from 0.92 to 20 mg/L, with sertraline being one of the most toxic compounds. The test design and statistical analysis of results from mixture tests were based on isobole analysis. It was demonstrated that the mixture toxicity of the SSRIs in the two bioassays is predictable by the model of concentration addition. Therefore, in risk assessment based on chemical analysis of environmental samples, it is important to include the effect of all SSRIs that are present at low concentrations. and the model of concentration addition may be used to predict the combined effect of the mixture of SSRIs.

AB We investigated the presence of 66 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals from seven therapeutic groups in surface waters of the Tejo estuary. Collection sites covered the entire estuary and included areas near main river inflows and wastewater treatment outfalls, traversing urban, agriculture, aquaculture, and nature reserve areas. Detection of pharmaceuticals was performed via UHPLC-TOF-MS. Pharmaceuticals were found in all sites (32 different compounds in total). Antibiotics, beta-blockers, antihypertensives and anti-inflammatories were the most frequently detected ( > 90%), with variation in concentrations reflecting the multifaceted nature of estuarine surroundings (accumulated site contamination between 15 and 351 ng L-1). Higher concentrations of antidepressant Sertraline (304 ng L-1), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Diclofenac (51.8 ng L-1), lipid regulator Gemfibrozil (77.0 ng L-1), antihypertensive Ibersartan (161.9 ng L-1) or antibiotic Doxycycline (128.0 ng L-1), among others, though localized may potentially impact key estuarine functions or services. Ultimately, results provide a baseline for regulatory information and future biota evaluations.

AB Photocatalytic (PC) methods based on advanced oxidation processes have shown great potential for removal of water pollutants. Oxide semiconductors stand out as the most promising materials for UV-mediated photodegradation of persistent pollutants in wastewater. Although an immense number of studies have appeared so far concerning the PC activity mostly of TiO2 but also of ZnO, the efficiency of these and other mixed oxides in degrading a wide range of organic pollutants has not yet been extensively explored. In this work we compare the efficiency of ZnO, TiO2 and the 2ZnO-TiO2 mixed crystal prepared by mechanochemical solid-state treatment, to decompose a pharmaceutical (Naproxene) and a dye (methylene blue) compound. The phase morphology, composition, specific surface area and crystalline structure of the nanopowders were characterized in detail. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO under UV irradiation was systematically higher than the other materials. The activity of the mixture was found to depend on the type of the analyte molecule, being, however, higher than that of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Aminophenols (AP) are synthetic intermediates in pharmaceutical, photographic and chemical dye industry. They can be released into the environment from wastewater and can react during water treatment processes. Therefore, it was interesting to study the oxidation of AP with chlorine and monochloramine in aqueous solution. In particular, the chlorination and monochloramination of 3-aminophenol (3AP) were investigated, and the formation of first by-products and kinetic rates were determined. The chlorination rate was 3.6 x 10(5) times greater than the monochloramination rate at pH 8.6. Two reaction pathways can explain the variation of the monochloramination apparent rate constant with pH. The first one was an electrophilic substitution of Cl+ on the aromatic ring of the non-ionized 3AP, leading to the formation of chloroaminophenol, with an individual rate constant of 6.7 x 10(2) M-1 h(-1). The second reaction pathway was a monochloramine attack on the amino group of 3AP catalyzed at acidic pH with an individual rate constant of 9.2 x 10(9) x M-2 x h(-1).

AB This study investigated the influences of solid retention time (SRT), nitrification, and microbial activity on the attenuation of pharmaceuticals and estrogens and the total estrogenic activity, using identical bench-scale membrane bioreactors. Phenacetine, acetaminophen, pentoxifylline, caffeine, bezafibrate, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone were effectively attenuated even at short SRT (8 d). However, the attenuation efficiencies of gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, clofibric acid, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were dependent upon SRTs (20 and 80 d). Some acidic pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, diclofenac, bezafibrate, and ketoprofen) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were partially degraded by nitrification. Relatively high removal efficiencies were observed for 17 beta-estradiol and estrone (natural estrogens) compared to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (synthetic estrogen) when nitrification was inhibited. Most of selected pharmaceuticals were not significantly attenuated under presumably abiotic conditions by adding sodium azide except phenacetine, acetaminophen, and caffeine. In this study, carbamazepine was found to be recalcitrant to biological wastewater treatment using membrane bioreactors regardless of the change of SRTs and microbial activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Membrane bioreactor technology is widely recognised as offering a key option for enhanced wastewater treatment or reuse. This brief review of the technology incorporates four key aspects: (a) market growth, (b) research areas, (c) product supply diversity and specifications, and (d) practitioner needs. Market growth and research topics were assessed through an examination of the appropriate literature and databases, specifically Scopus for the latter. Available MBR membrane products were identified from the Internet and other searches and the specifications verified through contact with the suppliers. Appropriate practitioners were identified through networking and verified as either being active in the operation and maintenance of full-scale MBRs or with an extensive experience of them within the industrial community. Results indicate that the footprint of modules normalised against membrane area changes significantly across the currently commercially-available product range, notwithstanding generically similar construction, such that opportunities for interchanging may be limited. The survey of research papers revealed the most comprehensively researched topic to be at odds with its practical constraints as identified by the practitioners. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A bacterial strain able to degrade dichloromethane (DCM) as the sole carbon source was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant receiving domestic and pharmaceutical effluent. 16S rDNA studies revealed the strain to be a Xanthobacter sp. (strain TM1). The new isolated strain when grown aerobically on DCM showed Luong type growth kinetics, with mu(max) of 0.094 h(-1) and S (m) of 1,435 mg l(-1). Strain TM1 was able to degrade other aromatic and aliphatic halogenated compounds, such as halobenzoates, 2-chloroethanol and dichloroethane. The gene for DCM dehalogenase, which is the key enzyme in DCM degradation, was amplified through PCR reactions. Strain TM1 contains type A DCM dehalogenase (dcmAa), while no product could be obtained for type B dehalogense (dcmAb). The sequence was compared against 12 dcmAa from other DCM degrading strains and 98% or 99% similarity was observed with all other previously isolated DCM dehalogenase genes. This is the first time a Xanthobacter sp. is reported to degrade DCM.

AB Direct capillary nanofiltration also in combination with an upstream powdered activated carbon treatment was tested for high quality water reuse of tertiary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Two endocrine disruptors (BPA and EE2) and two cytostatics (CytR and 5-FU) were spiked in concentrations of 1 to 2 mu g/L to evaluate the process performance. In direct NF the real total removal of the micropollutants was between 5 and 40%. Adsorption to the membrane played a major role leading to a seemingly total removal between 35 and 70%. Addition of powdered activated carbon and lignite coke dust largely reduced the influence from adsorption to the membrane and increased the total removal to >95 to 99.9% depending on the PAC type and dose. The cytostatics showed already in direct NF a very high removal due to unspecified losses. Further investigations are ongoing to understand the underlying mechanism. The PAC/NF process provided a consistently high permeate quality with respect to bulk and trace organics.

AB Background: The Mures River Basin is a long-term heavily polluted watershed, in a situation of climate changes with decreasing water flow and related decreasing dilution capacity. Here, a mixture of emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals were targeted to reveal potential risks regarding the natural lotic ecosystems. Due to the continuous discharge into the environment, pharmaceuticals are gaining persistent organic pollutant characteristics and are considered emerging pollutants. Based on the hazard quotient, this research highlights the dangerous concentrations of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, furosemide, and enalapril in river water. Results: High levels of four pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, furosemide, and enalapril) and some of their derived metabolites (enalaprilat, carboxyibuprofen, 1-hydroxyibuprofen, and 2-hydroxyibuprofen) were reported in our study in the Mures River Basin. Overall, pharmaceutical concentrations were found to be highest in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, median downstream of the WWTP, and lowest upstream of the WWTP, as was expected. For all pharmaceutical compounds tested, we recorded concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in at least one of the sites tested. Carbamazepine exhibited the highest mean values upstream, downstream, and at the WWTP. As expected, the highest concentrations for all the studied pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the WWTP effluent. All Hazard Quotient (HQ) values were below one (on a logarithmic scale in base 10), with the highest values in the WWTP and the lowest in the river upstream of the WWTP. The HQ intervals were in the same range for furosemide, carbamazepine, and ibuprofen at each of the three different sites: upstream WWTP effluent, and downstream. The interval for enalapril stands out as having the lowest HQ at all three sites. Conclusions: Based on these results, the large and complex hydrographical system Mures River Basin was transformed from a grey area, with little information about pharmaceutical contamination, to a hotspot in terms of contamination with emerging pollutants. Pharmaceutical compound concentrations were found to be the highest in WWTP effluents. The WWTP effluent concentrations were among the highest in Europe, indicating that treatment plants are the primary source of water pollution with pharmaceuticals compounds. The detected levels were higher than the safety limit for carbamazepine and ibuprofen. The determined HQ values imply that the measured levels do pose a threat to the environment for the studied pharmaceuticals. Based on the obtained results, human communities can assess, monitor, predict, and adapt in time to these already-present regional challenges and risks for sustainable use of natural resources, including water and associated products and services.

AB Four lab-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were built to treat simulated wastewater containing typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The efficiency in removing different PPCPs at different concentrations (1, 2 and 5 mg/L) and their effects on the performance of MBBRs were investigated. Results showed that the average removal efficiencies of sulfadiazine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine were 61.1 +/- 8.8%, 74.9 +/- 8.8% and 28.3 +/- 7.4%, respectively. Compared to the reactor without PPCPs, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of the reactors containing sulfadiazine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine declined by 21%, 30% and 42%, respectively. Based on the microbial community analysis, increasing the PPCPs concentration within a certain range (< 2 mg/L) could stimulate microbial growth and increase microbial diversity yet the diversity reduced when the concentration (5 mg/L) exceeded the tolerance of microorganisms. Furthermore the presence and degradation of different PPCPs resulted in a different kind of microbial community structure in the MBBRs.

This paper reports on the production of a TiO2 nano-layer on quartz wool in a relevant amount, its characterisation by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and its use as a photocatalyst under ultraviolet radiation for the simultaneous mineralisation of five emerging organic contaminants (benzophenone-3, benzophenone-4, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and triton X-100) dissolved in deionised water and tap water. This treatment was compared with direct ultraviolet photolysis and with photocatalytic degradation on commercial TiO2 micropearls. The disappearance of every pollutant was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and mineralisation was assessed by the determination of total organic carbon. After 4 hours of treatment with the TiO2 nano-coated quartz wool, the mineralisation exceeds 90% in deionised water and is about 70% in tap water. This catalyst was reused for seven cycles without significant efficiency loss.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in natural waters, which act as drinking water sources, raises concerns. Moreover, those compounds incompletely removed by treatment have the chance to form toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during subsequent disinfection. In this study, acetaminophen (Apap), commonly used to treat pain and fever, was selected as a model PPCP. The formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBPs, namely trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, and haloacetamides, during chlor(am)ination of Apap was investigated. Yields of chloroform (CF), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), dicholoacetamide (DCAcAm), and tricholoacetamide (TCAcAm), during chlorination were all higher than from chloramination. The yields of CF continuously increased over 48 h during both chlorination and chloramination. During chlorination, as the chlorine/Apap molar ratios increased from 1 to 20, CF yields increased from 0.33 +/- 0.02% to 2.52 +/- 0.15%, while the yields of DCAN, DCAcAm and TCAcAm all increased then decreased. In contrast, during chloramination, increased chloramine doses enhanced the formation of all DBPs.
   Acidic conditions favored nitrogenous DBP formation, regardless of chlorination or chioramination, whereas alkaline conditions enhanced CF formation. Two proposed formation mechanisms are presented. The analysed DBPs formed during chlorination were 2 orders of magnitude more genotoxic and cytotoxicity than those from chioramination.

AB The ozonation of caffeine in water was performed at different pH values, including acidic conditions. Kinetic experiments were conducted by adding pulses of a concentrated caffeine solution to ozone saturated water. The results showed a rapid decrease of ozone concentration during the first 15 s after injection, followed by a gradual decline at a much slower rate. The data were fitted to a second order kinetic model with rate constants increasing from 0.25 to 1.05 M(-1) s(-1) for pH in the 3-10 range. The initial ozone consumption per mol of ozonated caffeine was greater at high pH values, reflecting a higher ozone decomposition rate. The decomposition of ozone was positively affected by the concentration of caffeine, an effect that could be attributed to the presence of a reaction intermediate from the ozonation of caffeine that behaved as a strong promoter of ozone decomposition. A study of the transformation products identified by liquid chromatography in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was carried out, which permitted a tentative degradation pathway to be proposed and several persistent by-products to be identified at both pH 3 and 8. Most transformation products were the result of the opening of the imidazole ring after breaking caffeine's N9C8 double bond. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to uptake three pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, mefenamic acid and metronidazole) from two types of soil (clay and sandy soil) was investigated in this study to explore the human exposure to these pharmaceuticals via the consumption of beans. A pot experiment was conducted with beans plants which were grown in two types of soil for six weeks under controlled conditions. During the experiment period, the soil pore water was collected weekly and the concentrations of the test compounds in soil pore water as well as in plant organs (roots, stems and leaves) were weekly determined. The results showed that the studied pharmaceuticals were detected in all plant tissues; their concentrations in plant roots were higher than plant stems and leaves. The extent level and accumulation of the studied pharmaceuticals in sandy soil was higher than the clay soil. The concentration of diclofenac in plant tissues was higher than both of mefenamic acid and metronidazole, indicating that diclofenac is more available to plant. The content of dissolved pharmaceuticals in soil pore water decreased gradually over time during the experimental period confirming the ability of beans to uptake these pharmaceuticals from soil. The results suggest the possibility of studying pharmaceuticals to be accumulated in beans tissues despite their low concentrations in the studied soils.

AB In recent years, cardiovascular diseases were the second most common cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the consumption of drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases is high. So far, there were no such comprehensive reports regarding the presence of cardiovascular drugs in surface and tap waters, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of 30 pharmaceutically active compounds and some of their metabolites, at specific points of the Vistula River and in tap water samples in the Warsaw region. The analysis was performed using the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method, coupled to solid-phase extraction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where the presence of ciprofibrate in the environment was investigated. Cardiovascular drugs found at the highest concentrations (reaching 1 mu g/L or higher) in surface water were beta-blockers, sartans and diuretics. In tap water samples, trace amounts of pharmaceuticals were detected, for almost all target compounds. This highlights their inadequate elimination by the treatment facility used in the Warsaw region. The presence of cardiovascular compounds in the aquatic environment could have a long-term effect even at a low exposure level, since synergy effects amongst pharmaceuticals may occur.

AB Essentially ubiquitous in our environment, residues of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals somewhat paradoxically represent an emerging and increasing risk to wild biota. Whilst in recent years a great deal of analytical effort has been expended to quantify the presence of many pharmaceutical contaminants, especially in freshwater systems, our real understanding of the risks posed to most clades of wildlife, aquatic and terrestrial alike, still lags behind. In particular, relevant field-based studies regarding possible chronic impacts in higher terrestrial wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, etc.) remain all too scarce. Yet, for example, over the past two decades Old World Gyps vultures on the Indian subcontinent have been virtually extirpated due to non-target exposure to a single synthetic pharmaceutical compound, diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Here, we highlight and discuss the myriad possible exposure routes to terrestrial wildlife, consider the analytical and monitoring approaches that are already in use or that could be used in future research, and reflect upon a selection of legislative approaches currently being applied to identified terrestrial impacts. Finally, with the ultimate aim of encouraging further applied ecotoxicology-based research in this emerging field, we highlight several priorities for future inquiry, with special emphasis on non-target effects in previously overlooked but potentially vulnerable or highly representative clades of wildlife exposed within environmentally relevant, real-world scenarios.

AB Magnetic nano-scaled particles Fe3O4 were studied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to generate active radicals for degradation of acetaminophen (APAP) in water. The Fe3O4 MNPs were found to effectively catalyze PMS for removal of APAP, and the reactions well followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics pattern (R-2 > 0.95). Within 120 min, approximately 75% of 10 ppm APAP was accomplished by 0.2 mM PMS in the presence of 0.8 g/L Fe3O4 MNPs with little Fe3+ leaching (<4 mu g/L). Higher Fe3O4 MNP dose, lower initial APAP concentration, neutral pH, and higher reaction temperature favored the APAP degradation. The production of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals was validated through two ways: (1) indirectly from the scavenging tests with scavenging agents, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and ethanol (EtOH); (2) directly from the electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) tests with 0.1 M 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO). Plausible mechanisms on the radical generation from Fe3O4 MNP activation of PMS are proposed based on the results of radical identification tests and XPS analysis. It appeared that Fe2+ Fe3+ on the catalyst surface was responsible for the radical generation. The results demonstrated that Fe3O4 MNPs activated PMS is a promising technology for water pollution caused by contaminants such as pharmaceuticals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As part of our study on pharmaceutical waste management in Ghana, we investigated the biodegradability of the most widely used antituberculosis drug isoniazid in the aquatic environment. The experiment was conducted using three tests from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines (close bottle test (CBT) 301D, low bacterial density i.e. <1000 colony forming units (CFU) mL(-1), manometric respiratory test (MRT) 301F, i.e. <1000CFUmL(-1) and the Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT) 302B, i.e. <1000CFUmL(-1)) employing different concentrations. At the end of the study, the results showed that isoniazid at concentrations of 4.29mgL(-1) for the CBT and 25.7mgL(-1) for the MRT were found not to be readily biodegradable in accordance with the test guidelines. In the ZWT, at a concentration of 142.92mgL(-1) which allows evaluation of aerobic degradation at high bacterial density, the results provided evidence for biological degradation of isoniazid. Finally, the test samples after 28days analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet detector showed a complete primary elimination of the test substance in MRT and ZWT. The difference of the results obtained by HPLC and oxygen consumption in the MRT indicated the formation of stable transformation products, i.e. incomplete biodegradation, whilst there was no biodegradation at all in CBT.

AB Occurrence of five estrogens, including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water, sediment and biota in Northern Taihu Lake, were investigated and their ecological risk was evaluated. Most of the target estrogens were widely distributed in the eight studied sampling sites, and their levels showed a regional trend of Gong Bay < Meiliang Bay < Zhushan Bay. The average concentrations of E1, E2, E3, EE2 and BPA ranged from 3.86 to 64.4 ng l(-1), 44.3 to 64.1 lg k(-)1 dry weight and 58.6 to 115 lg kg(-1) dry weight in water, sediments and biota, respectively. In most cases, the average concentrations of BPA and E2 were higher than those of other estrogens. E1, E3 and EE2 were found to be accumulated in river snails with bioaccumulation factor values as high as 14,204, 35,327 and 20,127 l kg(-1), respectively. E3 was also considered to be accumulated in clams. The evaluation of environmental risk showed that the occurrence of E2 and EE2 in lakes might pose a high risk to aquatic organisms. These findings provide important information for estrogen control and management in the studied area.

AB The aim of this study was the development of analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, metabolites, and pesticides, belonging to the various chemical classes, in river sediments and their corresponding surface and ground water with the purpose of monitoring the contamination levels. The methods were based on the solid-phase extraction as the sample preparation method for water samples, and the ultrasonic solvent extraction for the sediment samples, followed by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High recoveries were achieved for extraction from both water and sediment samples for the majority of analytes. Low limits of detection were achieved for all investigated compounds in the water sample (1-5 ng L-1) as well as in the sediment (1-3 ng g(-1)). Applicability of the developed methods was demonstrated by determination of pharmaceutical and pesticide residues in 30 surface water, 44 groundwater, and 5 sediment samples from the Danube River Basin in Serbia. Sixty percent of target compounds were detected in environmental samples. The most frequently detected analytes in river sediments were the pesticides dimethoate and atrazine, while carbamazepine and metamizole metabolites 4-AAA and 4-FAA were the most frequently found in water samples.

AB Environmental antibiotic contamination is due mainly to improper and illegal disposal of these molecules that, yet pharmacologically active, are excreted by humans and animals. These compounds contaminate soil, water and plants. Many studies have reported the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in plants and their negative effects on photosynthesis, cell growth and oxidative balance. Therefore, the principal objective of this paper was the study of antibiotic accumulation sites in plants and its uptake modality. Iberis sempervirens L., grown in soil and in agar in the presence or absence of tetracycline, were used as a model system. Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that tetracycline was absorbed and propagated in plants through apoplastic transport and also accumulated in intercellular spaces. Tetracycline was rarely detected inside cells (in cytoplasm and mitochondria where, coherent to its pharmacological activity, it probably affected ribosomes), except in stomata. Moreover, we verified and clarified further the phytotoxic effects of tetracycline on plants. We observed that the antibiotic induced a large reduction in plant growth and development and inhibition of photosynthetic activity. As tetracycline may lead to oxidative stress in plants, plant cells tried to balance this disequilibrium by increasing the amount and activity of some endogenous enzyme antioxidant agents (superoxide dismutase 1 and catalase) and levels of antiradical secondary metabolites.

AB In order to investigate the effect of sunlight on the persistence and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals contaminating the aquatic environment, we exposed nine pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen (AA), amiodarone (AM), dapsone (DP), dexamethasone (DX), indomethacin (IM), naproxen (NP), phenytoin (PH), raloxifene (RL), and sulindac (SL)) in aqueous media to sunlight and to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254, 302 or 365 nm (UV-C, UV-B or UV-A, respectively). Degradation of the pharmaceuticals was monitored by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sunlight completely degraded AM, DP and DX within 6 hr, and partly degraded the other pharmaceuticals, except AA and PH, which were not degraded. Similar results were obtained with UV-B, while UV-A was less effective (both UV-A and -B are components of sunlight). All the pharmaceuticals were photodegraded by UV-C, which is used for sterilization in sewage treatment plants. Thus, the photodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals are dependent on both chemical structure and the wavelength of UV exposure. Toxicity assay using the luminescent bacteria test (ISO 11348) indicated that UV irradiation reduced the toxicity of some pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms by decreasing their amount (photodegradation) and increased the toxicity of others by generating toxic photoproduct(s). These results indicate the importance of investigating not only parent compounds, but also photoproducts in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments.

AB Sulfonamides are one of the most frequently used antibiotics worldwide. Therefore, mitigation processes such as abiotic or biotic degradation are of interest. Photodegradation and biodegradation are the potentially significant removal mechanisms for pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The photolysis of sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP) using a medium pressure Hg-lamp was evaluated in three different media: Millipore water pH 6.1 (MW), effluent from sewage treatment plant pH 7.6 (STP), and buffered demineralized water pH 7.4 (BDW). Identification of transformation products (TPs) was performed by LC-UV-MS/MS. The biodegradation of SMP using two tests from the OECD series was studied: Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D), and Manometric Respirometry test (OECD 301 F). In biodegradation tests, it was found that SMP was not readily biodegradable so it may pose a risk to the environment. The results showed that SMP was removed completely within 128 min of irradiation in the three media, and the degradation rate was different for each investigated type of water. However, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not removed in BDW and only little DOC removal was observed in MW and STP, thus indicating the formation of TPs. Analysis by LC-UV-MS/MS revealed new TPs formed. The hydroxylation of SMP represents the main photodegradation pathway. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment, as a result of human and veterinary use, and have become a relevant environmental concern. In the present study, the acute toxicity of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate, and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the euryhaline fish Gambusia holbrooki was evaluated. Special attention was devoted to oxidative stress parameters. G. holbrooki males, captured in the estuary of the Minho River (NW Portugal), were exposed for 96 It to the selected compounds. The following oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in gills and liver tissues: reduced and oxidised glutathione. lipid peroxidation, and several antioxidant enzymes, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and (4) glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). In the particular case of diazepam, swimming behaviour was also evaluated. The obtained results indicate an overall diminished oxidative stress response caused by SIDS and diazepam. Oxidative-based alterations were observed after exposure to clofibrate and clofibric acid, with modifications of several enzymatic activities. Diazepam caused evident behavioural changes: animals showed dark pigmentation and also abnormal postures, namely lethargy and anomalous movement. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As a possible input pathway in most cases municipal sewage has been discussed. But as an input from the realm of agriculture is conceivable as well, in this study it should be investigated if an input can occur via the pathway application of liquid manure on fields with the subsequent mechanisms surface run-off/interflow, leaching, and drift. For this purpose a series of surface waters, soils, and liquid manures from North Rhine-Westphalia (Northwestern Germany) were sampled and analyzed for up to 29 compounds by HPLC-MS/MS.
   In each of the surface waters antibiotics could be detected. The highest concentrations were found in samples from spring (300 ng/L of erythromycin). Some of the substances detected (e.g., tylosin), as well as characteristics in the landscape suggest an input from agriculture in some particular cases. In the investigation of different liquid manure samples by a fast immunoassay method sulfadimidine could be detected in the range of 1...2 mg/kg. Soil that had been fertilized with this liquid manure showed a content of sulfadimidine extractable by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) of 15 mug/kg dry weight even 7 months after the application. This indicates the high stability of some antibiotics in manure and soil.

AB In the present study, the uptake and metabolization of the sartan drug telmisartan by a series of plants was investigated. Thereby for seven potential metabolites, modifications on the telmisartan molecule such as hydroxylation and/or glycosylation could be tentatively identified. For two additional signals detected at accurate masses m/z 777.3107 and m/z 793.3096, no suggestions for molecular formulas could be made. Further investigations employing garden cress (Lepidium sativum) as a model plant were conducted. This was done in order to develop an analytical method allowing the detection of these substances also under environmentally relevant conditions. For this reason, the knowledge achieved from treatment of the plants with rather high concentrations of the parent drug (10 mg L-1) was compared with results obtained when using solutions containing telmisartan in the mu g - ng L(-1 )range. Thereby the parent drug and up to three tentative drug-related metabolites could still be detected. Finally cress was cultivated in water taken from a local waste water treatment plant effluent containing 90 ng L-1 of telmisartan and harvested and the cress roots were extracted. In this extract, next to the parent drug one major metabolite, namely telmisartan-glucose could be identified.

AB The aim of the study was to describe the impact of the soil water content and sulfamethoxazole, SUL, (antibiotic) concentration in soil on the net CO2 efflux. Soil samples were taken from topsoils of a Haplic Fluvisol and Haplic Chernozem. Soil samples were packed into the steel cylinders. The net CO2 efflux was measured from these soil columns after application of fresh water or SUL solution at different soil water contents. The experiments were carried out in dark at 20 degrees C. The trends in the net CO2 efflux varied for different treatments. While initially high values for water treatment exponentially decreased in time, values for solution treatment increased during the first 250-650 minutes and then decreased. The total net CO2 effluxes measured for 20 hours related to the soil water content followed the second order polynomial functions. The maximal values were measured for the soil water content of 0.15 cm(3) cm(-3) (Haplic Fluvisol with water or solution, Haplic Chernozem with solution) and 0.11 cm(3) cm(-3) (Haplic Chernozem with water). The ratios between values measured for solution and water at the same soil water contents exponentially increased with increasing SUL concentration in soils. This proved the increasing stimulative influence of SUL on soil microbial activity.

AB Even though the methodology used for the determination of beta-blockers and beta-agonists in environmental samples is basedmainly on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, the available literature data on the applied SPE procedures is rather sparse. In this paper such comparison is presented. Moreover, the usefulness of the eight SPE cartridges for the determination of five beta-blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol) and two beta-agonists (salbutamol and terbutaline) in environmental aqueous samples using GC techniques is tested. Among them, three (the trifunction sorbent Strata Screen C, the copolymers LiChrolut EN, and the functionalized copolymer Isolute ENV+) were used for the first time for this purpose. It was confirmed that polystyrene-divinylbenzene-N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers (PS-DVB-VP, Strata-X, and Oasis HLB cartridges) have a better potential than a cation-exchange sorbent for the extraction of the target drugs from environmental water samples. However, it should be stressed out that the direct application of the tested SPE conditions for the analysis of real environmental water samples is not possible, and such parameters, like volume of loading sample, appropriate solvents for washing and elution steps, and so forth, must be optimized again in order to achieve satisfactory recovery values for the target compounds.

AB In this paper the photocatalytic degradation of the 0.2 mM ibuprofen (2-(4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)propanoic acid) in aqueous solution (pH 3) has been carried out by the homogeneous photocatalysis (photo-Fenton) process. This method consists of coupling Fenton's reagent and UV-C irradiation in order to catalyse the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals, a powerful oxidizing agent which leads to degradation of organic pollutants until total mineralization. The effect of H2O2 and Fe3+ (catalyst) concentration on the TOC removal has been examined and the performances of photo-Fenton process have been also compared with other photochemical processes such as direct photolysis (UV alone) and H2O2 photolysis (H2O2/UV). The results have shown that the photo-Fenton process appeared more effective than the other systems studied and the TOC removal decreased in the sequence: photo Fenton >H2O2/UV>UV alone. The kinetics study showed that the TOC removal follows the second-order kinetics. It was found that the concentrations of H2O2 and ferric iron constitute key factors governing the TOC removal and that the optimal concentrations are equal to 10 mM of H2O2 and 0.25 mM Fe3+. In these conditions, 96% of initial TOC has been removed after 8 h of irradiation time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of photodegradation of the non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen (+)-S-2-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid, an emerging organic pollutant, was studied in aqueous solutions under deaerated and aerated conditions. The photolysis experiments were carried out under monochromatic irradiation (lambda = 254 nm) at pH = 7.0 and T = 25 degrees C.
   Simplified reaction schemes of photodegradation of naproxen are proposed in absence and in presence of oxygen respectively. The schemes take into account the photolysis of naproxen and its photoproducts and the reactions of the measured species with oxygen dissolved in the liquid bulk. According to these schemes, two kinetic models were developed which correlate the experimental data, for runs performed in absence and in presence of oxygen, with a fair accuracy and allowed to estimate the best values for the unknown kinetic parameters.
   The calculated quantum yield of direct photolysis of naproxen under deaerated media is in good agreement with the one previously reported. Under aerated conditions, the generation of singlet oxygen has also been taken into account.
   The obtained results, under the adopted conditions, indicated a marked influence of dissolved oxygen on the photodegradation rates of naproxen and the relative distribution of the major reaction intermediates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of an aqueous solution of clofibric acid was investigated during catalytic and noncatalytic ozonation. The catalyst, TiO2, enhanced the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone and raised the fraction or clofibric acid degraded by hydroxyl radicals. The rate constant for the reaction of clofibric acid and hydroxyl radicals was not affected by the presence of the catalyst. The toxicity of the oxidation products obtained during the reaction was assessed by means of Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna tests in order to evaluate the potential formation of toxic by-products. The results showed that the ozonation was enhanced by the presence of TiO2. the clofibric acid being removed completely after 15 min at pH 5. The evolution of dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm and the concentration of carboxylic acids monitored the degradation process. The formation of 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid and three non-aromatic compounds identified as a product of the ring-opening reaction was assessed by exact mass measurements performed by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). The bioassays showed a significant increase in toxicity during the initial stages of ozonation following a toxicity pattern closely related to the formation of ring-opening by-products.

AB An isolation and quantification technique is presented for the analysis of semi-volatile spices and scents in aquatic waters including thymol, eugenol, limonene, carvacrol, vanillin, and cinnamaldehyde. Compounds are isolated from natural waters by solid phase extraction onto Waters Oasis HLB columns and eluted into ethyl acetate. Recovery efficiencies are >70% for most target compounds. Comparison with liquid-liquid extraction and C-18 solid phase extraction indicates that HLB cartridges are more robust and provide equal or better recoveries for target compounds relative to other approaches. Because the compounds are semi-volatile and prone to losses during solvent evaporation, we do not dry the samples completely before quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Compounds are analyzed using selected ion monitoring with a sensitivity similar to 1 pg compound per injection. This equates to a sensitivity of about 2-200 ng L-1 in natural waters, or part-per-billion levels. Column loading and matrix effects are minimal and are accounted for by careful monitoring of volumes and by standard additions during GC analysis. Environmental samples (treated sewage, lake, stream, and fjord samples) show a wide range of compounds and quantities, most in the 10-10,000 ng L-1 range. The artificial spice ethylvanillin, which is commonly used as an internal standard in analysis of woody lignin samples, is found in some natural waters. This is likely a result of the industrial-scale production of this compound for culinary and pharmaceutical use.

AB The UV/H2O2-induced degradation of carbamazepine, a worldwide used antiepileptic drug, recently found as contaminant in many municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and other aquatic environments, is investigated. The oxidation treatment caused an effective removal of the drug. At complete abatement of the substrate after 4 min treatment, a 35% value of removed total organic carbon (TOC) was obtained. A kinetic constant of (2.05 +/- 0.14) x 10(9) 1 mol(-1) s(-1) was determined for OH radical attack to carbamazepine in the UV/H2O2 process. Preparative TLC of the reaction mixture led to the isolation of acridine-9-carboxaldehyde as a reaction intermediate. HPLC and GC/MS analysis indicated formation of small amounts of acridine, salicylic acid, catechol and anthranilic acid among the reaction products. Under the same reaction conditions, synthetically prepared 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was easily degraded to acridine as main product, suggesting that this epoxide is a likely intermediate in the oxidative conversion of carbamazepine to acridine. Under sunlight irradiation, carbamazepine in water underwent slow degradation to afford likewise acridine as main product. In view of the mutagenic properties of acridine, these results would raise important issues concerning the possible environmental impact of carbamazepine release through domestic wastewaters and support the importance of prolonged oxidation treatments to ensure complete degradation of aromatic intermediates.

AB The increasing release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into water poses serious threats to human beings. In this study, a novel core-shell activated carbon (CSAC) material with a high-mechanical strength porous ceramic shell was synthesized and tested by adsorbing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from aqueous solutions. An activated carbon core (AC core) was synthesized from a mixture of powder AC (92%) and cassava waste splinters binder (8%). Moreover, a shell with a high thickness of 0.13 cm and compressive strength (2.92 MPa) was generated from the mixture of coal fly ash and clay at ratio of 60:40. It demonstrated high protection of the AC core. The adsorption efficiency of SMX by CSAC attained 99.0% and 97.9% at initial concentrations of 5 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. Furthermore, 77.0, 68.6 and 60.4% of SMX were adsorbed at higher concentrations of 30, 50, and 100 mg L-1, respectively. The kinetics study demonstrated that the adsorption of SMX followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Moreover, the sorption isotherm was better fitted to Freundlich isotherms. Finally, SMX adsorption on CSAC simultaneously depended on the pore texture of CSAC and the hydrophobic properties of SMX, as well as the pi-pi bonds and electrostatic interactions between them.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been identified as environmental emerging pollutants and are present in different compartments, including soils. Chemical remediation showed to be a good and suitable approach for soil remediation, though the knowledge in their impact for terrestrial organisms is still limited. Therefore, in this work, two different chemical remediation treatments (Fenton oxidation and nanoremediation) were applied to a soil contaminated with an environmental representative concentration of ibuprofen (3 ng g(-1)). The phytotoxic impact of a traditional soil remediation treatment (Fenton oxidation) and of a new and more sustainable approach for soil remediation (nanoremediation using green nano-scale zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVIs)) was evaluated in Lactuca sativa seeds. Percentage of seed germination, root elongation, shoot length and leaf length were considered as endpoints to assess the possible acute phytotoxicity of the soil remediation treatments as well as of the ibuprofen contaminated soil. Both chemical remediation treatments showed to have a negative impact in the germination and development of lettuce seeds, exhibiting a reduction up to 45% in the percentage of seed germination and a decrease around 80% in root elongation comparatively to the contaminated soil. These results indicate that chemical soil remediation treatments could be more prejudicial for terrestrial organisms than contaminated soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Beta-agonists and sulfonamides are widely used for treating both humans and livestock for bronchial and cardiac problems, infectious disease and even as growth promoters. There are concerns about their potential environmental impacts, such as producing drug resistance in bacteria. This study focused on their spatial distribution in surface water and the identification of pollution sources in the Langat River basin, which is one of the most urbanized watersheds in Malaysia. Fourteen beta-agonists and 12 sulfonamides were quantitatively analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to visualize catchment areas of the sampling points, and source profiling was conducted to identify the pollution sources based on a correlation between a daily pollutant load of the detected contaminant and an estimated density of human or livestock population in the catchment areas. As a result, 6 compounds (salbutamol, sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole) were widely detected in mid catchment areas towards estuary. The source profiling indicated that the pollution sources of salbutamol and sulfamethoxazole were from sewage, while sulfadiazine was from effluents of cattle, goat and sheep farms. Thus, this combination method of quantitative and spatial analysis clarified the spatial distribution of these drugs and assisted for identifying the pollution sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many studies demonstrated the presence of diverse environmental contaminants in the Douro River estuary, such as natural and synthetic estrogens, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides. This estuary is located between two densely populated cities and is highly impacted due to anthropogenic activities, such as industry and agriculture. Although the presence of mycotoxins and phytoestrogens, such as lignans and coumestrans, in the aquatic environment is reported by some authors, their occurrence in Portuguese waters was not investigated yet. To evaluate the presence of phytoestrogens, phytosterols and mycotoxins in Douro River estuary, water samples were collected seasonally at nine sampling points, preconcentrated by solid phase extraction and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Local flora was collected on the riverside, in the same sampling points, for identification and evaluation of the possible relation to the presence of phytoestrogens and/or phytosterols in the estuarine water. Results showed the ubiquitous presence of mycotoxins, namely deoxynivalenol up to 373.5 ng L-1. Both phytoestrogens and phytosterols showed a possible seasonal fluctuation, which is in accordance to the life cycle of the local flora and agricultural practices. Physicochemical parameters were also determined for water quality evaluation. This study revealed for the first time the presence of mycotoxins and lignans in estuarine waters from Portugal, and highlights the need to consider natural contaminants in future monitoring programs.

AB Surface sediments from 12 different locations of the Istanbul Strait and Marmara Sea, Turkey were analysed for five antibiotics belonging to two different groups of widely used pharmaceuticals, tetracyclines (TCs) and fluoroquinolones (FQs), by solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography. These two groups of antibiotics, mainly used to prevent or treat illness for humans as well as for animals, are frequently detected in the effluent of municipal sewage plants, in the aquatic environments and in soils after being spread by liquid manure. The results of analysis revealed that measured concentrations of individual antibiotics were significantly different depending on sampling location. Chlortetracycline (CTC) was not detected in any of the samples. High concentrations were mainly found in urbanized regions of the Strait. The concentrations of the two tetracyclines ranged from not detectable to 27.3 mu g kg(-1) in freeze-dried marine sediments. Comparable results were obtained for the two fluoroquinolones with concentration levels from 1.3 mu g kg(-1) up 34.1 mu g kg(-1). This study is the first attempt to show the contamination degree of the Istanbul Strait sediments by emerging contaminants. Particular concern should be given concerning their potential side effects caused by the frequent consumption of mussels and fishes captured in the Istanbul Strait.

AB Investigation on the toxic effects of pharmaceutical drugs namely clofibric acid (CA) and diclofenac (DCF) were studied in a common carp Cyprinus carpio at different concentrations such as 1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1 for a short-term period of 96 h under static bioassay method. At all concentrations, red blood cell (RBC), plasma sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) levels were decreased in fish treated with CA and DCF. Contrastingly, white blood cell (WBC), plasma glucose, protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gill Na+/K+-ATPase level were increased. However, a mixed trend was observed in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), plasma chloride (Cl-), mean cellular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels. There was a significant (P<0.01 and P<0.05) change in all parameters measured in fish exposed to different concentrations of CA and DCF. In summary, the alterations in hematological, biochemical, ionoregulatory and enzymological parameters can be used as biomarkers in monitoring the toxicity of CA and DCF in aquatic environment. However, more detailed studies on using of specific biomarkers to monitor the human pharmaceuticals are needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed drugs that are present in sewage effluents and surface waters. The objective of the present study was to determine whether low environmentally relevant concentrations of the SSRIs fluoxetine and sertraline could impair growth and development in tadpoles of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and to evaluate if such effects may be caused by a disruption of the neuroendocrine system. Tadpoles were exposed to SSRIs at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L for 70 d throughout metamorphosis. No effects on deformities were observed. Tadpoles exposed to fluoxetine (10 mu g/L) and sertraline (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L) exhibited reduced growth at metamorphosis. Tadpoles exposed to sertraline (0.1 and 1 mu g/L) exhibited an acceleration of development as indicated by an increase in the time to tail resorption. The effects of SSRIs on growth and development in tadpoles were likely driven by reduced food intake. Reduced feeding rates were observed in SSRI-exposed tadpoles, and nutritional status can influence growth and development in amphibians via effects on the neuroendocrine system. Only sertraline was capable of causing developmental toxicity in tadpoles at environmentally relevant concentrations. These data warrant additional research to characterize the risks to human health and wildlife from pharmaceutical exposures.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are emerging pollutants included in the first watch list agreed by European countries and set in the EU Water Directive. The objective of the present study was the analytical monitoring of DCF, E2, and EE2 in surface water and sediment of the Manzanares River in a stretch that crosses the city of Madrid, Spain, and to assess whether such environmental levels could affect the development of aquatic vertebrates through a zebrafish embryo-larval assay. Samples taken during two campaigns in the spring of 2015 were analyzed for DCF, E2, and EE2 by LC-MS or GC-MS. The levels of E2 and EE2 measured in surface water and sediments of the Manzanares were within the ranges reported in other Spanish and European studies; however, DCF levels were higher in the present study. The zebrafish embryos exposed to the Manzanares River water (0-144h) showed lethal effects and sublethal effects (developmental delay, bradycardia, and reduced locomotion). Nevertheless, these effects were not primarily associated with the levels of DCF, E2, and EE2 present in the Manzanares River, because representative mixtures of the field study prepared in the laboratory did not exhibit such toxicity to the zebrafish embryos.

AB Trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in waste active sludge (WAS) have caused many concerns due to their recalcitrance and detriment to the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, UV (2 h) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2, 0.1 g g(-1)-VSS (VSS, volatile suspended solid) was proposed as a suitable sludge pretreatment to enhance the AD performance with an increase in the production of maximum total short-chain fatty acids (421.3 %) and methane (119.2 %). Meanwhile, above 50 % removal efficiency for 19 detected TOrCs was achieved. UV and CaO2 had a synergistic effect on the subsequent AD of WAS. Both UV and Ca(OH)(2) produced by CaO2 played important roles in the dissolution of WAS and the subsequent AD, while UV-direct and %OH-indirect photolysis accounted for TOrCs attenuation. In order to predict TOrCs attenuation by UV/CaO2 treatment, a TOrCs photolysis model was tentatively established using carbamazepine as an indicator. This predictive model expressed a good prediction with adj-R-2 = 0.94, and the difference of predicted and measured values was within 27.3 %. This work evaluates a sludge pretreatment for simultaneously TOrCs attenuation and methane accumulation, laying foundation for promotion of sludge resource recycling.

AB The quality of both surface waters (SW) and groundwater (GW) can be affected by anthropogenic activities and by faecal pollution sources from humans and animals. This study investigated the concentration of a group of chemical markers for tracking anthropogenic pollution in the Vega de Granada aquifer (VGA). A group of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, pantoprazole and caffeine, trace elements (TEs) and other potential marker species of anthropogenic pollution were selected. The parameter values (PV) for these contaminants in many of the samples exceeded it the guideline values. We also analysed some vegetables (VEG) grown in the area. The most alarming finding was that amoxicillin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and caffeine were detected in all the samples. Geostatistical methods were used to map the spatial distribution of the estimated PC scores for each principal component extracted (PCi). All the markers selected, including the CECs, appeared in different sectors of the aquifer. By analysing the results for the different parameters, it was possible to clearly define the areas affected by anthropic activities (urban and agricultural) and distinguish them from other areas with a water quality that is almost natural and is less influenced by human activity. This is a first attempt to map a group of CECs and TECs that can be hazardous to human health and the environment.

AB Human pharmaceuticals such as Acetaminophen, Atenolol and Carbamazepine are pseudo persistent aquatic pollutants with yet unknown sub-lethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were exposed to Acetaminophen: 31.90 +/- 11.07 mu g L-1 ; Atenolol: 0.95 +/- 0.38.mu g L-1 and Carbamazepine: 6.95 +/- 0.13 mu g L-1 in a 28 day flow through experiment to (1) determine whether exposure to low concentrations in the mu g L-1 range of the pharmaceuticals alters the brain transcriptome and, (2) identify different expression profiles and treatment specific modes of action and pathways. Despite low exposure concentrations, 411, 7 and 612 differently expressed transcripts were identified in the individual treatments with Acetaminophen, Atenolol and Carbamazepine, respectively. Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed a significant over representation of several biological processes, cellular compartment features and molecular functions for both Acetaminophen and Carbamazepine treatments. Overall, the results obtained in seabream brain suggest similar physiological responses to those observed in humans also at environmental concentrations, as well as the existence of treatment specific processes that may be useful for the development of biomarkers of contamination.

AB In this study, the changes in UV absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) and electron donating capacity (EDC) were investigated as surrogate indicators for assessing removal of micropollutants and bromate formation during ozonation of wastewater effluents. To measure the EDC, a novel method based on size exclusion chromatography followed by a post-column reaction was developed and calibrated against an existing electrochemical method. Low specific ozone doses led to a more efficient abatement of EDC than of UVA(254). This was attributed to the abatement of phenolic moieties in the dissolved organic matter (DOM), which lose their EDC upon oxidation, but are partially transformed into quinones, which still absorb in the measured UV range. For higher specific ozone doses, the relative EDC abatement was lower than the relative UVA abatement, which can be explained by the oxidation of UV absorbing moieties (e.g. non-activated aromatic compounds), which contribute less to EDC. The abatement of the selected micropollutants (i.e., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), carbamazepine (CBZ), atenolol (ATE), bezafibrate (BZF), ibuprofen (IBU), and p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA)) varied significantly depending on their reactivity with ozone in the examined specific ozone dose range of 0-1.45 mgO(3)/mgDOC. The decrease of EE2 and CBZ with high ozone reactivity was linearly proportional to the reduction of the relative residuals of UVA254 and EDC. The abatement of ATE, BZF, IBU, and pCBA with intermediate to low ozone reactivities was not significant in a first phase (UVA(254)/UVA(254,0) = 1.00-0.70; EDC/EDC0 = 1.00-0.56) while their abatement was more efficient than the degradation of the relative residual UVA(254) and much more noticeable than the degradation of the relative residual EDC in a second phase (UVA(254)/UVA(254,0) = 0.70-0.25; EDC/EDC0 = 0.56-0.25) because the partially destroyed UV absorbing and electron donating DOM moieties become recalcitrant to ozone attack. Bromate formation was pronounced for specific ozone doses >0.25 mgO(3)/mgDOC. At these ozone doses, the residual DOM competes less with bromide for ozone as the electron-rich DOM moieties are almost completely degraded. Overall, these results imply that a combination of the relative residual UVA(254) and EDC more truly reflects the intrinsic reactivity of DOM associated with the removal of micropollutants and bromate formation than the single use of the UV absorbance-based surrogate indicators.

AB In this study, a commercial magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin was used for the removal of clofibric acid (CA), one of the most persistent pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in the environment, from aqueous solutions. As a result of batch experiments, optimum conditions were determined as pH = 4-7, equilibrium time = 240 min., and resin dosage = 26 mL/L for the removal of CA with MIEX resin. Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second order kinetic model showed the best fit for the sorption data with correlation coefficients higher than 0.99. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that the ion exchange process betweenMIEX resin and CA was a thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous process. Regeneration studies showed that the repeated use of MIEX resin is possible. The effect of all coexistent anions (chloride, carbonate and sulphate) was found to be close to each other for molar ratios of CA:coexisting anion = 1-3. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images were used to examine the interactions of resins with CA and to see the changes that could occur in the resins after regeneration. The most obvious changes in MIEX resin due to CA sorption are found in the 1712 cm(-1), 1480 cm(-1), 1238 cm(-1)and 963 cm(-1)bands. This study revealed that the mechanism of removal of the CA by MIEX resin is ion exchange and is reversible.

AB Benzophenone-3, benzophenone-8, and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor are used in sunscreens because they can protect the skin from UV radiation. The widespread use of organic UV filters may mean that they directly or indirectly enter seawater during recreational activities or through sewage discharge. In this study, a simple and efficient method using 1-octanol:isooctane (2:8, v/v) as an extraction solvent and liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed to measure trace levels of organic UV filters in seawater samples. This proposed method proved to be a highly sensitive, low-cost, and green analytical tool that requires minimal sample preparation. The method was validated and it exhibited favorable performance as well as acceptable accuracy (67 to 115%), precision (2.1 to 7.3%), coefficients of determination (0.9952 < R-2 < 0.9987), sensitivity (limits of quantification [3.3 to 5.7 ng L-1]), and an acceptable matrix effect (87 to 99%). This methodology was successfully applied to analyze seawater taken from Kenting National Park located in the Hengchun Peninsula of southern Taiwan. Benzophenone-3 was detected at all sampling sites and at a higher concentration than the other organic UV filters. The highest concentration of benzophenone-3 was 514.6 ng L-1 in a sample collected from Baisha Beach.

AB Pharmaceuticals in drinking water sources (DWSs) have raised significant concerns for their persistent input and potential human health risks. Currently, little is known about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in DWSs in China. In this study, a survey for multi-class pharmaceuticals in DWSs of five major river watersheds in China was conducted from 2012 to 2013. Samples were collected from 25 sampling sites in rivers and reservoirs. 135 pharmaceuticals were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that a total of 70 pharmaceuticals were present in the samples, and the most frequently detected ones included sulfonamides, macrolides, antiepileptic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers, etc. Amongst these, maximum concentrations of lincomycin, sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen and paraxanthine were between 44 ng/L and 134 ng/L, and those of metoprolol, diphenhydramine, venlafaxine, nalidixic acid and androstenedione were less than 1 ng/L. Concentrations of the two that were most persistent, DEET and carbamazepine, were 0.8-10.2 ng/L and 0.01-3.5 ng/L, respectively. Higher concentrations of cotinine were observed in warm season than in cold season, while concentrations of lincomycin were the opposite. In a causality analysis, the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in DWSs depends mainly on the detection limits of the methods, their usage and the persistence in the aquatic environment.

AB In 2007, a 1.5-year field-scale study was initiated by the U.S. Geological Survey to evaluate the dissipation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) following a first agronomic biosolids application to nonirrigated farmland. CECs with the greatest decrease in concentration in the surface biosolids at 180days post-application included indole, d-limonene, p-cresol, phenol, and skatol. CECs that were present in the largest concentration in 180-day-weathered biosolids included stanols, nonylphenols, bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, hexahydrohexamethyl cyclopenta-benzopyran (HHCB), and triclosan. CECs that were detected in pre-application soil were 3-beta coprostanol, skatol, acetophenone, beta-sitosterol, beta-stigmastanol, cholesterol, indole, p-cresol, and phenol, most of which are biogenic sterols or fragrances that have natural plant sources in addition to anthropogenic sources, yet their concentrations increased (in some cases, substantially) following biosolids application. Preliminary data indicate the nonylphenols (including NPEO1, NPEO2), OPEO1, benzo[a]pyrene, diethyl phthalate, d-limonene, HHCB, triclosan, and possibly 3-beta coprostanol, skatol, beta-sitosterol, cholesterol, indole, and p-cresol, migrated downward through the soil by 468days post-application, but indicated little uptake by mature wheat plants. This study indicates that some CECs are sufficiently persistent and mobile to be vertically transported into the soil column following biosolids applications to the land surface, even in semiarid regions.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical drugs in the environment is an important field of toxicology, since such residues can cause deleterious effects on exposed biota. This study assessed the ecotoxicological acute and chronic effects of two anticholinesterasic drugs, neostigmine and pyridostigmine in Daphnia magna. Our study calculated 48 h-EC50 values for the immobilization assay of 167.7 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and 91.3 mu g L-1 for pyridostigmine. In terms of feeding behavior, we calculated a 5 h-EC50 for filtration rates of 7.1 and 0.2 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively; for the ingestion rates, the calculated EC50 values were, respectively, 7.5 and 0.2 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine. In the reproduction assay, the most affected parameter was the somatic growth rate (LOECs of 21.0 and 2.9 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively), followed by the fecundity (LOECs of 41.9 and 11.4 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively). We also determined a 48 h-IC50 for cholinesterase activity of 1.7 and 4.5 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively. These results demonstrated that both compounds are potentially toxic for D. magna at concentrations in the order of the mu g L-1.

AB The applicability of O-3, UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV treatment processes as technologies for water reuse considering pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) removal was investigated. Electrical energies required for the effective removal of various PPCPs in secondary effluent were 0.09 kWh/m(3), 0.54 kWh/m(3) and 1.09 kWh/m(3) for O-3, UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV treatments, respectively, showing that O-3 treatment is the most cost-effective treatment option for the PPCPs removal. O-3 treatment showed the effective PPCPs removal at O-3 dose of 6 mg/L; however, the formation of bromate is expected for O-3 treatment using O-3 dose of more than 4 mg/L. In particular, bromate formation will be a critical issue when the reclaimed water is used for direct/indirect potable reuses. Therefore, in order to suppress the bromate formation as well as achieve the effective PPCPs removal, O-3/UV treatment will be recommended. UV/H2O2 treatment will be also a profitable treatment method because no bromate will be formed during the process. The evaluation for ecological risk of PPCPs by the applied processes showed that all the processes could decrease the ecological risk caused by parent PPCPs considerably. This means that the investigated treatment processes can play an important role in reducing unpredictable side effects caused by PPCPs in the aquatic environment.

AB This paper reports a sensitive analytical method based on microwave-assisted extraction and continuous solidphase extraction (SPE), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS), for the simultaneous determination of residues of 18 pharmaceuticals (analgesics, antibacterials, anti-epileptics, beta-blockers, lipid regulators and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), one personal care product and 3 hormones in soils, sediments and sludge. The analytes are extracted with 3:2 methanol/water under the action of microwave energy and the resulting extract is passed through a SPE column to clean up the sample matrix and preconcentrate the analytes. Then, the analytes, trapped on Oasis-HLB sorbent, are eluted with ethyl acetate, silylated and determined by GC-MS. The proposed method provides a linear response over the concentration range 2.5-20000 ng/kg with correlation coefficients higher than 0.994 in all cases. Also, it features low limits of detection (0.8-5.1 ng/kg), good precision (within- and between-day relative standard deviation less than 7%) and recoveries ranging from 91 to 101%. The method was successfully applied to agricultural soils, river and pond sediments, and sewage sludge.

AB Pharmaceuticals have a wide range of biological properties and are released into the environment in relatively large amounts, yet little information is available regarding their effects or potential ecological risks. We exposed outdoor aquatic microcosms to combinations of ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), and ciprofloxacin (a DNA gyrase-inhibiting antibiotic) at concentrations of 6, 10, and 10 mug/L, respectively (low treatment [LT]); 60, 100, and 100 mug/L, respectively (medium treatment [MT]); and 600, 1,000, and 1,000 mug/L, respectively (high treatment [HT]). We maintained these concentrations for 35 d. Few responses were observed in the LT; however, effects were observed in the MT and HT Fish mortality occurred in the MT (<35 d) and in the HT (<4 d). Phytoplankton increased in abundance and decreased in diversity (number of taxa) in the HT, with consistent trends being observed in the MT and LT. Zooplankton also showed increased abundance and decreases in diversity in the HT, with consistent trends being observed in the MT. Multivariate analyses for zooplankton and phytoplankton suggested interactions between these communities. Lemna gibba and Myriophyllum spp. showed mortality in the HT; growth of L. gibba was also reduced in the MT Bacterial abundance did not change in the HT. All responses were observed at concentrations well below the equivalent pharmacologically active concentrations in mammals. Although the present data do not suggest that ibuprofen. fluoxetine, and ciprofloxacin are individually causing adverse effects in surface-water environments, questions remain about additive responses from mixtures.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are emerging contaminants that have been widely detected in water bodies in the last decades, with ecological effects toward aquatic biota that have not been fully elucidated. Most studies concerning their toxicity to microalgae have only considered short-term individual PhAC exposure, rather than combined exposure to several compounds for longer time periods. In this study, we investigated the effects of albendazole (ABZ) (anthelmintic) and carbamazepine (antiepileptic), alone and in combination with caffeine, on the growth and production of chlorophyll-a of the microalgaeRaphidocelis subcapitata, during 16 days of exposure. ABZ alone had a more significant effect than carbamazepine alone on the growth rate and maximum cell density of the microalgae (p < .05; analysis of variance). These results were probably related to the effect of ABZ in inhibiting enzyme complexes and cell membrane proteins related to adenosine triphosphate synthesis, which is important for cell growth. The presence of caffeine lowered the toxicities of ABZ and carbamazepine to the microalgae, probably due to its antioxidant properties, positively affecting chlorophyll-a production, growth rate, and maximum cell density. Thus, caffeine had an antagonistic interaction with the studied PhACs. The results reinforce the importance of ecotoxicological assays that compare individual and combined PhAC exposure conditions. Our findings highlighted that caffeine can be a relevant factor influencing such assays, considering its widespread occurrence in impacted water bodies.

AB Caffeine is ubiquitous in surface and ground waters and it has been proposed as a marker of the anthropogenic pressure on the environment. Sewage treatment plants based on active sludges seem to be not very efficient in its complete removal from effluents while additional disinfection treatments by chlorination are able to do it. In a simulation of the chlorination step herein we report that caffeine is transformed in six by-products: 8-chlorocaffeine, 1,3-dimethyl-5-azabarbituric acid, N,N'-dimethylparabanic acid, N,N'-dimethyloxalamide, N-methylurea and N,N'-dimethylurea. The ecotoxicity of caffeine and identified compounds was evaluated on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to assess acute and chronic toxicity, while SOS Chromotest and Ames Test were used to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds. Moreover, we assessed the possible antigenotoxic effect of the selected compounds using SOS Chromotest after co-incubation with the standard genotoxin, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on the rotifer while the algae seemed to be unaffected. Results indicated that caffeine (1), N,N'-dimethyloxamide (4) and N,N'-dimethylparabanic add (5) reduced beta-galactosidase activity in comparison with positive control, both at 1 and 5 mg/L of 4-NQNO with a good dose-response.

AB The seasonal variations in the occurrence of carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, and acebutolol were studied at seven sites along River Fyris from December 2007 to December 2008. Samples were collected from the effluent of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP), at one upstream site, and five downstream sites of the WWTP). During one occasion in May 2008, water samples were collected at different locations and depths in the recipient lake. All analytes except of acebutolol were present in both the river and the lake at quantifiable amounts at all sampling occasions. Carbamazepine was found in similar concentrations (about 90 ng L(-1)) at all sampling sites and all studied depths (0.5-40 m) in the lake, indicating high environmental persistence of this compound. A clear seasonal pattern was observed for the natural attenuation of the beta-blockers in the river, with the highest attenuation occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. The loss of beta-blockers on a distance of 1320 m reached up to 75% during summer time but was insignificant during winter. The seasonal variations in the loss followed the seasonal variations in water temperature and chlorophyll a mass flow suggesting that biotransformation and adsorption are the main processes responsible for the loss of the studied pharmaceuticals in River Fyris downstream the WWTP.

AB The occurrence of four beta blockers, one antiepileptic drug, one lipid regulator, four anti-inflammatories, and three fluoroquinolones was studied in a river receiving sewage effluents. All compounds but two of the fluoroquinolones were observed in the water above their limit of quantification concentrations. The highest concentrations (up to 107 ng L-1) of the compounds were measured during the winter months. The river water was passed to a pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant, and the elimination of the pharmaceuticals was followed during the treatment. The processes applied by the plant consisted of ferric salt coagulation, rapid sand filtration, ozonation, two-stage granular activated carbon filtration (GAC), and UV disinfection. Following the coagulation, sedimentation, and rapid sand filtration, the studied pharmaceuticals were found to be eliminated only by an average of 13%. An efficient elimination was found to take place during ozonation at an ozone dose of about 1 mg L-1 (i.e., 0.2-0.4 mg of O-3/mg of TOC). Following this treatment, the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals dropped to below the quantification limits with the exception of ciprofloxacin. Atenolol, sotalol, and ciprofloxacin, the most hydrophilic of the studied pharmaceuticals, were not fully eliminated during the GAC filtrations. All in all, the treatment train was found to very effectively eliminate the pharmaceuticals from the raw water. The only compound that was found to pass almost unaffected through all the treatment steps was ciprofloxacin.

AB This study investigated the effects of selected four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, and roxithromycin) on the photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes of Cyperus alternifolius in constructed wetlands (CWs). Moreover, the removal and kinetics of PhACs in CWs were evaluated to explore the related removal mechanisms. Results showed that C. alternifolius can uptake and withstand certain PhACs. The PhAC tolerance of C. alternifolius might be attributed to their capacity to maintain relatively normal photosynthetic activity and elevated antioxidative defense. CWs offered comparable or even higher removal efficiencies for the selected PhACs compared with conventional WWTPs. The removal of the target PhACs was enhanced in the planted CWs versus the unplanted CWs mostly because of plant uptake and rhizosphere effects. In particular, carbamazepine, which is considered the most recalcitrant of the PhACs, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The removal of target PhACs fitted into two distinct periods. The initial fast step (within the first 2 h) was essentially attributed to the adsorption onto the CW medium surface. The subsequent slow process (2-12 h) closely followed first-order kinetics probably because of the interaction between microorganisms and plants. The obtained results indicate that C alternifolius can phytoremediate PhAC-contaminated waters in CWs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detection of estrogenic disrupting compounds (EDCs) in drinking waters around China has led to rising concerns about health risks associated with these compounds. There is, however, a paucity of studies on the occurrence and identification of the main compounds responsible for this pollution in the source waters. To fill this void, we screened estrogenic activities of 23 source water samples from six main river systems in China, using a recombinant two-hybrid yeast assay. All sample extracts induced significant estrogenic activity, with E2 equivalents (EEQ) of raw water ranging from 0.08 to 2.40 ng/L. Additionally, 16 samples were selected for chemical analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EDCs of most concern, including estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estriol (E3), diethylstilbestrol (DES), estradiol valerate (EV), 4-t-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-nonylphenols (4-NP) and bisphenol A (BPA), were determined at concentrations of up to 2.98, 1.07, 2.67, 4.37, 2.52, 1.96, 89.52, 280.19 and 710.65 ng/L, respectively. Causality analysis, involving comparison of EEQ values from yeast assay and chemical analysis identified E2, EE2 and 4-NP as the main responsible compounds, accounting for the whole estrogenic activities (39.74% to 96.68%). The proposed approach using both chemical analysis and yeast assay could be used for the identification and evaluation of EDCs in source waters of China.

AB A wide range of human pharmaceuticals are present at low concentrations in freshwater systems, particularly in sections of polluted river. These compounds show high biological activity, often associated with a high stability. These characteristics imply a potential impact of these substances on aquatic biota even when present at low environmental concentrations. Low flow conditions in Mediterranean rivers, most of which flow through densely populated areas and are subjected to intensive water use, increase the environmental risk of these emergent compounds. Here, we studied whether pharmaceuticals in river water affect the local benthic community structure (diatoms and invertebrates). For this purpose, we analyzed the occurrence of pharmaceuticals along the Llobregat River and examined the benthic community structure (diatoms and invertebrates) of this system. Some pharmaceutical products in the Llobregat River registered concentrations greater than those cited in the literature. Multivariate analyses revealed a potential causal association between the concentrations of some anti-inflammatories and beta-blockers and the abundance and biomass of several benthic invertebrates (Chironomus spp. and Tubifex tubifex). Further interpretation in terms of cause-and-effect relationships is discussed; however, it must be always taken with caution because other pollutants also may have significant contributions. Combined with further community experiments in the laboratory, our approach could be a desirable way to proceed in future risk management decisions.

AB The recognition of pharmaceuticals as significant environmental contaminants has only been a recent phenomenon. Therefore there is a paucity of data relating to the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals once they enter an aquatic receiving system. The amount of work that needs to be done in terms of risk assessment for pharmaceuticals required by regulatory agencies is substantial. This paper has determined the environmental partitioning coefficient (K-d) of 13 diverse human pharmaceuticals in three model systems of differing combinations of solid phases and solutions. The K-d values were then compared with distribution values of the pharmaceuticals in the human body determined from pharmacological studies. This was done to assess the functional relationship between Kd and distribution values in the human body (VD). Kd values ranged from 3 to 2450 L kg(-1). Regression coefficients ranged from r(2) = 0.62-0.72, indicating that VD values are a useful indicator for the Kd values of the tested pharmaceuticals within the batch sorption systems. The relationship between K-d and V-D should therefore be further explored to determine whether this relationship can be applied to a broader range of pharmaceuticals in more diverse environmental systems. Exploiting available human pharmacological data in such a way would be of great benefit in prioritising human pharmaceuticals as environmental contaminants in the risk assessment process.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a large group of substances that have been recognized as environmental contaminants in recent years. Research on the pharmaceutical fate in soils is currently limited or missing. In this study, three pharmaceuticals (atenolol (ATE), carbamazepine (CAR), and metoprolol (MET)) were introduced to soils and exposed for 61 day under aerobic conditions. Thirteen different soils were used in the study to increase the understanding of pharmaceutical behaviour in the soil matrix. Ten metabolites were detected and tentatively identified. Some of them, such as atenolol acid (AAC), carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (EPC), 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), trans-10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine (RTC), and metoprolol acid (MAC), were consequently confirmed using commercial reference standards. It was concluded that the aerobic conditions of the experiment determined the pharmaceutical degradation pathway of studied compounds in the soils. The different amounts/rates and degradation of the transformation products can be attributed to differences in the soil properties. ATE degraded relatively quickly compared with CAR, whereas MET degradation in the soils was unclear. The persistence of CAR and its metabolites, in combination with low CAR sorption, enable the transportation of CAR and its metabolites within soils and into the ground water. Thus, CAR may cause adverse effects on the environment and humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Psychoactive pharmaceuticals as environmental contaminants may disrupt

   interaction network
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPRESSION; EXPOSURE; MODELS
AB Background: Most cases of idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) likely result from unknown environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. These triggers may include maternal exposure of a fetus to minute concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine (CBZ), venlafaxine (VNX) and fluoxetine (FLX).
   Unmetabolized pharmaceuticals reach drinking water through a variety of routes, including ineffectively treated sewage. Previous studies in our laboratory examined the extent to which gene sets were enriched in minnow brains treated with pharmaceuticals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genes in fish brains and human cell cultures, significantly enriched by pharmaceuticals, would have distinct characteristics in an ASD-associated protein interaction network. We accomplished this by comparing these groups using 10 network indices.
   Results: A network of 7212 proteins and 33,461 interactions was generated. We found that network characteristics for enriched gene sets for particular pharmaceuticals were distinct from each other, and were different from non-enriched ASD gene sets. In particular, genes in fish brains, enriched by CBZ and VNX 1) had higher network importance than that in the overall network, and those enriched by FLX, and 2) were distinct from FLX and non-enriched ASD genes in multivariate network space. Similarly, genes in human cell cultures enriched by pharmaceutical mixtures (at environmental concentrations) and valproate (at clinical dosages) had similar network signatures, and had greater network importance than genes in the overall ASD network.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that important gene sets in the ASD network are particularly susceptible to perturbation by pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds, widely produced and used all around the world, are partly responsible for the widespread water pollution in the environment. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug that persists in the environment for many years. In the present study, we used the TiO2/UV, nanoparticulate zero-valent iron (NZVI), and NZVI/H2O2 treatment processes to compare efficiency of CBZ removal from water. Influence of NZVI loading, H2O2 concentration, TiO2 loading, UV lamp power, and the matrix (distilled water and groundwater) on CBZ removal efficiency was evaluated using full factorial design. Results indicated that the NZVI/H2O2 process oxidized CBZ within 5min. On the other hand, the NZVI process alone did not reduce CBZ concentration after 120min of process time. The NZVI/H2O2 process was equally effective in CBZ removal from both distilled water and groundwater whereas the TiO2/UV process was less effective due to the presence of ions in groundwater. CBZ removal efficiency of the TiO2/UV process declined 30% when the matrix was changed from distilled water to groundwater. Negative divalent ions, i.e., SO42- ans CO32-, were the main cause of reduction of CBZ removal efficiency from groundwater. It is likely that these two ions adsorb onto, and consequently prevent the superoxide anion O-2(center dot-) and hydroxyl radical OH center dot from being generated on, the surface of the TiO2.

AB A wide range of pharmaceutical compounds have been identified in the environment, and their existence is a topic of growing concern, both for human and ecological health. The work described here has investigated the photolytic properties of L(+)-alpha-phenylglycine (L-alpha-PG-H) in aqueous solution as it can be degraded by photo-catalysis. In 266 nm laser flash photolysis of aqueous solution of L-alpha-PG-H saturated with nitrogen, two transient absorption bands are observed at 280-330 nm and 450-800 nm, respectively, due to L-alpha-PG-H radical cation and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)). Then e(aq)(-) reacts with L-alpha-PG-H to form the L-alpha-PG-H radical anion. Decaying rate constants of e(aq)(-) observed at 720 nm is to be 8.9 x 10(8) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). The rate constant for oxidation of L-alpha-PG-H by SO4- is calculated as 4.5 x 10(8) and 4.3 x 10(8) s(-1) mol(-1) dm(3), respectively. The dissociation constants (pKa) of L-alpha-PG-H is 3. Excited triplet of L-alpha-PG-H in solution is formed by laser flash photolysis. The quench rate constant of L-alpha-PG-H excited triplet (k(s)) is determined to be 1.3 x 10(7) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) and k(0) is equal to 1.7 x 10(5) s(-1).

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media are pharmaceuticals which are biologically inert and metabolically stable during their passage through the body and are excreted almost completely within a day into waste water. They are not readily biodegradable. However, in a test system simulating sewage treatment, we were able to show that the model compound iopromide (N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-5-methoxyacetylamino-N-methyliso-phthalamide) was amenable to primary degradation. The resulting degradation product (5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-N-methyliso-phthalamide) showed a faster photolysis than the parent compound. Additionally this product was further degraded in a test system simulating surface water conditions. Short-term toxicity of the primary degradation product was low, i.e. no effects on any of various aquatic species could be found even at concentrations of I g l(-1). Additionally no chronic toxicity of the degradation product was observed in an early-life stage test with zebrafish at the highest tested concentration of 100 mg l(-1). Based on the results from model systems a degradation pathway for iopromide is postulated. Though further work showing the transferability of the laboratory results to environmental conditions is necessary the presently available information on the environmental fate and effects of iopromide and its degradation products do not provide evidence of a risk for aquatic life caused by the introduction of this contrast medium into waste water.

AB This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the fate of fluoroquinolone antibacterial ofloxacin (OFX) which is the free available chlorine (FAC) in order to determine its effect during water chlorination process. The Direct reactions of FAC with OFX were quite rapid. A half-life of 7.7 s was measured under pseudo-first order conditions in the presence of an excess of total chlorine ([FAC](0) = 13 mu M and [OFX](0) = 0.55 mu M at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C in buffered reagent water. Free chlorine reactions rates were of first-order type in both substrate and oxidant with specific second-order rate constants of 6.8 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1). No induced back reactions or other interference by using thiosulfate to stop the chlorination reaction was shown. The seven products of the reaction were determined by using the LC/MS/MS analysis. Structures were investigated due to the explication of transitions obtained at different CID energies by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Pathways of the formations of these by-products were presented in this study and pathways of the fragmentations of pseudo molecular ions of the structures proposed were presented in supplementary files.

AB Practical aspects of Lagenaria vulgaris shell conversion to activated carbon were examined along with its use in ranitidine adsorption. Kinetics and isotherms of adsorption onto Lagenaria vulgaris carbon (LVC) were correlated to several theoretical adsorption models. The best fit was found in the case of Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model indicating monolayer adsorption. The influence of pH under kinetic study showed slightly hindered adsorption below pH 4. The optimal adsorbent dosage was set to 1 g/L. LVC was characterized by several complementary techniques, including wet chemical techniques such as Boehm's titrations and determination of pH(pzc) and pH of LVC, which revealed neutral nature of the adsorbent. N-2 sorptometry determined specific surface area of 665 m(2)/g and significant ratio of micropores in the sample with maximum wall's diameter of 2.2 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the role of lignin and cellulose in the formation of the final LVC structure. Porous structure of the material was proved by using scanning electron microscopy. Preparation of LVC material drew attention as an easy and low-cost process for production of a highly efficient adsorbent which exhibited fast kinetics of ranitidine removal in the first minutes of contacting and large adsorption capacity (315.5 mg/g) at equilibrium.

AB Illicit drugs and their metabolites have recently been recognized as an emerging group of contaminants due to their potential ecotoxicological impact in aquatic ecosystems. To date, information on the occurrence of these compounds in the aquatic environment of China remains limited. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 36 rivers in north China that discharge into the Bohai Sea and north Yellow Sea and measured the concentrations of amphetamine-like compounds, ketamines, cocainics, and opioids. The occurrence and spatial patterns of these substances show significant differences between the rivers and regions. Two designer drugs, methamphetamine (METH) and ketamine (KET), were the most abundant compounds detected in the entire set of samples (detection frequency of 92 and 69 %). The concentrations of METH and KET ranged from <0.1 to 42.0 ng L-1 (mean = 4.53 ng L-1) and <0.05 to 4.50 ng L-1 (mean = 0.49 ng L-1), respectively. The high detection frequencies of METH and KET are consistent with the fact that they are the main illicit drugs consumed in China. The high concentrations of these illicit drugs and their metabolites were found in areas that have a high population density. The riverine input of total illicit drugs into the Bohai Sea and north Yellow Sea was estimated to be in the range of 684 to 1160 kg per year.

AB Monitoring sublethal effects of pharmaceuticals on nontarget species in aquatic environments has become an important topic in ecotoxicology, yet few studies have been conducted concerning the effects of beta-blockers on aquatic organisms. The present study investigated the effects of the beta-blocker sotalol (SOT) at 3 environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history traits of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of SOT, the authors hypothesized reduced numbers of embryos in the brood pouches, decelerated growth of adult snails, and smaller size of neonates, but no effect on mortality rates of adults. Contrary to the hypothesis, the total number of embryos was significantly higher after 56 d of exposure at nominal concentrations of 0.05 mu g/L and 1.0 mu g/L by 107% and 73%, respectively. No differences in embryo numbers were observed at earlier time-points. Therefore, the mode of action seems to be an extension of the reproductive period rather than an increase of the embryo production. Furthermore, our results indicate a hormetic dose-response relationship, because no effects were observed at the highest test-concentration (6.5 mu g/L). Mortality, growth of adult snails, and neonate sizes were not affected by the beta-blocker. Given the strong influence on reproduction, the effects of sublethal concentrations of SOT and other beta-blockers deserve better consideration in ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB Among the vast list of xenobiotics that may promote harmful effects in aquatic ecosystems, pharmaceuticals are currently a prominent class due to their ability to persist in these environments and also due to the lack of information regarding their effects on the different components of the aquatic biota. Antifungals in particular, despite their massive use, are not extensively studied in environbmental terms. The main objective of this study was to characterize the toxicity of the antifungal clotrimazole to the aquatic organism Daphnia magna. To attain this purpose, the effects of this compound were measured, focusing on the determination of acute lethality, and quantification of biomarkers, such as neurotoxicity (soluble cholinesterases, ChEs); and oxidative stress and metabolism (such as catalase, CAT; and glutathione-S-transferases, GSTs). The toxicity assessment with biomarkers was based on animals exposed to concentrations similar to those already found in surface waters in order to increase the ecological relevance of the obtained data. The results showed that exposure to clotrimazole was able to induce significant increases in both CAT amd GSTs activities. ChE activity was not significantly altered after clotrimazol exposure. In view of the above, it is concluded that the drug studied caused adverse effects in terms of oxidative stress, at an ecological relevant levels, showing that the presence of clotrimazol in the wild is not innocuous.

AB The development of membrane-associated molecularly imprinted materials that can rapidly adsorb and separate specific compound has broad technological applications for areas ranging from sewage treatments to biomedical devices. However, issues such as low permselectivity and unstable composite structures are restricting it from developing stage to a higher level. Here, inspired by the bioadhesive technology of polydopamine (pDA), we present a novel molecular imprinting strategy to integrate multilevel nanocomposites (Br-Ag-pDA@SiO2) into the porous membrane structure. The molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (MINcMs) were then obtained through an in situ photoinitiated ATRP method by using propranolol as the template molecule, which was one of the pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). In this work, largely enhanced specific rebinding capacity (48.53 mg/g) and permselectivity (the permeability factor beta values were also more than 9.6) had been successfully achieved, which should be attributing to the creation of high-stability and uniform growth of propranolol-imprinted polymer layers onto the nanoparticle-integrated nanocomposite membrane surfaces. Specifically, the as-prepared MINcMs not only exhibited rapid adsorption dynamics of template molecule, but also possessed excellent regeneration performance. Moreover, when the other PhACs were respectively imprinted, similar recognition selectivity could be observed dependent on the template molecule. Importantly in this case, all synthesis methods were conducted in aqueous at ambient temperature, which was environmental friendly for scaling up without causing pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence of 13 parent and conjugated estrogens and progestagens in surface water of the Santa Ana River. With the exception of the synthetic hormones 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and mestranol, other compounds were detected at least twice at 10 representative sites, with the ubiquitous estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol-3-sulfate as the dominant compounds quantified (0.24-6.37 ng/L and 0.49-9.25 ng/L, respectively). Sites near dairy farms exhibited high levels of conjugates, whereas those close to a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent outlet displayed relatively high concentrations of E1. Principle component analysis coupled with multiple linear regression revealed dairy farms and the STP as the 2 significant contamination sources, accounting for 69.9% and 31.1% of the total hormone burden, respectively. Risk assessment results suggested E1 and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the 2 hormones with the largest risks to aquatic organisms, and which combined, contributed >90% of the total estrogenicity. Most of the sites investigated showed that E1 and E2 posed a medium risk (0.1 < risk quotient < 1), whereas each induced a high risk (risk quotient > 1) at sites severely impacted by the STP and dairy farms. These results suggest that river health would benefit from effective treatment of waste at the STP and dairy farms prior to discharge. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Standardized ecotoxicological tests still constitute the fundamental tools when doing risk-assessment of aquatic contaminants. These protocols are managed towards minimal mortality in the controls, which is not representative for natural systems where mortality is often high. This methodological bias, generated from assays where mortality in the control group is systematically disregarded, makes it difficult to measure therapeutic effects of pharmaceutical contaminants leading to lower mortality. This is of concern considering that such effects on exposed organisms still may have substantial ecological consequences. In this paper, we illustrate this conceptual problem by presenting empirical data for how the therapeutic effect of Oxazepam-a common contaminant of surface waters-lower mortality rates among exposed Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) from wild populations, at two different life stages. We found that fry hatched from roe that had been exposed to dilute concentrations (1.1 +/- 0.3 mu g l(-1)) of Oxazepam for 24 h 3-6 days prior to hatching showed lower mortality rates and increased activity 30 days after hatching. Similar effects, i.e. increased activity and lower mortality rates were also observed for 2-year old perch exposed to dilute Oxazepam concentrations (1.2 +/- 0.4 mu g l(-1)). We conclude that therapeutic effects from pharmaceutical contaminants need to be considered in risk assessment assays to avoid that important ecological effects from aquatic contaminants are systematically missed.

AB Photodegradation rates of five pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and propranolol) and of four estrogens (estriol, estrone [E-1] 17 beta-estradiol [E-2], and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol [EE2] which are common contaminants in the aquatic environment, were measured in both purified and river water at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-2 mu g/L) and different oxygen concentrations. Solutions were irradiated with a xenon arc lamp (765 W/m(2); 290 nm < lambda < 700 nm) and analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with electrospray ionization for pharmaceuticals and atmospheric pressure photoionization for estrogens. In river water, half-lives were 4. 1 h for ketoprofen, 1. 1 min for propranolol, 1.4 h for naproxen, 2 to 3 h for estrogens, and 15 It for gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. In air-saturated purified water, rates generally were slower except for that of ketoprofen, which reacted with a half-life of 2.5 min. Naproxen, propranolol, and E, reacted with half-lives of 1.9, 4.4, and 4.7 h, respectively. The EE2, estriol, E-2, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen reacted with half-lives of 28.4, 38.2, 41.7, 91.4, and 205 h, respectively. The presence of oxygen doubled the direct photolysis rates of naproxen and propranolol. In nonautoclaved river water, 80% of E-2 rapidly biotransformed to E-1 within less than 20 min, whereas all other compounds remained stable over 22 h.

AB Ultraviolet filters (UVFs) are emerging organic compounds found in most water systems. They are constituents of personal care products, as well as industrial ones. The concentration of UVFs in the water bodies in space and time is mostly determined by degradation and sorption, both processes being determinant of their bioavailability and toxicity to ecosystems and humans. UVFs are a wide group of compounds, with different sorption behavior expected depending on the individual chemical properties (pK(a), K-oc, K-ow). The goal of this work is framed in the context of improving our understanding of the sorption processes of UVFs occurring in the aquifer; that is, to evaluate the role of biomass growth, solid organic matter (SOM) and redox conditions in the characterization of sorption of a set of UVFs. We constructed a conceptual and a numerical model to evaluate the fate of selected UV filters, focused on both sorption and degradation. The models were validated with published data by Liu et al. (2013), consisting in a suite of batch experiments evaluating the fate of a cocktail of UVs under different redox conditions. The compounds evaluated included ionic UV filters (Benzophenone-3; 2-(3-t-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)5-chloro-benzotriazole; 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-octylphenyl)-benzotriazole) and neutral ones (octyl 4-methoxycinnamatte; and octocrylene).

AB In the first part of a broader study on the effects of individual and multicomponent mixtures of pharmaceutical active compounds, the authors used the Microtox((R)) test system to analyze in detail the effects of 10 widely used human and veterinary pharmaceutical active compounds toward the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri. The experimental results indicated moderate toxicity for the majority of the tested compounds. Comparison between experimental 50% inhibitory concentrations and those predicted from the quantitative structure-activity relationship models indicated that most of the tested pharmaceutical active compounds behave as polar narcotic compounds toward A. fischeri (only the antibiotic chlortetracycline seemed to have a specific mechanism of action). A comparison between the experimental results and a collection of acute toxicity data on other nontarget organisms indicated that in general A. fischeri has a comparable sensitivity to other aquatic species. However, according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, the majority of the investigated chemicals can be classified as harmful or nontoxic for aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on comparisons among the 95th percentile of measured environmental concentrations found in European Union water bodies and acute toxicity data on various aquatic organisms, no risk to aquatic life exists when the tested pharmaceutical active compounds are assessed as individual chemicals.

AB Water samples from streams, brooks and storm sewer outfall pipes that collect storm waters across the Island of Montreal were analyzed for caffeine, carbamazepine and fecal coliforms. All samples contained various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and caffeine levels ranged over several orders of magnitude with a modest correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R-2 value of 0.558). An arbitrary threshold of 400 ng caffeine L-1 allows us to identify samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than 200 colony-forming units per 100 mL (cfu 100 mL(-1)) of fecal coliforms. Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban environment, is widely contaminated by domestic sewers as indicated by the ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and carbamazepine. Caffeine concentrations were relatively well correlated to fecal coliforms, and could potentially be used as a chemical indicator of the level of contamination by sanitary sources. The carbamazepine data was not significantly correlated to fecal coliforms and of little use in this dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated the growth inhibition effect of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin on four photoautotrophic aquatic species: the freshwater microalga Desmodesmus subspicatus, the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae, the monocotyledonous macrophyte Lemna minor, and the dicotyledonous macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum. Both antibiotics, which act by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase, demonstrated high toxicity to A. flos-aquae and L. minor and moderate to slight toxicity to D. subspicatus and M. spicatum. The cyanobacterium was the most sensitive species with median effective concentration (EC50) values of 173 and 10.2 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Lemna minor proved to be similarly sensitive, with EC50 values of 107 and 62.5 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. While enrofloxacin was more toxic to green algae, ciprofloxacin was more toxic to cyanobacteria. Calculated EC50s for D. subspicatus were 5,568 mu g/L and >8,042 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. These data, as well as effect data from the literature, were compared with predicted and reported environmental concentrations. For two of the four species, a risk was identified at ciprofloxacin concentrations found in surface waters, sewage treatment plant influents and effluents, as well as in hospital effluents. For ciprofloxacin the results of the present study indicate a risk even at the predicted environmental concentration. In contrast, for enrofloxacin no risk was identified at predicted and measured concentrations. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2786-2792. (C) 2011 SETAC

AB Metabolic products are often more toxic than their pharmacological parent compounds. Therefore, the acute and chronic effects of the main metabolites-salicylic acid (SAL), gentisic acid (GEN), and o-hydroxyhippuric acid (HDP)-of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active ingredient in Aspirin(R) and many other pharmaceuticals, were assessed using standard (Daphnia magna) and autochthonous (Daphnia longispina) cladocerans. The sequence of decreasing levels of acute and chronic toxicity of ASA metabolites to daphnids was GEN > SAL > HDP. HDP did not present acute toxicity, but chronic exposures enabled the production of abnormal neonates and, in particular, egg abortion. Thus, reproduction was the end point most susceptible to HDP. On the other hand, SAL and GEN induced changes in the normal patterns of reproduction and growth of both species. In general, D. longispina was more sensitive than was D. magna, although the population growth of the autochthonous species was superior under SAL exposures than that of the standard test species. Although the concentrations that were determined to have a toxic effect were above the levels detected in aquatic environmental samples, exposure to low levels of pharmacologically active substances for a duration longer than the test period may induce changes in nontarget organisms.

AB The aqueous photochemistry of four pharmaceutical compounds detected in surface waters (naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and clofibric acid) was investigating in purified (Milli-Q) water and in Mississippi River water (MRW). Both direct photolysis and hydroxyl radical-mediated indirect photolysis (using a combination of probe and quencher experiments) were studied. Singlet oxygenation was also investigated for naproxen. Second-order rate constants for reaction with hydroxyl radical were determined using Fenton's reagent. Naproxen was rapidly transformed via direct photolysis in sunlight in both Milli-Q and MRW. The radical quencher isopropyl alcohol (IPA), had a similar effect in both systems, and this effect was interpreted as a reaction of a carboxyl radical intermediate of naproxen. Diclofenac was found to undergo rapid direct photolysis under sunlight, confirming the results of prior studies. Addition of IPA led to more rapid transformation, possibly due to formation of other radical species or photoreduction with IPA serving as the H-source. When irradiated under natural sunlight, slow direct photolysis of clofibric acid is observed in Milli-Q water, and a combination of direct photolysis and radical mediated indirect processes appear responsible for clofibric acid photolysis in MRW. The dominant photochemical loss process for ibuprofen irradiated with a medium pressure Hg-vapor lamp was identified as reaction with photo-generated radicals. These results suggest that photolytic processes are important removal mechanisms for pharmaceutical compounds discharged into sunlit surface waters.

AB Lomefloxacin (LOM) is a synthetic antimicrobial from the fluoroquinolone family (FQ) used as a veterinary and human drug. Once in the environment, LOM may pose a risk to aquatic and terrestrial microorganisms due to its antimicrobial activity. This study evaluated the effect of ozonation of LOM (500 mu g L-1), the residual antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and acute toxicity against Vibrio fischeri. In addition, degradation products were investigated by UHPLC-MS/MS and proposed. Ozonation was carried out varying the applied ozone dose from 0 to 54.0 mg L-1 O-3 and pH values of 3, 7, and 11. Ozonation was most efficient at pH 11 and led to 92.8% abatement of LOM in a 9-min reaction time (54.0 mg L-1 O-3 applied ozone dose). Ozonation at pH 3 was able to degrade 80.4% of LOM. At pH 7, 74.3% of LOM was degraded. Although the LOM concentration and the antimicrobial activity of the solution dropped as ozone dose increased (antimicrobial activity reduction of 95% at pH 11), toxicity to V. fischeri increased for pH 7 and 11 (i.e., 65% at pH 7 and 75% at pH 11). The reduction in antimicrobial activity may be related to the oxidation of piperazinyl and the quinolone moiety. The formation of intermediates depended on the oxidant (hydroxyl radicals or/and molecular O-3) that acted the most in the process.

AB Background: There is an enhanced international awareness that the improper disposal of unwanted and unused medications may have a detrimental effect on the environment.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of unused medications in New Zealand that are not returned to a pharmacy for disposal and are instead disposed of via land fill or water systems. In addition, this study intended to identify why these medications were unused or unwanted. Design: An online survey was placed on the New Zealand National Poisons Centre website for a period of three months during 2008. This consisted of a series of questions with predefined answer sets and asked about collection of medications, why there may be unused medications, storage of medications and disposal of medications.
   Results: This survey was completed by 452 individuals. 62% of respondents currently had unwanted medications in their house. The most common reason for people to have leftover medication was 'medical condition improved or resolved' (n = 307). Depending on formulation type. between 13-24% of unused medications were returned to pharmacies with tablets and capsules being most likely to be returned and liquids most likely to be added to water systems.
   Conclusions: A significant percentage of unwanted medications are disposed of via routes that have the potential to adversely affect the environment. Reducing excess medications and wastage as well as education of appropriate disposal techniques may minimize their potential impact on the environment. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been globally detected in surface waters, and the ecological impacts of these biologically-active, ubiquitous chemicals are largely unknown. To evaluate the aquatic toxicity of individual pharmaceuticals and mixtures, we performed single species laboratory toxicity tests with Daphnia magna, a common freshwater zooplankton. We conducted acute (6-day) and chronic (30-day) exposure pharmaceutical bioassays and evaluated survivorship and morphology of adults and neonates, adult length, resting egg production, brood size (fecundity), and the proportion of male broods produced (sex ratio). In general, exposure to a single pharmaceutical in the 1-100 mu g/l range yielded no apparent effects on the normal life processes of Daphnia. However, chronic fluoxetine exposure (36 mu g/l) significantly increased Daphnia fecundity, and acute clofibric acid exposure (10 mu g/l) significantly increased sex ratio. A mixture of fluoxetine (36 mu g/l) and clofibric acid (100 mu g/l) caused significant mortality; the same fluoxetine concentration mixed with 10 mu g/l clofibric acid resulted in significant deformities, including malformed carapaces and swimming setae. Mixtures of three to five antibiotics (total antibiotic concentration 30-500 mu g/l) elicited changes in Daphnia sex ratio. We conclude: (1) individual and mixtures of pharmaceuticals affect normal development and reproduction of Daphnia magna, (2) aquatic toxicity of pharmaceutical mixtures can be unpredictable and complex compared to individual pharmaceutical effects, and (3) timing and duration of pharmaceutical exposure influence aquatic toxicity.

AB This work evaluated the photo-Fenton degradation of two pharmaceuticals extensively used in human medicine, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and fluoxetine (FLU) when present in an anaerobic pre-treated hospital effluent (HE) at low concentration (100 mu g L-1). Operational parameters such as concentration of hydrogen peroxide, iron, and initial pH as well as the effect of iron citrate complex were evaluated considering the degradation of the pharmaceuticals. Iron citrate complex (Fecit) influenced significantly FLU degradation at pH 4.5 achieving 80 % after 20 min, while with iron nitrate only 36 % degradation was obtained after the same time. However, only a slight effect was observed on CIP degradation, achieving 86% with Fecit and 75% with Fe(NO3)(3), after 20 min. Samples of HE used in this work were previously treated in an anaerobic reactor followed by sand filtration; however, the presence of pharmaceuticals was detected. Degradation of both FLU and CIP was significantly hindered when present in HE, due to the relatively high content of organic (39.6 mg L-1) and inorganic (12.5 mg L-1) carbon, which may have consumed OH in side reactions. However, the iron cycle reduction was not affected by the matrix in the presence of citrate. Despite the recalcitrance of the matrix (no total organic carbon removal), it was possible to achieve over 50 % degradation of both pharmaceuticals after 90 min.

AB To discover the catalytic activity of sludge-corncob activated carbon in catalytic ozonation of Ibuprofen, the performance of sludge-corncob activated carbon and three selected commercial activated carbons as catalysts in catalytic ozonation was investigated. The observation indicates the degradation rate of Ibuprofen increases significantly in the presence of sludge-corncob activated carbon and the catalytic activity of sludge-corncob activated carbon is much higher than that of the other three commercial activated carbons. Ibuprofen's removal rate follows pseudo-first order kinetics model well. It is also found that the adsorption removal of Ibuprofen by sludge-corncob activated carbon is less than 30% after 40 min. And the removal efficiency of Ibuprofen in the hybrid ozone/sludge-corncob activated carbon system is higher than the sum of sludge-corncob activated carbon adsorption and ozonation alone, which is a supportive evidence for catalytic reaction. In addition, the results of radical scavenger experiments demonstrate that catalytic ozonation of Ibuprofen by sludge-corncob activated carbon follows a hydroxyl radical reaction pathway. During ozonation of Ibuprofen in the presence of activated carbon, ozone could be catalytically decomposed to form hydrogen peroxide, which can promote the formation of hydroxyl radical. The maximum amount of hydrogen peroxide occurs in the presence of sludge-corncob activated carbon, which can explain why sludge-corncob activated carbon has the best catalytic activity among four different activated carbons.

AB Phytochemicals are widely present in fruits, vegetables and other plants and have great health benefits owing to their antioxidant properties. They are naturally found in the aquatic environment as well as discharged from sewage treatment plants after their large consumption. Little is known about their impact on fish; particularly in light of their interactions with pharmaceuticals. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of diosmin, naringenin, quercetin and idole-3-carbinol on CYP1A-dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity on rainbow trout hepatic microsomes in the presence of two pharmaceuticals: clotrimazole and dexamethasone. The interactions between the phytochemicals and pharmaceuticals used in this study were determined using a combination index. Hepatic microsomes were exposed to two concentrations (1-or 50 mu M) of phytochemicals and pharmaceuticals separately and in combinations. Singly, clotrimazole inhibited EROD activity 40% and 90% of control, while dexamethasone did not. Naringenin and diosmin inhibited EROD activity alone up to 90% and 55% respectively, but activities were further inhibited in the presence of either pharmaceutical. The preliminary study of combinations of clotrimazole with phytochemicals primarily showed synergistic effects. While EROD activity was not inhibited in the presence of quercetin or indole-3-carbinol, significant and synergistic inhibition was detected when either of these was combined with clotrimazole or dexamethasone.

AB The potential presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones and personal care products in drinking water supplies has raised concerned over the efficiency with which these substances are removed by water treatment processes. In this work, we analyzed samples of raw, unprocessed water collected in different periods and found them to contain higher levels of these contaminants in the colder periods (viz. 12314 ng L-1 in autumn and winter as compared to 8-127 ng L-1 in spring and summer) as a result of their biodegradation being favoured by high temperatures and solar irradiance. We also assessed the efficiency with which these contaminants are removed from drinking water by a water treatment plant operating in south-eastern Spain. Preoxidation with potassium permanganate and chloramination with sodium hypochlorite in the presence of highly concentrated ammonia were found to be the treatment steps most markedly contributing to the removal of pharmaceuticals, hormones and personal care products from drinking water (especially in the warmer periods, where these contaminants were completely removed from the water). By contrast, water treated in the colder periods (autumn and winter) still contained small amounts of ibuprofen and carbamazepine (0.09-0.5 ng L-1) which, however, accounted for less than 0.2% of their original concentrations in the water prior to treatment.

AB The antimicrobial substance triclosan has widespread use in personal care products and can enter the terrestrial environment if sewage sludge is applied to soil. The inhibitory effects of triclosan on basal and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) of three different soils were investigated. Soils were dosed and later redosed with four nominal triclosan concentrations, and respiration rates were measured over time. In each soil, a significant depression in basal respiration was noted after initial dosing, followed by a recovery. The initial extent of respiration inhibition was positively related to the triclosan dose, i.e., respiration was most inhibited at highest triclosan concentration. Differences in respiration inhibition between soils at equivalent dose were inversely correlated with organic matter and clay content, suggesting that the bioavailability of triclosan might have been reduced by sorption to organic carbon or by physical protection in micropores. Substrate-induced respiration was also reduced by the addition of triclosan and subsequently recovered. After redosing with triclosan, basal respiration was enhanced in all soils, suggesting that it was acting as a substrate. However, redosing resulted in SIR inhibition in all treatments above 10 mg triclosan kg(-1) in all three soils, although all soils appeared to be more resistant to perturbation than following initial dosing. The present study suggests that triclosan inhibits soil respiration but that a subsequent acclimation of the microbial community occurs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:360-366. (C) 2010 SETAC

AB The removal of clofibric acid from aqueous solution has been investigated in catalytic and non-catalytic semicontinuous ozonation runs. Kinetic data were analyzed using second order expressions for the reaction between organics and ozone or hydroxyl radicals. Catalytic runs used a commercial titanium dioxide catalyst consisting of fumed colloidal particles. The kinetic constant of the non-catalytic ozonation of clofibric acid at pH 3 was 8.16 x 10(-3) +/- 3.4 x 10(-4) L mmol(-1) s(-1). The extent of mineralization during non-catalytic runs ranged from 50% at pH 7 to 20% at pH 3 in a reaction that essentially took place during the first 10-20 min. The catalyst increased the total extent of mineralization, its effect being more important during the first part of the reaction. The pseudo-homogeneous catalytic rate constant was 2.17 X 10(-2) L mmol(-1) s(-1) at pH 3 and 6.80 x 10(-1) L mmol(-1) s(-1) at pH 5, with up to a threefold increase with respect to non-catalytic constants using catalyst load of 1 g/L. A set of stopped-flow experiments were designed to elucidate the role of catalyst. whose effect was probably due to the adsorption of organics on catalytic sites rather than to the promotion of ozone decomposition.

AB Some uses of biochar/H2O2 in the removal of organic pollutants from sewage have made the advanced oxidation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products by modified biochar possible. However, little is known about the performance of modified biochar and the mechanism of this process. Herein, the activation of H2O2 by Fe-impregnated biochar (FBC, produced from maize straw, wheat straw and peanut shell) was studied, and the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was specifically investigated. The results show that Fe-impregnated biochar had the ability to activate H2O2 and degrade SMX and its performance was better than that of the original biochar. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 350 degrees C to 700 degrees C, Fe-impregnated maize straw (1 g/L) enhanced the decomposition of H2O2 (3 mM) from 66% to 99% within 2 h. The degradation of SMX (10 mu M) by FM700/H2O2 within 2 h reached 100%, which was approximately 3 times of that of the original biochar. The mechanism of activation-degradation was elucidated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results show that the interaction of H2O2 with C-OH promoted the generation of HO center dot and that HO center dot and non-radical sites jointly attacked SMX to degrade it. Impregnation with Fe not only increased the specific surface area of the biochar but also provided more active sites to activate H2O2 and degrade SMX.

AB Ubiquitous occurrence of several pharmaceuticals in discharged sewage effluents has lead to considerable deterioration of life and quality of receiving water bodies. Ibuprofen, an acidic nonsteroid drug, is one such pharmaceutical being widely used for its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The present work investigated the efficiency of graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) in adsorption of Ibuprofen from its aqueous solutions. The GONPs were characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze changes in structure and morphology occurring due to adsorption (if any). The impact of various process parameters on percentage removal (%) of Ibuprofen was determined by batch adsorption experiments. The data obtained were subjected to isotherm and kinetic analysis in order to describe the distribution of ibuprofen between the liquid and solid phases in the batch studies. The results obtained best fitted the Langmuir isotherm model and were determined to be guided by pseudo second-order kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibb's free energy, Enthalpy and Entropy were also evaluated and the results revealed the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the process of adsorption of ibuprofen onto graphene oxide. Hence, graphene oxide may be considered as a suitable adsorbent for large scale efficient treatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen and similar other anti-inflammatory drugs.

AB Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) could represent a useful marker of contamination of effluent from agricultural land receiving biosolids. The persistence characteristics of caffeine in three agricultural soils was investigated. In laboratory microcosms of moist soil incubated at 30 degrees C, [8-ring-C-14]-caffeine was rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 in a sandy loam and a loam soil, and less rapidly in a silt loam soil. Caffeine mineralization was very responsive to soil temperature and moisture. Mineralization of caffeine was hastened by the addition of liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) from three municipal sewage-treatment plants (MSTPs) that aerate this material. In contrast, LMB from three MSTPs that did not aerobically digest their LMB did not accelerate caffeine mineralization. Autoclaved LMB had no effect on caffeine dissipation. A bacterium, designated Pseudomonas sp. Strain TH1, was isolated from aerated LMB. The bacterium first demethylated caffeine to 3,7-dimethylxanthirle, and then mineralized the molecule. Inoculation of Pseudomonas sp. Strain TH1 into soil hastened mineralization of [8-ring-C-14]caffeine. In summary, caffeine was more stable in a silt loam soil than a sandy loam or loam soil, but biodegradation in all three soils was quite uniform upon the addition of caffeine-degrading bacteria or aerated biosolids. We suggest that caffeine would likely not be a suitably conservative chemical marker for detecting chronic contamination of agricultural drainage water following fertilization with LMB. Aerobic digestion of LMB promotes the enrichment of caffeine-degrading microorganisms.

AB Tetracycline (C22H24N2O8) is a well-known emerging contaminant that is generally used in pharmaceuticals and personal-care products. Traditional biological treatment technologies are inadequate for quickly and completely removing tetracycline from wastewater; hence, the ozonation investigated in this study is preferable. The effects of several reaction parameters, such as tetracycline concentration, pH, temperature, addition of center dot OH radical scavengers, gas type, and bubble size, were investigated. Experimental results indicated that the connection of air or pure oxygen gas with a millibubble or ultrafine-bubble compressor could not remove tetracycline. As the ozonation was carried out, the degradation of tetracycline exceeded 99.5 %, followed by approximately 40 % mineralization with 60-min treatment. A lower pH level or a higher reaction temperature was practical to increase the degradation of tetracycline; also, the increase in the formation of center dot OH radicals was impressive to mineralize further the organic compound. According to the experimental results shown in this study, ultrafine-bubble ozonation is a feasible way to degrade the antibiotics effectively and decrease the toxicity in water within a short treatment duration, and with low ozone gas consumption.

AB A porous Z-scheme MnO2/Mn-modified alkalinized g-C3N4 catalyst (MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn) was fabricated by calcination-impregnation method. MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn exhibited higher Fenton-like photocatalytic activity in degrading tetracycline than pure g-C3N4 and alkalinized g-C3N4. The optimal MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15(%) showed the highest catalytic activity with 96.7% tetracycline removal and 74.9% total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency due to the enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. The tetracycline degradation process followed two pathways, and the formation of NO3- further revealed deep mineralization of tetracycline to inorganic substance during the photocatalytic degradation. The highest center dot OH yield of MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15(%) was attributable to synergism of surface grafted hydroxyl groups, Z-scheme charge transfer and H2O2 activation via redox cycles of Mn(IV)/Mn(III)/Mn(II). The Fenton-like photocatalytic mechanism of Z-scheme MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn was presented. Moreover, MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15% can effectively dispose of pharmaceutical wastewater with 77.1% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal.

AB Discharge of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from wastewater has been increasingly alarmed, led to the advent of the treatment techniques. Among these methods, adsorption is regarded as a tunable and green approach with the utilization of mesoporous carbon (MC) as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent. Herein, we described the strategy for the synthesis of novel MC from Fe-MIL-88B as a self-sacrificial template. Three thermolysis temperatures (550, 750, and 950 degrees C) were investigated to compare the structural characteristics and absorbability towards selected NSAIDs compounds including diclofenac sodium (DCF), aspirin (APR), and ibuprofen (IBU). Effect of contact time (0-480 min), concentration (10-40 mg/L), pH (2-10), and MC dosage (0.1-0.5 g/L) was systematically studied. Kinetic and isotherm models were also used to find out the adsorption mechanism and behavior of NSAIDs pharmaceutical over MC materials. Proposed mechanism and recyclability test were rigorously studied to gain more insight into how the NSAIDs molecules adsorb on the MC materials and their potential towards drug treatment.

AB The biochar prepared from plantain wood was used to remove Cephalexin antibiotic from aqueous solutions. The effect of some operational parameters such as pH (1-10), contact time (0-120 min), Cephalexin concentration (10, 50, and 100 mg/L), adsorbent dose (0.2-4 g/L), and temperature (10 degrees C-60 degrees C) was evaluated and optimized. The micropore surface area and micropore volume of the biochar were determined to be 896 m(2)/g and 0.472 cm(3)/g, respectively. In the optimum conditions (pH = 6.7, initial concentration of Cephalexin = 50 mg/L, contact time = 60 min, and adsorbent dose = 2 g/L), the removal efficiency was 88.5%. The adsorption isotherm of Cephalexin follows the Langmuir model. Thermodynamic results revealed that the process was endothermic, and the kinetics study confirmed that the adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order reaction. The results of this study indicate that the biochar prepared from the plantain wood can be used as a suitable and cost-effective technology for the removal of Cephalexin from aqueous solutions with high removal efficiency.

AB The performances of two FAU-type zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were evaluated for the removal of antibiotics of three different classes, namely azithromycin, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole, from aqueous solutions. Commercial zeolites were used, without any previous treatment. Use of a small adsorbent dosage resulted in fast antibiotic adsorption that followed pseudo-second order kinetics. The removals of azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were highly pH-dependent, with low removal percentages observed under acid (pH 2.5-4.5) and basic (pH 8.5-10.5) conditions, respectively. The Freundlich isotherm model provided the best fits to the adsorption data. The adsorption mechanisms appeared to involve both electrostatic and H-bonding interactions. Using an antibiotics mixture, percentage removals of azithromycin and ofioxacin onto the zeolites of up to 79% were obtained. Both materials presented good adsorption (>50%) of azithromycin and ofioxacin from a real sample of effluent wastewater. The results showed that zeolites with FAU structure can be used as effective adsorbents for the removal of antibiotics with different physicochemical properties, including molecules with large volumes, such as azithromycin.

AB The pollution characteristics and ecological risk of 12 classified as sulfonamide, trimethoprim, quinolone, and tetracycline antibiotics in Dongting Lake, China, were studied. The total concentrations of the antibiotics ranged from 1.06 to 135.40 ng L-1 for all sampling sites. The highest average concentration was observed for sulfadiazine, followed by sulfamethoxazole. The detection frequencies (over 60%) of sulfonamides were higher than those of other antibiotics. The direct discharge of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry wastewater might be the main pollution sources of antibiotics in the Dongting Lake. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution and the scale of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry sources. The seasonal changes of antibiotic concentration were relatively diversified, with the dry season generally having higher concentrations than the wet season. The results of the ecological risk assessment indicated that sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and sarafloxacin might pose a significant risk to the aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially in Potou and Nandu. This study enriches the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake.

AB The fate of the three environmentally relevant beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol has been studied in batch experiments involving aquifer material and nitrate reducing conditions. Results from the about 90d long tests indicate that abiotic processes, most likely sorption, jointly with biotransformation to atenololic acid were responsible for the 65% overall removal observed for atenolol. Zero order kinetics, typical of enzyme-limited reactions, controlled the transformation of this beta blocker to its corresponding carboxylic acid. The mass balance evidences that no mineralization of atenolol occurs in the biotic experiment and that atenololic acid is more stable than its parent compound under the studied conditions. This finding stresses the importance of considering atenololic acid as target compound in the environmental studies on the fate of atenolol. For metoprolol and propranolol the results from the experiment suggest a slower sorption to be the dominant removal process, which led to final decreases in concentrations of 25-30% and 40-45%, respectively. Overall, the removals observed in the experiments suggest that subsurface processes potentially constitute an alternative water treatment for the target beta-blockers, when compared to the removals reported for conventional wastewater treatment plants.

AB Major oxidation products (OPs) of the beta blocker propranolol, formed during ozonation in aqueous solution were identified and oxidation pathways were proposed. Ozonation led to a high number of OPs being formed. In total, chemical structures were elucidated for five different nominal masses (including constitutional isomers, approximately 13 signals), whereas at least eight other OPs and their isomers (similar to 30 signals) remained unidentified. The structural elucidation was performed via liquid chromatography coupled with hybride triple quadrupole with linear ion trap (LC-Qq LIT MS). The primary ozonation product, OP-291, was formed by ozone attacking the naphthalene ring, which resulted in the ring-opening and two aldehyde moieties being formed. OP-291 was further oxidized to OP-307, which was then oxidized to OP-281. Experiments were performed at pH 3 and pH 8, as well as in the presence and absence of a radical scavenger, Ozonation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents spiked with propranolol (10 mu M) led to the same OPs being formed as observed in the experiments with deionized water. Therefore, ozonation of WWTP effluent is resulting in the formation of a high number of OPs with an elevated toxic potential (i.e., formation of aldehydes).

AB The phototransformation of acetaminophen (APAP) by UV/H2O2 in deionized water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents was studied systematically by a combination of analysis of the reaction intermediates and kinetic study. 1-(2-amino-5-hydroxyphenyl) ethanone (P1) and the reported N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetamide (P2) were identified as the main transformation intermediates during the transformation of APAP by UV/H2O2. There was no influence of center dot OH on the formation kinetics of P1, while its decay was promoted. The formation and decay kinetics of P2 were accelerated by increases in the concentration of center dot OH. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of center dot OH with APAP, P1, and P2 were 3.9 x 10(9), 8.1 x 10(9), and 4.7 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The kinetic study indicated that the main transformation of APAP also included transformation to 1,4-hydroquinone, although the accumulated concentration of 1,4-hydroquinone was quite low. The presence of anions (Cl-, HCO3-/CO32-, NO2-/NO3-), humic acid, commercial drug components or adjuvants, and dissolved organic matters in STP effluents not only changed the transformation kinetics of APAP, but also altered the distribution of the intermediates. The kinetics and pathway of APAP transformation in STP effluent were markedly different from those in deionized water. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have received great attentions from the general and scientific community due to their potential impacts on ecological and human health. We investigated the occurrence of twelve acidic pharmaceuticals and herbicides (salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, diclofenac, meclofenamic acid and indomethacin) in surface waters of the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River in north China during the wet and dry seasons and assessed the potential risks to aquatic organisms posed by these acidic compounds. Seven acidic compounds were detected in the rivers, including five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, mefenamic acid and naproxen), and two blood lipid regulators (clofibric acid and gemfibrozil). The concentrations for acidic pharmaceuticals in the Yellow River and Liao River were in most cases higher in the dry season than in the wet season, but the concentrations of acidic compounds in the Hai River were generally higher in July than in November. High concentrations of these detected compounds in the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River were found more frequently at those sites located in metropolitan areas, lower reaches or river confluences. Only diclofenac and ibuprofen were found to have medium to high risks in the three rivers based on the calculated risk quotients. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A study of the photodegradation of different pharmaceuticals [furosemide, ranitidine (hydrochloride), ofloxacine, phenazone, naproxen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid] in aqueous medium at various pHs by using a batch photoreactor and a photocatalytic membrane reactor working in recirculation regime was carried out. Polycrystalline TiO2 was used as the photocatalyst, and different membranes (NTR 7410, PAN GKSS HV3/ T, N 30 F, NF PES 10) were tested. A different adsorption of the substrates onto the catalyst surface was observed owing to the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic character of the catalyst, depending on the pH. The photodegradation of the seven molecules in the batch reactor was successfully carried out and the behaviour was in accordance with pseudo-first order kinetics. Furosemide and ranitidine were selected to carry out the study of rejection and photodegradation in the hybrid membrane system. The permeate flux of the treated water was in the 31.5-60.0 L/(hm(2)) range for NTR 7410 membrane, whereas rejection values in the range 10-60% for furosemide and 5-30% for ranitidine in the dark (without photoreaction) were found. The degradation in the hybrid membrane photoreactor showed that the photocatalyst was retained by the membrane in the reaction ambient, while the membrane rejection towards the pollutants was not very satisfactory. A net decrease of the rejection down to 0 was observed in the contemporary presence of light, photocatalyst and oxygen. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) with estrogenic or estrogenic-like activity have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments and have been an issue of global concern due to their potential negative effects on wildlife and human health. This study used the MCF-7 cell proliferation assay (E-Screen) to assess the estrogenic activity profiles in Maryland Coastal Bays (MCBs), a eutrophic system of estuaries impacted by human activities. Estrogenic activity was observed in all study sites tested. Water samples from MCBs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation above the negative control from 2.1-fold at site 8, located in Sinepuxent Bay close to the Ocean City Inlet, to 6.3-fold at site 6, located in Newport Bay. The proliferative effects of the sediment samples over the negative control ranged from 1.9-fold at the Assateague Island National Seashore site to 7.7-fold at the Public Landing site. Moreover, elevated cell proliferation (p < 0.05) was observed when cells were co-exposed with 17ss-Estradiol (E2), while reduction in cell proliferation was observed when cells were co-exposed with the antagonist ICI 182, 780 suggesting that cell proliferative effects were primarily mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER). These results suggest the occurrence of some estrogenic or hormonal-like compounds in the MCBs and are consistent with our previous findings based on vitellogenin analyses.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) as an important group of "emerging contaminants" (ECs), have been highlighted and received global attentions in last decade. China has tremendous consumption of PhACs and the most pharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide. In this study, 33 PhACs (19 antibiotics included) were monitored in the Beiyun River basin in Beijing, China. The seasonal occurrence, temporal spatial distribution and potential source were investigated. The total levels were about 2 mu g L-1. Nonantibiotics were more frequently detected. The highest median concentrations were observed for caffeine (558 ng L-1) and erythromycin (319 ng L-1). Acetaminophen, erythromycin, diclofenac and N,N-diethylmeta-toluamide showed highly significant seasonal variation, while caffeine, carbamazepine, metoprolol and most sulfonamides were more stable. The burden was most heavy in Qing River in both seasons (up to 4 mu gL(-1)). Antibiotics from veterinary use accounted for minor contribution in this region. The characteristics and trends were overviewed by comparing with our previous survey. The total level of 15 PhACs dropped significantly by 37% on average from 2013 to 2015. The proportion of caffeine, once a major component in 2013, reduced from 77% to 47%. The burden of these ECs in surface water of Beijing is remarkably reduced, suggesting the overall situation has been improving. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal efficiencies of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), bisphenol A and nonylphenol, during various types of water treatment processes were evaluated extensively using laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments. The specific processes of interest were coagulation/flocculation sedimentation/filtration (conventional water treatment process), powdered activated carbon (PAC), granular activated carbon (GAC), ozonation and chlorination. Batch sorption tests, coagulation tests, and ozone oxidation tests were also performed at higher concentrations with 14 EDCs including bisphenol A. The conventional water treatment process had very low removal efficiencies (0 to 7%) for all the EDCs except DEHP, DBP and DEP that were removed by 53%, 49%, and 46%, respectively. Ozonation at 1 mgO(3)/L removed 60% of bisphenol A and 89% of nonylphenol, while chlorination at 1 mg/L removed 58% and 5%, respectively. When ozone and chlorine doses were 4 and 5 mg/L, respectively, both EDCs were not detected. PAC removal efficiencies ranged from 15% to 40% at 3 to 10 mg/L of PAC with a contact time of 15 minutes. In the high concentration batch sorption tests, EDC removal efficiencies by PAC were closely related to octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow). GAC adsorption was very effective water treatment process. The type and service time of GAC did not affect EDC removal efficiencies. The combination of ozonation and GAC in series appears to remove EDCs effectively to safe levels while conventional water treatment could not.

AB In particular in arid regions the reuse of waste water and aquifer recharge is an important issue. Elimination of persistent emerging pollutants represents a key factor in integrated water resources management, and identifying suitable treatment processes to eliminate such compounds becomes inevitably necessary. It is the objective of this study (1) to assess the occurrence of emerging pollutants in the Jordan Valley and (2) to review and examine the biodegradability of selected key compounds. Among the most frequently detected compounds during a sampling campaign in 2007 were pharmaceutical residues such as carbamazepine, diclofenac, or naproxen, and X-ray contrast agents such as diatrizoic acid and iopromide, all typically found in Europe and the USA as well. To gain further insight into elimination processes, biodegradation studies were conducted with batch tests and flow-through soil columns under unsaturated, aerobic conditions. Results demonstrated biodegradation for pharmaceutical residues such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and bezafibrate. The degradation rate was faster in treated waste water as compared to raw waste water, most probably due to competing substrate consumption in raw waste water. The antiepileptic carbamazepine showed no degradation in the batch tests and only moderate removal during soil passage, probably due to sorption. The results of this study and previously published data emphasize the need for further studies under more defined conditions to elucidate the specific conditions under which biodegradation of emerging pollutants proceeds.

AB There are several papers in the literature that have recorded satisfactory results for the degradation of different pharmaceuticals in aqueous solutions by means of oxidation processes; however. only a few of them relied on real samples in carrying out their investigations. This study examines the results of the performance of photo-induced oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, ozonation and peroxone in degrading the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (CIP) in a hospital effluent. The real samples were collected from the treatment system of the University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM). Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) was used to monitor the decrease of the CIP concentration. As expected, photo-induced oxidation was much slower than the other processes in bringing about total CIP degradation. Both heterogeneous photocatalysis and peroxone led to almost complete CIP degradation after 60 min treatment. Ozonation showed the best performance: total degradation after 30 min treatment. This was an unexpected result in view of the greater capacity of the other two processes to generate hydroxyl radicals. However, this finding supports a result in the literature that has tended to be overlooked. The by-products formed during the application of the processes were found to be very similar. Moreover, on the basis of the data obtained from the literature, there is some evidence to suggest that the by-products are derived from the oxidation of the piperazine group. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the effects and fate of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) at environmentally relevant levels (50-500 mu g/L) in activated sludge (AS) microbial communities under aerobic conditions. Exposure to 500 mu g/L of CIP decreased species diversity by about 20% and significantly altered the phylogenetic structure of AS communities compared to those of control communities (no CIP exposure), while there were no significant changes upon exposure to 50 mu g/L of CIP. Analysis of community composition revealed that exposure to 500 mu g/L of CIP significantly reduced the relative abundance ofRhodobacteraceaeandNakamurellaceaeby more than tenfold. These species frequently occur in AS communities across many full-scale wastewater treatment plants and are involved in key ecosystem functions (i.e., organic matter and nitrogen removal). Our analyses showed that 50-500 mu g/L CIP was poorly removed in AS (about 20% removal), implying that the majority of CIP from AS processes may be released with either their effluents or waste sludge. We therefore strongly recommend further research on CIP residuals and/or post-treatment processes (e.g., anaerobic digestion) for waste streams that may cause ecological risks in receiving water bodies.

AB This study provides an alternative solution for the bioremediation of a recalcitrant pharmaceutical micropollutant. Clofibric acid (CLA) was chosen as target molecule, because of its environmental persistence and resistance to wastewater treatment technologies. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a phenol-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from the activated sludge to degrade CLA. In order to evaluate the effect of acclimation process with glucose as carbon co-substrate, two protocols were performed, in which the transfer of the inoculum is carried out either in the exponential growth phase or in the decline phase. The results showed a removal efficiency of CLA of 35% when cells in the decline phase were used for inoculation. In contrast, a very low removal yield (10%) was achieved when cells harvested in the exponential phase were used as inoculum. This work is the first one reporting on the capability of this bacterium to remove this drug. The obtained data showed that the isolated strain is able to degrade target molecule and might be a promising agent for the elimination of this refractory compound.

AB In this study, the solar photocatalytic process in a pilot plant with compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) was performed for amoxicillin (AMX) degradation, an antibiotic widely used in the world. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken statistical experiment design was used to optimize independent variables, namely TiO2 dosage, antibiotic initial concentration, and initial pH. The results showed that AMX degradation efficiency affected by positive or negative effect of variables and their interactions. The TiO2 dosage, pH, and interaction between AMX initial concentration and TiO2 dosage exhibited a synergistic effect, while the linear and quadratic term of AMX initial concentration and pH showed antagonistic effect in the process response. Response surface and contour plots were used to perform process optimization. The optimum conditions found in this regard were TiO2 dosage = 1.5 g/L, AMX initial concentration = 17 mg/L, and pH = 9.5 for AMX degradation under 240 min solar irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation of AMX after 34.95 kJ(UV)/L accumulated UV energy per liter of solution was 84.12 % at the solar plant.

AB Acute toxicities of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (ANAMMOX) substrates and four antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewaters on ANAMMOX process were reported. Individual and joint acute toxicity assays were performed using 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Results showed that IC50 values and their 95% confidence interval of ammonium chloride (A), sodium nitrite (B), penicillin G-Na (C), polymyxin B sulfate (D), chloramphenicol (E) and kanamycin sulfate (F) were 2708.9 (2247.9-3169.9), 1475.4 (1269.91680.9), 5114.4 (4946.4-5282.4), 10.2 (1.8-18.6), 409.9 (333.7-486.1) and 5254.1 (3934.4-6573.8) mg L-1 respectively, suggesting toxicities were in the order of D > E > B > A > C > F. Joint acute toxicities of bicomponent mixtures A and B, C and D, C and F, D and F were independent; D and E, E and F were additive while C and E were synergistic. Joint acute toxicities of multicomponent mixtures were synergistic or additive. Luminescent bacteria test is an easy and robust method for forecasting the feasibility of ANAMMOX process for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Adsorption of antibiotics on solid particles is a key process controlling their fate in the subsurface. To determine the sorption of the representative sulfonamides (SAs) on soils, we investigated the effects of initial concentration, temperature, contact time and soil properties on the sorption of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) onto two different soil samples (Longxing and Jinjiang purple paddy soils) from the West Sichuan Plain, China. Meanwhile, batch equilibration experiments were carried out with application of different kinetics and thermodynamics models. The results showed that both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were well represented the equilibrium adsorption data of SMX, while kinetic experimental data were well fitted by double chamber first-order model on both adsorbents. 96% of total adsorption amount were achieved in the initial 1 h for two soils. The adsorption ability enhanced with the increase of initial SMX concentration. Owing to different soil properties, including element composition and endogenous dissolved organic matters (EDOM), the adsorption behavior on two purple paddy soils had a great difference. The single point adsorption coefficient (K) values of Longxing paddy soil were higher than those of Jinjiang paddy soil. And as the temperature rising, the adsorption amount on Longxing paddy soil increased, but there was no obvious regularity in Jinjiang paddy soil. This study will play an important part in understanding the fate and risk of SMX in soil environment.

AB The removal routes of pharmaceuticals especially biodegradation routes in the activated sludge process are still unclear. Some studies indicated pharmaceuticals were mainly removed via nitrification process (autotrophic biodegradation), while others suggested pharmaceuticals were mainly removed via COD degradation process (heterotrophic biodegradation). These unclear problems limited the improvements of pharmaceuticals removal. In this study, in order to elucidate three biodegradation routes (nitrification, COD degradation, or both nitrification and COD degradation), autotrophic and heterotrophic reactors were individually developed to separate nitrification and COD degradation form the activated sludge process (mix-trophic process including nitrification and COD degradation). Furthermore, the pharmaceuticals removal routes of adsorption, hydrolysis, and oxidation were also studied. Among six degradable pharmaceuticals, heterotrophic biodegradation and adsorption were the major removal routes. Two sulfonamides of five antibiotics were predominantly removed by COD degradation process, while nitrification and adsorption had no contributions. Adsorption, hydrolysis, nitrification, and COD degradation were the main elimination routes of cefalexin. COD degradation and adsorption were the dominant removal routes of norfloxacin. Tetracycline was mainly removed by the adsorption route, and hydrolysis and oxidation also played a role. For two drugs, ibuprofen was removed mainly via nitrification and COD degradation, and no adsorption occurred. Diclofenac could not be removed at all and was persistent in the aerobic conditions. Kinetic studies showed that biodegradation of the two sulfonamides, cefalexin, norfloxacin, and ibuprofen followed first-order kinetics rather than zero-order or second-order kinetics.

AB Ground water samples collected from the Norman Landfill research site in central Oklahoma were analyzed as part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Toxic Substances Hydrology Program's national reconnaissance of pharmaceuticals. and other organic waste water contaminants (OWCs) in ground water. Five sites, four of which are located downgradient of the landfill, were sampled in 2000 and analyzed for 76 OWCs using four research methods developed by the USGS. OWCs were detected in water samples from all of the sites sampled, with 22 of the 76 OWCs being detected at least once. Cholesterol (a plant and animal steroid), was detected at all five sites and was the only compound detected in a well upgradient of the landfill. N,N-diethyltoluamide (DEET used in insect repellent) and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (fire-retardant) were detected, in water samples from all four sites located within the landfill-derived leachate plume. The sites closest to the landfill had more detections and greater concentrations of each of the detected compounds than sites located farther away. Detection of multiple OWCs occurred in the four sites located within the leachate plume, with a minimum of four and a maximum of 17 OWCs detected. Because the landfill was established in the 1920s and closed in 1985, many compounds detected in the leachate plume were likely disposed of decades ago. These results indicate the potential for long-term persistence and transport of some OWCs in ground water.

AB Amidase, a biocatalyst for the biotransformation of nitrile amides into various commercial carboxylic acids, is used in the pharmaceutical industry, in the chemical industry, and in the treatment of wastewater. It has been observed that the synthesis of amidase enzyme relies on several media compositions. The present study focused on increased synthesis of intracellular amidase from a novel thermotolerant bacteria Bacillus tequilensis by response surface methodology (RSM). RSM with a central composite design (CCD) was used to examine the effect of independent variables (starch, peptone, and mineral base) on response variables. From the RSM model, it was confirmed that the experimental results were appropriate in the statistical model of quadratic polynomial with R-2 values greater than 0.900 for the two responses. An optimized condition consisting of 5.413 g/l starch, 1.113 g/l peptone, and 150 ml/l mineral base respectively was reported for amidase activity. The experimental values of the enzyme activity and biomass production were 8.453 I.U. and 3.213 g/l at optimized conditions. Using the statistical approach, 1.4 times increment on acrylamidase production was observed over the unoptimized experimental values.

AB In this paper, a simple and green method was developed to fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based material with the assistance of caffeic acid (CA). The prepared 3D graphene displayed fast and high sorption for norfloxacin (NOR) and ketoprofen (KP). Their adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 12 h for NOR and KP, which was attributed to their fast diffusion in the porous structure of the 3D graphene. The maximum adsorbed amount of this adsorbent was 220.99 mg/g for NOR and 125.37 mg/g for KP according to the Langmuir model at pH 6.6, 298 K. In the competitive adsorption of six pharmaceuticals, the organic compounds in the form of cations are preferentially adsorbed on the adsorbent. The co-existing organic compounds in the actual wastewater do not seriously inhibit the adsorption of NOR and KP. This study provides the theoretical basis for the facile and low-cost preparation of high-performance 3D graphene adsorbents. The results of this study demonstrate the potential utility of 3D graphene as a very effective adsorbent for pharmaceuticals removal from contaminated water.

AB A microwave (MW) heat-activated the persulfate (PS) process was employed to treat paracetamol (PAM) in wastewater, and the powder-activated carbon (PAC) be used is used as a catalyst to accelerate this reaction process. The PAM added (100 mg) to the solution was nearly completely removed within 70 min, and the PH, temperature, PAC, and PS dosage have great influence on the degradation process; the total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate reached 98%. The PAC(1) still had a good catalytic effect after being reused six times. The radical mechanism was investigated to determine the type of dominant active species involved in PAM degradation. Sulfate radicals (SO4-.) were the dominant oxidizing agent for PAM degradation under acidic conditions. The degradation mechanism was proposed based on the PAM degradation intermediates, which were identified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear trap quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry. Three types of possible reaction pathways for PAM were identified as follows: including hydroxylation of the benzene ring, amine group oxidation at the benzene ring, and amine (HN-C=O) functional group N-C bond cleavage.

AB Changes in the characteristics, removal efficiency, and toxicity of pharmaceutical effluent organic matter (EfOM) after catalytic ozonation were investigated in this study. After a 90-min treatment with a catalytic ozonation process (COP) in the presence of MnO2 ceramsite, the total organic carbon (TOC), UV254, colority, protein, and humic acid removal rates were 13.24%, 60.83%, 85.42%, 29.36% and 74.19%, respectively. The polysaccharide content increased by 12.73 mg/L during the COP for reaction times between 0 and similar to 50 min and decreased by 6.97 mg/L between 50 and similar to 90 min. Furthermore, 64.44% of the total colority was detected in the hydrophobic organic matter (HOM) fraction, and after the COP, and 88.69% of the colority in the HOM was eliminated. Meanwhile, only 59.18% of the colority in the hydrophilic organic matter (HIM) fraction was removed. GC-MS analysis showed that 38 organic pollutant species were completely removed, 8 were partially removed, and 7 were generated. After 90 min of COP treatment, the pharmaceutical EfOM toxicity was effectively reduced based on the higher incubation and lower mortality rates.

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac have been pointed out as important markers for environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals. This study reports on the isolation of bacterial strains capable to degrade these micropollutants from activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). After selective enrichments, one strain able to degrade diclofenac and two strains able to degrade carbamazepine were isolated. The strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Strain Brevibacterium sp. D4 was able to biodegrade 35% of 10 mg L-1 of diclofenac as a sole carbon source; periodic feeding with acetate as a supplementary carbon source resulted in enhancing biodegradation to levels up to 90%, with a concomitant increase of the biodegradation rate. Strains Starkeya sp. C11 and Rhizobium sp. C12 were able to biodegrade 30% of 10 mg L-1 of carbamazepine as a sole carbon source; supplementation with acetate did not improve the biodegradation of carbamazepine by these strains. The activated sludge harboured bacteria capable to degrade the two top priority environmental contaminants and may be potentially useful for biotechnological applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although potential risk of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and trihalomethanes to humans is small or unconfirmed, it is advisable to remove these wastewater-related contaminants to increase public confidence and acceptance as a precautionary principle and consequently their elimination or reduction during drinking water treatment is warranted. Experiments were conducted using the dual train pilot-scale conventional treatment plant with ozone and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) with three different raw water sources. Reductions of trihalomethanes-formation potentials (THM-FPs) were 8-52%. Ozone was found to decrease THM-FPs while UV/H2O2 was found to increase THM-FPs in most of the experiments under experimental conditions. Conventional treatment poorly removed the selected PPCPs and EDCs while ozone + conventional treatment provided excellent removal. Conventional + UV/H2O2 treatment also demonstrated effective removal. However, removal of PPCPs and EDCs by conventional + UV/H2O2 treatment provided lower efficacy for Sites B and C, likely due to the presence of scavengers such as organics, bicarbonates, carbonates and particles.

AB This study investigated the effects of surfactant addition to the draw solution on the performance of osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR). Forward osmosis (FO) tests were conducted with the addition of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), a representative surfactant, to both inorganic and ionic organic draw solutions, including sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium acetate (NaOAc), and sodium propionate (NaPro), to determine the desirable draw solution for OMBR operation. Results show that SDBS impacts were more notable for inorganic draw solution in comparison to its ionic organic counterparts at the same osmotic pressure (60 bar) in FO operation. In specific, SDBS addition up to 5 mM considerably reduced the reverse diffusion of NaCl draw solute (approximately 69.7%) with insignificant impact on water flux. Thus, salinity build-up in the bioreactor could be effectively mitigated when SDBS was added to the NaCl draw solution in OMBR operation. This mitigation led to stable sludge characteristics and biological treatment to sustain OMBR performance regarding water production (approximately 10 L/m(2)h) and contaminant removal (e.g. over 90% for pharmaceutically active compounds).

AB In the present study, sorption of pharmaceuticals ((acetaminophen (ACP), carbamazepine (CBZ)) and personal care products (bisphenol A (BPA), caffeine (CAFF), triclosan (TCS)) using a graphene oxide (GO)-based composite adsorbent was extensively studied. Structural characterization indicated the incorporation of activated carbon and chitosan onto the GO. For both classes of pollutants, the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. On the other hand, the Langmuir isotherm showed a better fit compared to the Freundlich isotherm. Maximum adsorption capacities of ACP, CBZ, BPA, CAFF, and TCS were found to be 13.7, 11.2, 13.2, 14.8, and 14.5 mg/g, respectively. Desorption of ACP, BPA, and CAFF was significantly higher in a polar solvent (70%-80%), whereas CBZ and TCS were able to desorb (60%) in a nonpolar solvent. DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption mechanism is majorly accompanied by size-related diffusion and also a minor contribution by synergetic combination of hydrophobic/hydrophilic, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and pi-pi interactions. Overall, the prepared composite material showed enhanced structural stability along with higher removal characteristics toward multiple emerging contaminants in water and wastewater.

AB A Gram-negative strain DT4, capable of growing aerobically on tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. It was identified as Pseudomonas oleovorans by morphological and physiological characteristics as well as Biolog profiling and 16S rDNA sequence. Cells of P. oleovorans DT4 pre-cultured in THF could degrade 5 mM THF completely without lag phase. The generation time of 2.7 h and the maximum degradation rate of 203.9 mg THF/(h g dry weight) were observed, demonstrating that DT4 bears the highest THF-degrading activity in ever described strains. Furthermore, THF concentration as high as 100 mM was tolerated by the culture. Several important compounds including gamma-butyrrolactone and benzene could be directly metabolized, whereas other pollutants (e.g., tetrahydropyrane) could be cometabolized by DT4. THF removal was achieved in a continuous flow system with the maximum specific growth rate 0.113 h(-1) and half-saturation constant 1.224 mg/L, indicating the great potential of THF bioremediation in future full-scale application.

AB Kinetic studies on the stability of the pain killer paracetamol in Al-Quds activated sludge demonstrated that paracetamol underwent biodegradation within less than one month to furnish p-aminophenol in high yields. Characterizations of bacteria contained in Al-Quds sludge were accomplished. It was found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the bacterium most responsible for the biodegradation of paracetamol to p-aminophenol and hydroquinone. Batch adsorptions of paracetamol and its biodegradation product (p-aminophenol) by activated charcoal and a composite micelle (octadecyltrimethylammonium)-clay (montmorillonite) were determined at 25 degrees C. Adsorption was adequately described by a Langmuir isotherm, and indicated better efficiency of removal by the micelle-clay complex. The ability of bench top reverse osmosis (RO) plant as well as advanced membrane pilot plant to remove paracetamol was also studied at different water matrixes to test the effect of organic matter composition. The results showed that at least 90% rejection was obtained by both plants. In addition, removal of paracetamol from RO brine was investigated by using photocatalytic processes; optimal conditions were found to be acidic or basic pH, in which paracetamol degraded in less than 5min. Toxicity studies indicated that the effluent and brine were not toxic except for using extra low energy membrane which displayed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) value of 80%.

AB A sensitive, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS; 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) was developed. Novel immunizing haptens were synthesized by derivatizing at the 4-Cl position of the TCS molecule. Compounds derived from substitutions at 4'-Cl and that replaced the 2'-OH with a Cl atom were designed as unique coaling antigen haptens. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were screened against the coating antigen library to identify combinations of immunoreagents resulting in the most sensitive assays. The most sensitive assay identified was one utilizing antiserum no. 1155 and a heterologous competitive hapten, where the 2'-OH group was substituted with a Cl atom. An IC50 value and the detection range for TCS in assay buffer were 1.19 and 0.21-6.71 mu g/L, respectively. The assay was selective for TCS, providing low cross-reactivity (<5%) to the major metabolites of TCS and to brominated diphenyl ether-47. A second assay utilizing a competitive hapten containing Br instead of Cl substitutions was broadly selective for both brominated and chlorinated diphenylethers. Using the most sensitive assay combination, we measured TCS concentrations in water samples following dilution. Biosolid samples were analyzed following the dilution of a simple solvent extract. The immunoassay results were similar to those determined by LC-MS/MS. This immunoassay can be used as a rapid and convenient tool to screen for human and environmental exposure.

AB Emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds were detected worldwide in different environmental compartments. Nowadays, multiple studies are focused on the investigation of their environmental fate, as well as to find new, efficient and sustainable removal technologies. Several studies demonstrated that heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the most promising techniques used for water purification. Thus, the aim of our work was to evaluate the photodegradation efficiency of a refractory emergent compound, named clofibric acid, under UV light in aqueous solution. We report that photodegradation and mineralization efficiency are strongly dependent of the catalyst used. Results showed that the photodegradation was enhanced in the presence of TiO2 Aeroxide. The complete elimination was achieved for an initial pollutant concentration of 1.5 mg/L after 30 min of irradiation, the degradation rate following the pseudo-first order kinetics. It was also observed that the rate constant for the photodegradation process is affected by the concentration of catalyst. Process efficiency is enhanced by increasing the light intensity. The simultaneous reduction of pollutant concentration and dissolved organic carbon demonstrates the mineralization of the target molecule. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the addition of nitrate to the system increases the pollutant degradation rate, while the carbonate reduces its removal, suggesting that this last ion can act as a hydroxyl scavenger. Preliminary phytotoxicity tests were also carried out and showed the capacity of the heterogeneous photocatalysis to reduce the toxicity of reaction intermediates generated during the photocatalytic reaction.

The concentrations of total pharmaceuticals in coastal area seawater (mean: 533 ng/L) were higher than those in fish farm seawater (mean: 300 ng/L), while the opposite trend (coastal area: 136 ng/g dry wt < fish farm area; 195 ng/g dry wt) was observed for sediment samples. Regarding cultured fish, the concentration of total pharmaceuticals in fish muscle (mean: 5.08 ng/g wet wt) was lower than that in organs (mean: 14.1 ng/g wet wt). However, not all compounds were present at higher concentrations in organs. Characteristic distribution patterns of pharmaceuticals were observed according to sample types and sampling sites based on the predominance of various antibiotics in fish farms (including cultured fish and feed) and the predominance of pharmaceuticals of terrestrial origin (human and livestock) in coastal areas. Pharmaceuticals used as fish drugs, such as sulfadiazine, erythromycin, and trimethoprim, were commonly detected in fish farm media (seawater, sediment, and cultured fish), which might contaminate fish farm media.

AB The seasonal and spatial variations of 12 selected antibiotics belonging to four groups, including sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides, were investigated in three main tributaries of Liao River in Jilin Province, northeast China. The concentrations of the antibiotics in the surface water and surface sediments were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that oxytetracycline (OTC), erythromycin (ETM), and ofloxacin (OFL) were dominant antibiotics in the water, with mean concentration of 174.9 +/- 266.9, 103.2 +/- 95.5, and 67.1 +/- 77.3 ng/L, respectively, while OFL, OTC, and norfloxacin were prominent antibiotics in sediments, with mean concentration of 152.2 V 108.3, 149.5 +/- 147.6, and 62.8 +/- 83.3 ng/g, respectively. The total antibiotic concentrations in water at each sampling site were 1.2-3 times higher in autumn (November 2015) than those in summer (July 2015), whereas antibiotic concentrations in sediments showed no significant seasonal variation. The highest total antibiotic concentrations in water and sediments were observed around cities with large populations of humans and livestock. Risk assessment based on single antibiotic exposure revealed that OFL, ETM, and OTC were main antibiotics with potential adverse ecological consequences for aquatic organisms. In addition, the mixtures of selected antibiotics posed medium to high risk for aquatic organisms in the Liao River in Jilin Province.

AB An analytical method was developed to analyze eight psychoactive pharmaceuticals-including the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the opiates morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, the opiode tramadol, and the tranquilizers diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam-and the antibiotic sulfa methoxazole as well as three metabolites (10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), 10,11-dihydroxy-10, 11-dihydrocarbamazepine, and N-4-acetylsulfamethoxazole) in river sediments. Relative recoveries of all analytes exceeded 97% using either deuterated or (CN)-C-13-N-15-labeled surrogate standards. Sorption isotherms of all analytes were constructed at pH 6.5-6.6 on two natural river sediments (Burgen and Dausenau) that differed in organic carbon contents and particle size distributions. Affinities of all analytes were up to an order of magnitude higher for the Dausenau sediment in comparison to the Burgen sediment. Isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model. Sorption of all analytes was linear on the Burgen sediment except for structurally similar carbamazepine (n = 0.90) and DHC (n = 0.88). Conversely, most analytes showed pronounced nonlinear sorption to the Dausenau sediment (n = 0.77-0.92) except for positively charged codeine, dihydrocodeine, and tramadol. Linear sorption of the latter was taken to arise from concentration-independent electrostatic interactions of the organocations with negatively charged surfaces on clay minerals or in the sediment organic matter. Desorption gave rise to hysteresis in 13 out of 16 investigated analyte-sorbent systems. Hysteresis was likely due to slow desorption kinetics beyond 24 h used in the experiment.

AB BACKGROUND Non-aqueous biocatalytic system has exhibited advantages including outstanding substrate solubility, facilitation for product purification, suppression of unwanted water-dependent side reactions and rare wastewater discharge. However, limited by enzyme stability, selectivity and cofactor recycling, there has been no successful attempt to use carbonyl reductases in non-aqueous phase. RESULTS In this study, a non-aqueous catalytic system of carbonyl reductase was developed for the first time with a carbonyl reductase-cofactor co-immobilized biocatalyst. Using n-hexane as the reaction medium, the key chiral diol intermediate of the top-selling hypolipidemic drug rosuvastatin, tert-butyl (3R,5S)-6-chloro-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate ((3R,5S)-CDHH) was prepared in a continuous packed-bed bioreactor, with a total yield of 95.51%, enantiomeric excess (e.e.) > 99.5% and diastereomeric excess (d.e.) > 99.5% in a 44-batch reaction. The yield of per unit biocatalyst was 34.42 mg U-1, and the space-time yield was 91.01 g h(-1) L-1. CONCLUSION Our work corroborated the valuable potential of carbonyl reductases in non-aqueous biosynthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

AB The impacts of biofouling on the retention of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by a commercially available nanofiltration membrane (NF 270) were systematically studied. Biofouling was achieved through inoculating live and dead Pseudomonas aeruginosa into artificial wastewater. In comparison to a clean membrane, an increase in PhAC rejection during biofouling with live cells was observed. However, the rejection behaviors presented more complex changes during biofouling with dead cells: PhAC rejection was below the clean membrane in the early biofouling stage; however, in the later stage, PhAC rejection was above the clean membrane. In addition, PhAC rejection behaviors present the similar tendency as salt rejection under both biofouling conditions. In addition, solute rejections were much lower for biofouling with dead cells than those for biofouling with live cells. Combined with biofilm characterization under both biofouling conditions, we could conclude that biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure (BEOP) due to higher cell counts and biofilm thickness led to a decrease in PhAC retention, especially for the dead cells. In addition, more dominant steric exclusion in the later stage of biofouling due to higher extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) concentration on the membrane surface resulted in an increase in PhAC retention.

AB The use of dispersed catalysts in aqueous medium inside reactors in advanced oxidative processes is common among researchers. However, due to the difficult separation of these species after treatment, in many cases, the treatment process is unfeasible. In this context, the main target of the work was the evaluation of degradation of the phenolic solution by ozonation titanium dioxide (TiO2/P25), supported on zeolite spheres. The process was investigated through the response surface methodology (RSM) and optimized by the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm. The effects of various operating parameters including pH, power ozone (O-3) generation, flow rate, and treatment time were investigated, using as a response to removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). It was made in optimum conditions the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand to check the increasing biodegradability, aiming ozonation as preliminary treatment, with the possibility of subsequent biological treatments. There was an increase in this ratio from 0.17 to 0.50 in 48min, which would facilitate the use of the subsequent biological process. The proposed model showed good fit to the experimental data with R-2 andR(adj)(2) correlation coefficients of 0.9964 and 0.9932, respectively.

AB This study offers insight into the roles anodic and cathodic processes play in electrochemically activated persulfate (EAP) and screens EAP as a viable technique for ciprofloxacin degradation in wastewater. Sulfate radical formation at a boron doped diamond (BDD) anode and persulfate activation at a graphite cathode were experimentally elucidated using different electrolytes and electrochemical setups. Rapid ciprofloxacin transformation occurred via pseudo-first-order mechanisms with respect to ciprofloxacin in persulfate electrolyte, reaching 84% removal in 120 min using EAP. Transformation pathways were compared to those in nitrate and sulfate electrolytes. Ciprofloxacin removal rates in the electrochemical system were 88% and 33% faster in persulfate than nitrate and sulfate electrolytes, respectively. Total organic carbon removal rates were 93% and 48% faster in persulfate than nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Use of sulfate electrolyte resulted in removal rates 6-7 times faster than those in nitrate solution. Accelerated removal in sulfate was attributed to anodic sulfate radical formation, while enhanced removal in persulfate was associated with cathodic persulfate activation and nonradical persulfate activation at the BDD anode. Quenching experiments indicated both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals contributed to degradation. Comparisons between platinum and graphite cathodes showed similar cathodic persulfate activation and ciprofloxacin degradation.

AB Adsorption on activated carbon has been successfully used in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants for the removal of various pollutants. Among them, pharmaceutical compounds have become a growing issue. The present study has focused on levodopa molecule, which is one of the drugs used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The adsorption of levodopa onto three activated carbons from different source materials is reported for the first time and analyzed according to both textural and surface chemical properties of the carbons.
   The activated carbons are characterized using low temperature nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetry analysis and Boehm titration. The equilibrium isotherms are measured at 25 degrees C and five models (Langmuir, Jovanovic, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Khan) are evaluated to fit the experimental data. The characteristic parameters of each isotherm model are optimized and the selection of the most adequate one is performed using statistical regression criteria. For two of the studied carbons the adsorption process can be well described by Freundlich model with an average relative error of 5%, while for the last carbon only three-parameter models gives good fitting.

AB The contamination of the environment with anticancer drugs, which show recalcitrance to conventional wastewater treatment, has become a significant ecological threat. Fungi represent a promising non-conventional biological alternative for water conditioning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of five white-rot fungi (Fomes fomentarius (CB13), Hypholoma fasciculare (CB15), Phyllotopsis nidulans (CB14), Pleurotus ostreatus (BWPH) and Trametes versicolor (CB8)) in the removal of bleomycin and vincristine. The removal capacity was measured at 0, 4, 9, and 14 days of incubation using SPE-UPLC-MS. The enzymatic profiles of laccase, manganese, and lignin peroxidases and wide range of ecoand cytotoxicity, assays of the post-process samples were also conducted. We observed >94% vincristine elimination by F. fomentarius, H. fasciculare and T. versicolor after only 4 days. Bleomycin removal occurred after a minimum of 9 days and only when the drug was incubated with T. versicolor (36%) and H. fasciculare (25%). The removal of both cytostatics was associated with laccase production, and the loss of ecoand cytotoxicity, especially in regard to viability of Lemna minor and Daphnia magna, as well as fibroblasts morphology.

AB There is growing interest in determining the unidentified peaks within a sample spectra besides the analytes of interest. Availability of reference standards and hyphenated instruments has been a key and limiting factor in the rapid determination of emerging pollutants in the environment. In this work, polar compounds were silylated and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the abundant fragments within the single ion monitoring (SIM) mode and methodology. Detection limits and recoveries of the compounds were established in river water, wastewater, biosolid and sediment matrices. Then, specific types of polar compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the environment were targeted in the Mgeni and Msunduzi Rivers. We also performed suspect and non-target analysis screening to identify several other polar compounds in these rivers. A total of 12 compounds were quantified out of approximately 50 detected emerging contaminants in the Mgeni and Msunduzi Rivers. This study is significant for Africa, where the studies of emerging contaminants are limited and not usually prioritized.

AB Loratadine and desloratadine are second-generation antihistaminic drugs. Because of human administration, they are continuously released via excreta into wastewater treatment plants and occur in surface waters as residues and transformation products (TPs).
   Loratadine and desloratadine residues have been found at very low concentrations (ng/L) in the aquatic environment but their toxic effects are still not well known. Both drugs are light-sensitive even under environmentally simulated conditions and some of the photoproducts have been isolated and characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute and chronic ecotoxicity of loratadine, desloratadine and their light-induced transformation products in organisms of the aquatic trophic chain. Bioassays were performed in the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and in two crustaceans, Thamnocephalus platyurus and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Loratadine exerted its acute and chronic toxicity especially on Ceriodaphnia dubia (LC50: 600 mu g/L, EC50: 28.14 mu g/L) while desloratadine showed similar acute toxicity among the organisms tested and it was the most chronically effective compound in Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Generally, transformation products were less active in both acute and chronic assays.

AB It is a great challenge to realize the effective removal and transform of emerging pharmaceuticals from aquatic environment. In this study, MnO2 was used as a catalyst to achieve the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in situ on the surface of three-dimensional graphene (3DG). The removal of TC were also evaluated at different temperature, pH and inorganic ions. Due to the synergistic effect of 3DG and MnO2, TC could be efficiently removed by 3DG/MnO2 composites. The removal data were fitted well with rate-retarded model, indicating that the adsorption of reaction products on the surface of 3DG/MnO2 composites could lead to saturation of surface and less reactive sites. Moreover, the reaction of TC with 3DG/MnO2 was endothermic, and reaction rate decreased with the increase of pH, due to the changes of properties of 3DG/MnO2 and TC. Inorganic ions could compete with TC for vacancy or the reactive sites on 3DG/MnO2 surface to inhibit the removal of TC. This work develops a potentially effective carbon material for simultaneous enrichment and degradation of organic pollutants and provides a new sustainable approach for wastewater treatment.

AB Trimethoprim is one of the representative drugs within the pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) group. The photo-Fenton oxidation technology was used to degrade trimethoprim in wastewater and the extent of degradation was analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography, then experimentally obtained the optimal conditions. Analysis of the experimental data showed that, under the single-factor experimental conditions, the optimal conditions for degradation were a pH of 4, an H2O2 concentration of 3.0 mmol/L, an FeSO4 concentration of 0.06 mmol/L, an initial trimethoprim concentration of 0.0689 mmol/L, and an ultraviolet (UV) intensity (UVA) of 12 mW/cm(2). The interaction of pH and the concentration of H2O2 and Fe2+ have been further explored, it was obtained the following response surface results through the central composite design experiment: pH = 4.56, H2O2 concentration = 0.09 mmol/L, and Fe2+ concentration = 0.09 mmol/L. Under these conditions, it can be obtained a degradation rate of 99.95% after 6 min. There were similar results for three sets of parallel experiments, indicating that these simulation conditions were feasible.

AB Waters released from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a relevant source of pharmaceuticals and personal care products to the aquatic environment, since many of them are not effectively removed by the treatment systems. The consumption of these products increased in the last decades and concerns have consequently risen about their possible adverse effects on the freshwater ecosystem. In this study, we present a simple, yet effective, analytical model of transport of contaminants released in surface waters by WWTPs. Transport of dissolved species is modeled by solving the advection dispersion reaction equation (ADRE) along the river network by using a Lagrangian approach. We applied this model to concentration data of five pharmaceuticals, diclofenac, ketoprofen, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and irbesartan, collected during two field campaigns, conducted in February and July 2015 in the Adige River, northeastern Italy. The model showed a good agreement with measurements and the successive application at the monthly timescale highlighted significant variations of the load due to the interplay between streamflow seasonality and variation of the anthropogenic pressure, chiefly due to the variability of touristic fluxes. Since the data required by the model are widely available, our model is suitable for large-scale applications.

AB In this study, an air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) system at pilot scale is applied for purification of effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A district heating network (DHN) is considered as a heat source for the membrane distillation system. Removal performance of pharmaceutical residuals, specific heat demand, and economic assessments were analyzed on the membrane distillation plant. Almost all targeted pharmaceutical compounds were removed to a very high degree, often below the method detection limit. The heat requirement for the MD process could be sufficiently supplied by the low-temperature district heating return line. Specific heat demands for the AGMD ranges from 692 to 875 kWh/m3 without heat recovery and as low as 105 kWh/m3 when heat recovery is possible. Different approaches to integrating the MD within the DHN system were analyzed; the advantages and shortcomings of each are discussed with emphasis on the MD system's capacity requirement and annual heat demand. The thermoeconomic analyses from this study presented the potential for energy optimization regarding heat recovery and module design improvement of the current MD equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, the toxicity of 11 products (three brands of mouthwash, three toothpastes, three detergents and two analgesics) was evaluated in relation to juvenile snails Physa acuta (Draparnaud, 1805). Bioassays of toxicity were conducted and the organisms exposed to six concentrations of each product, along with a control group, to determine the 96-hour LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50). The sensitivity of the gastropods to the different products was determined by comparing their LC50 values to that of acute toxicity values. In addition, the degree of lipoperoxidation in the gastropod tissue was evaluated by measuring the concentration of MDA (malondialdehyde) in sublethal tests (LC10) for chronic toxicity (during 30-day exposure). The toxicity of the products tested varied from highly toxic and harmful (mouthwashes) through harmful (detergents), potentially harmful (analgesics), and non-toxic (toothpastes). The degree of lipoperoxidation observed in the sublethal tests was (from most to least toxic): Analgesics > Mouthwashes > Detergents > Toothpastes. These results indicate that a certain risk exists resulting from the presence in wastewater dumped into aquatic systems of components of these products which may cause adverse effects on populations of P. acuta and other aquatic organisms.

AB Aqueous solutions of mixtures of four pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacin and trimethoprim) both in Milli-Q ultrapure water and in a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant have been treated at pH 7 by different oxidation methods, such as conventional ozonation, photolytic ozonation, TiO2 catalytic ozonation, TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation and TiO2 photocatalytic ozonation. Experiments were carried out using a solar compound parabolic concentrator. The performance results have been compared in terms of removal of emerging contaminants (ECs), generation rate of phenolic intermediates, organic matter mineralization, ecotoxicity removal and enhancement of biodegradability. Also, the consumption of ozone to achieve certain treatment goals (95% removal of ECs and 40% mineralization) is discussed. Results reveal that solar photocatalytic ozonation is a promising oxidation method as it led to the best results in terms of EC mineralization (similar to 85%), toxicity removal (similar to 90%) and efficient use of ozone (similar to 2 mg O-3 mg EC-1 to achieve complete EC removal and similar to 18 mg O-3 mg TOC-1 to achieve 40% EC mineralization, respectively).

AB A new sorbent was prepared by loading rhodamine B on Amberlite IR-120. Various physico-chemical parameters such as effects of adsorbate concentration, contact time, pH, and temperature on the sorption of the dye have been studied. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) were also evaluated for the sorption of dye. Kinetic studies revealed that the sorption of the dye was best fit for pseudo-second-order kinetic. The metal ion uptake in different solvent systems has been explored through column studies. On the basis of distribution coefficient (K-d), some heavy metal ions of analytical interest from binary mixtures have been separated. The limit of detection (LOD) for the Ni2+ and Fe3+ metal ions was 0.81 and 0.60 mu gL(-1), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 2.72 and 2.0 mu gL(-1). This sorbent has also been successfully applied in the analysis of multivitamin formulation. The applicability of the modified resin in the separation of heavy metals constituting real and synthetic samples has been explored.

AB Pharmaceuticals are important environmental stressors since they have a worldwide use; they are usually released in the aquatic compartment without adequate treatment, and because of their intrinsic properties, they may affect several non-target organisms. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active substance of aspirin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, being one of the most widely prescribed analgesics in human medical care. Consequently, this compound is systematically reported to occur in the wild, where it may exert toxic effects on non-target species, which are mostly uncharacterized so far. The objective of the present work was to assess the acute and chronic effects of ASA on selected oxidative stress biomarkers [catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST)], lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance), and histological alterations in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor (Annelida: Polychaeta). The obtained data showed that ASA is not exempt of toxicity, since it was responsible for significant, albeit transient, changes in biomarkers related to the redox status of the organisms, occurring as an increase in the activity of catalase in the individuals exposed acutely to ASA. Chronic exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of this drug showed to be mostly ineffective in promoting any significant biochemical alteration in H. diversicolor. However, histochemical observations revealed proliferation of mucous cells in the tegument of chronically exposed individuals to ASA.

AB Toxicity in natural ecosystems is usually not due to exposure to a single substance, but is rather the result of exposure to mixtures of toxic substances. Knowing the effects of contaminants as a mixture compared to their effects in isolated form is therefore important. This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced by binary mixtures of diclofenac with paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid and by these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in isolated form, using Hyalella azteca as a bioindicator. The median lethal concentration (LC50) and the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of each NSAID were obtained. Amphipods were exposed for 72 h to the latter value in isolated form and as binary mixtures. The following biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and activity of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Significant increases in LPX and PCC with respect to the control group (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) were induced by NSAIDs both in isolated form and as binary mixtures. Changes in SOD, CAT, and GPx activity likewise occurred with NSAIDs in isolated form and as binary mixtures. In conclusion, NSAIDs used in this study induce oxidative stress on H. azteca both in isolated form and as binary mixtures, and the interactions occurring between these pharmaceuticals are probably antagonistic in type.

AB Estrogenic compounds in drinking water sources pose potential threats to human health. Treatment technologies are needed to effectively remove these compounds for the production of safe drinking water. In this study, GAC adsorption was first tested for its ability to remove a model estrogenic compound, 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Although GAC showed a relatively high adsorption capacity for E2 in isotherm experiments, it appeared to have a long mass transfer zone in a GAC column reactor, causing an early leakage of E2 in the effluent. With an influent E2 concentration of 20 mu g/L, the GAC reactor was able to bring down effluent E2 to similar to 200 ng/L. To further enhance E2 removal, the GAC reactor was converted to a biologically active carbon (BAC) reactor by promoting biofilm growth in the reactor. Under optimal operating conditions, the BAC reactor had an effluent E2 concentration of similar to 50 ng/L. With the empty bed contact times tested, the reactor exhibited more robust E2 removal performance under the BAC operation than under the GAC operation. It is noted that estrone (E1), an E2 biodegradation intermediate, was frequently detected in reactor effluent during the BAC operation. Results from this study suggested that BAC could be an effective drinking water treatment process for E2 removal and in the meantime El accumulation needs to be addressed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This is a comprehensive study of the occurrence of antibiotics, hormones and other pharmaceuticals in water sites that have major potential for downstream environmental contamination. These include residential (hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and regional discharges), industrial (pharmaceutical production facilities), and agricultural (animal husbandries and aquacultures) waste streams. We assayed 23 Taiwanese water sites for 97 targeted compounds, of which a significant number were detected and quantified. The most frequently detected compounds were sulfamethoxazole, caffeine, acetaminophen. and ibuprofen, followed closely by cephalexin, ofloxacin, and diclofenac, which were detected in > 91% of samples and found to have median (maximum) concentrations of 0.2 (5.8), 0.39 (24.0), 0.02 (100.4). 0.41 (14.5), 0.15 (31.4), 0.14 (13.6) and 0.083 (29.8) mu g/L, respectively. Lincomycin and acetaminophen had high measured concentrations (> 100 mu g/L), and 35 other pharmaceuticals occurred at the mu g/L level. These incidence and concentration results correlate well with published data for other worldwide locations, as well as with Taiwanese medication usage data, suggesting a human contamination source. Many pharmaceuticals also occurred at levels exceeding predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC), warranting further investigation of their occurrence and fate in receiving waters, as well as the overall risks they pose for local ecosystems and human residents. The information provided here will also be useful for development of strategies for regulation and remediation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Guanylurea is the main transformation product of the antidiabetic drug metformin, which is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals worldwide. Due to the high rate of microbial degradation of metformin in sewage treatment plants, guanylurea occurs in higher concentrations in surface waters than its parent compound and could therefore affect aquatic wildlife. In this context, data for fish are scarce up to now which made us investigate the health of brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) in response to guanylurea.
   Methods. In two experiments, eggs plus developing larvae and juvenile brown trout were exposed to three different concentrations of guanylurea (10, 100 and 1,000 m g/L) and, as a negative control, filtered tap water without this compound. Low internal concentrations were determined. The investigated parameters were mortality, length, weight, condition factor, tissue integrity of the liver and kidney, levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides, as well as behavioural and developmental endpoints. It was found that guanylurea did not significantly change any of these parameters in the tested concentration range.
   Results. In conclusion, these results do not give rise to concern that guanylurea could negatively affect the health or the development of brown trout under field conditions. Nevertheless, more studies focusing on further parameters and other species are highly needed for a more profound environmental risk assessment of guanylurea.

AB Widespread use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in mixture concentrations ranging from mg/L in effluent to mu g/L concentrations in surface water. In a 2008 study, 13 pharmaceuticals, ranging in amounts from 0.0028 to 0.1757 mu g/l, were identified in the Tennessee River, USA and its tributaries. In order to address the need for risk assessment of environmentally relevant pharmaceutical mixtures, Daphnia magna 21-d life cycle tests were performed on a mixture of 11 of the 13 pharmaceuticals as well as on the individual components of the mixture. Mixture exposures were based on the same initial ratios of individual compounds, up to 1000x the initial mixture concentrations. The endpoints of mortality, time to first brood, size, and fecundity were assessed. The LOEC of the 11-pharmaceutical mixture was determined to be 100x greater than the measured mixture concentration detected in the Tennessee River, with the NOEC being 75x that of the measured mixture. Single concentrations of pharmaceuticals within the mixture up to the 100x LOEC were not statistically different from control for any of the assessed endpoints. Thus, no single pharmaceutical was deemed predominately responsible for the mixture toxicity at the concentrations tested. While mixtures of pharmaceuticals are common in many systems, based on the findings of the present study, they may not pose a significant acute or chronic hazard to aquatic invertebrates at current concentrations.

AB Background: Over recent years, a global increase in the use of pharmaceutical products has been observed. EU directives state that "Member states shall ensure that appropriate collection systems are in place for medicinal products that are unused or have expired" (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/27/EC).
   Objectives: There is no published data on how people in Ireland dispose of unused medicines; therefore the purpose of this study is to establish baseline information on storage and disposal of medicines.
   Design: Data was collected over two 2-week periods a year apart. People in the streets of Galway and Cork were approached randomly and invited to participate by filling out a questionnaire.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 398 individuals (207 in Galway and 191 in Cork). Unused medicines were kept in the home by 88% of the respondents. The most cited reason for keeping unused medicines was "in case they are needed later" (68%). Of the respondents who had disposed of medicine in the past, 72% had done so inappropriately. Environmentally inappropriate disposal methods were through general waste disposal and via the sewage system. Interestingly, of the people who had received advice on disposal practices from a healthcare professional, 75% disposed of their medicine appropriately.
   Conclusions: There is little awareness among members of the public regarding appropriate ways to dispose of unused medicines. Our findings suggest that effective communication and established protocols will promote appropriate disposal practices. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Namibia is a semi-arid to arid country and has most of its surface water in dams built on ephemeral rivers. Whilst water quality is often measured in terms of bacterial contamination and general physico-chemical characteristics, this study extends water quality assessment to include steroid hormone presence and potential physiological toxicity. This is the first study to determine these parameters in dams in Namibia at various stages of the seasons. Seven bioassays were used to determine oestradiol (E-2), oestrone (E-1) and testosterone (T) concentrations, as well as neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity, in water sampled during 2010 and 2011. Oestradiol and E-1 concentrations of up to 7.2 pg ml(-1) and 7.6 pg ml(-1), respectively, were recorded. Testosterone concentrations measured up to 19 pg ml(-1). No cytotoxic effects were detected, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assays indicated low neurotoxic effects in Goreangab Dam (18% AChE inhibition) and no neurotoxic effects in other samples. The immune system biomarker interleukin-6 was high in all samples (457 pg ml(-1); SD 54), with interleukin-10 being high only at Avis (46 pg ml(-1)), Goreangab (74 pg ml(-1)) and Swakoppoort (81 pg ml(-1)) dams. The results suggest that water from Goreangab and Swakoppoort dams may have the potential to modulate endocrine systems, and shows physiological toxicity.

ID PHARMACEUTICALS
AB This paper describes research undertaken to develop an approach for facilitating an initial hazard assessment and risk characterisation for a proposed indirect potable reuse scheme, as part of the water safety plan recommended by the World Health Organization. The process involved a description and evaluation of the catchment, which was the sewerage system supplying the sewage treatment works that would provide the effluent to supply the pilot scale indirect potable reuse water treatment plant. Hazards, sources and barriers throughout the proposed system were identified and evaluated. An initial assessment of the possible hazards, highlighted chemical hazards as predominating, and assessment of risks, using a heat map as output, categorised most hazards as medium or high risk. However, this outcome has been influenced by a precautionary approach which assigned a high likelihood to the occurrence of hazards where no data was available on their occurrence in the system. As more data becomes available, and the waster safety plan develops, it is anticipated that the risk heat map will become more specific. Additionally, high quality targets, to drinking water standards, have been set, although water from the potable reuse plant will be discharged to receiving waters where it will undergo natural attenuation prior to further treatment to potable standards before distribution. The assessment has demonstrated the usefulness of the approach where data is initially limited, in generating a heat map allowing for prioritisation of hazards to a practical level.

AB The residues of active pharmaceutical ingredients present risk to the environment and can cause health problems. In this study, the toxicities of flurbiprofen, naproxen Na, propranolol HCl, and carbamazepine, all of which belong to the most frequently used analgesic, beta-blocker, and antiepileptic drugs, were investigated. Toxicity tests were conducted using a watercress (Lepidium sativum), a freshwater invertebrate (Daphnia magna), and a luminescent bacterium (Aliivibrio fischeri). The various biological test methods used in this study were compared in terms of the sensitivity of these species to the drugs tested. When the three toxicity-test results were analyzed, different sensitivities were determined in the synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater samples that had different characteristics. In general, D. magna was the most sensitive among the test organisms, A. fischeri was the second most sensitive, and L. sativum was the least sensitive. The results showed that all four micropollutants were capable of causing toxicity in luminescent bacteria, a freshwater invertebrate and in watercress with a 50% effective concentration of similar to 1.9 to 50 mg/L. In particular, "flurbiprofen" had a more toxic effect than the substances in all the toxicity tests.

AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) can be activated by various catalysts to degrade organic contaminants in wastewater treatment processes. In this research, the co-activation of PMS by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbonate is investigated. The results show that SMX can be degraded in situ, and the main reactive oxygen species are singlet oxygen and carbonate radicals. Only singlet oxygen is detected when SMX is degraded by PMS without carbonate. However, both carbonate radicals and hydroxyl radicals are measured in the presence of carbonate. Among which, hydroxyl radicals are identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy method, and carbonate radicals are confirmed by radical quenching experiments, as well as the variation of SMX degradation kinetic and the appreance of carbonyldioxy derivatives by-products in the presence of carbonate anions. Based on this phenomenon, it is proposed that carbonate can enhance the decomposition of PMS and the generation of secondary free radicals (carbonate radicals). Thus carbonate radicals can enhance the oxidizability for sulfonamide antibiotics in the PMS-based advanced oxidation systems. These results suggest that the addition of carbonate is an important enhancement method for the treatment of sulfonamide antibiotics in water.

AB Losartan is a highly consumed antihypertensive worldwide and commonly found in effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants. In the environment, losartan can promote harmful effects on organisms. Thus, an option to face this pollutant is the treatment by photochemical advanced oxidation processes. This dataset has two main components: 1) theoretical calculations on reactivity indexes for losartan, and 2) degradation of the pollutant throughout TiO2-photocatalysis and UVC/persulfate (UVC/PS). The first part of the work presents the data about HOMO and LUMO energies, optimized geometry, dipolar moment, HOMO/LUMO energy gap and total density distribution, in addition to ionization energy, electron affinity, chemical potential, hardness, softness and electrophilicity for losartan. Meanwhile, the second one depicts information on the routes involved in the degradation of the pharmaceutical by the oxidation processes, mineralization, toxicity evolution and losartan removal from a complex matrix (synthetic fresh urine). The data reported herein may be utilized for further researches related to elimination of pharmaceuticals in primary pollution sources such as urine. Moreover, this work also provides experimental and theoretical data useful for the understanding of the response of losartan to oxidative and photochemical processes. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB In this work we evaluated the contamination of the water cycle in Como Bay by measuring 38 selected pharmaceuticals in two main wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland and in Italy, two influents (River Breggia and Cosia), lake water (epilimnion and hypolimnion), as well as potable water. The collection of comparative information on the presence and environmental fate of these substances contributes to set specific environmental quality standard (EQS). The results presented show that the contamination of the lake reflects national health policies, which deeply influence the usage of chemicals. The outcomes of this study give an overall picture of contamination in the area, showing that concentrations of the measured compounds are generally low and under the commonly adopted ecotoxicological and toxicological thresholds. Only in a few cases did the contamination appear to be noteworthy, for some of the most persistent compounds (antibiotic macrolides, diclofenac, irbesartan, carbamazepine and dihydrocarbamazepine, bezafibrate, furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide). Some concern can be also be raised for the presence of antibiotics (clarithromycin) in drinking water, although at very low levels, due to the problem of antibiotic resistance.

AB An enrichment process was employed by applying high ibuprofen concentration in an immobilized cell bioreactor in order to favor the ibuprofen-degrading community present in activated sludge. Experimental data showed the ability of the immobilized cell bioreactor to achieve high ibuprofen removal efficiencies (98.4 +/- 0.3%), the tendency of the enriched biomass to acidify the treated liquor, and the inhibition of the nitrification process. Illumina sequencing revealed a massive increase in the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (from 29.1 to 80.8%) and a dramatic decrease in the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia (from 42.7 to 2.1%) when pure ibuprofen served as the sole carbonaceous feeding substrate. This shift in the feeding conditions resulted in the predominance of Novosphingobium and Rhodanobacter (25.5 +/- 10.8% and 25.2 +/- 3.0%, respectively) and demonstrated a specialized ibuprofen-degrading bacterial community in activated sludge, which possessed the selective advantage to cope with its degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this bioreactor system was capable of effectively treating the highest ibuprofen concentration applied in wastewater treatment plants.

AB In-sewer stability of illicit drug biomarkers has been evaluated by several reactor-based studies, but less has been done in sewer pipes. Experiments conducted in sewer pipes have advantages over lab-scale reactors in providing more realistic biomarker stability due to the flow and biological dynamics. This study assessed the transportation and transformation of seven illicit drug biomarker compounds in a pilot-scale rising main and a gravity sewer pipe. Biomarkers presented diverse stability patterns in the pilot sewers, based on which a drug transformation model was calibrated. This model was subsequently validated using transformation data sets from the literature, aiming to demonstrate the predictability of the pilot-based transformation coefficients under varying sewer conditions. Furthermore, transformation coefficients for five investigated biomarkers were generated from four studies, and their prediction capabilities under the pilot-sewer conditions were jointly assessed using performance statistics. The transformation model was successful in simulating the in-sewer stability for most illicit drugs. However, further study is required to delineate the sources and pathways for those compounds with potential formations to be simulated in the transformation model. Overall, the transformation model calibrated using the pilot-sewer data is a credible tool for the application of wastewater-based epidemiology.

AB The possibility of removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions was examined using ibuprofen (Ibu) oxidation as an example, using in situ electrochemically synthesized ferrate(VI), a strong oxidant and coagulant, with forming of non-harmful byproducts. A solution of ibuprofen of 206 mg/L in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution was treated with different amounts of fresh, electrochemically synthesized ferrate(VI). The changes of ibuprofen concentration in samples were determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The extent of mineralization was estimated using the changes in chemical oxygen demand (COD) values and total organic carbon (TOC) values of test samples. The largest reduction of the concentration of Ibu (41.75%) was obtained by adding 69.2 mg/L ferrate(VI) as Fe (Ibu: Fe = 1: 0.34). An effective removal of ibuprofen from aqueous solutions was recorded up to 68% and it can be done by using ferrate(VI) in the ratio Ibu: Fe = 1: 3 as Fe. The possibility of ibuprofen removal by ferrate(VI) was confirmed by COD and TOC results, which demonstrated reduction up to 65% and 63.6%, respectively.

AB A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation efficiency and treatment cost of 17 beta-estradiol using coagulation, adsorption, and advanced oxidation processes. The results show that granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption collocated Ultraviolet C (UVC)/H2O2 shows the best 17 beta-estradiol (E2) removal. The E2 concentration of effluent water cannot be detected by instrument after one hour reaction. GAC adsorption collocated Ultraviolet A (UVA)/TiO2 after one hour reaction degraded 92% of E2. Adsorption plays the main role in the removal efficiency above. The ultraviolet light (UV)/H2O2 oxidation program requires the least cost and has the best removal rate compared with other single processes. In economic assessment, a unit gram of E2 could be removed for as low as 53 U.S. dollar cost. GAC adsorption collocated UVC/H2O2 could completely removal E2 in water. It costs 76 U.S. dollar to treat one gram E2. The studies provide important information about E2 degradation and compare the technical development for E2 removal. Most importantly, this study provides information of process efficiency and cost for industrial application to contribute to the removal of E2 and industrial application.

AB Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) were used for the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in aqueous solution. The electric discharge was generated either ex situ or in situ directly on the water surface. To maintain the same ozone concentration of 40 ppm in both instances, the power injected was 0.7W in the ex situ discharge and 12W in the in situ discharge. The results showed 100% CBZ removal after 3 min of treatment with the ex situ discharge, while the in situ discharge only removed 81% of the CBZ after 60 min. According to measurements of UV absorbance at 285 nm and 254 nm. and of total organic carbon, the ex situ discharge system also proved to be more effective than the in situ system. The measurement of nitrogen oxides in both gaseous and liquid phases indicated that high energy in situ discharges produced a large amount of NOx. These species contributed to decreased pH and significantly slowed the CBZ oxidation rate, due to their competition with ozone. Production of NOx should be avoided when using the DBD technique for wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results show that the combined system with 2-day HRT had better treatment efficiency in terms of treated water quality than that obtained with 0.5-day HRT. The combined system effectively decreased the monitored water quality parameters; the removal percentages increased with increasing quantity of photocatalyst. Compared with constructed wetland treatment alone, the combined system improves the treatment efficiency of polluted water. An evaluation of the possibility of using the treated water for reclamation found that only the combined system effectively removed both trihalomethane (THM) and six haloacetic acid (HAA6) precursors, which decreased their formation to levels that meet the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) of drinking water. The proposed system is thus suitable for treating agricultural and domestic wastewater for water reclamation with low operating and maintenance costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to identify commercial pharmaceuticals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (P&B) and that were not being considered in current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. We developed a database of 3193 pharmaceuticals from two U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases and some lists of top ranked or selling drugs. Of the 3193 pharmaceuticals, 275 pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment and 399 pharmaceuticals were, based upon production volumes, designated as high production volume (HPV) pharmaceuticals. All pharmaceuticals that had reported chemical structures were evaluated for potential bioaccumulation (B) or persistence (P) using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) or scientific judgment. Of the 275 drugs detected in the environment, 92 were rated as potentially bioaccumulative, 121 were rated as potentially persistent, and 99 were HPV pharmaceuticals. After removing the 275 pharmaceuticals previously detected in the environment, 58 HPV compounds were identified that were both P&B and 48 were identified as P only. Of the non-HPV compounds, 364 pharmaceuticals were identified that were P&B. This study has yielded some interesting and probable P&B pharmaceuticals that should be considered for further study.

AB The biotransformation of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBF) was studied by exposing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to IBF via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, and via water at four (0.17, 1.9, 13 and 145 mu g L-1) exposure levels for 4 d. Following exposure, the bile was collected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS methods. The identification of the formed metabolites in i.p. injected fish bile was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer (Q-TOF-MS) and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by ion trap mass analyzer (IT-MS). In addition to unmetabolized IBF, several phase I and phase II metabolites were found in the bile. The main metabolites were acyl glucuronides and taurine conjugates of IBF and of hydroxylated IBFs. The bioconcentration factors (BCFbile), defined as the ratio of the sum of IBF and its metabolites in fish bile to the concentration of IBF in water, was determined following enzymatic deconjugation and was found to range from 14000 to 49000. The highest BCFbile was found at the lowest exposure concentration (0.17 mu g L-1). The results show that rainbow trout has a high capacity for biotransformation of IBF, and the exposure of fish to sub mu g L-1 concentrations of IBF can be determined by the analyses of the biliary metabolites of the compound.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are of growing interest as a result of continuous occurrence through human into municipal wastewater without adequate treatment. Green methods are needed to overcome this problem without adverse impact on the environment. In this work, modified nanobiopolymers have been dedicated to solve this problem. Accordingly, modified chitosan with nanosilica is proposed to mediate ibuprofen. Spectroscopic analysis was carried outbased on both experimental techniques such as FTIR spectrophotometry and theoretical approach represented in semiemprical calculations. QSAR descriptors were also conducted in order to quantify biological activities of both structures. Results of FTIR ensure that chitosan can be modified using silica through the formation of both chemical and physical bonds. Furthermore, FTIR shows that spectra of chitosansilica after interaction with ibuprofen suffers from a general reduction in all of its peaks and shifting in many bands. Significant reduction in bands of -NH bending and -CH stretching proposed that chitosan may interact with ibuprofen through electrostatic and hydrophobic mechanisms. PM6 calculations illustrate that amine group of modified chitosan is the most probable active site for interaction either in the complex or adsorb forms. The calculated vibrational frequencies ensure that the calculated structures correspond to minimum energy structures.

AB CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microsphere with excellent and stable photocatalytic activity for degradation tetracyclines was successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal route. The photocatalytic experiments indicated that CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microspheres exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to pure Bi2WO6 in both the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. The 1CeO(2)/2Bi(2)WO(6) exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for degradation of TCH, reaching 91% after 60 min reaction. The results suggested that the particular morphological conformation of the microspheres resulted in smaller size and more uniform morphology so as to increase the specific surface area. Meanwhile, the heterojunction was formed by coupling CeO2 and Bi2WO6 in the as-prepared microspheres, so that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes was dramatically improved and the lifetimes of charge carriers were prolonged. Hence, introduction of CeO2 could significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microspheres and facilitate the degradation of TCH. This work provided not only a principle method to synthesize CeO2/Bi2WO6 with the excellent photocatalytic performance for actual produce, but also a excellent property of the photocatalyst for potential application in photocatalytic treatment of tetracyclines wastewater from pharmaceutical factory.

AB In this study, microbial community dynamics were assessed in two lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs). One of the reactors was fed by synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewater with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as the test reactor and the other without sulfamethoxazole as the control reactor. DNA based DGGE results indicated that Clostiridum sp. became dominant in the SMX reactor while the inoculum was dominated with Firmicutes (61%) and Methanomicrobiales (28%). However their abundances in active community decreased through the last phase. Also the abundance of hydro-genotrophs was high in each phase, while acetoclastic methanogens disappeared in the last phase. Q-PCR analysis revealed that there is a significant reduction in the bacterial community approximately 84%, while methanogens increased to 97% through the operation. Additionally an increase in the expression level of bacterial and methanogenic 16S rRNA (60% and 20%, respectively) was detected. Significant correlation between microbial community and the reactor operation data was found. The study demonstrated that the microbial community maintains the system stability under high antibiotic concentration and long-term operation by homoacetogenesis coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.

AB Letrozole (LET) is a triazole-containing drug that can inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 aromatase. It is an environmentally emerging pollutant because of its broad use in medicine and frequent occurrence in aquifers receiving the effluent of municipal or hospital wastewater. However, the toxic impact of LET on fish populations remains unclear. We exposed medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) at an early stage of sexual development to a continuous chronic LET at environmentally relevant concentrations and assessed the endocrine disruption effects in adulthood and the next generation. LET exposure at an early life stage persistently altered phenotypic sex development and reproduction in adults and skewed the sex ratio in progeny. As well, LET exposure led to a gender-different endocrine disruption as seen by the interruption in gene expression responsible for estrogen synthesis and metabolism and fish reproduction. LET interfering with the aromatase system in early life stages of medaka can disrupt hormone homeostasis and reproduction. This potent aromatase inhibitor has potential ecotoxicological impact on fish populations in aquatic environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The anti-microbial agent triclosan (TCS), and its derivative methyl-triclosan (Me-TCS), are discharged with treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants to receiving environments. We investigated the bioconcentration of TCS and Me-TCS in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to TCS (100 ng L-1) for 30 days in seawater aquaria (19 +/- 2 degrees C) with fresh phytoplankton as a food source. Bioconcentration increased with time reaching a steady-state around 24-30 days. The bioconcentration factor (log BCF) for TCS were 2.81 L kg-1 (dry weight) and 4.13 L kg(-1), when lipid normalised concentrations were used. Mussels were also deployed in cages at four marine locations receiving effluents from WWTPs. The mean ( SD) TCS and Me-TCS concentrations for mussels from these sites were 9.87 ( +/- 1.34) and 6.99 ( +/- 2.44) mu g kg(-1). The study showed that mussels can be a useful tool for monitoring pollution of TCS and Me-TCS in marine and estuarine environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Owing to high levels of residual antibiotics, antibiotic manufacturing waste is hazardous to the environment. As a result, such wastes are usually treated by expensive incineration. The high organic content of antibiotic manufacturing biowaste suggests its feasibility for anaerobic treatment, but the presence of ammonia and antibiotics in the waste may be inhibitory factors. After evaluating the peak concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ammonia and lincomycin in 10 d bio-liquefaction, different methods for the removal of ammonia from hydrolysate and removal of lincomycin from biowaste were employed to relieve ammonia and lincomycin inhibition respectively. Prior to ammonia elimination on the tenth day, 38.0% of the organic carbon was degraded into hydrolysate. Water replacement, struvite precipitation and nitrogen stripping removed 100, 76 and 30% of the ammonia, respectively. The hydrolysate obtained from the water replacement could be immediately utilized for liquefaction. Lincomycin elution through butanol and water prior to liquefaction removed a large amount of carbohydrate and protein, resulting in poor liquefaction efficiency. The residual lincomycin in the bio-liquefaction process could be co-treated with lincomycin manufacturing wastewater, which made it suitable for the treatment of lincomycin manufacturing biowaste.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic environment has become an increasing concern for researchers and regulators in the past decade, and recent research has focused on pharmaceutical contamination from point sources, such as wastewater treatment facility outfalls. As an important initial step we are going to analyze 75 recent publications concerning the information on 12 selected drugs belonging to different groups of pharmaceuticals. Hence we cope with an initial data-matrix of the dimension 12x75. Thus, the object set contains 12 chemicals, the information base IB 75 attributes. This 12x75-data-matrix is evaluated by the Hasse Diagram Technique, a method derived from discrete mathematics. As this initial step leads to a diagram with many incomparabilities a data-reduction method on the attribute side is performed as the second step. Aggregation procedures of the data-matrix will be performed by applying METEOR (Method of Evaluation by Order Theory). Different weighting schemes are performed. In all approaches EES=Estinyl Estradiol is in a maximal position whereas FEN: Fenofibrate is a minimal object. This means that EES is the best scrutinized pharmaceutical and FEN the least analysed one within this information base IB.

AB Inefficient removal of pharmacological agents from water in sewage treatment plants leads to the introduction of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, into the hydrological cycle, and also contributes to the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This problem requires the development of new technologies that will support conventional treatment. One of the solutions is the use of membrane processes (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, membrane bioreactor) using membranes covered with materials with adsorptive and bactericidal properties. One of the substances that has these two properties is graphene oxide (GO). This paper presents the results of research on the modification of commercial microfiltration membranes involving the chemical attachment of graphene oxide to the membrane surface using a (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (3-APTES) precursor and applying a GO-PEBAX 2533 (polyether block amide type 2533) layer in the dip-coating process. Using the scanning electron microscopy microscopic analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy method and contact angle measurements, the presence of GO particles on the membrane surface and the change of membrane surface properties were confirmed. In the tests, aqueous solutions of sulfadiazine and amoxicillin were used. The amount of the adsorbed substances in a stationary system were: 31.03 and 4.77 mg/m(2), respectively. The membranes modified by GO are able to adsorb the pharmacological substances, which was confirmed in the flow system. In addition, the effects of modification on the membrane structure using a porosimeter and on water permeability based on the filtration coefficient were determined.

AB The effects of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals on sexual differentiation in F1 offspring were examined in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 or 10g/L of carbamazepine or gemfibrozil for 6 wk and bred in pairwise crosses to generate 7 distinct lineages. Lineages were formed with both parents from the same treatment group or with only one parent exposed, to delineate between maternal and paternal effects. The F1 offspring from each lineage were reared in clean water and sampled at 45 and 60 d post fertilization (dpf). Gonadal differentiation was assessed by histology. The morphological stages of the gonads were converted to a quantitative day-equivalent based on data from offspring of untreated parents sampled from 15 to 75 dpf, which enabled a quantitative statistical analysis on the timing of sexual differentiation. Paternal, but not maternal, exposure to carbamazepine resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation and a male-biased sex ratio; these effects were not observed when both parents were exposed. Combined paternal and maternal exposure to gemfibrozil resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation, and paternal, but not maternal, exposure to gemfibrozil led to male-biased sex ratios. The present study demonstrates the ability of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals to disrupt sexual differentiation in the F1 offspring and also shows that effects may be uniquely influenced by which parent was exposed.

AB BACKGROUNDCaBi(6)O(10) nanoplates were synthesized by a sonochemical method using a high-power ultrasonic processor. Also, the CaBi6O10 was synthesized by an impregnation-calcination method in order to compare the effect of the synthesis method on the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. In addition, the role of the oxidizing species such as h(+), OH center dot, H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) was evaluated during the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and methylene blue (MB).
   RESULTSThe sample synthesized sonochemically showed a morphology of nanoplates with a thickness around 50 nm and length 1.5 mu m. Also, the sample showed the best photocatalytic activity (i.e. the sample with the highest surface area and a plate-like morphology), degrading CPFX by 56% and MB by 67%. The main species involved in the degradation of CPFX were the OH<bold> radicals</bold>, and in the degradation of MB it was H2O2.
   CONCLUSIONSCaBi6O10 nanoplates were prepared successfully by a sonochemical method, showing the best photocatalytic activity in the degradation of CPFX and MB, mainly attributed to the morphology of the nanoplates. In addition, it was observed that the main species involved in the degradation of CPFX were the OH<bold> radicals and in the degradation of MB</bold>, H2O2. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The interaction-based hazard index (HIint) allows a prediction of mixture effects different from linear additivity by including information on binary mixtures between the chemicals. The aim of this study is to make a solid estimate on the possible synergistic potential of combined antibiotics and to quantify the subsequent effect for the case of the receiving river Elbe, Germany. Pieces of information on binary interactions between antibiotic groups were used from literature and from knowledge on human antibiotic combination therapy. Applying a moderate and a worst-case scenario, in terms of the interaction magnitude, resulted in 50 to 200% higher environmental risks, compared to the classical assessment approach applying simple concentration addition. A subsequent sensitivity analysis revealed that the data strength for some binary antibiotic combinations is too low to be considered for a solid estimate of synergistic effects. This led to the definition of certain preconditions in order to decide whether or not to include certain interaction information (e.g. the necessary number of interaction studies). The exclusion of information with low data strength resulted in an attenuated risk increase of 20 to 50%, based on the currently available scientific information on binary antibiotic mixtures. In order to include antibiotics with the highest share in the overall risk (macrolides, quinolones, and cephalosporins) as well as their corresponding metabolites, investigations should focus on binary interactions between them.

AB In recent years, concern around the impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) on the environment has grown. In order to investigate the influence of tourists on emissions and ecological risk of PPCPs, the concentrations of thirty PPCPs were measured in influent and effluent from the four largest wastewater treatment plants, as well as surface river water at six sites in a famous tourist city (Sanya City, China). Substantial increasing trends on PPCPs levels were observed from low to high tourist season (ng/L to mu g/L, or mu g/L to mg/L). Caffeine (CAF) was dominant with concentrations as high as 185 mu g/L. Emission load per capita was estimated to explore the contribution of different populations. Tourist migrant population might be a dominant contributor, as they were mostly elderly people who took long-term medication. The predicted no-effect concentration was derived using the species sensitivity distribution method to calculate the ecological risk quotient (RQ) of the dominant PPCPs. Additionally, RQs of seven dominant PPCPs in rivers were > 1, indicating high chronic ecological risk for freshwater ecosystems. The results of this study will assist in raising the awareness and improving management of emerging pollutants in less industrialized regions.

AB Anticancer drugs have been detected in the aquatic environment, they have a potent mechanism of action and their consumption is expected to drastically increase in the future. Consequently, it is crucial to routinely monitor the occurrence of anticancer drugs and to develop effective treatment options to avoid their release into the environment.
   Prior to implementing a monitoring program, it is important to define which anticancer drugs are more prone to be found in the surface waters. In this study the consumption of anticancer drugs in the Lisbon region (Portugal), Belgium and Haryana state (India) were used to estimate the concentrations that can be expected in surface waters.
   Moreover, one important aspect is to define the major entry route of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment is it hospital or household effluents? The results disclosed in this study showed that in Belgium and Lisbon, 94 % of the total amount of anticancer drugs were delivered to outpatients, indicating that household effluents are the primary input source of these drugs and thus, upgrading the treatment in the domestic wastewater facilities should be the focus.

AB Pharmaceuticals are detected at trace levels in water. Their adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems required novel pharmaceutical remediation methods for treating wastewater effluents. Layer double hydroxide (LDH) is abundantly available by simple preparation methods and with low costs. The extensive use of antibiotics nowadays leads to increasing the appearance of antibiotic resistance between bacteria and decreasing the effectiveness of antibiotics. In this work, the removal of one of these antibiotics named "oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC)" by Zn/Fe LDH was investigated. The Zn/Fe LDH before and after adsorption was characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR analysis, zeta potential, particle size, BET surface area, HRTEM, FESEM, and XPS. The effects of different factors on the OTC adsorption performance were investigated. The removal percentage of OTC was 77.23% by Zn/Fe LDH. The isothermal and kinetic study of OTC adsorption was carried out at pH 6 at 25 degrees C using different models. The adsorption mechanism was investigated by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations.

AB In an extensive monitoring programme, event mean concentrations of 12 heavy metals, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nine pesticides/biocides, three pharmaceuticals, three benzotriazoles, acesulfame, and DEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) were measured at 10 combined sewer overflow (CSO) facilities throughout Bavaria, Germany, for more than 110 overflow events. A harmonised approach with large volume samplers was used to produce volume-proportional event composite samples. A wide range of event durations and volumes was covered successfully. All substances analysed were detected in CSO samples and the majority were quantified in more than 80% of the samples. Our results confirm that CSOs need to be considered in the debate on micropollutant emissions, and knowledge regarding their concentrations at a regional level needs to be solidified. Distinct substance-specific patterns can be observed in the variability between events and sites as well as in a correlation analysis of substance concentrations. These trends underline the need for differentiation of the substances by their predominant sources, pathways, and transport behaviours. Compared to wastewater treatment plants, CSOs are an important pollution source especially for ubiquitous, primarily stormwater-transported pollutants, including substances causing failure to achieve good chemical status of surface waters, such as the uPBT (ubiquitous, persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) substances Hg and PAH.

AB This study fabricated a new and multifunctional mixed metal-biochar composites (MMBC) using the mixture of two abundant industrial wastes, red mud (RM) and lignin, via pyrolysis under N(2 )atmosphere, and its ability to treat wastewater containing various contaminants was comprehensively evaluated. A porous structure (BET surface area = 100.8 m(2) g(-1)) was created and metallic Fe was formed in the MMBC owing to reduction of Fe oxides present in RM by lignin decomposition products during pyrolysis at 700 degrees C, which was closely associated with the transformation of liquid to gaseous pyrogenic products. The potential application of the MMBC was investigated for the removal of heavy metals (Pb(II) and Ni(II)), oxyanions (As(V) and Cr(VI)), dye (methylene blue), and pharmaceutical/personal care products (para-nitrophenol and pCBA). The aluminosilicate mineral, metallic Fe, and porous carbon matrix derived from the incorporation of RM and lignin contributed to the multifunctionality (i.e., adsorption, chemical reduction, and catalytic reaction) of the MMBC. Thus, engineered biochar composites synthesized from selected industrial wastes can be a potential candidate for environmental applications.

AB In this work, statistical design was applied for the optimization of process parameters for the biofiltration of toluene using mixed microorganisms obtained from pharmaceuticals wastewater sludge in a packed bed biofilter. The effects of process parameters such as gas flow rate, initial toluene concentration, height of the packing material, and temperature on removal efficiency (RE) of toluene was studied and optimized using response surface methodology. Using Box-Behnken Design, 30 experiments were carried out for the four test variables. From the results, the optimum condition for maximum RE was found to be: gas flow rate-0.01 m(3)h(-1), initial toluene concentration -0.25 gm(-3), packing height-0.75 m, and temperature -31 degrees C. At these optimized conditions, the removal efficiency of toluene was found to be 95 %. A high R-2 value of greater than 0.9 indicates the fitness of the model to predict the experimental data. Biokinetic studies led to a good fit between experimental data and mathematical equations, yielding a calculated maximum toluene degradation rate of 140.42 gm(-3)h(-1) with a half-velocity constant, K-S, of 0.076 gm(-3).

AB The photocatalytic degradation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in aqueous suspension under ultraviolet irradiation was investigated using zinc oxide prepared through hydrothermal process. The as-prepared ZnO was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the three-dimensional structured ZnO microspheres were synthesized by assembly of nanorods with hexagonal wurtzite structure. The influence of initial ZnO doses and pH on EE2 degradation was firstly examined. The degradation efficiency of EE2 could reach the highest point at pH 9.0 with 0.5 g.L-1 ZnO. In addition, the effects of the presence of HCO3-, NO3- and HPO42- on EE2 removal were also revealed. It was found that the photocatalytic reaction was totally inhibited by NO3- and HPO42-, whereas the process was slightly promoted by HCO3-. The photocatalytic process of ZnO followed the pseudo-first order rate kinetics. The reaction rate constant for EE2 degradation by ZnO/UV was 0.156 min(-1), which was higher than 0.110 min(-1) of TiO2 (Degussa P25) suspension. This work can provide some useful information for the removal of EE2 by ZnO from wastewater for a water reclamation purpose.

AB A process has been developed for reducing both the mass and volume of waste activated sludge generated by the biological treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater, As a result of the mixture rule the sludge is classified as a hazardous waste. Thus, treatment and disposal have traditionally been very costly. This study focused on optimizing an engineered hydrolysis operation in terms of solids reduction, environmental impact, practicality and cost. Dewaterability screening studies were also conducted in an attempt to transform the residual solids into a readily filterable material.
   The resultant hydrolysis/thickening/filtration process begins with room temperature sludge acidification using sulfuric acid. This results in 50 to 60 percent solubilization of suspended solids, thus sharply reducing the mass of solids to be handled. Also, carbon dioxide is liberated during the reaction phase, enabling solids separation and thickening to occur via flotation. Subnatant hydrolysate can then be recycled to enhance solids solubilization. Once properly conditioned with acid and cationic polymer, the residual solids are readily pressure filtered to cake dryness in excess of 50% solids. Results of laboratory studies indicate that the overall process is capable of substantially reducing sludge cake production.

AB The removal of Tricaine Methanesulfonate from water in a fixed-bed column packed with pyrolysed paper mill sludge was evaluated for application in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems. Breakthrough adsorption curves were determined for this pharmaceutical, under different operating conditions. In a laboratory scale approach, with synthetic effluent, a bed adsorption capacity of 125 mg g(-1) was obtained under a flux of 56 L min(-1) m(-2), with 400 mg L-1 of MS-222 with 4.5 cm bed depth. The performance of the continuous adsorption in a column packed with biological paper mill sludge-based carbon, using real aquaculture wastewater as matrix, was not significantly affected. Then, scale-up was carried out and the bed depth service time model was applied and provided good predictions. Finally, the thermal regeneration of the exhausted adsorbent was assessed, which revealed satisfactory results for one cycle reusability after saturation; however, considering the nature of its precursor, the use of new adsorbent could be more profitable than its regeneration, functioning also as an additional option for the management of such wastes, (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Some pollutants can be resistant to wastewater treatment, hence becoming a risk to aquatic and terrestrial biota even at the very low concentrations (ng L-1-mu g L-1) they are commonly found at. Tertiary treatments are used for micropollutant removal but little is known about the ecotoxicity of the treated effluent. In this study, a municipal secondary effluent was treated by a solar photo-Fenton reactor at initial neutral pH in a raceway pond reactor, and ecotoxicity was evaluated before and after micropollutant removal. Thirty-nine micropollutants were identified in the secondary effluent, mainly pharmaceuticals, with a total concentration of approximate to 80 mu g L-1. After treatment, 99 % microcontaminant degradation was reached. As for ecotoxicity reduction, the assayed organisms showed the following sensitivity levels: Tetrahymena thermophila > Daphnia magna > Lactuca sativa > Spirodela polyrhiza approximate to Vibrio fischeri. The initial effluent showed an inhibitory effect of 40 % for T. thermophila and 20 % for D. magna. After 20 min of photo-Fenton treatment, no toxic effect was observed for T. thermophila and toxicity dropped to 5 % for D. magna.

AB Human pharmaceuticals have been detected in wastewater treatment plants, rivers, and estuaries throughout Europe and the United States. It is widely acknowledged that there is insufficient information available to determine whether prolonged exposure to low levels of these substances is having an impact on the microbial ecology in such environments. In this study we attempt to measure the effects of exposing cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (UWC1) to six pharmaceuticals by looking at differences in metabolite levels. Initially, we used Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis to discriminate between cell cultures exposed to different pharmaceuticals. This suggested that on exposure to propranolol there were significant changes in the lipid complement of P. putida. Metabolic profiling with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), coupled with univariate statistical analyses, was used to identify endogenous metabolites contributing to discrimination between cells exposed to the six drugs. This approach suggested that the energy reserves of exposed cells were being expended and was particularly evident on exposure to propranolol. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were raised in P. putida exposed to propranolol. Increased energy requirements may be due to energy dependent efflux pumps being used to remove propranolol from the cell.

AB Disaccharides are valuable oligosaccharides with an increasing demand in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Disaccharides can be manufactured by extraction from the acid hydrolysate of plant-derived substrates, but this method has several issues, such as the difficulty in accessing natural substrates, laborious product separation processes, and troublesome wastewater treatment. A chemical synthesis using glucose was developed for producing disaccharides, but this approach suffers from a low product yield due to the low specificity and requires tedious protection and deprotection processes. In this study, we adopted an artificial strategy for producing a variety of value-added disaccharides from low-cost starch through the construction of an in vitro synthetic enzymatic platform: two enzymes worked in parallel to convert starch to glucose and glucose 1-phosphate, and these two intermediates were subsequently condensed together to a disaccharide by a disaccharide phosphorylase. Several disaccharides, such as laminaribiose, cellobiose, trehalose, and sophorose, were produced successfully from starch with the yields of more than 80% with the help of kinetic mathematical models to predict the optimal reaction conditions, exhibiting great potential in an industrial scale. This study provided a promising alternative to reform the mode of disaccharide manufacturing.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A complex mix of pharmaceuticals enters waterways via treated wastewater effluent and many remain biochemically active after the drugs reach aquatic systems. However, to date little is known regarding the ecological effects that might arise following pharmaceutical contamination of aquatic environments. One group of particular concern is behaviorally modifying pharmaceuticals as seemingly minor changes in behavior may initiate marked ecological consequences. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) on key behavioral traits in wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) at concentrations similar to those encountered in effluent surface waters. Roach exposed to water with high concentrations of oxazepam (280 mu g/L) exhibited increased boldness, while roach at low treatment (0.84 mu g/L) became bolder and more active compared to control fish. Our results reinforce the notion that anxiolytic drugs may be affecting fish behavior in natural systems, emphasizing the need for further research on ecological impacts of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems and development of new tools to incorporate ecologically relevant behavioral endpoints into ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB Denitrification plays a key role in the biological nitrogen removal from the wastewater using granular sludge as the integral part of a high-rate denitrification technology. It is helpful to evaluate the effect of typical organic toxicants on the activity of denitrifying granular sludge for the application of denitrification technology. In this study, four typical organic toxicants, namely, penicillin, chloramphenicol, 2,4-dinitrophenol and polymyxin B sulphate were used to assess the effect of organic toxicants on the activity of denitrifying granular sludge. The results of individual toxicity indicated that penicillin, chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had significant inhibition, whose half-inhibitory concentrations were 0.534, 0.162 and 0.474 g/L with respective inhibitory magnitudes of 90.79%/(g/L), 282.5%/(g/L) and 138.83%/(g/L). Polymyxin B sulphate showed no significant inhibition. The results of combined toxicity indicated that the binary mixture of penicillin and chloramphenicol had an antagonistic effect, both the binary mixture of penicillin and 2,4-dinitrophenol and the binary mixture of chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had additive effects. The ternary mixture of penicillin, chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had a partial additive effect.

AB While substantial knowledge on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is available, their behavior and fate in surface waters is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze the short-term dynamics of selected pharmaceuticals along a 13.6 km long river stretch downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and to quantify their attenuation by a mass balance approach. Four acidic pharmaceuticals (bezafibrate, clofibric acid, diclofenac, naproxen) with different attenuation properties were measured over a period of three weeks at high temporal resolution, and in situ photolysis experiments were carried out The average concentrations of pharmaceuticals were between 9 4 and 339 +/- 133 ng L-1, corresponding to loads between 1.9 +/- 1.2 and 63 +/- 37 g d(-1) (n = 134). The temporal dynamics of pharmaceuticals was closely related to discharge of the WWTP and precipitation, and highest concentrations were observed at the beginning of a discharge event During a dry period, naproxen was eliminated along the river stretch with a dissipation time (DT50) of 3.6 +/- 2.1 days while the other compounds did not exhibit significant attenuation. As photolysis and other abiotic processes were of limited quantitative relevance, the attenuation of naproxen can most likely be attributed to biotransformation.

AB Rejection of trace organic compounds, including disinfection by-products (DBPs) and pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), by high-pressure membranes has become a focus of public interest internationally in both drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation/reuse. The ability to simulate, or even predict, the rejection of these compounds by high-pressure membranes, encompassing nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO), will improve process economics and expand membrane applications. The objective of this research is to develop a membrane transport model to account for diffusive and convective contributions to solute transport and rejection. After completion of cross-flow tests and diffusion cell tests with target compounds, modeling efforts were performed in accordance with a non-equilibrium thermodynamic transport equation. Comparing the percentages of convection and diffusion contributions to transport, convection is dominant for most compounds, but diffusion is important for more hydrophobic non-polar compounds. Convection is also more dominant for looser membranes (i.e., NF). In addition, higher initial compound concentrations and greater J(0)/k ratios contribute to solute fluxes more dominated by convection. Given the treatment objective of compound rejection, compound transport and rejection trends are inversely related. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Biological treatability studies: New regulations require a new approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the past, biological treatability studies were directed toward defining effluent BOD and TSS. Recent regulations now require effluent limitations on volatile organic carbon, specific priority pollutants, aquatic toxicity and in many cases nitrogen for complex wastewaters. This, in turn, has changed the focus of biological treatability studies.
   It is assumed that a screening protocol has been employed to define biological treatment as a candidate process [1].
   (a) Priority Pollutants-If on or more priority pollutants are a permit issue, a fed batch reactor (FBR) is run using acclimated biosolids to determine the maximum degradation rate, q(m), and the half velocity constant, K-s. From these data, the required SRT to meet effluent limitations can be computed.
   (b) Aquatic Toxicity-If the wastewater exhibits aquatic toxicity in addition to priority pollutant requirements, bioassays are run on the biological units. Effluent toxicity and COD are tracked with time. Since effluent toxicity is frequently associated with soluble microbial products (SMP), the SMP is estimated from the effluent COD over time of aeration.
   (c) Nitrogen-Many organics including SMP are inhibitory to nitrification. The nitrification. rate should be determined on the effluents using seeded NH4Cl as a control. From these data, the required SRT can be computed.
   This paper reviews the required protocols and presents several case histories from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.

AB Applying sewage sludge or animal manure onto agricultural land can result in estrogen pollution, which increases the risk of human exposure to steroid estrogens (SEs) via the food chain. However, the uptake and accumulation mechanism of SEs by plants is still unclear. In this study, the uptake, accumulation, and translocation of 17 beta-E2, a representative SE, were investigated through a series of wheat hydroponic experiments. Various inhibitors were applied to explore the uptake pathways of 17 beta-E2 by wheat. In addition, the effects of exposure concentrations, coexisting 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and plant properties on the uptake of 17 beta-E2 were examined. The results indicated that the accumulation of 17 beta-E2 in wheat roots mainly resulted from adsorption and active uptake that involved aquaporins and anion channels transport The chlorophyll and protein contents of plants were positively correlated with the uptake of 17 beta-E2, whereas competitive inhibition occurred when 17 beta-E2 and EE2 coexisted in the same solution. Nevertheless, the results of a split-root experiment showed that 17 beta-E2 absorbed by wheat could further migrate in plant via long-distance transport and ultimately was discharged from plants, suggesting that 17 beta-E2 was still at risk of being released even though it had been absorbed by plants. These results could provide valuable insights into the risk assessment and risk control of the uptake of SEs by plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Southern Brazil is an agricultural region that is experiencing strong growth in both cereal and animal production. The intensification of agricultural practices, as well as the growing urbanization in this region, also generates strong anthropogenic pressures on the aquatic environment. In Brazil, the lack of sewage treatment and the wide use of waste (liquid or solid) for the fertilization of soils are likely to favor the spread of pharmaceuticals in the surrounding environment. Considering the benefits of the determination of anthropogenic markers in the environment, the study aimed to monitor the presence of carbamazepine (CBZ) and sucralose (SCR) in the Guapore River, representative of a southern Brazilian rural watershed. Both carbamazepine and sucralose are measured in water by polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) (CBZ: lower than limit of detection (<LOD) to 746 mu g g(-1) and SCR:<LOD) and in the river biofilms (CBZ: <LOD to 3.6 ng g(-1) and SCR: <LOD to 139.3 ng g(-1)) to give an overview of the level of aquatic contamination. The use of sucralose and carbamazepine as tracers of anthropogenic activity proved promising, as was the use of biofilms and POCIS as samplers. Biofilm and POCIS are two complementary techniques. Biofilms are able to identify contaminated environment sites by the capture of SCR as a human marker and POCIS are capable to capture the CBZ compounds with higher efficiency in polluted sites than biofilms.

AB Fifty-six pharmaceuticals of various chemical groups, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and cardiovascular drugs, were detected in four selected river waters receiving sewage effluents in the Community of Madrid (Spain). A promising approach for the degradation of those residues is the application of a photo-Fenton treatment. Several new bioassays using fern spores were employed for the evaluation of acute and chronic toxicity based on mitochondrial activity, DNA and chlorophyll quantifications of as-received river water and photo-Fenton-treated samples. photo-Fenton treatment provided a high degree of total organic carbon mineralization with up to 70% reduction for river water samples. In addition, the elimination of most of the studied pharmaceutical compounds was confirmed. A few compounds, however (salicylic acid, ofloxacin, caffeine, cotinine and nicotine), seemed more resistant, with after-treatment concentrations between 4 and 44 ng L-1. Nicotine showed the most refractory behaviour with concentrations ranging from 29 to 224 ng L-1 for treated samples. Photo-Fenton treatment yielded a significant decrease in acute and chronic toxicity, even though some residual toxicity remained after treatment. This fact seemed to be related to the presence of toxicants in the water matrix, probably of inorganic nature, rather than the toxic effect of the studied pharmaceutical compounds, as revealed by the effective removal of these compounds and high TOC mineralization of photo-Fenton treatments.

AB Among increasingly used pharmaceutical products, beta-blockers have been commonly reported at low concentrations in rivers and littoral waters of Europe and North America. Little is known about the toxicity of these chemicals in freshwater ecosystems while their presence may lead to chronic pollution. Hence, in this study the acute toxicity of 3 beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol on fluvial biofilms was assessed by using several biomarkers. Some were indicative of potential alterations in biofilm algae (photosynthetic efficiency), and others in biofilm bacteria (peptidase activity, bacterial mortality). Propranolol was the most toxic beta-blocker, mostly affecting the algal photosynthetic process. The exposure to 531 mu g/L of propranolol caused 85% of inhibition of photosynthesis after 24 h. Metoprolol was particularly toxic for bacteria. Though estimated No-Effect Concentrations (NEC) were similar to environmental concentrations, higher concentrations of the toxic (503 mu g/L metoprolol) caused an increase of 50% in bacterial mortality. Atenolol was the least toxic of the three tested beta-blockers. Effects superior to 50% were only observed at very high concentration (707 mg/L). Higher toxicity of metoprolol and propranolol might be due to better absorption within biofilms of these two chemicals. Since beta-blockers are mainly found in mixtures in rivers, their differential toxicity could have potential relevant consequences on the interactions between algae and bacteria within river biofilms.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is among the top 100 drugs prescribed yearly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Tissue and water extraction methods were developed to detect and quantify FLX, norfluosetine and the associated biological compounds serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), tryptophan (TRP) and melatonin (MEL) using LC/MS/MS. Acute mortality and sublethal physiological effects of FLX were assessed using standard static renewal toxicity tests in which juvenile sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) were exposed to FLX. Fluoxetine did not cause significant mortality at levels near currently reported environmental concentrations. Significant changes in neurotransmitter levels were observed within the serotonergic system in juvenile sheepshead minnows exposed at concentrations approximately one order of magnitude above those currently reported in the environment. Transformation activity ratios of a product to a precursor compound (5-HT/TRP, 5-HIAA/5-HT and MEL/5-HT) also exhibited significant changes with FIX treatment. Fluoxetine exposure did not only affect 5-HT but had additional effects both upstream and downstream of 5-HT within its synthesis and metabolic pathways. These sublethal changes within the serotonergic pathway may result in behavioral changes which could, in turn, have implications for the ecological response Of Populations to additional environmental stressors.

AB Anthropogenic contamination of water resources with micro-organic pollutants has become a heightened concern as many of these compounds have been shown to have estrogen-like action on organismal function. Recent studies have demonstrated that wastewater effluent released to the environment contains estrogen at biologically relevant levels. It is therefore imperative to meet the demand for real-time/on-site detection of environmental estrogen. However, the technology that is currently used for this purpose is expensive, technically complicated, and not available for estrogen level determination at contaminated sites. The primary objective of this paper is to review the present-day technology involved in the design of a robust and rapid Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC), a device that automates multiple functions into a single integrated circuit, which could be implemented for the detection of estrogen in environmental water samples. This paper concisely encompasses different branches of science, e.g. micro/nano-bioelectronics, environmental health, toxicology, and biochemistry to analyze the underlying system dynamics of a LOC for viable detection of environmental pollutants. Particularly, we discuss the detection of environmental estrogen by piezoresistive microcantilever sensor and integration of the sensor with alternating current electrokinetics in a microfluidic chamber.

AB Sulfonamides are one of the most frequently used antibiotics worldwide. Therefore, processes that determine their fate in the environment are of great interest. In the present work, biodegradation as biotic process and hydrolysis and photolysis as abiotic processes were investigated. In biodegradation experiments, it was found out that sulfonamides (sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine) and their N (4)-acetylated metabolites were not readily biodegradable. The results showed that decrease of concentrations were in the range from 4% for sulfadiazine to 22% for N (4)-acetylsulfamethazine. Hydrolytic experiments examined at pH values normally found in the environment also showed their resistance. However, photolysis proved to be significant process for decreasing concentrations of sulfonamides and their metabolites in three various aqueous matrices (Milli-Q water, river water, and synthetic wastewater). In addition, influence of ubiquitous water constituents (Cl-, NO3 (-), SO4 (2-), PO4 (3-), and humic acids) was also investigated, showing their different impact on photolysis of investigated pharmaceuticals. The results showed that photolysis followed first-order kinetics in all cases. The obtained results are very important for assesing the environmental fate of sulfonamides and their metabolites in the aquatic environment.

AB Growing use of xenobiotic substances, synthetic fragrances, pesticides, drugs, and other contaminants is leading to their increasing concentrations in the aquatic environment (over 1 mu g/L). Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTP) are unable to degrade these contaminants entirely. In this study, solar photo-Fenton process is proposed and optimized as a tertiary treatment for MWTP effluents containing emerging contaminants (ECs) and other micro-pollutants. A three-level factorial experimental design (3(3)), modified with 2 x 3 axial and 6 central runs to make it spherical was carried out for optimization using Statgraphics software. The influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage, iron (II) concentration and temperature were assessed over accumulated energy (QUV kJ/L as the response factor) necessary to remove more than 95% of the micro-pollutants. Pareto graphic and response surfaces showed that Fe (II) concentration, temperature and their interaction are the variables that influence the response factor the most. Finally, the optimal operating conditions were successfully applied to the treatment of a real MWTP effluent at pilot plant scale removing 80% of total micropollutants after 0.56 kJ/L.

AB Here, we explore the role that sorption to mineral surfaces plays in the fate of two commonly encountered effluent-derived pharmaceuticals, the anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine. Adsorption isotherms and pH-edge experiments are consistent with electrostatics governing anticonvulsant uptake on metal oxides typically found in soil and aquifer material (e.g., Si, Al, Fe, Mn, and Ti). Appreciable, albeit limited, adsorption was observed only for phenytoin, which is anionic above pH 8.3, on the iron oxides hematite and ferrihydrite. Adsorption increased substantially in the presence of cationic and anionic surfactants, species also commonly encountered in wastewater effluent. For carbamazepine, we propose the enhanced uptake results entirely from hydrophobic interactions with apolar tails of surfactant surface coatings. For phenytoin, adsorption also arises from the ability of surfactants to alter the net charge of the mineral surface and thereby further enhance favorable electrostatic interactions with its anionic form. Collectively, our results demonstrate that although pristine mineral surfaces are likely not major sinks for phenytoin and carbamazepine in the environment, their alteration with organic matter, particularly surfactants, can considerably increase their ability to retain these emerging pollutants in subsurface systems.

AB Pollution of aquatic bodies by pharmaceutical compounds is an emerging environmental problem because these drugs are extensively used in animal and human medicine. Ibuprofen, 2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl] propanoic acid, is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly present both in wastewater and in rivers and lakes in Europe. Despite this environmental emergency is giving rise a great interest in the scientific community, literature about the effects of ibuprofen on microalgae is scarce. A previous work on the freshwater microalga Scenedesmus rubescens had shown some morpho-physiological effects caused by treatment with 62.5, 250 and 1000 mu g L-1 ibuprofen. In this paper, we presented the results of treatment with ibuprofen at the same concentrations, ranging from environmental levels up to higher values, on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (P.J.L. Dangeard). Ibuprofen effects on the alga were assayed through analyses of growth curve. Moreover, analyses of cell morphology, ultrastructure, and photosynthetic pigments were performed. The first effect of drug was the stimulation of the microalga growth. In addition, following exposure to ibuprofen, cells exhibited morphological and ultrastructural alterations, the latter ones consisting of starch granules and both in vacuolar and cytoplasmatic inclusions. On the contrary, chlorophyll and carotenoids amounts, were not affected by drug treatment.

AB Ozonation is widely used in wastewater treatment plants to remove diverse organic micropollutants. As molecular structures of organic micropollutants contain multiple ozone-preferred reaction sites, and moreover intermediate products can react with ozone again, ozonation mechanism is complex. A fast increasing number of organic micropollutants and a great demand of ecological risk assessments call for an in silico method to provide insights into the ozonation mechanism of organic micropollutants. Here, an in silico model was developed to unveil ozonation mechanisms of organic micropollutants. Sulfamethoxazole was taken as a case. The model enumerates elementary reactions following well-accepted ozonation patterns and secondary transformation reactions established for intermediates by experiments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed for evaluating thermodynamic feasibilities of reaction pathways. By calculating Gibbs free energies, ozonation products of SMX were predicted. The predicted products are consistent with those detected in experiments. This method is advanced in revealing all possible reaction pathways including minor pathways that produce toxic byproducts but are difficult to be observed by experiments. Accordingly, water treatment engineers can setup necessary treatment technology to ensure water safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical synthesis processes of the pharmaceuticals industry produce wastewaters which are variable in character and highly strong. In-plant controls are important and highly effective in determining the final wastewater quality. At any rate several stages of treatment comprised of physical, chemical and biological are required to obtain a reasonable degree of treatment. The problem is further complicated in small-scale plants due to low volume of wastewaters and dilution requirements. In this study, a small-scale pharmaceuticals plant producing three common active materials was experimentally evaluated to assess the waste management alternatives. The processes were evaluated and a source-based pollution profile was prepared. Paracetamol wastewaters were found to be readily biodegradable. Omeprazole wastewaters could be biologically treated only after significant chemical treatment. Mephenoxalone wastewaters were in no case biologically degradable. Paracetamol and pretreated Omeprazole wastewaters could be biologically treated down to several hundreds of ppm COD at as high as 0.5 g COD/g VSS day F/M ratio after several fold dilution. Results of the study were evaluated and discussed. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

AB Nature-based solutions of polishing treated effluent are drawing increased attention because of their potential to mitigate ecological risks, and the shallow open water unit (SOWU) process is one of the most promising options. In this study, a pilot experiment was conducted to assess the efficiency of SOWU for effluent quality polishing in a municipal wastewater treatment plant targeting 33 residual emerging contaminants (ECs) that were categorized into six groups, namely pharmaceuticals, sunscreens, bactericides, pesticides, flame retardants and phenols. In the 14-day monitoring period, each of the ECs decayed following a first order reaction, and about 61 % total ECs removal was achieved, indicating the remarkable photolysis effect of the SOWU under natural conditions. The significant removal of ECs, especially the very high removals of pharmaceuticals (76 %) and sunscreens (77 %), was associated with the attenuation of both the acute luminescent bacterial toxicity and genotoxicity. From the linear relationship between the acute toxicity and chromophoric dissolved organic matter and that between genotoxicity and UV absorbance at 254 nm, it was likely that the attenuation of biotoxicities resulted from the decay of chromophoric and aromatic compounds. By analyzing several reactive species, the excellent photoreactivity of the SOWU was further identified.

AB Growing interests and efforts have been recently focused on design and assembly of novel hydrogel nanosorbents for removal of drugs from wastewater. Therefore, this work is aimed to immobilize and encapsulate starch hydrogel matrix onto metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and dope with nanomagnetite. The magnetic MOFs-Starch hydrogel (NFe3O4@Zn(GA)/Starch-Hydrogel) was synthesized via microwave irradiation process and characterized with high surface area (528.39 m(2)/g), mesoporous with pore size 2.90 nm and highly crystalline structure. The maximum swelling ratio (1000.0 %) was optimized at pH 10, 180 min and 25 degrees C. The validity of NFe3O4@Zn(GA)/Starch-Hydrogel for adsorptive removal of Fluvastatin statin drug provided maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity 782.05 mg g(-1). The Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second kinetics models were correlated well with the computed correlation coefficient values 0.9991 and 0.9997, respectively. The validity of NFe3O4@Zn(GA)/Starch-Hydrogel for removal of FLV statin drug from real water matrices was confirmed in the range 96.15-99.99 %.

AB The adsorption of organic micropollutants onto activated carbon is a favourable solution for the treatment of drinking water and wastewater. However, these adsorption processes are not sufficiently understood to allow for the appropriate prediction of removal processes. In this study, thermogravimetric analysis, alongside evolved gas analysis, is proposed for the characterisation of micropollutants adsorbed on activated carbon. Varying amounts of carbamazepine were adsorbed onto three different activated carbons, which were subsequently dried, and their thermal decomposition mechanisms examined. The discovery of 55 different pyrolysis products allowed differentiations to be made between specific adsorption sites and conditions. However, the same adsorption mechanisms were found for all samples, which were enhanced by inorganic constituents and oxygen containing surface groups. Furthermore, increasing the loadings led to the evolution of more hydrated decomposition products, whilst parts of the carbamazepine molecules were also integrated into the carbon structure. It was also found that the chemical composition, especially the degree of dehydration of the activated carbon, plays an important role in the adsorption of carbamazepine. Hence, it is thought that the adsorption sites may have a higher adsorption energy for specific adsorbates, when the activated carbon can then potentially increase its degree of graphitisation.

AB Levofloxacin-a fluoroquinolone antibiotic-is a potential wastewater contaminant generated by pharmaceutical industries. Novel one-dimensional disilver dimolybdate (Ag2Mo2O7) structures were developed to form a heterojunction with thin nanosheets of MoS2 on the surface of Ag2Mo2O7. A photocatalyst was used for the efficient removal of levofloxacin under visible light. The processing of the Ag2Mo2O7 structures was optimized by altering the hydrothermal duration with structural analysis using Rietveld refinement. An enhanced catalytic activity for levofloxacin degradation (efficiency of 97%) was observed with 30 wt% MoS2/Ag2Mo2O7, following first-order kinetics. The superior activity is ascribed to the well-aligned and favorable band positions, which allowed efficient charge transfer between the photogenerated charge carriers. The direct Z-scheme led to the photogeneration of a large number of electrons at the MoS2 surface. An investigation with radical scavengers indicated that superoxide radicals played a significant role in the degradation process, which was confirmed by electron spin resonance spectral measurements. Detailed parametric studies were performed, and the reaction mechanism was examined, providing an insight into the development of such hybrid microcomposites for the removal of hazardous pharmaceuticals from the environment.

AB Since it is known that conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove pharmaceutical compounds, such as carbamazepine, the need for their removal has intensified. The use of biocatalysts, such as enzyme is an environmentally friendly method for carbamazepine biodegradation. Nevertheless, enzyme immobilization is required to facilitate the recovery and reusability and avoid the loss of enzyme. In this work, laccase was immobilized on modified polyimide aerogels by means of covalent bonding. Results showed that the immobilized laccase on polyimide aerogels possesses significantly improved activity under acidic or basic pH range in comparison with the free enzyme. Furthermore, for all the temperature range the activity of the immobilized enzyme was higher compared to the free enzyme form. The storage stability improved by the immobilization on this support material. The reusability tests towards oxidation of 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) showed that the immobilized laccase maintained 22% of the initial activity after 7 cycles. Immobilized laccase on polyimide aerogels for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation exhibited 76% and 74% removal in spiked water and secondary effluent, respectively. Furthermore, after 7 cycles the CBZ removal efficiency remained higher (50% and 65% for spiked water and secondary effluent, respectively).

AB A new membrane fouling control technique using ozonated water flushing was evaluated for direct nanofiltration (NF) of secondary wastewater effluent using a ceramic NF membrane. Experiments were conducted at a permeate flux of 44 L/m(2)h to evaluate the ozonated water flushing technique for fouling mitigation. Surface flushing with clean water did not effectively remove foulants from the NF membrane. In contrast, surface flushing with ozonated water (4 mg/L dissolved ozone) could effectively remove most foulants to restore the membrane permeability. This surface flushing technique using ozonated water was able to limit the progression of fouling to 35% in transmembrane pressure increase over five filtration cycles. Results from this study also heighten the need for further development of ceramic NF membrane to ensure adequate removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) for water recycling applications. The ceramic NF membrane used in this study showed approximately 40% TOC rejection, and the rejection of PPCPs was generally low and highly variable. It is expected that the fouling mitigation technique developed here is even more important for ceramic NF membranes with smaller pore size and thus better PPCP rejection.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment may be decomposed by abiotic and biotic factors. Photodegradation is the most investigated abiotic process, as it occurs in the natural environment and may be applied in wastewater treatment technology. Although pharmaceuticals are detected in effluents and surface water in a mixture, the photodegradation process is mainly evaluated with single compounds. The photodegradation of fluoxetine (FLU) and fluvoxamine (FLX) in the presence of diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS) was investigated with HPLC and bioassay. FLU did not degrade under UV-Vis irradiation in SunTest CPS+ either with or without the tested additives, although small amounts of desmethyl fluoxetine and 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol were formed. In contrast, during irradiation, FLX isomerized to cis-FLX. This process was enhanced by DCF and TCS, but to a lesser degree than by humic acids. Thus, the presence and composition of the matrix should be considered in the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. As the toxicity of the tested solutions depended only on the concentration of the tested drugs, it was suggested that the biological activity of the photodegradation products was lower than that of the parent compounds.

AB In this study, the adsorption of pharmaceutically active compounds - salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol and diclofenac-Na onto activated carbons has been studied. Three different commercial activated carbons, possessing similar to 650, 900 or 1500 m(2) g(-1) surface areas were used as solid adsorbents. These materials were fully characterized - their textural, surface features and points of zero charge have been determined.
   The adsorption was studied from aqueous solutions at 303 K using batch adsorption experiments and titration microcalorimetry, which was employed in order to obtain the heats evolved as a result of adsorption. The maximal adsorption capacities of investigated solids for all target pharmaceuticals are in the range of 10(-4) mol g(-1). The obtained maximal retention capacities are correlated with the textural properties of applied activated carbon. The roles of acid/base features of activated carbons and of molecular structures of adsorbate molecules have been discussed. The obtained results enabled to estimate the possibility to use the activated carbons in the removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen is one of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the world. It was measured at different concentration levels in environmental water. Since naproxen can be exposed to UV light during water and wastewater treatment, an investigation was conducted to identify photolysis rate and transformation product formation during photolysis in the presence of photosensitizers. Different experiments were carried out to identify the effect of dissolved organic matter and NO3- to photolysis reactions of naproxen. Naproxen was measured and transformation products were detected using liquid chromatograph coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. MassBank libraries were used to propose transformation product molecular structures. During direct photolysis experiments pseudo first order degradation kinetic constant k(obs) was found as 0.121min(-1). k(obs) decreased to 0.068min(-1) during indirect photolysis experiments. While presence of dissolved organic matter decreases photolysis rate, NO3- accelerates the degradation of naproxen. Benzyl succinic acid and caffeic acid were proposed as potential transformation products of naproxen along with an unidentified transformation product having 177m/z. All potential transformation products of naproxen proposed in this study were identified for the first time in the literature.

AB Recent occurrences of pharmaceutical antibiotics in surface water, drinking water, and wastewater systems have gained significant attention due to their potential threats to human health. This study determined the absolute second-order rate constants of ozone with two amine-based antibiotics, namely, lincomycin and spectinomycin, using the stopped-flow technique under controlled ionic strength, buffer, and temperature. Results indicate that ozone reacts quickly with the selected antibiotics, and the reaction rate significantly depends on solution pH. For lincomycin, ozone attacks its free amine group and sulfur group with absolute rate constants of 2.76 x 10(6) M-1.s(-1) (for neutral form) and 3.26 x 10(5) M-1.s(-1) (for monoprotonated form), respectively. For spectinomycin, ozone attacks two free amine groups with absolute rate constants of 1.27 x 10(6) M-1.s(-1) (for neutral form) and 3.30 x 10(5) M-1.s(-1) (for monoprotonated form), respectively. These rate constants have been corrected to zero ionic strength. Protonated amine is nonreactive toward ozone. Model prediction indicates that lincomycin and spectinomycin can be effectively transformed by ozonation processes around neutral pH.

TI THE ROLE OF CHEMICAL-ENGINEERING IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL AND THE BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Depending on which definition is chosen, biotechnology can be considered to be one of the oldest industrial technologies or one of the newest. For the chemical engineer, however, the major distinction is in terms of the scale of operation. The majority of products of the new biotechnology are extremely high value, low volume biochemicals. Thus recovery (separation) processes for such products may be relatively costly and energy intensive, because of the small quantities involved, but at the same time must be highly efficient in order to minimize loss of valuable product. This contrasts with the more traditional biotechnological processes of the food and beverage industries, antibiotic and medium value pharmaceuticals production, and wastewater treatment. Here, the problems for the chemical engineer are more like those in the chemical or process industries.
   In this paper a typical biological process is compared with its counterpart chemical process and the role of the chemical engineer in designing and developing such a process is examined through a series of examples. Just as the chemical industry for decades was dominated by the chemist, so the bioprocess industry is still dominated by the industrial microbiologist. There are consequently many areas in which improvements can be made to established industrial biological processes by the application of simple engineering concepts.

ID PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION
AB Pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites raise worrying questions because of their continuous release and lack of efficient removal by conventional wastewater treatments; therefore, they are being detected in groundwater, surface water and drinking water in increasing concentrations. Paracetamol and aspirin are two of the most commonly used drugs employed as fever reducer, analgesic and anti-inflammatory. They and their metabolites are very often found in river water, so their degradation is necessary in order to render water suitable for human consumption. The present work is focused on the comparison of the photocatalytic performance of industrial active gr,s porcelain tiles covered with a commercial micro-sized TiO2 by industrial process using either conventional spray deposition or innovative digital printing methods. The photodegradation of two commonly used drugs, namely aspirin and paracetamol, was investigated both individually and as a mixture, in both deionized and tap water. The results reveal the full conversion of the drugs and the significant role of the photocatalytic tiles in the mineralization processes leading to harmless inorganic species. In particular, the digitally printed tiles exhibited better photodegradation performance for both drugs compared to the spray deposited tiles. No deactivation was observed on both photocatalytic tiles.

TI Pharmaceutical residues in the river Rhine - results of a one-decade
   monitoring programme
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
LA English
DT Article
ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; TREATMENT-PLANT; WATER; FATE
AB In this paper, results of an extensive monitoring programme for pharmaceutical residues in the river Rhine are presented. For one decade (1997 until 2006), the occurrence of widely used human pharmaceuticals like analgesics, lipid regulators, antiepileptics and others has been studied at four locations along the river Rhine. The results of more than 500 analyses clearly prove that compounds such as carbamazepine or diclofenac are regularly found in the river Rhine in concentrations up to several hundred ng per litre. Combining concentration levels with data on water flow enables the calculation of transports, which e. g. for carbamazepine or diclofenac were in the range of several tons per year. The evaluation of the long-term monitoring data shows that only a slight decrease in concentration levels as well as in annual transports can be observed and thus the contamination of the river Rhine by pharmaceutical residues during the last decade has to be regarded as almost constant. Seasonal variations can be detected for bezafibrate, diclofenac and ibuprofen, for which the concentrations are much lower in the summer months. A more effective removal during wastewater treatment in the warmer periods of the year seems to be the major reason for those variations. For carbamazepine, no comparable seasonal effect can be found.

AB Antibiotic fermentative residues are categorized into hazardous wastes in China due to the existence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and residual antibiotics How to treat and manage these wastes is a new challenge. This paper investigated the treatment of erythromycin thiocyanate fermentation (EryTcF) residues using ionizing radiation technology for removing ARGs and antibiotics from the fermentation residues. The results showed that as exposed the EryTcF residues to gamma radiation, the abundance of four macrolide resistance genes (ereA, ermB, mefA and mpfB) decreased 1.0-1.3 log with 90-95% removal, and around 56% of erythromycin was removed at absorbed dose of 30 & kGy and room temperature (19-22 &degrees C). Direct action of gamma-ray radiation contributed to 42-53% of ARGs removal and indirect action (radicals' reaction) was mainly responsible for erythromycin removal (84%). The positive correlation between total ARGs and Shannon index was observed. The potential ARGs-linked hosts were assigned to genera Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae and their abundance decreased by 36-43% at 30 & kGy. Radiation has not obvious influence on the nutrient components of residues, such as protein content, suggesting that the radiation treated fermentative residues can be used as fertilizer, which is favorable for the development of recycling economy in antibiotic pharmaceutical factory. The results could provide a new insight into a sustainable management of antibiotic fermentative residuals.

AB More than 400 new nitrogen containing products were detected upon experimental sunlight photolysis of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). These products were presumably formed through covalent binding of CBZ phototransformation products with DOM molecules. About 50% of these newly formed bound residues contained one nitrogen atom and had a molecular mass between 375 and 525 Da, which was 150 to 200 Da higher than for an average DOM molecule. In addition, a previously unknown CBZ phototransformation product, 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (3-QCA), was identified by liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). 3-QCA was likely formed through oxidative ring cleavage and subsequent decarboxylation of acridine, a well-known phototransformation product of CBZ. Collision induced dissociation experiments and Kendrick mass defect analyses corroborated that about 160 of the new products were formed via covalent binding of 3-QCA with DOM molecules of above-average O/C and H/C ratios. Experiments at lower CBZ concentration suggested that the importance of bound residue formation increases with increasing DOM/CBZ ratios. Photochemically induced bound residue formation of polar contaminants with DOM in the aqueous phase is thus a disregarded pathway along which contaminants can be transformed in the environment. The method presented here offers a new possibility to study the formation of bound residues, which may be of relevance also for other transformation processes in natural waters where radical intermediates are generated.

AB Contamination of water sources by contaminants of emerging concerns, including pharmaceutical compounds, threatens the well-being of human who relies on the water sources. Development of cost-effective adsorbents for maximum removal of these contaminants is important to ensure clean and safe water access. This study demonstrates the reusability of activated carbon synthesized from spent tea leaves (STL-AC) for aspirin adsorption at optimized conditions. The maximum aspirin removal was 98.97% after optimization of process conditions using Response Surface Methodology. The adsorbent can be reused up to five cycles via solvent elution, with aspirin removal percentage above 85%. The repeated adsorption-desorption cycles affected the adsorbent textural properties, however the adsorbent surface chemistry was not affected by the regeneration. The aspirin adsorption proceeds via pore filling together with hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interaction between the aspirin molecules, however electrostatic repulsion between the deprotonated aspirin molecules and negatively charged STL-AC resulted in reduced removal percentage at high solution pH. This study signifies the superior property of STL-AC in adsorptive removal of aspirin, therefore the potential of such adsorbent in treatment of municipal wastewater, as well as hospital and pharmaceutical manufacturing effluents will be investigated.

AB Dimer formation was observed during ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, and confirmed with mass spectrometry, NMR and fluorescence analysis. The dimers were combinations of the two parent molecules or of the parent and the product of photolysis, and had visible color. Radical formation during UV exposure and dissolved oxygen photosensitized reactions played a role in dimer formation. Singlet oxygen formed via photosensitization by photolysis products of diclofenac. It reacted with diclofenac to form an epoxide which is an intermediate in some dimer formation pathways. Quantum yield of photolysis for diclofenac was 0.21 +/- 0.02 and 0.19 +/- 0.02 for UV irradiation from medium pressure and low pressure mercury vapor lamps, respectively. Band pass filter experiments revealed that the quantum yield is constant at wavelengths >200 nm. The same dimers formed in laboratory grade water when either of the two UV sources was used. Dimers did not form in wastewater effluent matrix, and diclofenac epoxide molecules may have formed bonds with organic matter rather than each other Implications for the importance of dimer formation in NOM are discussed.

AB We use life cycle assessment methodology to compare three disposal options for unused pharmaceuticals: (i) incineration after take-back to a pharmacy, (ii) wastewater treatment after toilet disposal, and (iii) landfilling or incineration after trash disposal. For each option, emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment (API emissions) are estimated along with nine other types of emissions to air and water (non-API emissions). Under a scenario with 50% take-back to a pharmacy and 50% trash disposal, current API emissions are expected to be reduced by 93%. This is within 6% of a 100% trash disposal scenario, which achieves an 88% reduction. The 50% take-back scenario achieves a modest reduction in API emissions over a 100% trash scenario while increasing most non-API emissions by over 300%. If the 50% of unused pharmaceuticals not taken-back are toileted instead of trashed, all emissions increase relative to 100% trash disposal. Evidence suggests that 50% participation in take-back programs could be an upper bound. As a result, we recommend trash disposal for unused pharmaceuticals. A 100% trash disposal program would have similar API emissions to a take-back program with 50% participation, while also having significantly lower non-API emissions, lower financial costs, higher convenience, and higher compliance rates.

AB Hospitals are the main source of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) released into the environment. Generally, their discharges are co-treated with domestic wastewaters, resulting in a decrement of the recalcitrant compound concentrations in the final effluent due to water dilution. However, as many PhCs resist normal treatments, pollutant load does not change. This paper compares the chemical characteristics of hospital and domestic wastewaters on the basis of an experimental investigation for macro-pollutants and literature data for PhCs. A membrane biological reactor pilot plant fed by a hospital effluent is tested in order to evaluate the feasibility of treating these kinds of wastewaters with membrane systems. The paper then presents the possible scenarios in the management of the effluent of a large hospital situated in a small town. In particular, it reports on a case study of designing a (new) treatment plant for the effluent of the 900 bed hospital in Ferrara, Northern Italy, located on the outskirts of the town. Finally, costs for the intervention are given.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) chemical degradation is a low-cost, environmentally friendly, and sustainable wastewater treatment technology. In this study, we designed an airlift photoreactor with internal circulation and explored the effect of its flow characteristics (hydrodynamics) on the reaction to improve the degradation efficiency of pollutants in water. The continuous flow vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/UV method was used to evaluate the degradation ability of pollutants in the reactor in terms of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), mass transfer, and photoreaction kinetic models. Results show that the turbulence intensity and circulation effect in the reactor are ideal in the range of gas flow rate used in this study, and the chance of UV radiation can be effectively improved. The formation of OH radicals and the decomposition efficiency of methylene blue (MB) in the VUV/UV process is strongly correlated with the mixing strength in the reactor. The computational results of the CFD model are close to the experimental results, but the efficiency of CFD in MB processing is higher than the experimental results. This finding is because the scavenger effect of MB decomposition by-products is not fully considered in CFD kinetic analysis.

AB The widely used carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most persistent pharmaceuticals and suffers insufficient removal efficiency by conventional wastewater treatment. A synthesized Co-based perovskite (LaCoO3) was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in order to degrade CBZ. Results showed that LaCoO3 exhibited an excellent performance in PMS activation and CBZ degradation at neutral pH, with low cobalt leaching. The results of FT-IR and XPS verified the high structurally and chemically stability of LaCoO3 in PMS activation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis suggested the generation of radical species, such as sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Radical quenching experiments further revealed the responsibility of SO4 center dot- as the dominant oxidant for CBZ oxidation. Ten products were detected via the oxidation of CBZ, with the olefinic double bond attacked by SO4- as the initial step. Hydroxylation, hydrolysis, cyclization and dehydration were involved along the transformation of CBZ. The toxicity of CBZ solution was significantly reduced after treating by PMS/LaCoO3.

AB The pharmaceutical industry generates wastewater discharges of varying characteristics and contaminant concentrations depending on the nature of the production process. The main chemicals present in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants-such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)-and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the geno- and cytotoxicity induced in the common carp Cyprinus carpio by the effluent emanating from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. Carp were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL, 0.1173%) for 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and biomarkers of genotoxicity (comet assay and micronucleus test) and cytotoxicity (caspase-3 activity and TUNEL assay) were evaluated. A significant increase with respect to the control group (p < 0.05) occurred with all biomarkers from 24 h on. Significant positive correlations were found between NSAID concentrations and biomarkers of geno- and cytotoxicity, as well as among geno- and cytotoxicity biomarkers. In conclusion, exposure to this industrial effluent induces geno- and cytotoxicity in blood of C. carpio. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An anaerobic multichamber bed reactor (AMCBR) was effective in removing both molasses-chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC). The maximum COD and OTC removals were 99% in sequential AMCBR/completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at an OTC concentration of 300 mg L-1. 51%, 29% and 9% of the total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) was composed of acetic, propionic acid and butyric acids, respectively. The OTC loading rates at between 22.22 and 133.33 g OTC m(-3) d(-1) improved the hydrolysis of molasses-COD (k), the maximum specific utilization of molasses-COD (k(mh)) and the maximum specific utilization rate of TVFA (k(TVFA)). The direct effect of high OTC loadings (155.56 and -177.78 g OTC m(-3) d(-1)) on acidogens and methanogens were evaluated with Haldane inhibition kinetic. A significant decrease of the Haldane inhibition constant was indicative of increases in toxicity at increasing loading rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research projects have shown a good suitability of the ozonation process to transform trace concentrations of most pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The concentrations of carbamazepine and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, for instance, were reduced below their detection limits by use of ozone dosages resulting in a specific ozone consumption of 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOCO. At the same time a good disinfection performance was achieved. The given hygienic requirements of the EU bathing water directive (e.g. 2,000N/100 mL faecal coliforms) are fulfilled without the formation of bromate (< 10 mu g/L). As technical control parameter of the ozonation process usually the residual ozone in the liquid phase or in the off-gas are used. However, at very low specific ozone consumptions, ozone reacts instantaneously with dissolved compounds and cannot be detected. Hence, alternative parameters should be used for effective operation control. The present paper evaluates the relation between UVA decrease and the removal of different compounds (endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media), microbial parameters and bromate formation. The results can be used as a guideline for the control of the oxidation performance at large scale ozonation units.

AB Natural dolomite, an inexpensive and vastly available natural material, was demonstrated as a potential heterogeneous photocatalyst for the efficient removal of diphenhydramine (DP) from aqueous solution under simulated solar light in this study. About 65% DP removal and 14% mineralization were achieved with dolomite as a catalyst after 75 min irradiation. The electron spin resonance analysis and scavenger experiments verified that O-1(2), OH, and O-2(-) produced in the dolomite system were the main reactive species responsible for DP degradation. Furthermore, first-principle calculations combined with deoxygenation experiments were employed to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism. The results revealed that the dolomite changed from an insulator to a semiconductor after partial substitution of Mg2+ by Fe2+, suggesting that natural dolomite could act as a semiconductor photocatalyst in photoreactions. Under irradiation, photo-excited electrons and holes separate and migrate to the surface of dolomite, and subsequently react to form reactive species resulting in the DP degradation. Product studies demonstrated that the main degradation pathways of DP included hydroxylation of the aromatic ring as well as hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation of the alkylamine side chain. This work indicated that natural dolomite could be applied in water and wastewater treatment as a promising photocatalyst.

AB Clofibric acid (CLF) is the main pharmacologically active metabolite in composition of the pharmaceutical products used for controlling blood lipid content. This xenobiotic compound is highly persistent in the aquatic environment and passes unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants. A white-rot fungal strain ofTrametes pubescenswas previously selected, for its ability for clofibric acid biodegradation (up to 30%) during cultivation in submerged system under aerobic conditions at an initial CLF concentration of 15 mg L-1. Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used for experimental planning, mathematical modelling and statistical analysis of data of the biotechnological process of CLF biotransformation byTrametes pubescensfungal strain. After optimization, the capacity of the selectedTrametes pubescensstrain to degrade CLF was increased by cultivation in a liquid medium containing 3 g center dot L(-1)yeast extract, 15 g center dot L(-1)peptone, 5 g center dot L(-1)glucose and mineral salts, inoculated at 2% (v/v) vegetative inoculum and cultivated at pH 5.5, during 14 days at 25 degrees C and 135 rpm. In these optimized biotechnological conditions, the CLF biotransformation yield was 60%.

AB Increasing global reliance on stormwater control measures to reduce discharge to surface water, increase groundwater recharge, and minimize contaminant delivery to receiving water-bodies necessitates improved understanding of stormwater-contaminant profiles. A multiagency study of organic and inorganic chemicals in urban stormwater from 50 runoff events at 21 sites across the United States demonstrated that stormwater transports substantial mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, bioactive contaminants (pesticides and pharmaceuticals), and other organic chemicals known or suspected to pose environmental health concern. Numerous organic-chemical detections per site (median number of chemicals detected = 73), individual concentrations exceeding 10 000 ng/L, and cumulative concentrations up to 263 000 ng/L suggested concern for potential environmental effects during runoff events. Organic concentrations, loads, and yields were positively correlated with impervious surfaces and highly developed urban catchments. Episodic storm-event organic concentrations and loads were comparable to and often exceeded those of daily wastewater plant discharges. Inorganic chemical concentrations were generally dilute in concentration and did not exceed chronic aquatic life criteria. Methylmercury was measured in 90% of samples with concentrations that ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 ng/L.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are contaminants of emerging concern which are commonly detected in wastewater effluent and which can disrupt the behavior of non-target organisms. In aquatic snails, the righting response is a critical behavior that has been shown to be inhibited by exposure to SSRI-type antidepressants. We exposed marine and freshwater snails to three tricyclic antidepressants (clomipramine, amitriptyline, and imipramine) for 1h and measured righting response time. In the marine mud snail (Ilyanassa obsoleta), all three TCAs significantly increased righting time at concentrations as low as 156g/L. Similarly, in the freshwater snail Leptoxis carinata, all three TCAs increased righting time at concentrations as low as 263g/L. However, exposure to imipramine from 15.8 to 316g/L resulted in significantly faster righting time. Such low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition are characteristics of a hormetic response. We discuss the possible physiological mechanism of action of TCAs and other antidepressants on snail behavior, and the occurrence of non-monotonic, hormetic dose responses to human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

AB Background: Berberine (BBR) is a pharmaceutical chemical with a broad antibacterial spectrum, and its biological treatment has been of research and practical interest. In this study, a pure bacterial strain B16 was isolated from the activated sludge in a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. The aim of the study is to characterize the properties of the strain B16, especially its BBR degradation capability. Methods: The identification of strain B16 was conducted by visual observation, as well as biochemical and phylogenetic analysis. The degradation kinetics of strain B16 was tentatively described by Haldane model. Results: The strain B16 was 100% determined as a Sphingopyxis sp. The kinetic parameters of BBR degradation by strain B16 were as follows: Vmax 54.73 +/- 5.54 mg (g MLSS <bold> h</bold>)(-1), Km 66.68 +/- 8.95 mg L-1, and Ki 43.16 +/- 5.92 mg L-1, with an R-2 of 0.996. Stain B16 exhibited considerable capability of BBR degradation. BBR of initial concentration 40 mg L-1 could be completely degraded in 48 h under optimal conditions. Conclusions: strain B16 was the first pure culture found with the ability to totally mineralize BBR, indicating the potential of B16 application in real industrial processes.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent which has been frequently detected in the environment. In this paper, the biodegradation of triclosan after radiation-induced advanced oxidation was investigated. The results show that the removal efficiency of triclosan in the combined irradiation and biological treatment process ranged from 88% to 97%, depending on the absorbed dose, while it was only 54% in the single biological treatment process. The removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) was in the range of 53.1%,-59.2% at dose of 1-5 kGy in the combined irradiation and biological treatment process. In comparison, the removal efficiency of TOC in the single biological treatment process was 24.5%, suggesting that irradiation can enhance the mineralization of triclosan. The dechlorination efficiency of triclosan ranged from 48.6% to 78.4% at dose of 1-5 kGy. The intermediates of triclosan degradation were tentatively identified by LC-MS analysis and the possible degradation pathway was proposed. Based on the above results, the combined irradiation and biological treatment process could be an alternative process for treating triclosan-containing wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Antibiotic contamination in drinking water sources has been increasingly prominent in recent years. The water quality in the Chongqing area is not only essential for the local people but also is crucial for the downstream of Yangzi River. To understand the level of antibiotic contamination in the large-scale drinking water sources, this study measured antibiotic residues in nine large-scale drinking water sources (five urban drinking water sources and four township drinking water sources) in Chongqing area of the Yangtze River. Results demonstrated that eight antibiotics of three categories in total were detected, including sulfonamide metformin (SMX), sulfonamide metformin (SMZ), erythromycin (ERM), Roxithromycin (ROM), Tylosin (TYL), Lincomycin (LIN), Chloramphenicol (CAP), and Florfenicol (FF). The mass concentration of antibiotic residues in five urban drinking water sources ranged from 13.9 to 76.6 ng/L, with an average of 46.4 ng/L, and that in four township drinking water sources ranged from 20.6 to 188.1 ng/L, with an average of 88.45 ng/L. The mass concentrations of antibiotic residues in Chongqing area were much lower than those in other cities. Antibiotics posed the maximum risk with a value of 0.005 for 0-3 months of the infant. The risk quotients of antibiotic residues in all water sources were much lower than 1 and thus did not pose a direct threat to human health.

AB Municipal biosolids provide organic matter to soil, and nutrients essential for crop growth. Some contaminants of standing and emerging concern such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, brominated flame retardants, and highly persistent perfluoroalkyl acids are not fully removed in the waste treatment process; and thus, they are often found in resultant biosolids applied to land. This paper provides an overview of selected research led by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on monitoring and predicting the fate and transport of these noted contaminants in field soil-hydrological environments following land applications of dewatered and liquid municipal biosolids. Different land application practices were examined in the context of their potential to reduce environmental exposure. Field studies of liquid/slurry municipal biosolids demonstrated that in macroporous soils contaminants of all types can rapidly reach shallow groundwater and tile drainage systems. Nevertheless, loads of contaminants in subsurface (tile) drainage can be significantly reduced if an aeration-based pre-tillage is employed. For dewatered municipal biosolids, directly injecting biosolids into subsoil had an indifferent effect upon water contamination, when compared with traditional surface application methods. For very high single applications of dewatered municipal biosolids to land, compounds such as the antifungal miconazole, the PBDE congener BDE 209, and perfluorooctanoic acids, for example, can persist in biosolid aggregates. Yet, for modestly macroporous soils, most of these compounds will not enter critical subsurface water receptors.

AB The objective of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of different Advanced Oxidation Processes based on solar and ultraviolet C radiation to remove the antibiotic tinidazole (TNZ) from water. Specifically the systems studied were: UVC, solar radiation, UVC/H2O2, solar/H2O2, UVC/K2S2O8, solar/K2S2O8, UVC/photo-Fenton and solar/photo-Fenton. Some aspects of these processes such as the degradation percentage of TNZ, its mineralisation degree, and the degradation products, were analysed. The direct photodegradation of TNZ showed low yields, with a removal percentage lower than 50%. With the UVC/H2O2 system, the percentage of TNZ degraded increased with the H2O2 concentration, but when solar radiation was used, the addition of H2O2 did not favour the process efficiency. The UVC/K2S2O8 system was more efficient than UVC/H2O2 for TNZ degradation. The presence of K2S2O8 in the solar photodegradation also enhanced TNZ degradation in comparison to the direct photolysis process. In the photo-Fenton systems, for both UVC and solar radiations, high levels of TNZ degradation and mineralisation were obtained. Therefore, the photo-Fenton systems are the most recommended to treat water contaminated with TNZ. Some clues of the mineralisation process appear from the degradation products detected by means of coupled ultra-pressure liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.

AB This study reports the removal of amoxicillin (AMX) in aqueous media using the electro-Fenton process in the presence of a graphite cathode recovered from used batteries. The impact of the relevant parameters on the electro-Fenton process, namely the applied current intensity, the temperature, the initial concentration of AMX and the initial concentration of ferrous ions were investigated. The results showed that the optimal values were: I = 600 mA, T = 25 degrees C, [AMX](0) = 0.082 mmol.L-1 and [Fe2+] = 1 mmol.L-1, leading to 95% degradation and 74% mineralization. The model parameters of AMX mineralization were determined using nonlinear methods, showing that it follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic. The Energy consumption (EC) calculated under the optimal values was found to be 0.79 kW.h.g(-1), which was of the same order of magnitude of those reported in other findings; while it is noteworthy that the electrodes used in our study are of a lower cost.

AB Knowledge of exposure to a wide range of chemicals, and the spatio-temporal variability thereof, is urgently needed in the context of protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems. This paper discusses a computational material flow analysis to predict the occurrence of thousands of man-made organic chemicals on a European scale, based on a novel temporally and spatially resolved modelling framework. The goal was to increase understanding of pressures by emerging chemicals and to complement surface water monitoring data. The ambition was to provide a first step towards a "real-life" mixture exposure situation accounting for as many chemicals as possible. Comparison of simulated concentrations and chemical monitoring data for 226 substance/basin combinations showed that the simulated concentrations were accurate on average. For 65% and 90% of substance/basin combinations the error was within one and two orders of magnitude respectively. An analysis of the relative importance of uncertainties revealed that inaccuracies in use volume or use type information contributed most to the error for individual substances. To resolve this, we suggest better registration of use types of industrial chemicals, investigation of presence/absence of industrial chemicals in wastewater and runoff samples and more scientific information exchange.

AB In this work, the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 composite was synthesized and was combined with persulfate (PS) for the efficient photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) under visible light. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to characterize the structural and optical properties of the as-prepared catalysts. Active species trapping experiments demonstrated that additional sulfate radicals (center dot SO4-) formed upon the addition of PS which could cooperate with superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), holes (h(+)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) to decompose NOR. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was also formed during the reaction and acted as an important active species. The degradation products of NOR were also identified and analyzed by using LC-MS technology, and the possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed and discussed. This work indicated that the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 coupled with PS displayed promising applications in the field of pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Metoprolol (MTP) is one of pharmaceuticals used for treatment of heart failure and hypertension. It was frequently detected in wastewater samples either influent or effluent. The application of graphite-PVC composite as anode was investigated for the degradation of metoprolol in the presence of strong electrolyte such as sodium chloride (NaCl). The degradation rate was strongly influenced by initial concentrations of metoprolol, NaCl concentration and applied voltage. An initial concentration of 2 mg/L was eliminated more than 95% after 30 min under optimum conditions; 5000 mg/L NaCl and 5 V. The consumption energy of the electrochemical reaction was 0.665 Wh/mg for metoprolol after 30 min. The kinetic rate constant of metoprolol could be ranged between 0.0016 and 0.0801 min(-1). The electrochemical degradation efficiency of metoprolol and its by-products has been achieved. The degradation of metoprolol produced four transformated products as investigated and elucidated using liquid chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The proposed degradation pathway of metoprolol was schemed on the base of the identified intermediates.

ID ANTIBIOTICS
AB Many pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are being found in surface and ground waters, indicating their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes for the transformation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid in water are alternatives to traditional water treatment. Therefore the kinetics of oxidation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid by diperiodatoargentate(III) in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.04 mol dm(-3) was studied spectrophotometrically at 25 degrees C. The oxidation products, 2-formyl-5,5-dimethylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and Ag(I), were identified by LC-ESI-MS and IR spectral studies. The reaction between 6-aminopenicillanic acid and diperiodatoargentate(1111) in alkaline medium exhibits I: I stoichiometry. The reaction shows first order with respect to diperiodatoargentate(III) concentration. The order with respect to 6-aminopenicillanic acid and alkali concentrations is less than unity. The rate goes on decreasing with the increase in the concentration of periodate. Monoperiodatoargentate(III) is considered the active species of the diperiodatoargentate(111). A possible mechanism is proposed. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of the mechanisms are determined. The activation parameters with respect to the slow step of the mechanism are calculated and discussed. The thermodynamic quantities are also determined.

AB With the growth of both the pharmaceutical industry and the human population and longevity, more drugs are used and processed each day. Inevitably, these pharmaceuticals enter wastewater through human excretion and improper disposal of leftovers. One such medication, diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is of importance due to its widespread consumption, and prevalence in aquatic environments. To study the sub-lethal effects of diltiazem on aquatic animals, we investigated its impacts no feeding behaviour, heart rate, respiration, growth, and reproduction of a bioindicator species, Daphnia magna. When exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, D. magna increased their heart rate by 12% and oxygen consumption by 48%. However, exposure did not have any effects on thoracic limb movement frequency or peristalsis (i.e. feeding behaviour). Individuals exposed to diltiazem for a longer duration (16 days) showed a 44% decrease in lipid reserves and produced between 17 and 28% fewer neonates which were 10-12% larger. Our study demonstrated that exposure to diltiazem creates an energy imbalance in D. magna which could, in the long run, influence their populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inefficient visible light photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, such as acetaminophen (ACE) and triclosan (TS), is one of the main limiting factors for implementing cost-effective metal oxide photocatalyst for large-scale deployment. Here, a highly efficient CuO thin film photocatalyst is developed through rapid thermal annealing. The CuO thin film is decorated with Pd nanostructures for enhanced visible light degradation of ACE and TS. It is shown that compared to the as-deposited thin CuO film photocatalyst, the rapid thermal assisted CuO photocatalyst can significantly enhance charge generation and separation efficiency through improvement of crystallinity and reduction of recombination centres. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of Pd nanostructures can considerably increase optical absorption, which further improve the photocatalytic performance through the enhancement of surface plasmon resonance. The CuO film with the 40 s of Pd sputtering (Pd40-CuO) shows the highest performance for photocatalytic degradation of both ACE and TS. The Pd40-CuO film shows good stability and does not show any considerable reduction in photocatalytic activity after five cycles. This indicates the high potential of Pd40-CuO for water and wastewater treatment on industrial scale.

AB An environment-friendly iodine and potassium co-doped g-C3N4 (IK-C3N4) photocatalyst was synthesized via the co-pyrolysis of urea and potassium iodate. Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the physical, thermal and chemical characteristics of the as-synthesized photo catalyst. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was used as a representative antibiotic pollutant. SMX removal by IK-C3N4 photocatalysts exceeded 99% (similar to 23 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4) within 45 min of visible light irradiation. The kinetics of SMX removal was analyzed with respect to solution pH, photocatalyst dosage and initial SMX concentration. Experimental data was found to fit the pseudo-first order kinetics and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. The reuse of the photocatalyst up to 3 consecutive photo degradation cycles gave a minimal decline in SMX removal while the structure and the crystallinity of the nanomaterials remained unchanged. Overall, morphology engineering of conventional bulk graphitic carbon nitride can produce highly efficient photocatalysts for the decontamination of antibiotics in the aqueous environment.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are two of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical compounds in water and are hardly removed by biological treatment systems. The presence of H2O2 was investigated in the ozonation of these two compounds. Experiments were carried out with both using distilled water and secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with pharmaceuticals. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) abatement rate improved when H2O2 was added at the beginning of the ozonation process and when the ozone inlet concentration increased, attaining a maximum value of 91% and simultaneously a lower ozone waste for a H2O2 initial concentration of 5mM and an ozone inlet concentration of 20gNm(-3). For these operation conditions, the water matrix has no significant impact on SMX and DCF removal, which were totally degraded in 45 and 60min, respectively. Nevertheless, lower COD degradation and ozone usage were obtained when the secondary effluent was used. Inorganic ions such as chloride, sulphate and nitrate and short-chain organic compounds were detected as by-products of the SMX and DCF oxidation. Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and H2O2 reduced acute toxicity.

AB This study characterizes the extracellular polymeric substances and bacterial community composition of aerobic granules exposed to cefalexin (CLX). The presence of CLX potentially decreases granular stabilities, resulting in a lowered granule diameter. Chemical oxygen demand and NH4+-N removal efficiencies were slightly decreased and the denitrification process was inhibited with CLX addition. Extracellular polymeric substance contents were significantly increased in aerobic granules exposed to CLX. The shifts of fluorescence intensities and peak locations in 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicated changes of EPS components. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed aerobic granules with CLX addition in synthetic wastewater had superior diversity of microbial species, and this was the reason that the level and components of EPS changed. The species richness for bacteria was increased from 341 to 352, which was revealed by Chao1. The Shannon index of diversity rose slightly from 3.59 to 3.73 with CLX addition. The abundance of Proteobacteria significantly decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi underwent a highly significant increase in aerobic granules exposed to CLX.

AB The environmental fate and persistence of steroidal estrogens is influenced by their photodegradation. This can potentially occur both in the presence of the ultraviolet (UV) portion of solar radiation and in tertiary wastewater treatment plants that use UV radiation for disinfection purposes. To determine patterns of UV photodegradation for estrone (E1) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), water samples containing these compounds were exposed to levels of UVB radiation that would simulate exposure to ambient sunlight. E1 degraded with a pseudo-first-order rate law constant that was directly proportional to UVB radiation intensity (R-2 = 0.999, P < 0.001) and inversely proportional to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (R-2 = 0.812, P = 0.037). DOC acted as a competitive inhibitor to direct photolysis of E1 by UV. In contrast to E1, EE2 was more persistent under similar UVB treatment. A reporter gene assay showed that the estrogenicity of UVB-exposed estrogens did not decrease relative to non-UVB-exposed estrogens, suggesting that some of the photoproducts may also have estrogenic potency. These results show that environmental degradation rates of steroidal estrogens are predictable from the UV intensity reaching surface waters, and the DOC concentrations in these surface waters.

We report an environmental application of the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation, a method widely used in pharmacology to study drug interactions, to determine the nature of toxicological interactions of three fibrates toward two aquatic bioluminescent organisms, Vibrio fischeri and the self-luminescent cyanobacterial recombinant strain Anabaena CPB4337 The combination index-isobologram equation method allows computerized quantitation of synergism, additive effect and antagonism In the Vibrio test, the fibrate combinations showed antagonism at low effect levels that turned into an additive effect or synergism at higher effect levels, by contrast, in the Anabaena test, the fibrate combinations showed a strong synergism at the lowest effect levels and a very strong antagonism at high effect levels We also evaluated the nature of the interactions of the three fibrates with a real wastewater sample in the cyanobacterial test We propose that the combination index-isobologram equation method can serve as a useful tool in ecotoxicological assessment (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Olive mill waste water (OMWW) is a major environmental issue in the Mediterranean. We address this problem by investigating the wastes for the presence of biologically active compounds already detected in both olive oil and pomace. Two initial OMWW samples were filtered using two microporous filtering media: (a) clayey diatomite and (b) zeolitic volcanic tuffs, obtaining three filtered samples from each. All initial and filtrated samples were tested for their activity on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced aggregation. The results showed that the initial samples contain biologically active compounds (PAF inhibitors) and that in their respective last-eluted filtered samples these compounds are purified. These eluted samples, along with their corresponding initial OMWW, were further separated with HPLC and the purified fractions responsible for the aforementioned biological activity, were further studied using chemical determinations and MS analysis. It was confirmed that the PAF inhibitor present in these fractions resembles the one isolated from olive oil. These results offer a new approach on the OMWW handling by offering an alternative use of this waste as starting material for nutritional and/or pharmaceutical purposes in the future.

AB Nanorod (NR) arrays offer commendable visible-light-driven photocatalytic performances. Herein, we describe the construction of a ternary ZnO-ZnS-Gd(2)S(3)nanostructural array in which a sulfidation process is used to decorate a Gd(2)S(3)shell layer with a ZnS interface over vapor-phase-grown vertically-aligned ZnO. With control over the shell-wall thickness, the shell layer of similar to 25 nm wall thickness on the ultra-long ZnO NR arrays exhibited a higher catalytic efficiency close to 3.3, 2.0, 1.2, and 1.8 times those of the bare ZnO, the ZnO-ZnS, the Gd2S3-decorated (similar to 10 nm) and Gd(2)S(3)shell-layered (similar to 40 nm) ZnO-ZnS core-shell structures, respectively. The core-shell geometry and the shell-wall thickness with maximized contact interface afforded increased light absorption in the visible region and effectively retarded the recombination rate of the photoinduced charge carriers by confining electrons and holes separately, thus providing advantages in terms of the degradation of the pharmaceutical residue tetracycline and the industrial pollutant 4-nitrophenol in wastewater.

AB This study examined the performance of natural clinoptilolite (NC) modified with two surfactants of Triton X-100 (NC-Triton) and Tween 80 (NC-Tween) on apramycin (APR) adsorption from wastewater in batch and continues systems. The optimum pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature were achieved. The findings revealed that the sorption was best described using the Langmuir isotherm compared to other isotherms. The maximum adsorption capacity of NC-Triton was greater than NC and NC-Tween. The lumped method was applied to solve the fixed-bed equations; predict breakthrough curve; determine axial dispersion coefficient and overall mass transfer coefficient parameters; and compare theoretical results with experimental results. Good fitness of experimental data with kinetic models of intra-particle diffusion, pseudo-first-order/liquid film diffusion and pseudo-second-order for NC, NC-Tween and NC-Triton, respectively, indicated that they were more suitable than the other models. Endothermic and spontaneous processes were resulted from positive enthalpy and negative Gibbs free energy changes, respectively.

AB The presence and final destination of pharmaceutical compounds in waters constitute one of the emerging events in current environmental chemistry. Two widely consumed compounds have been evaluated in this study, amoxicillin (AMOX) and diclofenac (DFC), at a concentration of 200 mg L-1. The presence of both in wastewater has been verified, generating problems in ecosystems and human health. Pyrolysis of hair waste from a tannery process was performed in a fixed-bed reactor. Char was obtained at different operating temperatures (300, 350, 400, and 450 degrees C), which underwent a characterization of heavy metals and elemental composition. An activation process was applied to the char obtained at 450 degrees C by means of physicochemical processes and with two chemical agents (KOH and K2CO3). For the removal of drugs, two separate tests were performed, one for 28 days and the other one for 4 h, to assess the efficiency and the percentage of removal. It was found that the char obtained at 450 degrees C is the one that removes most of both compounds: more than 90% of AMOX and more than 80% of DFC.

AB Recently, many studies highlighted the consistent finding of irbesartan in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in some rivers and lakes in both Europe and North America, suggesting that no >80% can be removed by specific treatments. The present investigation attempts to study the chemical fate of irbesartan in a simulated chlorination step, mimicking the conditions of a WWTP. A total of six disinfection by-products were identified, five were completely new, and separated on a C-18 column by employing a gradient HPLC method. Initially, a complete mass fragmentation pathway of the drug was established with the help of MS/TOF, and subsequently, the disinfection by-products were subjected to MS/TOF mass studies to obtain their mass and fragment pattern. The MS results helped to assign tentative structures to the disinfection products, which were verified through 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The chemical structures of the new compounds have been justified by a proposed mechanism of formation. A preliminary ecotoxicity assessment with the crustacean Daphnia rnagna showed that some of the identified by-products were up to 12-times more toxic than rbesartan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The fate of six human-use drugs was assessed and predicted in mesocosms designed to mimic shallow constructed wetlands during the onset of fall and senescence. Mesocosms were monitored for 28 days after the addition of carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine and naproxen (nominal initial concentrations of 5 mu g/L each), sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine (nominal initial concentrations of 150 mu g/L each), with and without phosphorous (P) addition at 1.6 mg/L. We hypothesized that addition of P would stimulate primary productivity and enhance removal of pharmaceuticals from the water column. Carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine, and naproxen had half-lives of 8.7, 11, 1.5, and 2.5, and 8.6, 11.0, 1.4, and 2.5 days in treatments with and without P amendment, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine had half-lives of 17 and 4.9 days in mesocosms with P amendment and 17 and 4.7 days without amendment. A concurrent pulse of P with pharmaceuticals did not significantly enhance the removal of these compounds. Predicted half-lives from modeling efforts were consistent with observed values, with photolysis the greatest contributor to chemical attenuation.

TI Urban contributions of glyphosate and its degradate AMPA to streams in

AB Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world, being routinely applied to control weeds in both agricultural and urban settings. Microbial degradation of glyphosate produces aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA). The high polarity and water-solubility of glyphosate and AMPA has, until recently, made their analysis in water samples problematic. Thus, compared to other herbicides (e.g. atrazine) there are relatively few studies on the environmental occurrence of glyphosate and AMPA. In 2002, treated effluent samples were collected from 10 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to study the occurrence of glyphosate and AMPA. Stream samples were collected upstream and downstream of the 10 WWTPs. Two reference streams were also sampled. The results document the apparent contribution of WWTP effluent to stream concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, with roughly a two-fold increase in their frequencies of detection between stream samples collected upstream and those collected downstream of the WWTPs. Thus, urban use of glyphosate contributes to glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in streams in the United States. Overall, AMPA was detected much more frequently (67.5%) compared to glyphosate (17.5%). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrafiltration techniques with membranes of pore sizes under 100 nm have been widely applied in drinking water, wastewater, semiconductor and pharmaceutical process water treatments for nanoparticle (NP) and pathogen removal. The most direct way to evaluate the membrane performance is to experimentally obtain the size fractional retention efficiency. However, the real-life performance of the membrane in terms of fouling (or loading) characteristics and the effects of the concentration of challenging particles and rate of flux (or filtration velocities) on the filtration efficiency during fouling have not been well understood. In this study, systematic filtration experiments for filtration efficiency at clean and loaded conditions were conducted for three different 50 nm rated membrane filters, including PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), PCTE (Polycarbonate Track-Etched) and MCE (Mixed Cellulose Ester) membranes, against 5, 10 and 20 nm Au NPs at different feed concentrations and fluxes. The results showed that the effects of feed concentration and flux are significant. This study provides important insights of retention mechanisms and efficiency for different ultrafiltration membrane structures at varied filtration velocities and fouling characteristics giving clear directions of future NP ultrafiltration research.

AB This study elucidates the impact of draw solution chemistry (in terms of pH and draw solute species) and membrane fouling on water flux and the rejection of trace organic contaminants by forward osmosis. The results show that draw solution chemistry could induce a notable impact on both water flux and TrOCs rejection. In addition, the impact was further influenced by membrane fouling. The reverse flux of proton (or hydroxyl) could alter the feed solution pH, which governed the separation of ionisable TrOCs. In addition, charged compounds generally exhibited higher rejections than neutral ones by the clean membrane. Electrostatic interaction, rather than size exclusion, was therefore the dominant rejection mechanism for most compounds. There was also a weak correlation between rejection and molecular sizes of the 43 TrOCs. Compared with Na+, Li+ with a larger hydrated radius showed a significantly lower reverse salt flux, resulting in a lower ionic strength and therefore a stronger electrostatic interaction. A fouling cake layer consisted of low molecular weight neutral organics could also affect TrOC rejection due to pore blockage and cake-enhanced concentration polarisation.

AB The growing urbanization in urban centers have continuously contributed to the deterioration of water quality in rivers. The use of caffeine as a chemical tracer for anthropic activities is an approach to the environmental monitoring of urban waterbodies, as its use is limited to humans and less susceptible to sampling error comparing to other traditional parameters for anthropic pollution. To analyze the possibility of using caffeine as a water quality parameter, the anthropic influence over three watersheds (Atuba, Belem and Palmital) from the Greater Curitiba was observed over five sampling campaigns. The caffeine was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem diode array detection, after the solid phase extraction. Traditional parameters of water quality monitoring, such as ammoniacal nitrogen, thermotolerant coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate, were measured for comparison. The results indicate anthropic influence over the basins, probably due to the lack of infrastructure, thus leading to the assumption of untreated domestic wastewater being discharged. The most degraded river was the Belem river (caffeine concentration of 23.08 mu g.L-1). Caffeine presented itself as an appropriate approach for environmental monitoring, presenting a good correlation with the traditional parameters, such as for thermotolerant coliforms (R = 0.7375).

AB Sample extraction is a major step in environmental analyses due both to the high complexity of matrices and to the low concentration of the target analytes. Sample extraction is usually expensive, laborious, time-consuming and requires a high amount of organic solvents. Actually, there is a lack of miniaturized methodologies for sample extraction and chiral analyses. Here, we developed a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) to extract the pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol, as models of basic chiral compounds, from wastewater samples. Compounds were then analysed by enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography. We monitored the influence of sample pH, extracting and dispersive solvent and respective volumes, salt addition, extracting and vortexing time. The DLLME method was validated within the range of 1-10 A mu g L-1 for fluoxetine enantiomers and 0.5-10 A mu g L-1 for metoprolol enantiomers. Accuracy ranged from 90.6 to 106 % and recovery rates from 54.5 to 81.5 %. Relative standard deviation values lower than 7.84 and 9.00 % were obtained for intra- and inter-batch precision, respectively.

ID WASTE-WATER; RETENTION; ANTIBIOTICS; REJECTION
AB This study explored the removal of five veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) (sulfamethoxazole (SMETOX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), dexamethasone (DEXA) and febantel (FEBA)) from different water matrices (Milli-Q water, model water, tap water and real pharmaceutical wastewater using four types of nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NF90, NF270, NF and HL) and two reverse osmosis (RO) membranes (LFC-1 and XLE). All VPs were added to different water matrices at a concentration of 10 mg/L. Rejections of VPs and water flux were measured. The rejection increased with increase of molecular weight. The highest rejections were obtained with RO membranes (LFC-1, XLE) and tight NF (NF90) membrane. In general, the rejection of VPs was higher in model water and tap water than in Milli-Q water, but the water flux was lower. This was mainly explained by ion adsorption inside the membranes pores. Narrower pore size counteracted the effect of presence of low concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) in tap water. The NOM was assumed to enhance the adsorption of VPs onto membrane surface, increased the size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion also appeared during the transport. Investigated water matrices had influence on water flux decline due to their complexity.

AB The catalytic ozonation of fenofibric acid was studied using activated alumina and alumina-supported manganese oxide in a semicontinuous reactor. The rate constants at 20 degrees C for the non-catalytic reaction of fenofibric acid with ozone and hydroxyl radicals were 3.43 +/- 0.20 M-1 s(-1) and (6.55 +/- 0.33) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The kinetic constant for the catalytic reaction between fenofibric acid and hydroxyl radicals did not differ significantly from that of homogeneous zonation, either using Al2O3 or MnOx/Al2O3. The results showed a considerable increase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals clue to the use of catalysts even in the case of catalytic runs performed using a real wastewater matrix. Both catalysts promoted the decomposition of ozone in homogeneous phase, but the higher production of hydroxyl radicals corresponded to the catalyst with more activity in terms of ozone decomposition. We did not find evidence of the catalysts having any effect on rate constants, which suggests that the reaction may not involve the adsorption of organics on catalyst surface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A mathematical model has been developed and calibrated for a two-stage (A + B) activated sludge pilot plant treating wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical industry. Two series of simulations have been performed: (a) by using typical values for the parameters of the model from the bibliography, which remain constant with time, and (b) by using, for some parameters, values which are variable with time, and are determined following a specific methodology. The calibration is constrained to be exactly consistent with daily observations of COD from the effluent and reactor suspended solids (MLSS). Three internal parameters of the system were thus obtained in their daily variation: MLSS growth rate, specific substrate removal rate and concentration factor in: the settling tank. Mean values obtained for MLSS growth rate were 0.73 d(-1) and 0.022 d(-1) for reactors A and a respectively, and the average observed biomass yield coefficient was 0.38 (reactor A) and 0.21 (reactor B). The model infered the evolution of the COD and MLSS with a fairly good accuracy, proving that the method used to obtain the parameters does not have internal inconsistencies and may be used in other situations.

AB Magnetic carbon nanotube-TiO2 (MCNT-TiO2) composites that rely on the inherent magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes were synthesized and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole under solar irradiation and environmentally relevant conditions. Compared with a TiO2 reference catalyst, the MCNT-TiO2 composites exhibited a higher photodegradation rate due to the high surface area and extended visible light absorption. The photodegradation rate constants for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in pure water were (similar to)1.5 and (similar to)1.2 times greater than those for TiO2, respectively. The catalysts were tested in the presence of natural organic matter and rapid photodegradation rates for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were observed relative to bare TiO2, indicating that MCNT-TiO2 may be suitable for practical applications. Solar and UVC reactivation were used to recover the photocatalytic activity, and UVC irradiation was more efficient and maintained the performance of MCNT-TiO2 for consecutive treatment cycles. MCNT-TiO2 with its unique fast kinetics and high photodegradation activity toward micropollutants exhibits great potential as an alternative method for water and wastewater treatment.

AB Diclofenac is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and the receiving water bodies. In this study, biogenic Pd nanoparticles (bio-Pd) were successfully applied in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for the catalytic reduction of diclofenac. Hydrogen gas was produced in the cathodic compartment, and consumed as a hydrogen donor by the bio-Pd on the graphite electrodes. In this way, complete dechlorination of 1 mg diclofenac l-1 was achieved during batch recirculation experiments, whereas no significant removal was observed in the absence of the biocatalyst. The complete dechlorination of diclofenac was demonstrated by the concomitant production of 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA). Through the addition of -0.8 V to the circuit, continuous and complete removal of diclofenac was achieved in synthetic medium at a minimal HRT of 2 h. Continuous treatment of hospital WWTP effluent containing 1.28 mu g diclofenac l-1 resulted in a lower removal efficiency of 57%, which can probably be attributed to the affinity of other environmental constituents for the bio-Pd catalyst. Nevertheless, reductive catalysis coupled to sustainable hydrogen production in a MEC offers potential to lower the release of micropollutants from point-sources such as hospital WWTPs.

AB Lincosamides are among the most frequently detected antibacterial agents in effluents from wastewater treatment plants and surface runoff at agricultural production systems. Little is known about their transformations in the environment This study revealed that manganese oxide caused rapid and extensive decomposition of clindamycin and lincomycin in aqueous solution. The reactions occurred mainly at the pyranose ring of lincosamides, initially by formation of complexes with Mn and cleavage of the ether linkage, leading to the formation of a variety of degradation products via subsequent hydrolytic and oxidative reactions. The results of LC-MS/MS and FTIR analysis confirm cleavage of the C-O-C bond in the pyranose ring, formation of multiple carbonyl groups, and transformation of the methylthio moiety to sulfur oxide. The overall transformation was controlled by interactions of cationic species of lincosamides with MnO2 surfaces. The presence of electrolytes (i.e., NaCl, CaCl2, and MnCl2) and dissolved organic matter in aqueous solution, and increase of solution pH, diminished lincosamide binding to MnO2 hence reducing the rate and magnitude of the transformations. Results from this study indicate that manganese dioxides in soils and sediments could contribute to the decomposition of lincosamide antibiotics released into the environment.

AB Phosphate is essential for food production. However, phosphate rock, which is the main natural source, is becoming worse in quality due to the depletion of the reserves and contamination with heavy metals and radioactive elements. Marketable phosphate contains more than 13 wt% of phosphorus (P), but run-of-the-mine phosphate rock is of lower grade (8 to 11 wt% of P). In this study, calcium phosphate granules (CaP granules) produced during anaerobic treatment of vacuum collected black water (feces and urine, BW) were assessed for their potential as a substitute for phosphate rock. The quality assessment was based on elemental composition (macro nutrients and heavy metals), crystallography and morphology analyses, dissolution tests, and quantification of micropollutants. CaP granules contained 10 wt% of P, from which 35% was dissolved within 5 min in citric acid and 85% in H2SO4. The incineration of the CaP granules increased the P content to 15 wt%, by eliminating the remaining organics (29%), pathogens, and organic micropollutants. Heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, As, and Pb) and organic micropollutants in CaP granules were below the Dutch and European regulatory limits for direct fertilizer application. Moreover, incinerated CaP granules complied with the requirements for use in the fertilizer industry. At the current process conditions, CaP granules produced from BW can potentially replace 12% of the phosphate rock used in agriculture as fertilizer.

AB Low river discharges of the rivers Rhine and Meuse are expected to occur more often and more prolonged in a changing climate. During these dry periods the dilution of point sources such as sewage effluents is reduced leading to a decline in chemical water quality. This study projects chemical water quality of the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the year 2050, based on projections of chemical emissions and two climate scenarios: moderate and fast climate change. It focuses on specific compounds known to be relevant to drinking water production, i.e. four pharmaceuticals, a herbicide and its metabolite and an artificial sweetener. Hydrological variability, climate change, and increased emission show a significant influence on the water quality in the Rhine and Meuse. The combined effect of changing future emissions of these compounds and reduced dilution due to climate change has leaded to increasing ( peak) concentrations in the river water by a factor of two to four. Current water treatment efficiencies in the Netherlands are not sufficient to reduce these projected concentrations in drinking water produced from surface water below precautionary water target values. If future emissions are not sufficiently reduced or treatment efficiencies are not improved, these compounds will increasingly be found in drinking water, albeit at levels which pose no threat to human health.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter the soil environment when animal slurries and sewage sludge are applied to land as a fertiliser or during irrigation with contaminated water. These pharmaceuticals may then be taken up by soil organisms possibly resulting in toxic effects and/or exposure of organisms higher up the food chain. This study investigated the influence of soil properties on the uptake and deputation of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine and orlistat) in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals into E. fetida changed depending on soil type. Orlistat exhibited the highest pore water based bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and displayed the largest differences between soil types with BCFs ranging between 30.5 and 115.9. For carbamazepine, diclofenac and fluoxetine BCFs ranged between 1.1 and 1.6, 7.0 and 69.6 and 14.1 and 20.4 respectively. Additional analysis demonstrated that in certain treatments the presence of these chemicals in the soil matrices changed the soil pH over time, with a statistically significant pH difference to control samples. The internal pH of E. fetida also changed as a result of incubation in pharmaceutically spiked soil, in comparison to the control earthworms. These results demonstrate that a combination of soil properties and pharmaceutical physico-chemical properties are important in terms of predicting pharmaceutical uptake in terrestrial systems and that pharmaceuticals can modify soil and internal earthworm chemistry which may hold wider implications for risk assessment.

AB The lipid regulator gemfibrozil (GEM) is one of many human pharmaceuticals found in the aquatic environment. We previously demonstrated that GEM bioconcentrates in blood and reduces plasma testosterone levels in goldfish (Carassius auratus). In this study, we address the potential of an environmentally relevant waterborne concentration of GEM (1.5 mu g/l) to induce oxidative stress in goldfish liver and whether this may be linked to GEM acting as a peroxisome proliferator (PP). We also investigate the autoregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) as a potential index of exposure. The three PPAR subtypes (alpha, beta, and gamma) were amplified from goldfish liver cDNA. Goldfish exposed to a concentration higher (1500 mu g/l) than environmentally relevant for 14 and 28 days significantly reduce hepatic PPAR beta mRNA levels (p < 0.001). Levels of CYP1A1 mRNA were unchanged. GEM exposure significantly induced the antioxidant defense enzymes catalase (p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase (P < 0.001) and glutathione-S-transferase (p = 0.006) but not acyl-CoA oxidase or glutathione reductase. As GEM exposure failed to increase levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), we conclude that a sub-chronic exposure to GEM upregulates the antioxidant defense status of the goldfish as an adaptive response to this human pharmaceutical.

AB Feminization responses have been observed in some wild populations of fish living in rivers and streams, some of which have been shown to arise as a consequence of exposure to sewage treatment (STP) effluent discharges and the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) they contain which mimic or antagonize the actions of steroid hormones. The synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), commonly used in oral contraceptives, is present in surface waters receiving STP effluents at concentrations ranging from non-detectable to 5 ng/L. Despite extensive evidence that EE2 negatively affects the reproductive health of fishes, relatively little is known about effects at the population level - and especially so for live-bearing fishes. To investigate the potential for such impacts, populations of the least killifish (Heterandria formosa) were exposed to 0 or 5 ng/L EE2. Exposures were started with newborn fish and continued for seven months. Chronic exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 caused significant reductions in population size, in abundances of newborns and males, and in population growth rates. The exposure also resulted in a female-biased sex ratio. However, individuals' survival rates were not affected. This study showed that chronic exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 negatively affected population dynamics in a live-bearing fish, demonstrating that the levels of EE2 detected near STPs have the potential to impact wild populations of these fish.

AB The effects of pig manure, from diets incorporating veterinary pharmaceuticals, on survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida were evaluated. Manures derived from the following diets: corn and soymeal (CS); 85% CS diet + 15% wheat meal (TR); CS diet + 100 ppm doxycycline + 50 ppm colistin + 2500 ppm Zn oxide (CSa); TR diet + 100 ppm doxycycline + 50 ppm colistin + 2500 ppm Zn oxide (TRa). Manures were tested in two subtropical soils representative of southern (Oxisol and Entisol). Despite the antibiotics no significant differences were found between the four manures within each soil. However, strong differences were found on the toxicity between soils. In Oxisol, LC50 values were around 100 m(3) ha(-1), and EC50 values around 80 m(3) ha(-1). In Entisol these were much lower, with LC50 values oscillating around 20 m(3) ha(-1) and EC50 values between 10-15 m(3) ha(-1). The observed toxicity on both soils was attributed to excess of nitrogen, Cu and Zn in the highest doses. The strong difference between soils could be explained by soil properties, namely CEC, organic matter, and clay contents that were lower in Entisol, indicating a poor ability to retain contaminants increasing their availability in soil. Results suggest that the application of these residues should be regulated not only using a volume-based criterion, but should incorporate data on soil properties, complemented by an ecotoxicological assessment.

AB Compost amendment on agricultural soil is a current practice to compensate the loss of organic matter. As a consequence, dissolved organic carbon concentration in soil leachates can be increased and potentially modify the transport of other solutes. This study aims to characterize the processes controlling the mobility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in deep soil layers and their potential impacts on the leaching of organic contaminants (pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds) potentially present in cultivated soils receiving organic waste composts. We sampled undisturbed soil cores in the illuviated horizon (60-90 cm depth) of an Albeluvisol. Percolation experiments were made in presence and absence of DOM with two different pesticides, isoproturon and epoxiconazole, and two pharmaceutical compounds, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. Two types of DOM were extracted from two different soil surface horizons: one sampled in a plot receiving a co-compost of green wastes and sewage sludge applied once every 2 years since 1998 and one sampled in an unamended plot. Results show that DOM behaved as a highly reactive solute, which was continuously generated within the soil columns during flow and increased after flow interruption. DOM significantly increased the mobility of bromide and all pollutants, but the effects differed according the hydrophobic and the ionic character of the molecules. However, no clear effects of the origin of DOM on the mobility of the different contaminants were observed.

AB Quinolones are antibiotics that are accredited in human and veterinary medicine but are regularly used in high quantities also in industrial livestock farming. Since these compounds are often only incompletely metabolized, significant amounts contaminate the aquatic environment and negatively impact on a variety of different ecosystems. Although there is increasing awareness of problems caused by pharmaceutical pollution, available methods for the detection and elimination of numerous pharmaceutical residues are currently inefficient or expensive. While this also applies to antibiotics that may lead to multi-drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria, aptamer-based technologies potentially offer alternative approaches for sensitive and efficient monitoring of pharmaceutical micropollutants. Using the Capture-SELEX procedure, we here describe the selection of an aptamer pool with enhanced binding qualities for fluoroquinolones, a widely used group of antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine. The selected aptamers were shown to detect various quinolones with high specificity, while specific binding activities to structurally unrelated drugs were not detectable. The quinolone-specific aptamers bound to ofloxacin, one of the most frequently prescribed fluoroquinolone, with high affinity (K-D=0.1-56.9 nM). The functionality of quinolone-specific aptamers in real water samples was demonstrated in local tap water and in effluents of sewage plants. Together, our data suggest that these aptamers may be applicable as molecular receptors in biosensors or as catcher molecules in filter systems for improved monitoring and treatment of polluted water.

AB The occurrence and sources of 21 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs: C4-C14, C16, C18 carboxylate, C4, C6-C8 and C10 sulfonates and C8 sulfonamide) were determined in water, sediment, and biota of the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). Analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and determined by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-QqQ-MS). All samples were contaminated with at least one PFAS, being the most frequently found perfluorobutanoate (PFBA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS). In general, mean PFAS concentrations measured in sediments (0.01-3.67 ng g(-1)) and biota (0.79-431 mu g kg(-1)) samples were higher than those found in water (0.01-233 ng L-1). L-PFOS presented very high levels in biota and water, particularly in the Anoia River where a maximum concentration of 2.71 mu g L-1 was related to important industrial activities. However, this pollution does not extend down the Llobregat River according to cumulated values. None of the hazard quotients (HQ) calculated indicate potential risk for the different tropic levels considered (algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). According to Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) proposed by the European Commission (L-PFOS) and to Provisional Health Advisory (PHA) values (PFOA, L-PFOS) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), only two water samples exceeded PHA concentration for L-PFOS.

AB In this study, antipyrine was selected as the typical pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and the abatement of antipyrine was investigated by the catalytic ozonation with a magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@CeO2 catalyst. Focusing on the kinetics of the antipyrine degradation at different initial concentrations of antipyrine, the ozone dosages, initial pH values, the antipyrine degradation mechanism, and catalytic mechanism was explored. The results showed that the core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2@CeO2 catalyst exhibited high activity in the degradation of antipyrine. Types of intermediates, such as anisole, nitrobenzene, n-phenylpropinamide, and aniline were detected by gas chromatographymass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography techniques during the catalytic ozonation process. The presence of the radical scavenger tert-butyl alcohol during catalytic ozonation promoted the degradation of antipyrine unexpectedly instead of inhibiting the generation of hydroxyl radicals from ozone decomposition. The results implied that the high removal efficiency was mainly attributed to the interfacial effect of Fe3O4@SiO2@CeO2 catalyst. The energy consumption was also analyzed and discussed. This paper could provide basic data and technique reference of catalytic ozonation for the PPCPs wastewater treatment.

AB The sensitivity and spatial recovery of river sediment biofilms along 1 km after the input of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in two river reaches with different degrees of anthropogenic influence were investigated. First, at the upper reach, we observed an inhibition of some microbial functions (microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme activities) and strong shifts in bacterial community composition (16S rRNA gene), whereas an increase in microbial biomass and activity and less pronounced effect on microbial diversity and community composition were seen at the lower reach. Second, at the lower reach we observed a quick spatial recovery (around 200 m downstream of the effluent) as most of the functions and community composition were similar to those from reference sites. On the other hand, bacterial community composition and water quality at the upper reach was still altered 1 km from the WWTP effluent. Our results indicate that biofilms in the upstream sites were more sensitive to the effect of WWTPs due to a lower degree of tolerance after a disturbance than communities located in more anthropogenically impacted sites.

AB BACKGROUND: Clofibric acid (CLF), the main pharmacologically active metabolite of blood lipid regulating pharmaceutical clofibrat, etofibrat, etofyllinclofibrat is one of the most widely reported drugs found in water. It is hardly or not degraded by the conventional technology used in wastewater treatment plants.
   RESULTS: Sixteen new filamentous bacteria belonging to genus Streptomyces spp. isolated from different Romanian soil samples and three strains from a collection of microorganisms (MIUG) were morphologically characterized, tested based on their resistance against clofibric acid toxicity and then investigated as bioremediation agents. Only five Streptomyces spp. isolates coded MIUG 4.88, MIUG 4.89, LP1, LP2, SNA, showed high CLF tolerance at most of the concentrations tested (0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 8 mg L-1).
   CONCLUSION: The data obtained showed that only the strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 presents promising potential for clofibric acid biodegradation, with an elimination yield of 35%, which was not reported for this class of bacteria to date. However, further research is needed for optimization of the CLF biodegradation conditions to enhance its bioremediation yield especially in polluted aquatic systems.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been reported to occur in coastal environments across the globe from Antarctica to the Arctic. Worldwide, the number of people living along the coast is rapidly increasing, resulting in increased discharges of wastewater, which is a major source of pharmaceuticals entering aquatic environments. At the same time there is an increasing demand for farmed seafood. It also is likely that the number of different pharmaceutical compounds and their concentrations in the marine environment is also increasing. There is a growing body of evidence that some pharmaceuticals are present in marine ecosystems at concentrations that are likely to have adverse effects on marine organisms. Of particular concern are the potential impacts on primary producers, such as algae, that may have follow- on effects on aquatic food webs, including the availability of seafood for human consumption. There is limited evidence for the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food chains and a paucity of data for higher trophic- level organisms, including marine mammals. This chapter presents an overview of the occurrence, fate and sources of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and veterinary medicines in the marine environment, and their potential impact on marine organisms and human health.

AB In this study, a toxicity assay using a mesophilic wastewater treatment plant sludge-based (SI) and a thermophilic manure-based inoculum (MI), under different biomass concentrations was performed to define the effects of diclofenac (DCF), triclosan (TCS), and nonylphenol (NP) on anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Additionally, the influence of DCF, TCS, and NP on the relative abundance of the methanogenic populations was investigated. Results obtained demonstrated that, in terms of methane production, SI inoculum was more resistant to the toxicity effect of DCF, TCS, and NP, compared to the MI inoculum. The IC50 values were 546, 35, and 363 mg L-1 for SI inoculum and 481, 32, and 74 mg L-1 for MI inoculum for DCF, TCS, and NP, respectively. For both inocula, higher biomass concentrations reduced the toxic effect of TCS (higher methane production up to 64%), contrary to DCF, where higher biomass loads decreased methane yield up to 31%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were more resistant to the inhibitory effect of DCF, TCS, and NP compared to aceticlastic methanogens.

AB Growing concern about environmental issues has prompted the pharmaceutical industry to investigate appropriate and environmentally friendly treatment technologies. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption is one of the most promising techniques, due to its convenience. In the present communication adsorption of Entacapone from wastewater using low-cost non-carbon adsorbent unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) has been reported. Results showed that adsorption of Entacapone onto UPR have some advantages such as high adsorption capacity and short adsorption time. Different thermodynamic parameters like Gibb's free energy (Delta G degrees), enthalpy (Delta H degrees), and entropy (Delta S degrees) of the undergoing process have also evaluated through these adsorption models. The estimated values for Delta G degrees were -11.953 x 10(3) kJ mol(-1) over UPR at 303 K (30 degrees C) indicate toward a spontaneous process. The rate equations showed that the adsorption kinetic data generally fitted the rate equations from which the rate constants and diffusion rate constants were evaluated. However, the Lagergren pseudo first-order rate equation gave the best fit, and thus the process followed first-order rate kinetics.

AB The regeneration of activated carbons used for the decontamination of water and wastewater polluted with organic compounds related to the pharmaceutical industry, has been studied in this work. To this end, the pyrolysis of exhausted activated carbons was performed in a quartz reactor. The influence of the pyrolysis of saturated activated carbons on their adsorptive capacities and porous structure was evaluated. Textural characterisation of the samples was carried out by helium density, and N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms, at -196 and 0 degrees C, respectively. Consecutive cycles of pyrolysis of activated carbons exhausted with phenol and salicylic acid, generated a widening of the microporosity, and a decrease in the apparent BET surface areas. The adsorptive capacities for phenol retention after a series of adsorption/ pyrolysis cycles were found to decrease drastically. In contrast, consecutive cycles gave higher salicylic acid adsorptive capacities, as compared to phenol. The DTG pyrolysis profiles of the samples saturated with salicylic acid appeared at lower temperatures than those of phenol, which showed two peaks, while those exhausted with salicylic acid only showed one. These results provide evidence of the different adsorption mechanisms of these two pollutants. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the degradation and mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by ozonation and ionizing radiation were investigated respectively, and the performance of the combined process of ozonation and ionizing radiation was evaluated. Results showed that complete degradation of SMX could be obtained by ozonation in 12 min or by ionizing radiation with the absorbed dose of 1.5 kGy. However, the mineralization of SMX was very limited in ozonation and ionizing radiation system, TOC removal efficiency was less than 15% and 27% in single-ozonation and single-radiation process, respectively. The combination of ozonation and radiation process obviously enhanced the mineralization of SMX, TOC removal efficiency increased to 65.7%. Moreover, the ozonationradiation process also exhibited good performance in the mineralization of sulfamethazine (SMT) and sulfanilamide (SM), suggesting a good application prospect of the combined process in treating wastewater contaminated with antibiotics. In addition, some different intermediate products were identified during SMX degradation in ozonation process and ionizing radiation process by a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and possible pathways of SMX degradation by ozonation and radiation were proposed.

AB Micropollutants emitted by Human activities represent a potential threat to our health and aquatic environment. Thousands of active substances are used and go to WWTP through wastewaters. During water treatment, incomplete elimination occurs. Effluents released to the environment still contain part of the micropollutants present in the influents. Here, we studied the potential impacts on Human health and aquatic environment of the release of 261 organic micropollutants and 25 inorganic micropollutants at the scale of France. Data were gathered from national surveys, reports, papers and PhD works. The USE-tox (R) model was used to assess potential impacts. The impacts on Human health were estimated for 94 organic and 15 inorganic micropollutants and on aquatic environment for 88 organic and 19 inorganic micropollutants highlighting lack of concentration and toxicological data in literature. Some Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and pesticides as well as As and Zn showed highest potential impacts on Human health. Some pesticides, PCB 101, beta E2, Al, Fe and Cu showed highest potential impacts on aquatic environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as suspended heterogeneous catalysts in electro-Fenton (EF) process for water treatment is almost inexistent. Fe-MOFs synthesized from phthalic acid-based linkers were spindle-shaped MIL(Fe)-88B and NH2-MIL(Fe)-88B crystals, whereas their calcination yielded nano-ZVI@C and nano-ZVI@C-N. The lipid regulator gemfibrozil was spiked into 0.050 M Na2SO4 solutions or urban wastewater and treated in electrolytic cells with an air-diffusion cathode to generate H2O2. The nano-ZVI@C-N catalyst obtained at 800 degrees C showed the highest activity, with high stability as deduced from the low iron leaching and high recyclability. Almost total drug removal and significant mineralization was feasible in both matrices at near-neutral pH. The presence of core-shell nano-ZVI and Fe3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped fusiform porous carbon rods was revealed, ensuring the Fe(III) conversion to Fe(II). Carbon doping with N contributed to the enhanced catalytic activity, and the strong magnetism facilitated the post-treatment catalyst recovery.

AB The present study describes the removal of salicylic acid (SA) from water by adsorption using ethylene diamine (EDA)-functionalized carbon nanofibers (CNFs)-containing porous carbon beads (similar to 0.5 mm). Briefly, the phenolic beads, separately synthesized using suspension polymerization, were carbonized and activated. The CNFs were grown on the carbon beads, using chemical vapor deposition, and the prepared fibrous beads functionalized with EDA were used as an adsorbent for SA. The prepared materials were characterized by their physico-chemical properties, including specific surface area, surface morphology, and surface functional groups. The adsorption tests performed over the initial SA concentration range of 100-1500 mg/L revealed the adsorption capacity of the materials to be similar to 682 mg/g, which was considerably larger than that of the adsorbents discussed in the literature for SA. The zeta-potential analysis attributed enhanced adsorption to the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the solute molecules and the EDA-functionalized surface of the CNFs. The material and method developed in this study for the remediation of the SA-laden wastewater may be extended to other acidic pollutants present in pharmaceutical effluents.

AB The performance of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in the removal of micropollutants from a wastewater treatment plant effluent was evaluated at mesocosm level. Fifteen mesocosms were studied following a modified Latin Square experimental design with six additional points. Three variables at three levels were studied: porous media -PM- (river gravel, fine volcanic gravel and coarse volcanic gravel), macrophyte type -M- (Thypa latiffolia, Phragmites australis, and Cyperus papyrus) and hydraulic retention time -HRT- (1, 3 and 5 days). As response variables the removal percentages of the total organic load of the effluent (BOD5) and the loads of several micropollutants (caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide, alkylphenols and their monoethoxylates and diethoxylates, methyl dihydrojasmonate, sunscreen UV-15 and parsol) were used. The results showed that the systems remove between 70% and 75% of the organic load and that all the micropollutants were degraded at different extents, from 55% to 99%. The HRT was the variable that showed major effects on the treatment process, while M and PM showed no statistically significant differences in the used experimental conditions.

AB Tetracycline (TC) are used as bacteriostatic agents, inhibits the synthesis of bacterial proteins, with activity against a wide variety of organisms with application in human and veterinary medicine. The presence of TC in the environment constitutes a serious problem, being weakly metabolized or absorbed into the human or animal body con. TC residues even in low concentration may produce serious toxic and other effects on humans and living organism. In this study are presented the applications of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) for degradation of TC using de BDD electrode. The influence of experimental parameters (COD, TOC, nitrogen (total Kjeldhal, organic and inorganic), HPLC and UV-Vis spectrophotometry) on electrochemical degradation is evaluated. A pseudo-first kinetic order is obtained for electrochemical reactions with BDD. Model TC solutions is used and different experimental conditions, namely, initial concentration, initial pH, applied current density, type and concentration of the electrolyte, is also tested. To study the influence of the experimental conditions on the degradation of the antibiotic, assays was been running at experimental conditions that allow kinetic and/or diffusive control, in order to determine medium mass transfer coefficients that help to predict degradation rates at experimental conditions other than those tested.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in water has adverse environmental and health impacts. The main objective of the current research are to investigate the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from aqueous solution by using magnetic manganese ferrite nanoparticles synthesized on powdered activated carbon (PAC). Magnetic activated carbon composites (MACC) were prepared by using chemical co-precipitation at different temperature values ranging from 298 to 423K. The obtained samples were characterized by contemporary characterization instrumental methods of analysis, and their SMX removal capabilities were evaluated. Results revealed that the procedure successfully created magnetic nanoparticles on PAC at temperatures of 298-423K, and the anchored MnFe2O4/MnO2 manifested more crystalline forms at 423K. As a result, MACC prepared at 423K showed the highest magnetic and sorption capacities among three obtained samples. The SMX maximal adsorption capacity of MACC(423K) was 159mg/g at pH 7, and the SMX adsorption remained stable at pH 3-7. The effect of common ions and humic acids on SMX adsorption indicates a high selectivity of MACC(423K) for SMX. Furthermore, MACC(423K) achieved much higher regeneration efficiency by H2O2 than that of virgin PAC, due to the presence of MnFe2O4/MnO2.

The CBV-901 extrudate, which has a lower ratio of silicon dioxide/aluminum oxide (SiO2/Al2O3) than CBV-28014 and less surface area than CBV-100, had the highest adsorption affinity for 17b-estradiol. At an equilibrium concentration of 0.09 mg/L, the adsorption capacity of E2 by CBV-901 extrudate was 8.24 mg/g, whereas the E2 adsorption capacities of CBV-28014, HISIV-3000, CBV-100 were all <0.05 mg/g. CBV-901 had adsorption affinities for other estrogens such as estrone (E1) and estriol (E3). In a mixture of E1, E2, and E3, CBV-901 extrudate showed a greater affinity for E1 and E2 than for E3. The CBV-901 extrudate was also studied for the adsorption of E1, E2, EE2 (17 beta-ethynylestradiol), progesterone, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol in a spiked effluent. Results showed a promising prospect of CBV-901 for the removal of estrogenic compounds in aqueous solutions.

AB A wide variety of drugs have been found in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, and lakes, including analgesics, antibiotics, and antiepileptics. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are promising technologies to treat low contents of toxic and biorefractory pollutants in water. Anodic oxidation of carbamazepine, the most frequently detected drug in water bodies, was carried out using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes at galvanostatic mode. To optimize the process and study the interaction between the four modified variables (pH, current, concentration of supporting electrolyte Na2SO4, and solution flow rate) a design-of-experiments procedure has been carried out. The influence of these four variables has been evaluated. The influence of current was the greatest in the studied variables, the second one was the salt concentration, and the third one was the flow rate. ANOVA test reported significant for 5 of the 14 involved variables and the response surface methodology technique used to optimize carbamazepine degradation. An optimum carbamazepine degradation of 100% was found at pH 9, flow rate equal to 1.25 cm(3) min(-1), and current density equal to 190 mA cm(-2) using a supporting electrolyte concentration equal to 0.48 mol L-1.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is the most representative antibiotic of the sulfonamides group used in both human and veterinary medicine, and thus frequently detected in water resources. This has caused special concern due to the pronounced toxicity and potential to foster bacterial resistance of this drug. Therefore, and to further understand the fate of SMX in the aquatic environment, its photodegradation under simulated solar radiation was here studied in ultrapure water and in different environmental samples, namely estuarine water, freshwater and wastewater. SMX underwent very fast photodegradation in ultrapure water, presenting a half-life time (t(1/2)) of 0.86 h. However, in environmental samples, the SMX photodegradation rate was much slower, with 5.4 h < t1/2 < 7.8 h. The main novelty of this work was to prove that pH, salinity and dissolved organic matter are determinant factors in the decrease of the SMX photodegradation rate observed in environmental samples and, thus, they will influence the SMX fate and persistence, potentially increasing the risks associated to the presence of this pollutant in the environment.

AB Effective management of water quality in large rivers requires information on the influence of activities within the catchment (urban and rural) throughout the whole river basin. However, traditional water quality monitoring programmes undertaken by individual agencies normally relate to specific objectives, such as meeting quality criteria for wastewater discharges, and fail to provide information on basin-scale impacts, especially in transboundary river basins. Ideally, monitoring in large international river basins should be harmonised to provide a basin-scale assessment of sources and impacts of human activities, and the effectiveness of management actions. This paper examines current water quality issues in the Danube River Basin and evaluates the approach to water quality monitoring in the context of providing information for a basin-wide management plan. Lessons learned from the monitoring programme in the Danube are used to suggest alternative approaches that could result in more efficient generation of water quality data and provide new insights into causes and impacts of variations in water quality in other large international river basins.

AB The efficiency of removing 9 different pharmaceuticals, 5 carbamazepine metabolites, and 1 personal care product through wastewater treatment plants and constructed wetlands was investigated. The compound concentrations were measured using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. For extraction confirmation and better accuracy, isotopic dilution and standards addition methods were employed. The reporting limits for the investigated compounds were less than 10 ng/L except TCEP (24 ng/L). The removal efficiencies were found to be inversely proportional to the octanol-water partition coefficients (log K(ow)) after modification with ionizable functional groups (log D(ow)); compounds with a higher hydrophilicity were more efficiently removed in the engineered processes through biological treatment mechanisms. Carbamazepine metabolites that were formed in the early stages of certain metabolic reactions exhibited enhanced removal efficiencies due to a decreased log D(ow) values. However, the removal efficiency of those formed in later stages did not increase, but rather fluctuated with large standard deviations. The removal behaviors of metabolites in biologically operating engineered systems need to be more extensively examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the feasibility of durian seed as an alternative precursor for the preparation of eco-friendly activated carbon (DSAC) via physiochemical activation. The porosity, functionality, and surface chemistry of DSAC were featured by means of low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, evaluation of surface acidity/basicity, and zeta potential measurement. The adsorption behavior was examined by performing batch adsorption experiments using acetaminophen (ACT) as the model pollutant. Experimental data were simulated using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. Kinetic modeling was fitted to the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations. Results illustrated an encouraging performance toward the removal of ACT, with a monolayer adsorption capacity of 304.48 mg/g. The adsorption equilibrium was best confronted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while the adsorptive removal of ACT onto DSAC was satisfactorily described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The findings demonstrated the applicability of DSAC as a promising adsorbent for the adsorptive treatment of analgesic ACT from the pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater.

AB Steroid hormones produce adverse effects on biota as well as bioaccumulation in fish and seafood, making it necessary to develop methodologies to evaluate these compounds in samples related to the food chain. This work presents an analytical method for evaluating 15 steroid hormones in fish tissue. It is based on microwave-assisted extraction and solid-phase extraction coupled to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MAE-SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS). The proposed method shows appropriate detection limits (0.14-49.0 ng g(-1)), recoveries in the range of 50% and good repeatability. After optimization, the method was applied to different tissues from two small fishes of the Canary Islands that constitute an important level of the food web (Boops boops and Sphoeroides marmoratus) and were exposed to the outfall of the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria wastewater treatment plant. The concentrations of eight detected compounds ranged from below the quantification limits to 3.95 mu g g(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the capability of pharmaceutical biodegradation of fungus Trichoderma harzianum was evaluated through the comparison with the well-known biodegradation capability of white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. The study was performed in aqueous phase under aerobic conditions, using two of the most frequently detected drugs in water bodies: carbamazepine and clarithromycin, with concentrations commonly found in treated wastewater (4 mu g/l and 0.03 mu g/l respectively). For the first time, we demonstrated that T. harzianum is able to remove carbamazepine and clarithromycin. The analyses were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry, using high-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry upon electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The high selectivity and mass accuracy provided by high-resolution mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify some unknown metabolites. On the basis of our study, the major metabolites detected in liquid culture treated by T. harzianum were: 14-hydroxy-descladinosyl- and descladinosyl-clarithromycin, which are pharmacologically inactive products not dangerous for the environment.

AB A newly available dataset on pharmaceuticals used in Scottish hospitals enabled an environmental risk assessment that includes hospital consumption of pharmaceuticals, as previous United Kingdom rankings have been based on community prescriptions only. Although health and the environment are devolved issues for the Scottish government, it is merited to consider a Scottish ranking separately; regional differentiation is particularly relevant in the spatial context of the European Commission's Water Framework Directive. Nine pharmaceuticals are identified as having a risk quotient greater than 1. Four of these, the antibacterials piperacillin, tazobactam, flucloxacillin, and ciprofloxacin, had high hospital contributions and had not been highlighted previously in rankings based on community prescriptions. Some drugs with a risk quotient < 0.1 are used almost exclusively in hospitals and could be more concentrated near effluents carrying hospital wastewater, where they may be of local concern. Although treating hospital effluents separately is a policy option, specifically including hospital consumption is important. Continually increasing the availability of ecotoxicological data and trends in consumption further contributes to a substantially different prioritization than in previous rankings. This leads the authors to conclude that regular review of risk is necessary. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB The additional removal of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) provided by advanced water and wastewater treatment inevitably requires additional financial costs, which must be estimated to support utility planning and compare alternatives. This study presents conceptual-level (Class 4) capital and annual operations and maintenance (O&M) cost curve equations to aid evaluations of advanced treatment trains for water reuse. The cost curve equations are broadly applicable to the water reuse community, particularly those interested in ozone-based treatment trains. Unit processes include microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes (MF/UF), nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes (NF/RO), ozone (with or without hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), ultraviolet (UV) treatment with H2O2 (UV/H2O2), and biological activated carbon (BAC); all cost curves are for a unit process and can be added together to obtain costs for a combined treatment train. The cost curves indicate that at all plant capacities (1 to 500 MGD), membrane treatment (e. g., MF or RO) represents the highest cost unit process, ozone the least, and BAC or UV/H2O2 fall in between. Additionally, the relationship between ozone dose and TOrC removal is discussed with a demonstration of how costs change with increasing ozone dose to achieve desired TOrC destruction.

AB Today, more than 3,000 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are used and released into the environment at low doses but they are barely degraded in wastewater treatment plants. One of the potential alternatives to effectively degrade PPCPs is based on the use of white-rot fungi (WRF) and involves the oxidative action of extracellular fungal enzymes. The aim of this work is to study the potential ability of three WRF strains, an anamorph species of Bjerkandera sp. R1, Bjerkandera adusta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium, to degrade PPCPs belonging to different therapeutic groups: anti-depressants (citalopram and fluoxetine), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole), anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen), anti-epileptics (carbamazepine), tranquilizers (diazepam) and fragrances (celestolide, galaxolide and tonalide). The results reported complete degradation of all the PPCPs except for fluoxetine and diazepam, which were partially removed in percentages from 23 to 57%. In the case of fragrances, these compounds were neither detected in the fungal cultures nor in the abiotic controls, indicating the possibility of volatilization during the experiment.

AB 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen prescribed as a contraceptive, was measured in Shorthead Redhorse Suckers (ShRHSs) (Moxostoma macrolepidotum) collected near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the St. Clair River (Ontario, Canada). We detected EE2 in 50% of the fish samples caught near the WWTP (Stag Island), which averaged 1.6 +/- 0.6 ng/g (wet weight) in males and 1.43 +/- 0.96 ng/g in females. No EE2 was detected in the samples from the reference site (Port Lambton) which was 26 km further downstream of the Stag Island site. Only males from Stag Island had VTG induction, suggesting the Corunna WWTP effluent as a likely source of environmental estrogen. EE2 concentrations were correlated with total body lipid content (R-2 = 0.512, p < 0.01, n = 10). Lipid normalized EE2 concentrations were correlated with delta N-15 (R-2 = 0.436, p < 0.05, n = 10), suggesting higher EE2 exposures in carnivores. Our data support the hypothesis of EE2 bioaccumulation in wild fish. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The drinking water for more than 28 million people was screened for a diverse group of pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and other unregulated organic contaminants. Source water, finished drinking water, and distribution system (tap) water from 19 U.S. water utilities was analyzed for 51 compounds between 2006 and 2007. The 11 most frequently detected compounds were atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, estrone, gemfibrozil, meprobamate, naproxen, phenytoin, sulfamethoxazole, TCEP, and trimethoprim. Median concentrations of these compounds were less than 10 ng/L, except for sulfamethoxazole in source water (12 ng/L), TCEP in source water (120 ng/L), and atrazine in source, finished, and distribution system water (32, 49, and 49 ng/L). Atrazine was detected in source waters far removed from agricultural application where wastewater was the only known source of organic contaminants. The occurrence of compounds in finished drinking water was controlled by the type of chemical oxidation (ozone or chlorine) used at each plant. At one drinking water treatment plant, summed monthly concentrations of the detected analytes in source and finished water are reported. Atenolol, atrazine, DEET, estrone, meprobamate, and trimethoprim can serve as indicator compounds representing potential contamination from other pharmaceuticals and EDCs and can gauge the efficacy of treatment processes.

AB The removal of antibiotics from the aquatic environment has received great interest. The aim of this study is to examine degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), amoxicillin (AMO), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) in sludge. Four antibiotic-degrading bacterial strains, SF1 (Pseudmonassp.), A12 (Pseudmonassp.), strains B (Bacillussp.), and SANA (Clostridiumsp.), were isolated, identified and tested under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in this study. Batch experiments indicated that the addition of SF1 and A12 under aerobic conditions and the addition of B and SANA under anaerobic conditions increased the biodegradation of antibiotics in sludge. Moreover, the results of repeated addition experiments indicated that the efficiency of the biodegradation of antibiotics using the isolated bacterial strains could be maintained for three degradation cycles. Two groups of potential microbial communities associated with the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of SMX, AMO and CTC in sludge were revealed. Twenty-four reported antibiotics-degrading bacterial genera (Achromobacter,Acidovorax,Acinetobacter,Alcaligenes,Bacillus,Burkholderia,Castellaniella,Comamonas,Corynebacterium,Cupriavidus,Dechloromonas,Geobacter,Gordonia,Klebsiella,Mycobacterium,Novosphingobium,Pandoraea,Pseudomonas,Rhodococcus,Sphingomonas,Thauera,Treponema,VibrioandXanthobacter) were found in both the aerobic and anaerobic groups, suggesting that these 24 bacterial genera may be the major antibiotic-degrading bacteria in sludge.

AB A semi-empirical model of heat-activated and iron-activated persulfate (PS) processes applied to the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) in water at low concentration (0.0025 mM) has been proposed and validated. In heat-activation systems, carried out at pH 3, temperature was varied from 25 degrees C to 65 degrees C, and acid-activation of PS showed an important initial role in the process. In iron-activated experimental series, iron concentration was changed from 0.009 mM to 0.18 mM at two different temperatures (25 degrees C and 35 degrees C), heat-activation was negligible with iron being the main activation mechanism and acid-activation showing also an important initial effect on process performance. High model prediction capability for both CBZ degradation and PS decomposition profiles was obtained in each case. Finally, the model was validated including supplementary experiments based on Fe(II) additions (0.018 mM each) and PS additions (0.17 mM) throughout the treatment. Developed model in this work is a powerful predictive tool for the application of PS in the removal of contaminants of emerging concern in water.

AB The present study aims to assess the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) levels of several typical and atypical antipsychotic (AP) drugs to evaluate their degree of biodegradabilities. In recent times, the consumption of APs has seen a marked increase, and BOD5 can be a good parameter to evaluate the relative oxygen contents of these pharmaceuticals in polluted waters, effluents and wastewater. The Winkler method was implemented and after that, an automatized sequential injection analysis (SIA) method was used, aiming to overcome some drawbacks of the Winkler method. The degradation degree of these pharmaceuticals was determined from two perspectives: by using the theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) value and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value. From the results obtained with the second perspective, we could determine the degree of biodegradability of the AP drugs. The results of the Winkler method and the SIA system were quite similar. The SIA methodology is capable of operating as a screening method in any stage of a synthetic process in addition to being more environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Overall, these studies presented promising perspectives for improvement in the removal of pharmaceuticals from waste effluents by assessing BOD values.

AB Carbama/epine and lamotrigine prescribed antiepileptic drugs are highly persistent in the environment and were detected in crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater. This study reports pharmacokinetics of the two drugs and their metabolites in cucumber plants under hydroponic culture, testing their uptake, translocation, and transformation over 96 h in single and bisolute systems at varying pH, Ruling out root adsorption and transformations in the nutrient solution, we demonstrate that carbamazepine root uptake is largely affected by the concentration gradient across the membrane. Unlike carbamazepine, lamotrigine is adsorbed to the root and undergoes ion trapping in root cells thus its translocation to the shoots is limited. On the basts of that, carbamazepine uptake was not affected by the presence of lamotrigine. while lamotrigine uptake was enhanced in the presence of carbamazepine. Transformation of carbamazepine in the roots was slightly reduced in the presence of lamotrigine. Carbamazepine metabolism was far more pronounced in the shoots than in the roots, indicating that most ot the metabolism occurs in the leaves, probably due to higher concentration and longer residence time. This study indicates that the uptake of small nonionic pharmaceuticals is passive and governed bv diffusion across the root membrane.

AB Activated carbons are considered to be the most successful adsorbent materials due to their high adsorption capacity for the majority of pollutants, e.g. dyes, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, phenols. They possess large surface area, and different surface functional groups, which include carboxyl, carbonyl, phenol, quinone, lactone and other groups bound to the edges of the graphite-like layers. Therefore, they are regarded as good adsorbents both in liquid and gas phases. The most widely used carbonaceous materials for the industrial production of activated carbons are coal, wood and coconut shell. These types of precursors are quite expensive and often imported, in many places; hence making it necessary, particularly for developing countries, to find a cheap and available feedstock for the preparation of activated carbon for use in industry, drinking water purification and wastewater treatment. In order to reduce the synthesis cost of activated carbons, some green final products are recently proposed, using several suitable agricultural by-products (lignocellulosics) - i.e. including olive-waste cakes, cattle-manue compost, bamboo materials, apple pulp, potato peel - as activated carbon precursors. In this chapter, special attention is given to activated carbons based on some of agricultural wastes from the Mediterranean region, which can be characterized as green.

AB An iopromide (IOPr)-degrading bacterium was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant in Shanghai. Based on its morphology, physiological-biochemical characteristics and a phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA sequence, the bacterium was identified and named as Pseudomonas sp. I-24. The optimum condition for degrading IOPr was at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. After 5 days, strain I-24 could degrade 30 mg/L IOPr by 99% in a basal salts medium with a 5% (V/V) inoculum and 200 mg/L starch as the primary substrate. When applied to an Anaerobic-Anoxic/Aerobic (A(2)/O) process, with the coexistence of other bacteria, the strain I-24 got lower (61.3%)IOPr removal, but in two A(2)/O systems (with and without I-24 inoculation), the CODc(r) removal were both approximately 95%. The trial dosed with strain I-24 showed better IOPr removal than the un-dosed one. I-24 sustained its abundance in the A(2)/O system during the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofioxacin (LEVO) was studied in two oxidation processes: photocatalysis (UVC lamp (254 nm), TiO2) and ozonation. LEVO (C-o = 20 mg/L) was no longer detected after an ozone dose of 20.5 mg/L and after 180 min of photocatalytic oxidation. COD removals of 59% and 70% were measured for 270 mg/L of transferred ozone dose and 300 min of photocatalytic oxidation, respectively. Extensive treatment with ozone did not result in further reduction in COD levels reaching a plateau at the above mentioned value, however increased irradiation time led to increased COD removal during photocatalytic treatment. Both treatment methods proved to be effective ways of removing antibacterial activity. From agar diffusion test with Escherichia coli, it was observed that a transferred ozone dose of at least 20.5 mg/L and 180 min of irradiation were enough to completely remove antibacterial activity. Both treatments methods were shown to efficiently remove LEVO and its antibacterial activity and show promising results as possible applications for removal of antibiotics in wastewater.

AB A new approach based on ferrocyanide for iron removal in kinetic studies on Fenton treatments was developed and proposed. The influence of iron precipitation using the ferrocyanide treatment on the measured concentration of two model molecules (phthalic acid and meropenem) was studied. For this purpose, different solutions of phthalic acid and meropenem were prepared. Ferrous sulfate was added to the solutions after the adjustment of the pH value. Then, iron was removed by alkalization (traditional) and ferrocyanide treatments, this for phthalic acid. In the case of meropenem, the removal of iron was performed using only the ferrocyanide treatment due to a chemical modification of the molecule at (highly) alkaline conditions. It was found that the precipitation of iron with ferrocyanide can take place at initial pH values below 5.5 and 4.5, for phthalic acid and meropenem, respectively. The pH value of the supernatant solutions after precipitation, in both cases, was 7.0. The results show that the application of ferrocyanide treatment did not affect the measurement of the concentration of phthalic acid and meropenem after the removal of iron. In addition, some considerations are provided to apply this method to other molecules.

AB Diclofenac is a pharmaceutical compound which is listed as a priority substance to be removed from wastewater. The current research investigated the adsorption of diclofenac using graphene oxide (GO) which was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the adsorption of diclofenac onto GO based on central-composite design. According to the developed model, the dominant parameters affecting the process were dosage and initial concentration. The optimum adsorption conditions were dosage of 0.16 g/L, time of 14.75 min, initial concentration of 400 mg/L and temperature of 40 degrees C. Under these conditions, GO exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 653.91 mg/g for diclofenac. The diclofenac uptake by GO was consistent with the Langmuir adsorption and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The active binding sites for diclofenac in GO might be hydroxyl, carboxyl and alkoxy as determined by FTIR analysis. The results provided sufficient evidence to support GO as a promising adsorbent for removal of diclofenac in aqueous solution. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Rising levels of antibiotics in treated wastewater pose a great threat to human health worldwide. The present study shows degradation studies of antibiotic Cephalexin using slurry and innovative fixed-bed photocatalysis under UVA (365nm) irradiations. A UV-spectrophotometer/HPLC was used for analyzing the decay of Cephalexin. Studies showed that variation in UV intensity, dose variation of TiO2 and H2O2, area by volume (A/V), and pH affect the degradation to a great extent. The degradation rate followed pseudo-first order kinetics with optimized conditions for degrading the antibiotic being TiO2 1.0g center dot L-1, H2O2 0.15mL, with UV intensity of 25W center dot m(-2). The COD decrease (80%) with the generation of nitrite, nitrate, and sulphate ions confirmed the mineralization of the selected compound. TiO2-coated spherical cement beads were used for fixed-bed studies, which eliminates the implications of slurry mode photocatalysis. The beads were recycled for at least 50 cycles, which confirmed the durability of the catalyst, and characterized by SEM-EDAX. Attempts were made to study the pilot-scale fixed-bed baffled solar reactor for degrading Cephalexin, which confirmed 70% degradation after 10h.

AB This study investigated the removal of salicylic acid (SA) from aqueous solution by electro-Fenton (EF) and EF-like processes using graphite-graphite electrolytic system. Fe-0, Fe2+, Fe3+ ions were used as the Fenton reagent in the EF process and in the EF-like reactions, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ were used as the same. The effect of various operating conditions on the effectiveness of EF process was investigated. The contribution of adsorption and electro-sorption in the removal of SA was also investigated. According to the results, EF method can be used efficiently for the removal of SA by maintaining proper operating conditions. Fe2+ was confirmed to be the most efficient catalyst among the metal ions that were tested. Maximum removal efficiency of 75.13% was obtained under optimal operating conditions after 8 h of electrolysis. Even though EF-like processes are also effective for the removal of SA from aqueous solutions, EF removal of SA was observed to be more efficient for the same. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of SA solutions electrolyzed at optimal conditions was carried out. Degradation pathway was proposed from GC-MS.

AB The performance of two laboratory scale biofilters, packed with pressmud (BF1) and sugarcane bagasse (BF2), was evaluated for gas phase ethylacetate removal under various operating conditions. Biofilters were inoculated with mixed culture obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater sludge. Experiments were carried out at different flow rates (0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 m(3) h(-1)) and inlet ethylacetate concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.2 gm(-3)). Maximum removal efficiency (RE) of 100% and 98% was achieved at an inlet concentration of 0.2 gm(-3) and gas flow rate of 0.03 m(3) h(-1) in BF1 and BF2, respectively. A maximum elimination capacity (EC) of 66.6 gm(-3) h(-1) and 64.1 gm(3) h(-1) was obtained in BF1 and BF2, respectively, at an inlet concentration of 0.8 gm(-3) and a gas flow rate of 0.12 m(3) h(-1). The kinetics of biofiltration of ethylacetate was studied by using Ottengraf and van den Oever model. The kinetic modelling gives an insight into the mechanism of biofiltration. The modified Ottengraf model, which was also tested, demonstrated good agreement between calculated and experimental data.

AB Land use in geographic areas that replenish groundwater and surface water resources is increasingly recognized as an important factor affecting drinking water quality. Efforts to understand the implications for health, particularly outcomes with long latency or critical exposure windows, have been hampered by lack of historical exposure data for unregulated pollutants. This limitation has hindered studies of the possible links between breast cancer risk and drinking water impacted by endocrine disrupting compounds and mammary carcinogens, for example. This paper describes a methodology to assess potential historical exposure to a broad range of chemicals associated with wastewater and land use impacts to 132 groundwater wells and one surface water body supplying drinking water to 18 public distribution systems on Cape Cod, MA. We calculated annual measures of impact to each distribution system and used the measures as exposure estimates for the residential addresses of control women in the Cape Cod Breast Cancer and Environment Study (Cape Cod Study). Impact was assessed using( 1) historical chemical measurements of nitrate at the water supply sources (performed as required by the Safe Water Drinking Act) and (2) a geographic information system analysis of land use within the zones of contribution (ZOCs) delineated for each well in a state-mandated wellhead protection program. The period for which these impact estimates were developed (1972-1995) was constrained by the availability of chemical measurements and land use data and consideration of time required for groundwater transport of contaminants to the water supply wells. Trends in these estimates for Cape Cod suggest increasing impact to drinking water quality for land use over the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect on the distribution of controls' cumulative exposure estimates from (1) reducing the area of the ZOCs to reflect typical well operating conditions rather than extreme pumping conditions used for the regulatory ZOCs, (2) assuming residences received their drinking water entirely from the closest well or cluster of wells rather than a volume-weighted annual district-wide average, and (3) changing the travel time considered for contaminants to reach wells from land use sources. We found that the rank and distribution of controls' cumulative exposure estimates were affected most by the assumption concerning district mixing; in particular, assignment of exposure estimates based on impact values for the closest well(s) consistently produced a larger number of unexposed controls than when a district-wide average impact value was used. As expected, the results suggest that adequate characterization of water quality heterogeneity within water supplies is an important component of exposure assessment methodologies in health studies investigating impacted drinking water.

AB 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) is one of the main compounds responsible for estrogenic activities in sewage and natural waters and has been found in these matrices all around the world, thereby justifying the development of technologies for its removal. In this work, pure or TiO2-containing molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) were prepared using E2 as template. The materials were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, adsorption/desorption of N-2, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization analyses showed that TiO2 was incorporated in the polymers and that all materials could be characterized as mesoporous and had surface areas ranging from 238 to 279 m(2)g(-1). Adsorption studies showed MIP-TiO2 had a high capacity to adsorb E2 from the water phase leading to q(max) values of 15.16 to 26.49 mg g(-1) at temperatures from 25 to 45 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process is endothermic, spontaneous, and entropically driven. The results also showed that the presence of TiO2 decreases the adsorption performance of MIP-TiO2 when compared with MIP (without the photocatalyst) during the adsorption. However, the application of MIP-TiO2 in a process of adsorption followed by photocatalysis resulted in 100% of E2 removal allowing the reuse of adsorbent. In addition, MIP-TiO2 maintained its E2 removal capacity even after five cycles of regeneration-reuse, which shows the ability of UV light to regenerate the specific adsorption sites. The results presented in this paper show MIP-TiO2 has potential to be applied in water treatment systems to remove E2.

AB Kitchen food waste provides serious environmental pollution including its handling and disposal problem. In this study, an initiative has been taken to chemically characterize food waste and identify possible reuse and disposal techniques. Food waste samples were collected from kitchen of girls hostel of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. Collected food waste samples were dried by various methods. It is observed that oven drying method at 105 degrees C is the optimum temperature for maximum dewatering of collected food waste. The dried samples were further used for lipid extraction. Lipid profile analysis of the food waste samples was performed by using combination of different time of contact (20, 40 and 60 min) with varying solvent to food waste volumes (1: 4, 1: 2, 1: 1 and 2: 1). Gas chromatographymass spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector analyses have been performed to identify and quantify the presence of organic compounds in lipid from food waste. Caproic acid (6: 1), lauric acid (12: 0), mystric acid (14: 0), palmitic acid (16: 0), stearic acid (17: 0) and oleic acid (18: 0) are the fatty acids that have been identified in GC-MS. Palmitic acid (60.89 mg/l), stearic acid (74.11 mg/l) and oleic acid (3.81 mg/l) dominate the lipid profile. The results obtained from lipid profile analysis suggest that the kitchen food waste can be an innovative raw material for biodiesel production. Physico-chemical characterization identify considerable amount of calcium (20.36 mg/l), iron (30.84 mg/l), magnesium (3.00 mg/l) and chromium (1.28 mg/l), suggest its reuse in pharmaceutical and agricultural industries after extracting these metals.

AB Degradation kinetics and pathways of ronidazole (RNZ) by chlorination (Cl-2), UV irradiation and combined UV/chlorine processes were investigated in this paper. The degradation kinetics of RNZ chlorination followed a second-order behavior with the rate constants calculated as (2.13 +/- 0.15) x 10(2) M-2 s(-1), (0.82 +/- 0.52) x 10(-2) M-1 s(-1) and (2.06 +/- 0.09) x 10(-1) M-1 s(-1) for the acid-catalyzed reaction, as well as the reactions of RNZ with HOCl and OCl-, respectively. Although UV irradiation degraded RNZ more effectively than chlorination did, very low quantum yield of RNZ at 254 nm was obtained as 1.02 x 10(-3) mol E-1. RNZ could be efficiently degraded and mineralized in the UV/chlorine process due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The second-order rate constant between RNZ and hydroxyl radical was determined as (2.92 +/- 0.05) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). The degradation intermediates of RNZ during the three processes were identified with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry and the degradation pathways were then proposed. Moreover, the variation of chloropicrin (TCNM) and chloroform (CF) formation after the three processes were further evaluated. Enhanced formation of CF and TCNM precursors during UV/chlorine process deserves extensive attention in drinking water treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Under many circumstances chemical risk assessments for pharmaceuticals and other substances are required to differentiate between 'loss' of a chemical from the aqueous phase as a result of abiotic (sorption or precipitation reactions) or biotic (biodegradation) processes. To distinguish only abiotic processes, it is necessary to work under sterile conditions. Reported methods include poisoning the soil with sodium azide, irradiation and autoclaving. However, a key aspect of any testing is the representativeness of the matrix and so any sterilisation procedure needs to ensure that the integrity of the sample is maintained, in particular particle size distribution, pH and organic carbon partitioning potential. A number of controlled laboratory experiments were performed on 3 different types of soil. Results indicated that none of the methods successfully sterilised the soils and some physico-chemical changes in soils were identified post-treatment. Autoclaving destroyed the soil structure, therefore potentially affecting its sorption behaviour and sodium azide changed the pH of the loam soil solution by 0.53 pH units. Gamma irradiation exhibited least disruption to the tested soils physico-chemical properties. It was therefore concluded that gamma irradiation was the best available method for sterilising soils in preparation for sorption-desorption experiments; however care needs to be taken with this method to ensure that microbial activity is absent, or quantified if present. The changes to soils after sterilisation varied depending on the individual soil properties, indicating that soils should be studied on a case-bycase basis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Manganese dioxides are ubiquitous in natural waters, soils, and sediments and play an important role in oxidative transformation of organic pollutants. This work presents the kinetics of the oxidation of selected beta-blockers, betaxolol, metoprolol, and atenolol by birnessite (delta-MnO2) as a function of concentration of the beta-blocker, dosage of delta-MnO2, and solution pH. The values of pseudo-first-order rate constants (k(obs)) of beta-blockers decreased in the order betaxolol > atenolol > metoprolol, which was positively correlated with their acid dissociation constants (K-a). Effect of series of metal ions (Fe3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) on the degradation of beta-blockers by delta-MnO2 was systematically examined. All of these metal ions inhibited the oxidation reaction under the same constant ionic strength. The inhibition efficiency was positively correlated with the logarithm of stability constant of metal ions in aqueous solution (logK(MeOH)). By LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses, the oxidation of beta-blockers primarily involved hydroxylation and cleavage of the parent molecules to the short branched chain compounds. An electron transfer mechanism for the oxidation of beta-blockers by delta-MnO2 was proposed. The oxidation was initiated by the electron transfer from the nonbonding electrons on nitrogen (N-electrons) of beta-blockers to delta-MnO2, followed by transformation of radical intermediates. These findings will help to understand the oxidation processes of beta-blockers and predict the effect of metal ions on the removal of pollutants by delta-MnO2 in the environment.

AB The occurrence of diclofenac (DCF) as an emerging pollutant in surface waters and drinking water has been attributed to elevated global consumption and the inability of sewage treatment plants to remove DCF. In this study, DCF spiked drinking water and river water was subjected to photolysis and TiO2 photocatalytic treatments in a circulating laboratory-scale (immersion-well) and a demonstration-scale loop reactor (Laboclean). The operational parameters for the immersion-well reactor were optimised as follows: TiO2 P25 loading, 0.1 g L-1; natural pH, 6.2; initial concentration, 30 mg L-1; water type, distilled water. Complete DCF removal was realised within 15 min under the optimised conditions using the immersion-well reactor. Sunlight-mediated photochemical degradation required a prolonged exposure period of up to 360 min for complete DCF removal. DCF in distilled and drinking water was efficiently degraded in the larger Laboclean reactor. Differences were, however, observed based on their pseudo-first-order rate constants, which implies that the water matrix has an effect on the degradation rate. Six major photoproducts, 2-(8-chloro-9H-carbazol-1-yl) acetic acid, 2-(8-hydroxy-9H-carbazol-1-yl) acetic acid, 2,6-dichloro-N-o-tolylbenzenamine, 2-(phenylamino) benzaldehyde, 1-chloromethyl-9H-carbazole and 1-methyl-9H-carbazole, generated from TiO2 photocatalysis of DCF were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). This work has shown that photocatalytic degradation kinetics of DCF are dependent on both the geometry of the photoreactor and the nature of the water matrices.

AB The pharmaceuticals bisoprolol (BIS), sotalol (SOT), and ranitidine (RAN) are among the most consumed pharmaceuticals worldwide and are frequently detected in different aquatic ecosystems. However, very few ecotoxicity data are available in the literature for them. To help fill these data gaps, toxicity tests with the algae Raphidocelis subcapitata, the macrophyte Lemna minor, the cnidarian Hydra attenuata, the crustacean Daphnia similis, and the fish Danio rerio were performed for assessing the ecotoxicity of these pharmaceuticals. Standard, as well as non-standard endpoint, was evaluated, including the locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae. Results obtained for SOT and RAN showed that acute adverse effects are not expected to occur on aquatic organisms at the concentrations at which these pharmaceuticals are usually found in fresh surface waters. On the other hand, BIS was classified as hazardous to the environment in the acute III category. Locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae was not affected by BIS and RAN. A disturbance on the total swimming distance at the dark cycle was observed only for larvae exposed to the highest test concentration of 500 mg L-1 of SOT. D. similis reproduction was affected by BIS with an EC10 of 3.6 (0.1-34.0) mg L-1. A risk quotient (RQ) of 0.04 was calculated for BIS in fresh surface water, considering a worst-case scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first chronic toxicity data with BIS on non-target organisms.

AB The occurrence of 24 pharmaceuticals (including 15 antibiotics, three analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs, three anti-epileptic/antidepressant drugs, two beta blockers, and one lipid regulator) was investigated in 75 water samples collected from four bays in the Ugandan part of Lake Victoria. In addition, the potential environmental risk of the target pharmaceutical compounds to aquatic organisms in the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Victoria was assessed. Water samples were extracted using solid phase extraction and analyzed for pharmaceuticals using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Eighteen of the 24 pharmaceuticals occurred at quantifiable concentrations. Sulfamethoxazole (1-5600 ng L-1), trimethoprim (1-89 ng L-1), tetracycline (3 -70 ng L-1), sulfacetamide (1-13 ng L-1), and ibuprofen (6-780 ng L-1) occurred at quantifiable concentrations in all water samples. Sulfamethazine (2-50 ng L-1), erythromycin (10-66 ng L-1), diclofenac (2-160 ng L-1), and carbamazepine (5-72 ng L-1) were only quantifiable in water samples from Murchison Bay. The highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in Murchison Bay, the main recipient of sewage effluents, industrial and municipal waste from Kampala city via the Nakivubo channel. Ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and diclofenac pose a high toxic risk to aquatic organisms in the lake, while ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ibuprofen pose a medium risk. This study is the first of its kind to report the levels and ecotoxic risks of pharmaceutical compounds in Lake Victoria waters, of Uganda, and East Africa as a whole. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in different aquatic systems may contribute to hazardous effects on aquatic organisms and subsequently on human health. In the present work, liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (LC-Q-ToF-MS) was used to identify and quantify a series of ECs in Periyar River in Aluva region, Kerala, India. The water samples were pre concentrated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to analysis. The compounds were probed in both positive and negative ionization mode using electro spray ionization (ESI). Method validations were performed for linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, and precision (intraday and inter day). The ECs were quantified using standard calibration curve. The identified nine ECs include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroids, surfactants, and phthalate. A relatively high concentration was observed in the case of 2-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (1012 ng/l) and low concentration was observed for lignocaine (4.3 ng/l; since this is below LOQ, the value is only approximate). In addition, we have identified another 28 organic compounds using the technique of non-target analysis out of which seven compounds fall in the category of surfactants. Being the first report on ECs in Periyar River, the data is very important as this river is one of the biggest and important rivers of Kerala having several purification units for drinking water in the province.

AB The Mediterranean wetlands are unique in biological diversity and provide multiple benefits, constituting a great water reserve for the planet and producing biomass and nutrients for the trophic chain. However, the increasing human impact and socio-economic development in recent decades have caused important losses in these ecosystems. This work was carried out in the Natural Park of L'Albufera (Valencia, Spain), which includes a coastal lagoon, marshlands, dunes and pinewoods, surrounded by rice fields and orchard in its non-urbanized part. Despite this great ecological value, it suffers impacts derived from the high human and industrial occupation and the hydrological contributions of the connected irrigation systems. The study focused on the development of a combined methodology, based on environmental forensics principles, with the aim of identifying the presence, flow paths and spatial distribution of illicit drugs entering the Natural Park. It is organized around two major procedures: analysis of 16 water samples and application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) integrating different sources and data formats, as analysis of 14 drugs of abuse by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry techniques, and social and environmental data in either GIS layers or tabular digital formats. Results show that, at present, most analyzed drugs have been identified in all sample points. Besides the population distribution pattern, the traditional irrigation system connected to sewage treatment plant (STP) locations is the way by which illicit substances are introduced into the Natural Park waters.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are routinely being detected in the environment, and there is growing concern about whether these drugs could elicit effects on aquatic organisms. Regulatory paradigms have shifted accordingly, with a greater emphasis on chronic toxicity data compared with acute data. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 210 Early Life Stage Test has been proposed as a good measure of the potential for pharmaceuticals to elicit chronic toxicity. To begin building a data set regarding the early life-stage toxicity of pharmaceuticals to fish, fathead minnows (FHM) were exposed to amiodarone, carbamazepine, clozapine, dexamethasone, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, norethindrone, or verapamil. Survival and growth were used to assess chronic toxicity in FHM at 28 days posthatch. Exposure of FHM to carbamazepine, fenofibrate, and ibuprofen resulted in no significant adverse effects at the concentrations tested. FHM survival was not impacted by verapamil exposure; however, growth was significantly decreased at 600 mu g/L. Dexamethasone-exposed FHM showed a significant decrease in survival at a concentration of 577 mu g/L; however, growth was not impacted at the concentration tested. Norethindrone exposure resulted in a significant decrease in survival and dry weight at 14.8 and 0.74 mu g/L, respectively. Exposure to amiodarone and clozapine resulted in a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in growth at concentrations of 1020 and 30.8 mu g/L, respectively. Although the effect levels derived in this study are greater then concentrations observed in the environment, these data suggest that synthetic progestins may require additional research.

AB Transport of salicylic acid (SA) through flat-sheet supported liquid membrane (SLM) was investigated using as liquid membrane the ionic liquids 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C(6)mim][PF6]) or ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). Using [C(6)mim][PF6], it has been observed that the transport efficiency decreases with increasing pH, indicating that the un-dissociated form of SA is mainly extracted. On the other hand, the ionic dissociated form of salicylic acid is mostly extracted via the anion exchange mechanism between nitrate and salicylate anions when EAN is used as liquid membrane. Parameters such as nature and concentration of the strippant in the receiving phase and concentration of the SA in the feed phase were studied. By comparing the SLM transport efficiency of SA (initial flux) of the two used ionic liquids. EAN appears to be slight efficient than [C(6)mim][PF6].
   Despite the use of different stripping solutions (NaCl, NaOH and Na2CO3) and even with pH maintenance around initial values, uphill transport driven by pH difference was not observed using both ionic liquids. The absence of uphill transport has been attributed to the formation, along the course of the experiment, of water microenvironments (aggregates) inside the ionic liquid. SA transport through these water microenvironments inside the liquid membrane becomes the main mechanism. The main feature of SLMs based on ionic liquids is their higher stability compared to classical SLMs. In fact, our SLM system retained its stability and initial performance during the 9 days long experiment.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and indocarban (TCC), widely used as antibacterial agents, have been frequently detected in biosolids Bios lids land application may introduce pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) such as TCS and TCC into the environment Microcosm studies were conducted to investigate TCS and TCC transformation in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam Both compounds were spiked into the soils with and without biosolids amendment under non-sterilized and sterilized conditions and incubated aerobically at 30 degrees C liar up to 100 d In both sods, transformation of TCS followed second-order reaction kinetics, with estimated reaction rate constants of (5 27 +/- 0 920) x 10(-1) and (9 13 +/- 1 58) x 10(-2) (mg kg(-1))(-1) d(-1) for Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively Transformation of TCC in both sods was slower than that for TCS After 100 d, 53 +/- 1% and 71 +/- 2% of the initially added TCC and only 2 8 +/- 0 35% and 62 +/- 0.80% of initially added TCS remained in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively. The transformation of both compounds were faster in the Marietta fine loam (pH 7 8, 1 8% organic matter) than in the McLaurin coarse loam (pH 4.7, 0 65% organic matter) Our result suggests that biotic processes are more of a controlling factor affecting TCS transformation, whereas abiotic processes may affect TCC transformation more significantly Addition of biosolids to the two soils slowed the transformation of both compounds, indicating interactions between both compounds and biosolids may adversely affect their transformation in sods, an important factor that must be included in models predicting environmental fate of biosolids-associated PPCPs.

AB Municipal biosolids are a source of nutrients for crop production. Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) can be used to minimize the risk of contamination of adjacent water resources with chemical or microbial agents that are of public or environmental health concern. In this field study, we applied biosolids slurry at a commercial rate using either subsurface injection or broadcast application followed by incorporation. Precipitation was simulated at 1, 3, 7, 22, 36 and 266 days post-application on 2 m(2) microplots; to evaluate surface runoff of 9 model pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), atenolol, carbamazepine, cotinine, gemfibrozil, naproxen, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan. In runoff from the injected plots, concentrations of the model PPCPs were generally below the limits of quantitation. In contrast, in the broadcast application treatment, the concentrations of atenolol, carbamazepine, cotinine, gemfibrozil, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan on the day following application ranged from 701477 ng L(-1) in runoff and generally declined thereafter with first order kinetics. The total mass of PPCPs mobilized in surface runoff per m(2) of the field ranged from 0.63 mu g for atenolol to 21.1 mu g for ibuprofen. For ibuprofen and acetaminophen, concentrations in runoff first decreased and then increased, suggesting that these drugs were initially chemically or physically sequestered in the biosolids slurry, and subsequently released in the soil. Carbamazepine and triclosan were detected at low concentrations in a runoff event 266 days after broadcast application. overall, this study showed that injection of biosolids slurry below the soil surface could effectively eliminate surface runoff of PPCPs.

AB In this study, a single-chamber Mg-air fuel cell (MAFC) is used to remove phosphorous (P) and to simultaneously recover struvite and electricity from synthetic hydrolyzed urine. The Mg 2+ generated from the anodic oxidation of Mg alloy provides a source of Mg for struvite precipitation. Meanwhile, the cathodic oxygen reduction re- action through a four-electron pathway produces OH- to maintain suitable pH for struvite precipitation and the avoid the addition of exogenous chemical reagents. The P concentration in the e ffluent is lower than 0.5 mg L-1 after a 15-min treatment and meets the sewage grade A discharge standard in China. The P removal e fficiency of urine reaches 99.48% with an e ffluent P concentration of 0.28 mg L-1 after a 25-min operation of MAFC, and the removed P can be completely recovered as high-purity struvite precipitation. The rate constant for P removal is calculated to be 0.46 min(-1) by fitting a first-order kinetic model. The recovered precipitation is identi fied as struvite, and the chemical analysis reveals a struvite purity of 98.26%. The maximum power density of MAFC with P-containing urine as electrolyte reaches 552.32 mW m(-3) , which is 47.39% higher than that of MAFC with P-free electrolyte. The struvite precipitation reaction can promote the electricity production of MAFC. This work provides not only a novel method for purifying and recovering resources from urine but also a new perspective for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MAFC in the future.

AB This study combined data of the concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products (PPCPs) in the sediments and the biological responses of the Atherinella brasiliensis fish in two different sites and climate seasons in the Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia, Southeast Brazil. The presence of metals, PAHs, and PPCPs were observed in the sediments demonstrating the contamination throughout the system with contributions of sewage and residues disposal, oil and combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. Higher contaminations were identified in the point of greater human presence (C - Cananeia City), especially during the cold-dry season. The influence of anthropic activities and variations in the estuarine conditions, such as lower hydrodynamics during the lower rainfall period, were observed. In fish, spatial and seasonal changes in the parameters of oxidative stress and biotransformation, genotoxicity and histopathological alterations followed the same trend, with more pronounced responses in C in the cold-dry season. The biological responses of the fish revealed adverse effects in the local species population and indicated the presence of metals, PAHs and PPCPs as stressors. The multivariate analysis and the integrated biomarker response index (IBR) corroborated with these results, also indicating that site C had the worst environmental quality. The present study provides new information about the contamination of the sediments of Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia and the chronic exposure to contaminants in A. brasiliensis. Therefore, contributing to a better understanding of the local environmental quality with data that can support protective management of the area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban rivers may receive contamination from various sources including point sources like domestic sewage and nonpoint sources (e.g., runoff), resulting in contamination with various chemicals. This study investigated the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (3 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and 17 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)) in six urban rivers of a representative subtropical city, Guangzhou (southern China). Our results showed that EDCs and personal care products were frequently detected in the water phase and sediment phase. 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) was the most predominant compound with the highest concentration of 5050 ng/L in the water phase and 14,400 ng/g dry weight (dw) in the sediment. Generally, higher total concentrations of EDCs and PPCPs were detected in the four urban streams compared to the main stream Zhujiang River and the Liuxi River at the suburb area. A screening-level risk assessment showed that 4-nonylphenol and triclosan (TCS) pose potential risks to aquatic organisms in most sampling sites. For individual taxa, 4-NP may pose risks to various groups of aquatic organisms, while TCS only might pose high risks to algae. Capsule: Higher contamination of EDCs and PPCPs was observed in rivers in urban area; 4-nonylphenol and triclosan showed RQs > 1 in >70% of the reported area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aquatic organisms can be exposed to thousands of chemicals discharged by the human population. Many of these chemicals are considered disruptive to aquatic wildlife, and the literature on the impacts of these chemicals grows daily. However, because time and resources are not infinite, research must focus on the chemicals that represent the greatest threat. One group of chemicals of increasing concern is pharmaceuticals, for which the primary challenge is to identify which represent the greatest threat. In the present study, a list of 12 pharmaceuticals was compiled based on scoring the prevalence of different compounds from previous prioritization reviews. These included rankings based on prescription data, environmental concentrations, predicted environmental concentration/predicted no-effect concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratios, persistency/bioaccumulation/(eco) toxicity (PBT), and fish plasma model approaches. The most frequently cited were diclofenac, paracetamol, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, naproxen, atenolol, ethinyl estradiol, aspirin, fluoxetine, propranolol, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole. For each pharmaceutical, literature on effect concentrations was compiled and compared with river concentrations in the United Kingdom. The pharmaceuticals were ranked by degree of difference between the median effect and median river concentrations. Ethinyl estradiol was ranked as the highest concern, followed by fluoxetine, propranolol, and paracetamol. The relative risk of these pharmaceuticals was compared with those of metals and some persistent organic pollutants. Pharmaceuticals appear to be less of a threat to aquatic organisms than some metals (Cu, Al, Zn) and triclosan, using this ranking approach. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Pharmaceuticals, such as anti-inflammatory nonsteroidal drugs, are frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems. Studies about the effects of these substances in nontarget organisms, such as bivalves, are relevant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on antioxidant status caused by ibuprofen (IBU) in oysters Crassostrea gigas exposed for 1, 4, and 7 days at concentrations 1 and 100 mu g L-1. Levels of IBU in tissues of oysters, as well as cell viability of hemocytes, were measured. The transcription of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, CYP30C1), glutathione S-transferase isoforms (GST-omega-like and GST-pi-like), cyclooxygenase-like (COX-like), fatty acid binding protein-like (FABP-like), caspase-like, heat shock protein-like (HSP70-like), catalase-like (CAT-like), and the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also evaluated in the gills of oysters. The highest levels of IBU were observed in animals exposed to 100 mu g L-1. A significant upregulation of CYP2AU1, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, GST-pi-like, COX-like, and FABP-like was observed in oysters exposed to IBU under different experimental conditions. Oysters exposed to 1 mu g L-1 for 7 days showed a significantly higher transcription of CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, and GST-pi-like but lower GR activity. In conclusion, C. gigas exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBU (1 mu g L-1) exhibited increased transcription of certain genes and alterations on antioxidant and auxiliary enzymes, which could, in the the long term, cause damages to exposed organisms.

AB Parabens, triclosan, and lipid regulators are frequently used in pharmaceuticals, personal care, hygiene, food, and other products. The final destination of these compounds frequently is domestic sewage. In many cases, collection and treatment systems are not completely efficient, and these compounds reach the environment. However, many of these substances are toxic, and their presence poses risks to several organisms. This study has the goal to determine the occurrence of five personal care products and two lipid regulators in three rivers in southern Brazil. Four sampling campaigns were conducted in December, March, June, and October in three rivers. Risk assessment was performed, and the general index of human contamination (GIHC) was used to evaluate water pollution in the area. Compounds were analyzed using an Agilent GC-MS/MS 7890A chromatograph. The monitoring and reaction mode (MRM) was employed for the detection and quantification of the compounds. Gemfibrozil was detected in concentrations up to 2590 ng L-1 and personal care products up to 788 ng L-1. Fenofibrate was not detected in any sample, while gemfibrozil, methylparaben, propylparaben, and triclosan were detected in all samples. Risk assessment indicated that triclosan, propylparaben, and gemfibrozil should be designated as priority compounds in the area. GIHC is a simple and efficient tool to assess pollution in urban areas and can be employed in future studies. The results indicated that areas upstream of the WWTPs had higher contamination levels than downstream, indicating that diffuse pollution and illegal effluent discharges may have a strong influence on the water quality in the area.

AB Antibiotics are known to enter the environment, not only by human excretion but also through livestock/aquaculture, healthcare facilities, and pharmaceutical industry waste. Once in the environment, antibiotics have the ability to provide a selective pressure in microbial communities thus selecting for resistance. Bayou Lafourche of Southeastern Louisiana serves as the raw source of drinking water for 300,000 people in the region and has previously been shown to receive high amounts of fecal contamination. Four sites along the bayou and one site from its input source on the Mississippi River were monitored for water chemistry, total and fecal coliform estimates, and presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) for a period of 1 year. Four waste-associated bacterial isolates were tested for resistance to antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin). Resistant bacteria were further examined with PCR/electrophoresis to confirm the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (Sul1, tet(A), tet(W), tet(X), IMP, KPC, and OXA-48). The bayou appears to meet the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) criteria for water chemistry, yet fecal coliforms were consistently higher than LDEQ thresholds, thus indicating fecal contamination. Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed 13.6%, 10.9%, and 19.8% resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cefoxitin, respectively, and 11 isolates were confirmed for presence of either tet(A) or Sul1 resistance genes. High fecal coliforms and presence of ARB/ARG may both indicate a presence of anthropogenic or agricultural source of fecal contamination.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX), the active ingredient in well-known therapeutic drugs such as Prozac, is highly prescribed worldwide to treat affective disorders even among pregnant women and adolescents. Given that FLX readily crosses the placenta, a fetus from a treated pregnant woman is potentially at risk from unintended effects of the chemical. Moreover, FLX reaches aquatic ecosystems at biologically active levels through sewage release, so fish may also be inadvertently affected. We previously demonstrated that FLX exposure to environmentally- (Low FIX Lineage; LFL) and human- (High FIX Lineage; HFL) relevant concentrations during the first 6 days of life in zebrafish (ZF; Danio rerio) reduced cortisol levels in the adults (F-0), an effect that persisted across 3 consecutive unexposed generations (F-1 to F-3). Here, we show that the transcriptional profile of selected genes in the staroidogenesis pathway in the F o whole-larvae varied in magnitude and direction in both FIX lineages, despite the same attenuated cortisol phenotype induced by both concentrations. We also observed an up-regulation in the transcript levels of some steroidogenic-related genes and a down-regulation of a gene involved in the inactivation of cortisol in the F-3 HFL larvae. These findings on the transcript levels of the selected genes in the larvae from F-0 and F-3 suggest that specific coping mechanism(s) are activated in descendants to attempt to counteract the disruptive effects of FIX. Our data are cause for concern, given the increasing prescription rates of FIX and other antidepressants, and the potential long-term negative impacts on humans and aquatic organisms.

AB For several years, the scientific community has been concerned about the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wild, since these compounds may have unpredictable deleterious effects on living organisms. Two examples of widely used pharmaceuticals that are present in the environment are paracetamol and ciprofloxacin. Despite their common presence in the aquatic environment due to their poor removal by sewage treatment plants, knowledge concerning their putative toxic effects is still scarce. This work aimed to characterize the effects of paracetamol (0.005, 0.025, 0.125, 0.625, and 3.125 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin (0.005, 0.013, 0.031, 0.078, 0.195, and 0.488 mu g/L) in zebrafish embryos and larvae, exposed to environmentally relevant levels, close to the real concentrations of these pharmaceuticals in surface waters and effluents. The adopted toxic end points were developmental, a behavioral parameter (total swimming time), and a biomarker-based approach (quantification of the activities of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, cholinesterases, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation levels) combined with epigenetic analysis (immunohistochemical detection of 5-methylcytidine). Exposure to paracetamol had effects on all of the adopted toxic end points; however, ciprofloxacin only caused effects on behavioral tests and alterations in biomarkers. It is possible to ascertain the occurrence of oxidative stress following exposure to both drugs, which was more evident regarding paracetamol, an effect that may be related to the observed epigenetic modifications.

AB Parabens have been widely used as antimicrobial agents, mainly in food products, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Although they are known as safe preservatives, they also cause some harm to human health, which has been discussed lately. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of nine parabens (including isomers) in mineral and drinking waters, besides in drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) samples with determination by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both methods solid phase extraction (SPE) and QuEChERS were validated. Calibration curves showed a correlation coefficient of 0.99 for all compounds. LOQ values ranged from 0.04 to 4 mu g L-1 in aqueous matrices and from 5 to 500 ng g(-1) in DWTS. Recoveries between 70 and 115% were reached with RSD below 20% for all compounds in SPE whereas recoveries between 62 and 119% were found with RSD below 20% for almost all compounds in QuEChERS. Matrix effect had low values (< 20%); it was only above 20% for methylparaben in the SPE and for pentylparaben in the QuEChERS. Using a quick and simple extraction procedures with SPE, QuEChERS, and LC-MS/MS analyses, these methods proved to be selective and sensitive. They were successfully applied to real samples (treated water, mineral water, and sludge), and methylparaben was detected at concentration levels below 0.242 mu g L-1 in mineral and treated water samples and 10 ng g(-1) in DWTS samples.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the potential health risks of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in ambient air of different factories. In this study, fifty-five locations were selected and represented eleven type factories, including municipal solid waste incineration factory (MSWI), hazardous solid waste incineration factory (HSWI), sewage sludge treatment factory (SST), medical waste incineration factory (MWI), electronic factory (EF), pharmaceutical factory in large infusion (PILI), oral medication class factory (OMC), inorganic chemical factory (IC), organic chemical factory (OC), paper mills factory (PM) and mechanical factory (MF). We found that toxic equivalent concentration of PCDD/Fs (TEQ) ranged from 0.236 +/- 0.198 to 0.48 +/- 0.442 pg I-TEQ/Nm(3) in 11 kinds of factories, and average value of TEQs in 11 factories were lower than atmospheric PCDD/F standard (0.6 pg I-TEQ/m3) announced in Japan, and the mean values of TEQ in ambient air of factories were in the decreasing order of MWI > MSWI > PILI > MF > OC > SST > HSWI > OMC > PM > EF > IC. In addition, lifetime average daily doses (LADDs) and their resultant excess cancer risks (ECRs) for workers in those factories were calculated. The results suggested that potential health risk might be occurred in those ambient air. Copyright (C) 2016 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.

AB This study investigates the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), and membrane distillation (MD). The Doce river located in Minas Gerais (Brazil - geographical coordinates 18 degrees 51'50.45 '' S and 41 degrees 56'46.86 '' W), which is used for drinking water catching and raw sewage disposal, was chosen as the background matrix for this study. Betamethasone and fluconazole, among the 28 assessed PhACs, were the most recurrent during monitoring. The results show that the PhACs rejection by NF and RO membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate (RR) increases. The first PhAC occurrence in the permeate happened at 40% and 60% RR for NF and RO, respectively. MD showed a rejection > 99% for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70% RR. NF and RO reject PhACs mainly through size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions, whereas, MD rejects PhACs due to their low volatility. All evaluated processes lead to a toxicological risk reduction. MD did not show any tendency of fouling, while NF and RO show flux decline mainly due to membrane fouling, which was more evident in RO. The membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and/or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low. Opex was estimated at 0.50, 0.43, and 1.96 US$/m3 for NF, RO and MD respectively. Although the MD process is more robust, the practical application is restricted by the high cost. And, NF and RO are feasible alternatives to remove PhACs from drinking water.

AB Aquatic systems receive a wide range of pharmaceuticals that may have adverse impacts on aquatic wildlife. Among these pharmaceuticals, antihistamines are commonly found, and these substances have the potential to influence the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Previous studies have focused on how antihistamines may affect behaviours of aquatic invertebrates, but these studies probably do not capture the full consequences of antihistamine exposure, as traditional recording techniques do not capture important animal movements occurring at the scale of milliseconds, such as prey escape responses. In this study, we investigated if antihistamine exposure can impact escape responses in aquatic insect, by exposing damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae to two environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) of diphenhydramine. Importantly, we used a highspeed imaging approach that with high-time resolution captures details of escape responses and, thus, potential impacts of diphenhydramine on these behaviours. Our results show overall weak effects of antihistamine exposure on the escape behaviours of damselfly larvae. However, at stage 2 of the C-escape response, we found a significant increase in turning angle, which corresponds to a reduced swimming velocity, indicating a reduced success at evading a predator attack. Thus, we show that low concentrations of an antihistamine may affect behaviours strongly related to fitness of aquatic insect prey - effects that would have been overlooked using traditional recording techniques. Hence, to understand the full consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic wildlife, high-speed imaging should be incorporated into future environmental risk assessments.

AB Knowledge on the sorption behavior of cationic organic substances in aquatic systems is vital for their risk assessment due to the increasing detection of such chemicals in the hydrosphere. Their sorption behavior is strongly influenced by sorption processes onto mineral surfaces (e.g., oxides, clays). To contribute to the development of prediction tools, the impact of sorbent characteristics on the sorption strength was studied in a highly-idealized model system. In addition to the properties of the solid phase, the concentration of other ions in direct competition for sorption sites and the molecular structure of the sorbate were changed to separate ion exchange and non-ion exchange processes. The study includes in total 120 systematic column experiments using five extensively characterized synthetic oxides (three silica gels, two aluminum oxides), three probe molecules (two structurally related cationic substances, one neutral compound), and four distinctively different NaCl concentrations. The results show that the concentration of OH groups on the sorbent surface is a meaningful descriptor for the observed variations in sorption capacity onto different oxides. Compound-specific linear correlations were obtained, enabling the prediction of sorption coefficients. In addition, a more complex sorption behavior of organic cations compared to uncharged molecules were observed as demonstrated by the sorption results at different electrolyte concentrations. Thus, the study provides an important step towards a better principal mechanistic understanding of organic cation sorption. However, further work using other sorbents including natural ones and other probe molecules is needed to verify the identified relationships within the scope of developing reliable prediction models for cation sorption.

AB Till now, no attention has been paid to pharmaceuticals (PCs) in the air, though they are known to affect waters, soils, foods and biota. This paper describes the first attempt to characterize the PC occurrence in the air. Airborne particulates (PM10 or PM2.5 fractions, from Amsterdam, Netherland, Rome and Rende, Italy) were sampled on quartz fiber filter by means of pumping systems operating at medium-volume conditions (16 or 38.5 L min(-1)). The samples were solvent extracted through sonication with a dichloromethane:acetone:methanol mixture and reduced close to dryness; three fractions of the residue were separated through column chromatography; they comprised non polar, low polar and very polar organic compounds, respectively, and PCs were in the third one. Chemical analysis was performed by means of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MSD), after treatment of solutions with methyl,tertzbutylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) to form silyl derivatives of most PCs. The following substances were investigated: acetaminophenol, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprefen, naproxen, fenofibrate, diclofenac, acetylcysteine and sulfanilamide; p-hydroxybenzoic acid and salicylic acid; and parabens (methyl, ethyl and propyl). Except aspirin, acetamidophenol, acetylcysteine and sulfanilamide, the target compounds could be quantified with good repeatability, reproducibility and percent recoveries (on the average, similar to 7.5%, similar to 7.1% and 91%, respectively). The PC concentrations ranged < 0.1-8.6 ng m(-3); season dependent drug profiles could be observed in Rome and Rende. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban water cycles are threatened in many ways by human activities, including the discharge of chemicals by industrial and household effluents. Since more than a decade it has been recognised that the active ingredients of, human pharmaceuticals contribute to the chemical contamination of urban surface waters and may pose a serious risk to the environment. Pharmaceuticals reach the aquatic environment due to their everyday use, excretion by humans and incomplete degradation in sewage treatment works. Their environmental concentrations are generally low. Due to their biologic activity, however, pharmaceuticals are considered as candidate compounds for low-level and chronic effects. Indeed, some pharmaceuticals, such as compounds interfering with reproductive hormones. provoke long-term effects on aquatic vertebrates in the ng/L range. Therefore, appropriate regulations for the environmental risk assessment as part of the approval of new medicines have been established. It was criticised, however, that these guidelines would not have been able to detect or predict the effects of Some Compounds with already known environmental impact. Thus, approaches for amending existing guidelines have been suggested. In this review, we give a brief-overview on Current and novel approaches for the prospective environmental risk assessment Of human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. In particular, we compare different strategies to identify potential ecotoxic effects and the possible applications within a regulatory framework. We indicate a number of tools that Could improve the detection of compounds with potential low-level effects or hitherto unknown but relevant alternative mode of actions with implications for long-term effects.

AB Sorption of pharmaceuticals, which can occur in soils, may differ when present in a soil solution as a single compound or in a solution with other pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the sorption isotherms described by the Freundlich equations were evaluated for 6 compounds, which were applied in solutions of a single pharmaceutical, two pharmaceuticals or all pharmaceuticals to seven soils. Study mainly focused on a behavior of fexofenadine and irbesartan that occurred in soils in 3 forms (cationic, zwitter-ionic or neutral, anionic). Sorption of both compounds slightly increased (in some soils) when applied together, largely increased when applied with carbamazepine (neutral), and extremely increased when applied in solutions with citalopram (strongly sorbed cation), which could be explained by a cooperative multilayer sorption on soil constituents. On the other hand, sorption of both compounds moderately decreased when applied with clindamycin (cation and neutral) or sulfamethoxazole (neutral or anion). The magnitude of an increase or decrease in the Freundlich sorption coefficient (K-F) for a particular compound depended on soil conditions, a form of compounds molecule and its interaction with molecules of other compounds. Despite sorption being influenced by other compound(s) in solution, the K-F coefficients evaluated for a particular compound under the different conditions were mostly correlated with the same soil properties: K-F,K-CAR with an organic carbon content, K-F,K-CIT and K-F,K-CLI with a base cation saturation, K-F,K-SUL with hydrolytic acidity, and K(F,FEX )and K-F,K-IRB with sorption complex saturation.

AB The study characterizes the anamorphic Bjerkandera adusta strain CCBAS 930, including growth conditions, physiological properties, and enzymatic activities related to basic metabolism and specific properties coupled with the fungal secondary metabolism. It was established that the fungus grows in a wide pH range (3.5-7.5), up to 3% of salt concentration and a temperature of 5-30 degrees C. Media rich in natural organic components (potato, maize extracts, whey) are optimal for biomass propagation. Minimal media, containing mineral salts and glucose as well as static growth conditions, are required to obtain idiophasic mycelium, equivalent to the secondary metabolism of the fungus. Of the 7 complex C, N, and energy sources tested, the strain did not utilize only fibrous cellulose. Lipolytic activity reached the highest values of the enzymatic activities corresponding to those capabilities. The specific properties of strain B. adusta CCBAS 930 determined by the production of HRP-like peroxidase were related to the decolorization and biodegradation of anthraquinone derivative daunomycin. The decolorization of 30% of daunomycin effluents occurred most rapidly in iso-osmotic medium and non-enriched with nitrogen, containing 0.25% glucose, pH = 5.0-6.0, and 25-30 degrees C. In agitated cultures, the strain decolorized solutions of daunomycin by biosorption, which coincided with the inhibition of aerial mycelium production and HRP-like biosynthesis. Based on knowledge, potential and real possibilities of using the strain in bioremediation of colored industrial sewage were discussed.

AB Pharmaceuticals are increasingly detected in environmental matrices, but information on their trophic transfer in aquatic food webs is insufficient. This study investigated the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 23 pharmaceuticals in Taihu Lake, China. Pharmaceutical concentrations were analyzed in surface water, sediments and 14 aquatic species, including plankton, invertebrates and fish collected from the lake. The median concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals ranged from not detected (ND) to 49 ng/L in water, ND to 49 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments, and from ND to 130 ng/g dw in biota. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in zoobenthos relative to plankton, shrimp and fish muscle. In fish tissues, the observed pharmaceutical contents in the liver and brain were generally higher than those in the gills and muscle. Both bioaccumulation factors (median BAFs: 19 -2008 L/kg) and biota sediment accumulation factors (median BSAFs: 0.0010-0.037) indicated a low bioaccumulation potential for the target pharmaceuticals. For eight of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in food webs, the trophic magnification factors (TMF5) were analyzed from two different regions of Taihu Lake. The TMFs for roxithromycin, propranolol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ofloxacin, norfioxacin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in the two food webs ranged from 0.28 to 1.25, suggesting that none of these pharmaceuticals experienced trophic magnification. In addition, the pharmaceutical TMFs did not differ significantly between the two regions in Taihu Lake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To mitigate the detrimental risk of residual phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (PEDCs) from the discharge of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and to increase the utilization of constructed wetlands( CWs), both a stacked CW (SCW), comprising vertical and horizontal flow CWs, and an assembled bio-filter (ABF) were developed and their capability to remove PEDCs from STP discharge at high hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) of 0.5-2.0 m/d evaluated. The SCW and ABF showed different performance on PEDCs removal because of process structural difference. The removal percentages of PEDCs were associated with their octanol-water partition coefficients (LogKow), except 4-nonlyphenol (4-NP) whose apparent removal rate was affected by its precursors, and declined in the order of triclosan (TCS) at 80% and 69%, 4-t-octylphenol (4-t-OP) at 58% and 51%, estrone (E1) at 48% and 44%, and bisphenol-A (BPA) at 45% and 32% in the SCW and ABF systems on average, respectively. The efficiencies of SCW and ABF were superior to the single type of CWs, such as surface flow CW, vertical flow CW, and horizontal flow CW, in terms of removal rates or first-order removal rate constants. Recommended value of HLR for optimal utilization of SCW and ABF to ensure essential removal of PEDCs from STP discharge was between 1.5 and 2.0 m/d. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous environment could be reductively degraded by using a hydrogen-based membrane biofilm reactor (H-2-MBfR) under denitrifying conditions as it provides an appropriate environment for the antibiotic-degrading bacteria in biofilm communities. This study evaluates the performance of H-2-MBfR for simultaneous removal of nitrate and TC, formation of degradation products of TC, and community analysis of the biofilm grown on the gas-permeable hollow fiber membranes. Hence, a H-2-MBfR receiving approximately 20 mg N/l nitrate and 0.5 mg/l TC was operated under different H-2 pressures, hydraulic retention times (HRTs), and influent TC concentrations in order to provide various nitrate and TC loadings. The results showed that H-2-MBfR accomplished successfully the degradation of TC, and it reached TC removal of 80-95 % at 10 h of HRT and 6 psi (0.41 atm) of H-2 gas pressure. TC degradation took placed at increased HRT and H-2 pressures while nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor for most of the electrons generated from H-2 oxidation used for denitrification. The transformation products of TC were found at part per billion levels through all the experiments, and the concentrations decreased with the increasing HRT regardless of H-2 pressure. Analyses from clone library showed that the microbial diversity at the optimal conditions was higher than that at the other periods. The dominant species were revealed to be Betaproteobacteria, Acidovorax caeni, and Alicycliphilus denitrificans.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) was studied as a photocatalyst under artificial ultraviolet (UV) and solar irradiation for degradation of estrone, a ubiquitous micropollutant widely detected in treated effluent from sewage treatment facilities. Despite its lower specific surface area and larger agglomerate size in water, ZnO enabled significantly more rapid estrone degradation in water under artificial UVA irradiation compared to the benchmark photocatalyst, Aeroxide (R) titanium dioxide P25 (P25 TiO2). Dissolution of ZnO photocatalyst, predominantly driven by its aqueous solubility, occurred during the photocatalytic degradation process which could be mitigated by pH adjustment. Solar irradiation was found to be a highly effective UV source for estrone photocatalytic degradation using either ZnO or P25 TiO2. Previous comparative studies on ZnO and TiO2 photocatalysts were reviewed, and the origin of the superior performance of ZnO under artificial UVA irradiation was investigated. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements showed that ZnO exhibited markedly higher UV absorbance than P25 TiO2 within the wavelength range of 320-385 nm, which supports the observation that ZnO showed evidently better performance than P25 TiO2 for estrone degradation under weak artificial UVA irradiation. Furthermore, a detailed mechanism was proposed on the role of intrinsic defects during ZnO optical excitation and charge transfer process, and its potential effect on ZnO surface redox reactions. The mechanism was supported by the observation that higher levels of hydrogen peroxide were generated in UV-irradiated ZnO suspension in the absence of added electron donors, suggesting that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO may be enhanced by an effective charge separation mechanism induced by its intrinsic defects.

AB Pharmaceuticals being extensively and progressively used in human and veterinary medicine are emerging as significant environmental contaminants. Pharmaceuticals are designed to have a specific mode of action and many of them are persistent in the body. These features among others make pharmaceuticals to be evaluated for potential effects on aquatic flora and fauna. Low levels of pharmaceuticals have been detected in many countries in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface waters, groundwater and drinking waters. In contrast, there is a general scarcity of publicly available ecotoxicological data concerning pharmaceuticals. Interspecies toxicity correlations provide a tool for estimating contaminant sensitivity with known levels of uncertainty for a diversity of wildlife species. In this context, we have developed interspecies toxicity correlation between Daphnia magna (zooplankton) and fish (species according to OECD guidelines) assessing the ecotoxicological hazard potential of diverse 77 pharmaceuticals. The developed models are validated and consensus models are presented to predict toxicity of the individual compounds for any one species when the data for the other species are available. Informative illustrations of the contributing structural fragments which are responsible for the greater toxicity of the diverse pharmaceuticals are identified by the developed models. Developed models are also used to predict fish toxicities of 59 pharmaceuticals (for which Daphnia toxicities are present) and Daphnia toxicities of 30 pharmaceuticals (for which fish toxicities are present). This study will allow a better and comprehensive risk assessment of pharmaceuticals for which toxicity data is missing for a particular endpoint. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a quick, easy, and robust extraction method for the simultaneous determination of 30 organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) including some transformation products in soil samples. Three different extraction methods based on an ultrasonic cylindrical probe (UAE), a pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and a QuEChERS method were compared. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for identification and quantification of the target analytes. A modified QuEChERS method showed the best results in terms of extractability and accuracy. The extraction procedure developed provided adequate extraction performances (70% of the target analytes were recovered within a 70-99% range), with good repeatability and reproducibility (variations below 20%) and great sensitivity (LOQ < 0.1 ng/g in most cases). No matrix effects were observed for 70% of the compounds. Finally, the analytical methodology was applied in a pilot study where agricultural soil was irrigated with reclaimed water spiked with the contaminants under study. Of the 25 CECs added in irrigation water, a total of 13 pesticides and 5 pharmaceutical products were detected at concentration ranges from 0.1 to 1.2 ng/g (d.w) and from 0.1 to 2.0 ng/g (d.w), respectively.

AB The pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) residues in freshwater lakes are being highlighted around the world. The occurrence and ecological risk of 34 PPCPs classified as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), cardiovascular drugs, psychotropic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, psychostimulants, and pesticides during rainstormperiod in surface water of the Dongting Lake, China, were studied. Twenty-six out of thirty-four PPCPs were detected, and the total concentrations of antibiotics ranged from 0.15 to 214.75 ng L-1 in surface water. The highest average concentration was observed for diclofenac, followed by diethyltoluamide (DEET). The PPCP concentrations were much lower in Dongting Lake compared to other rivers and lakes due to the strong dilution effect of rainstorm, while the detection rate remains high. Caffeine and DEET were detected with 100% frequency in Dongting Lake, and the detection rates of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, and roxithromycin were above 90%. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution of aquaculture plants, sewage treatment plants, and population density. The risk quotient (RQ) method was used to evaluate ecological environment risk under the worst case and the results suggested that clarithromycin, diclofenac, roxithromycin, and erythromycin might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially clarithromycin. This study can provide data support for further research on the dilutive effect and mechanism of rainwater runoff on PPCPs in lakes on a large scale.

AB Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug effective against gastrointestinal parasites in humans and animals. Despite the fact that it has been detected in environment (water, sediment and soil), there is no information on its fate in the environment. So, in order to understand the sorption process of albendazole in environment, the sorption mechanism and kinetic properties were investigated through sorption equilibrium and sorption rate experiments. For that purpose, batch sorption of albendazole on five sediment samples and five soil samples from Croatia's region with different physico-chemical properties was investigated. Except physico-chemical properties of used environmental solid samples, the effects of various parameters such as contact time, initial concentration, ionic strength and pH on the albendazole sorption were studied. The K-d parameter from linear sorption model was determined by linear regression analysis, while the Freundlich and Langmuir sorption models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms. The estimated Kd values varied from 29.438 to 104.43 mLg(-1) at 0.01 M CaCl2 and for natural pH value of albendazole solution (pH 6.6). Experimental data showed that the best agreement was obtained with the linear model (R-2 > 0.99), while the rate of albendazole sorption is the best described with the kinetic model of pseudo-second-order. Obtained results point to a medium or even strong sorption of albendazole for soil or sediment particles, which is particularly dependent on the proportion of organic matter, pH, copper and zinc in them.

AB Degradation of two representative antihypertensives, losartan (LOS) and valsartan (VAL) in water by photo-electro-Fenton (PEF), using a BDD anode in presence of sulfate anion was evaluated. PEF showed a fast elimination of these pollutants (>95% at 30 and 60 min of treatment for LOS and VAL, respectively). The main elimination route was the attacks of radicals produced in the system, having pseudo-first-order rate constants of 0.154 and 0.054 min(-1) for LOS and VAL, correspondingly. Theoretical analyses of atomic charges were performed to rationalize the antihypertensives reactivity toward the electrogenerated degrading agents. Afterwards, the primary transformation products were assessed. The transformation products revealed that the degrading species attack the biphenyl-tetrazole, imidazole, and alcohol moieties on LOS. Meanwhile, carboxylic and amide groups, plus the central nucleus, were modified on VAL. These moieties corresponded well with the electron-rich sites indicated by the theoretical calculations. Also, the PEF process removed between 33 and 38% of total organic carbon after 5 h of electrolysis. Finally, it was considered LOS treatment in presence of oxalic acid (a typical organic waste of pharmaceutical industry), in addition to the pollutant degradation in effluents from municipal sewage treatment plants by PEF at pH similar to 5. Oxalic acid accelerated LOS degradation. Meanwhile, in the effluent, the process led to 64% of LOS removal after 120 min of treatment, indicating the high potentiality of PEF to degrade antihypertensives in water containing organic and inorganic substances.

AB The current environmental problems urgently require researchers to seek an environmentally friendly, effective and easy to operate sewage treatment method. Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which has the advantages of simple preparation, safety, non-toxicity and chemical resistance, was expected to become a photocatalyst for solving environmental pollution. However, the performances of g-C3N4 still have some limitations that the electron hole recombination is fast and the powder is not easy to recover. In this study, zinc-doped graphite carbon nitride photocatalyst (Zn-g-C3N4) was mixed with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to produce photocatalyst fibres by electrospinning. It not only solves the problem that the powder catalyst is difficult to recycle, but also effectively inhibits the recombination of photoelectron-hole pairs. Zn-g-C3N4/PAN has good photocatalytic activity for the simultaneous reduction of hexavalent chromium and degradation of pharmaceuticals. When organic pollutants are present, the reduction efficiency of hexavalent chromium was improved without affecting its own removal efficiency. The potential application value of Zn-g-C3N4/PAN catalytic fibre was further explored by simulating the complex actual water environment. The composite fibre can be easily reused and keep its superior photocatalytic performance. The mechanism of pharmaceuticals degradation was proposed, in which center dot O-2(-) is the most important active species, which leads to the oxidation of pharmaceuticals. Besides, the photoelectrons generated by the catalyst can reduce the toxic hexavalent chromium. The efficiency of Zn-g-C3N4 to remove pollutants is improved by PAN fibre as a carrier, which not only solves the problem of difficult recovery of powder catalysts, but also provides more active sites.

AB Poor removal of many pharmaceuticals and personal care products in sewage treatment plants leads to their discharge into the receiving waters, where they may cause negative effects for aquatic environment and organisms. In this study, electrochemical removal process has been used as alternative method for removal of mefenamic acid (MEF). For our knowledge, removal of MEF using electrochemical process has not been reported yet. Effects of initial concentration of mefenamic acid, sodium chloride (NaCl), and applied voltage were evaluated for improvement of the efficiency of electrochemical treatment process and to understand how much electric energy was consumed in this process. Removal percentage (R%) was ranged between 44 and 97%, depending on the operating parameters except for 0.1 g NaCl which was 9.1%. Consumption energy was 0.224 Wh/mg after 50 min at 2 mg/L of mefenamic acid, 0.5 g NaCl, and 5 V. High consumption energy (0.433 Wh/mg) was observed using high applied voltage of 7 V. Investigation and elucidation of the transformation products were provided by Bruker software dataAnalysis using liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. Seven chlorinated and two non-chlorinated transformation products were investigated after 20 min of electrochemical treatment. However, all transformation products (TPs) were eliminated after 140 min. For the assessment of the toxicity, it was impacted by the formation of transformation products especially between 20 and 60 min then the inhibition percentage of E. coli bacteria was decreased after 80 min to be the lowest value.

AB The presences of micro-pollutants (active pharmaceutical ingredients, APIs) are increasingly seen as a challenge of the sustainable management of water resources worldwide due to ineffective effluent treatment and other measures for their input prevention. Therefore, novel approaches are needed like designing greener pharmaceuticals, i.e. better biodegradability in the environment. This study addresses a tiered approach of implementing green and sustainable chemistry principles for theoretically designing better biodegradable and pharmacologically improved pharmaceuticals. Photodegradation process coupled with LC-MSn analysis and in silico tools such as quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) analysis and molecular docking proved to be a very significant approach for the preliminary stages of designing chemical structures that would fit into the "benign by design" concept in the direction of green and sustainable pharmacy. Metoprolol (MTL) was used as an example, which itself is not readily biodegradable under conditions found in sewage treatment and the aquatic environment. The study provides the theoretical design of new derivatives of MTL which might have the same or improved pharmacological activity and are more degradable in the environment than MTL. However, the in silica toxicity prediction by QSAR of those photo-TPs indicated few of them might be possibly mutagenic and require further testing. This novel approach of theoretically designing 'green' pharmaceuticals can be considered as a step forward towards the green and sustainable pharmacy field. However, more knowledge and further experience have to be collected on the full scope, opportunities and limitations of this approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB zonation is an advanced water treatment process used to remove organic micropollutants (OMPs) such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). In this study, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, for ozonation and advanced oxidation process (AOP), were developed with percent-removal of OMPs by ozonation as the criterion variable. The models focused on PPCPs and pesticides elimination in bench-scale studies done within natural water matrices: Colorado River, Passaic River, Ohio River and Suwannee synthetic water. The OMPs removal for the different water matrices varied depending on the water quality conditions such as pH, DOC, alkalinity. The molecular descriptors used to define the OMPs physico-chemical properties range from one-dimensional (atom counts) to three-dimensional (quantum-chemical). Based on a statistical modeling approach using more than 40 molecular descriptors as predictors, descriptors influencing ozonation/AOP were chosen for inclusion in the QSAR models. The modeling approach was based on multiple linear regression (MLR). Also, a global model based on neural networks was created, compiling OMPs from all the four river water matrices. The chemically relevant molecular descriptors involved in the QSAR models were: energy difference between lowest unoccupied and highest occupied molecular orbital (E-LUMO-E-HOMO), electron-affinity (EA), number of halogen atoms (#X), number of ring atoms (#ring atoms), weakly polar component of the solvent accessible surface area (WPSA) and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C). All the QSAR models resulted in a goodness-of-fit, R-2, greater than 0.8. Internal and external validations were performed on the models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical substances in the municipal effluents is currently considered the principal source of bio-active molecule emissions into aquatic environments. This study analyzes the genotoxic damage caused by gemfibrozil and atorvastatin, two regulators of the hematic level of lipids, and sildenafil citrate, a vasodilator, on the teleost Danio rerio. The genotoxicity of these three compounds was evaluated using the comet assay, diffusion assay, and RAPD-PCR. The alkaline version (pH 12.1) of the comet assay was used for the erythrocytes of the zebrafish to evaluate the presence of single strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, the diffusion assay was used to estimate the number of apoptotic cells. The fish were treated with the three pharmacological agents at the average concentrations previously found at some Italian treatment plants and were then sacrificed from 5 to 35 days after exposure. The data of the comet assay showed a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity after 5 days of exposure to atorvastatin and after one week of exposure to gemfibrozil. This damage was, however, repaired after 14 days. Sildenafil citrate produced, instead, a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity at the concentrations found only after 35 days of exposure. The genotoxicity at the molecular level was tested by RAPD-PCR. The results from this investigation are in agreement with those from two other tests, confirming the efficacy of the use of the three experimental approaches for the complete evaluation of genotoxic damage.

AB In this study two pilot scale Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetlands (HSFCWs) near Lecce, Italy, planted with different macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia) and an unplanted control were assessed for their effectiveness in removing paracetamol. Residence time distributions (RTDs) for the two beds indicated that the Typha bed was characterized by a void volume fraction (porosity) of 0.16 and exhibited more ideal plug flow behavior (Pe = 29.7) than the Phragmites bed (Pe = 26.7), which had similar porosity. The measured hydraulic residence times in the planted beds were 35.8 and 36.7 h when the flow was equal to 1 m(3)/d. The Phragmites bed exhibited a range of paracetamol removals from 51.7% for a Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR) of 240 mm/d to 87% with 120 mm/d HLR and 99.9% with 30 mm/d. The Typha bed showed a similar behavior with percentages of removal slightly lower, ranging from 46.7% (HLR of 240 mm/d) to >99.9% (hydraulic loading rate of 30 mm/d). At the same HLR values the unplanted bed removed between 51.3% and 97.6% of the paracetamol. In all three treatments the paracetamol removal was higher with flow of 1 m(3)/d and an area of approx. 7.5 m(2) (half bed) than in the case of flow equal to 0.5 m(3)/d with a surface treatment of approx. 3.75 m(2). A first order model for paracetamol removal was evaluated and half lives of 5.16 to 10.2 h were obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals residue was detected in the water bodies as a consequence of the incomplete treatment. Recently, the side impacts of that residue on aquatic creatures have received a considerable attention. However, there is insufficient information about the effect of the most consumed narcotic drug (tramadol) on fish as an aquatic model. Thus, this study aims at investigating the poikilocytosis and tissue damage in Oreochromis niloticus after the exposure to 100 and 200 mg/L of tramadol hydrochloride. Three groups of fish were used; one as a control group, and the other two groups were exposed to 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L of tramadol hydrochloride respectively for 25 days. Exposure to tramadol caused a significant increase in the percentage of poikilocytosis compared to the control group. Poikilocytosis included tear-drop cell, spindle-shaped cell, sickle cell, schistocyte, blebbed cell, acanthocyte, eccentric nucleus, amoebocyte, dividing cell, and crenated cell. Moreover, liver tissue in fish exposed to tramadol showed degeneration and vacuolization of hepatocytes and atrophy of pancreatic acini as signs of histopathological alterations. Histopathological changes of brain showed severe gliosis, dark neurons, and vacuolization in fish exposed to tramadol compared to control fish. Gills tissue showed erosion, epithelial lifting, and secondary lamellae shrinking in fish exposed to tramadol compared to control fish. In conclusion, tramadol induced histopathological changes in liver, brain, and gills of Oreochromis niloticus as well as poikilocytosis were indicated clearly. Therefore, tramadol leakage to waters should be avoided to preserve aquatic creatures.

AB In this work, lovegrass (Cpa), an abundant grass of the Poaceae family, was employed as feedstock for the production of activated carbon in a conventional furnace using ZnCl2 as a chemical activator. The prepared material (Cpa-AC) was characterized by pH of the point of zero charges (pH(pzc)), Boehm's titration method, CHN/O elemental analysis, ATR-FTIR, N-2 adsorption/desorption curves, and SEM. This carbon material was used for adsorption of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and sodium diclofenac (DFC). FTIR analysis identified the presence of O-H, N-H, O-C=O), C-O, and aromatic ring bulk and surface of (Cpa-AC) adsorbent. The quantification of the surface functional groups showed the presence of a large amount of acidic functional groups on the surface of the carbon material. The isotherms of adsorption and desorption of N-2 confirm that the Cpa-AC adsorbent is mesopore material with a large surface area of 1040 m(2) g(-1). SEM results showed that the surface of Cpa-AC is rugous. The kinetic study indicates that the system followed the pseudo-second-order model (pH 4.0). The equilibrium time was achieved at 45 (ASA) and 60 min (DCF). The Liu isotherm model best fitted the experimental data. The maxima sorption capacities (Q(max)) for ASA and DFC at 25 degrees C were 221.7 mg g(-1) and 312.4 mg g(-1), respectively. The primary mechanism of ASA and DFC adsorption was justified considering electrostatic interactions and pi-pi interactions between the Cpa-AC and the adsorbate from the solution.

AB Porous activated carbons (ACs) prepared from a lignocellulosic waste, Caesalpinia ferrea seed pod wastes (CF) were utilised for removing captopril pharmaceutical from synthetic hospital effluents and aqueous effluents. Chemical activation using ZnCl2 was performed. It was utilised the following proportions CF-Biomass: ZnCl2 (1: 0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5, obtaining CFAC.0.5, CFAC.1.0, and CFAC.1.5 activated carbons. These mixtures were pyrolysed at 600 degrees C in a conventional furnace. The ACs were characterised by FTIR, hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio (HI), CHN/O elemental analysis, Boehm titration, surface areas (S-BET), total pore volumes, and pore size distribution. These analyses show that the ACs presents several functional groups on AC surfaces and there is a predominance of hydrophilic surfaces. All the activated carbons prepared presented surface area 1050-1480 m(2) g(-1). Regarding the adsorption process, the kinetics data were fitted to General-order kinetic model and equilibrium of adsorption data were well represented by and Liu isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity of 535.5 mg g(-1) was obtained at 25 degrees C for the sample CFAC.1.5. The thermodynamic studies have shown that the adsorption process of captopril is spontaneous and favourable. The employment of the ACs for treating simulated effluents, with different emerging contaminants, showed an excellent removal (up to 97.67%). This result is evidence that Caesalpinia ferrea seed pod wastes were a high-efficiency precursor for AC preparation and that such activated carbons could be used for treating hospital effluents containing pharmaceuticals.

AB Sludge recycled in agriculture may bring antibiotics into cropped soils. The nature, total amount, and availability of the antibiotics in soil partly depend on the sludge treatments. Our paper compares the fate of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) residues between soils incubated with the same sludge but submitted to different processes before being added in soil.
   The fate of C-14-AC-SMX residues was studied in mixtures of soil and sludges at different treatment levels: 1) activated and 2) centrifuged sludges, both enriched with C-14-AC-SMX, and 3) limed and 4) heat dried sludges obtained by treating the previously contaminated centrifuged sludge. The evolution of the extractability of C-14 residues (CaCl2, methanol) and their mineralization were followed during 119 days.
   More than 80% of the initial C-14-activity was no longer extractable after 14 days, except in soil with limed sludge. Liming and drying the centrifuged sludge decreased the mineralized C-14 fraction from 5.7-6.4% to 1.2-1.8% and consequently, the corresponding soils contained more C-14 residues after 119 days. Although C-14 residues were more CaCl2-extractable in soil with limed sludge, they seemed to be poorly bioavailable for biodegradation. For all solid sludges, the mineralization rate of C-14-AC-SMX residues was strongly correlated to that of sludge organic carbon, with a coefficient three times lower for the limed and dried sludges than for the centrifuged sludge after 14 days.

AB In this work, we investigated the use of thermally activated persulfate (TAP) as one of the most powerful advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of pharmaceuticals present in effluents. Pilot experiments were carried out on naproxen (NAP) solutions, and the effect of experimental conditions (e.g. inorganic additives, matrix) was assessed so as to better evaluate TAP systems and improve the reaction stoichiometric efficiency. A comparative kinetics study was provided for the removal of NAP vs work previously published using however other classes of pharmaceuticals e.g. bisoprolol, ibuprofen. The activation energy (EA) calculated was found to be 155.03 ( +/-26.4) kJ mol(-1). The best degradation rate was observed at 70 degrees C and found to be equal to 1.286 x 10(-4) mM min(-1). Furthermore, experiments were performed on untreated hospital effluents collected from the largest hospital in Beirut and spiked with NAP solution (50 mu M). Results showed full mineralization of the pharmaceutical effluent that was achieved and monitored via total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry were the techniques used for the identification of NAP and its transformation products. A NAP degradation mechanism was proposed and found to be mainly based on the action of sulfate radicals operating by electron abstraction. This study demonstrated once more that TAP systems are a valid and efficient method that can be used for the removal of dissolved pharmaceuticals in water and sewage water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the occurrence and distribution of sixteen antibiotics belonging to four groups in surface water, sediment and groundwater samples from the Wangyang River (WYR), a typical river receiving sewage discharges were investigated. Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the studied area. The aqueous samples were unavoidably contaminated with antibiotics, and the target antibiotics present in high levels were oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant at 3.6 x 10(5), 9.7 x 10(3), 6.9 x 10(4), 1.2 x 10(4), 4.8 x 10(3), and 1.1 x 10(3) ng L-1, respectively. Oxytetracycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin were the most frequently detected compounds in sediment samples, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant at 1.6 x 10(5), 1.7 x 10(4), 2.1 x 10(3) and 2.5 x 10(3) ng g(-1), respectively. The results also revealed that the high intensity of aquaculture activities could contribute to the increasing levels of antibiotics in the area. According to the ratios of measured environmental concentration (MEC) to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC), chlortetracycline, tetracycline, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin-H2O and sulfamethoxazole may present possible environmental risk to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Synechococcus leopoliensis and M. aeruginosa. Attention should be given to the long-term ecological effects caused by the continuous discharge of antibiotics in the WYR area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Caffeine is a well-known central nervous system stimulant, which can cause anxiety, insomnia and nervousness. Domestic wastes of caffeinated drinks, beverages and chocolates are the major sources for entry of caffeine in the environmental system. Caffeine has been widely detected in natural water resources. The current study describes a method for efficient removal of caffeine from aqueous solution by a laboratory scale dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in open air. Caffeine concentrations in various sample solutions were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the degradation products were identified by directly injecting the sample to mass spectrometer. The consequences of varied parameters such as input power, initial concentration and initial pH of the solution on the degradation of caffeine were investigated. Removal efficiency of caffeine from aqueous solution was 72.6% and 96.6% for the initial concentrations of 100 and 1 mu g/mL, respectively, at initial pH 7 after 4 min treatment in DBD plasma system with 60 W input powers. Caffeine removal efficiency was less in acidic solutions (initial pH 4), and insignificant degradation was observed in alkaline solutions (initial pH 10). Furthermore, the degradation of caffeine was also enhanced by increasing the input power in DBD system. The DBD system used in this study has been considered to be fast, effective and economical. It was operated at atmospheric condition in open air without using catalyst, expensive gases or organic solvents, and significant degradation of caffeine was achieved in a short (4 min) treatment time.

AB In the last few years, the newly opened Czech Arctic Scientific Infrastructure in Svalbard - Josef Svoboda Station - has closely collaborated with UiT - The Arctic University of Norway on very productive research related to climate change and the impact of the sea and land ice disappearance. Professor Josef Elster, the Head of the Czech station and a researcher in the diversity, ecology and ecophysiology of polar algae and cyanobacteria, and the glacial microbiologist Marie Sabacka and their team try to find the answer to questions concerning how the Arctic ecosystem responds to global warming and how global warming affects human activity. The results of their research can be used, for example, in the treatment and refinement of drinking and sewage water, the pharmaceutical industry and medicine, livestock nutrition including aquaculture and in the production of nutritional supplements for people. However, even the most exciting scientific information and results are not readily available to a nonprofessional audience. Interdisciplinarity and a suitable cultural framework can bring new life to the results of scientific research. If the presentation of science is interconnected with cultural disciplines such as literature, art, music or theatre, its account can be enriched and media interest can be increased. The scientific-cultural festivals AT HOME IN SVALBARD 2018 and ARCTIC FESTIVAL 2019 are just two good examples. The presentation of scientific research through culture is a very distinctive and innovative attempt. Moreover, the interest of the public can influence the stakeholders' approach to providing and increasing finances for further scientific research.

AB Sulfamethazine (SMZ), a kind of sulfonamide antibiotics, can exist for a long periods of time and has been widely detected in the environment, which could pose a potential health threat to human beings. In this study, sludge-derived carbon (SC) catalyst was modified and applied to degrade SMZ during catalytic oxidation process. Degradation products and possible transformation pathways were investigated based on data of GC-MS. The toxicity evolution of SMZ degradation after catalytic oxidation process was tested with zebrafish and microbial degradation respirometer. As a consequence, SC modified with nitric acid (SC-HNO3) exhibited highly catalytic efficiency reached 92.2% SMZ conversion and 75.2% total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate after 480 min. Ten kinds of possible products were identified by GC-MS during degradation process of SMZ, indicating two possible pathways. No pronounced malformation was observed in the toxicity experiments with zebrafish until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). However, further analysis showed that zebrafish incubated with SMZ solution had higher mortality, lower hatching rate, slower spontaneous movement and shorter body length, compared with the group used normal nutrient solution, while the water after treatment had lower toxicity effects on zebrafish. The toxicity experiments with microbial degradation respirometer showed that SMZ solution had lower value of oxygen uptake, which indicated that SMZ solution had higher values of toxicity and inhibition of pharmaceutical compounds. This study provides a catalyst with low cost and high catalytic efficiency for degradation process of SMZ and gives a deeper insight into the ecotoxicity of treated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Herein we investigated the multi-phase distribution and estrogenic effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloids, and soluble phases from the Shaying River to assess the composition of estrogenic compounds and associated estrogenic risk. The yeast two hybrid (YES) method, cross flow ultrafiltration (CFUF), and LC-MS/MS were employed. Risk quotient (RQ) values ranged from 0.72 to 3.88, revealing that the Shaying River posed high estrogenic risk to aquatic organisms. The contribution ratios of the target EDCs to the EEQ(YES) ranged from 62.7% to 92.5%, indicating that these chemicals were major contributors of estrogenic effects in the Shaying River. Further, 54.0-77.8% of the detected EDCs were distributed in the soluble phase, 15.1-31.7% were bound to colloidal substances, and 3.90-19.4% EDCs were associated with SPM. Significant correlation between total EDC abundance and COD contents was detected, and the concentrations of endogenous estrogens (E1, E2, and E3) were positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In addition, the in-situ SPM-soluble (Kpoc) and colloid-soluble partition (Kcoc) coefficients were calculated. The log Kpoc values of target compounds varied from 4.10 to 5.19, while log Kcoc values ranged from 4.25 to 5.56. Their Kcoc values were larger than the Kpoc values, indicating that organic colloids were the most important carriers of EDCs in the aquatic environment.

AB Understanding removal mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in conventional activated sludge systems is of fundamental and engineering importance. In this study, we selected six environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals as target organic contaminants, namely, metronidazole (MTZ), bezafibrate (BZF), ibuprofen (IBP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) for the mechanistic investigation for their removal. We demonstrated that sorption and biodegradation were the dominant pathways for contaminant removal, while volatilization and hydrolysis were negligible. The sorption removal process varied for the selected pharmaceuticals in the batch system. Then, first-order rate model was used to fit the biodegradation kinetics, and their first-order rate constants (k(bio)) were ranged from 3.67x10(-3) to 10.2 L g(-1) d(-1), in order of CBZ < CIP < SMX < MTZ < BZF < IBP. In order to elucidate the biodegradation mechanism, we calculated a total of twelve geometrical, electrostatic, and quantum chemical descriptors with density functional theory (DFT) approach. Then, correlation analysis was conducted to investigate kbio with these theoretical descriptors. Our results indicate that electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, influences the biodegradation kinetics to the greatest extent. The omega corresponds to the process where the pharmaceutical molecule acts as an electrophile, adding electron density from a nucleophile. The combined experimental and theoretical results provide insight into the intrinsic nature of biodegradation of organic contaminants of emerging concern during conventional activated sludge treatment.

AB The occurrence of illicit drugs in natural waters (surface, source and drinking water) is of interest due to the poor sanitation coverage and the high consumption of drugs of abuse in Brazil. In addition, little is known about the effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms and human health. This work investigates the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), in surface and drinking water collected in rivers from a populated geographic area in Brazil. Surface water samples were collected in 22 locations from 16 different rivers and one dam from sao Paulo State, whereas drinking water samples were collected in 5 locations. Samples were collected during the dry and wet season. Among the 34 surface water samples analyzed, BE was detected above the LOD in 94%, while COC in 85%. BE concentrations ranged from 10 ng L-1 to 1019 ng L-1 and COC concentrations from 6 ng L-1 to 62 ng L-1. In the drinking water samples analyzed, BE and COC were found in 100% of the samples analyzed. For BE, concentrations were found in the range from 10 ng L-1 to 652 ng L-1, and COC was quantified in concentrations between 6 and 22 ng L-1. These concentrations are one of the highest found in urban surface waters and may pose some risk to aquatic species. However, no human health risk was identified using the Hazard Quotient. BE is proposed as a reliable indicator of sewage contamination in both source and drinking water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paracetamol oxidation by ozonation and H2O2/UV processes was investigated. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of paracetamol with ozone was determined at pH 7.2 (k(o3)/(PRC) = 2.57 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)). The rate constant of the elementary reaction of ozone with the ionized form of PRC was then calculated and the pH dependence of the ozonation reaction of PRC was estimated. The second-order rate constant of the reaction of paracetamol with Ha radicals was also determined at pH 5 through the H2O2/UV oxidation system (k(HO)(center dot)/(PRC) = 4.94 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)). In the light of the high rate constants obtained, two conclusions on the kinetics of paracetamol ozonation in real water were drawn: (i) hydroxyl radicals do not have any impact on the removal of paracetamol during ozonation of real waters; (ii) a half-life of 0.03 s can be estimated for paracetamol, for a residual ozone concentration of 0.4 mg L-1. Hydroquinone and two other ozonation transformation products were identified by LC/UV, LC/MS and MS/MS analyses. In parallel, for the first time, toxicity was measured in ozonated paracetamol solutions with the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri test. The results showed an increase in toxicity as paracetamol degraded. This toxicity could not be assigned to hydroquinone formation only. One or several other transformation products more toxic than paracetamol might be formed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 14 mostly used pharmaceuticals from different classes (antibiotics, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stimulant) and hormones in surface water in Istanbul, Turkey was investigated in this study. An important drinking water source, Buyukcekmece Lake and main rivers flowing into the lake were selected for the monitoring of the compounds. Sampling was conducted five different times in a year in order to observe seasonal changes. A rapid, robust and sensitive method using solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer was established for quantification of both pharmaceuticals and hormones. Limit of quantifications were between 0.5 and 1.1 ng L-1. Recoveries were between 72-119% and 61-98% for ultra-pure water and for surface water, respectively. All selected compounds were detected at least once in the samples. Some pharmaceuticals were detected as high as a few of micrograms per liter levels in the rivers. Most frequently detected compounds were caffeine and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole). Synthetic hormone (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) was detected only 4 times corresponding least detected compound in whole sampling period. Field data confirms that amoxicillin is more prone to degradation with respect to other antibiotics. Estrone and 17-beta estradiol are converted to estriol by natural processes in surface water.

AB A reactive transport model is employed to evaluate the potential for contamination of drinking water wells by surface water pollution. The model considers various geologic settings, includes sorption and degradation processes and is tested by comparison with data from a tracer experiment where fluorescein dye injected in a river is monitored at nearby drinking water wells. Three compounds were considered: an older pesticide MCPP (Mecoprop) which is mobile and relatively persistent, glyphosate (Roundup), a newer biodegradable and strongly sorbing pesticide, and its degradation product AMPA. Global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method is employed to identify the dominant model parameters. Results show that the characteristics of clay aquitards (degree of fracturing and thickness), pollutant properties and well depths are crucial factors when evaluating the risk of drinking water well contamination from surface water. This study suggests that it is unlikely that glyphosate in streams can pose a threat to drinking water wells, while MCPP in surface water can represent a risk: MCPP concentration at the drinking water well can be up to 7% of surface water concentration in confined aquifers and up to 10% in unconfined aquifers. Thus, the presence of confining clay aquitards may not prevent contamination of drinking water wells by persistent compounds in surface water.

AB Acidic aqueous solutions of clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid), the bioactive metabolite of various lipid-regulating drugs, have been degraded by indirect electrooxidation methods such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton with Fe2+ as catalyst using an undivided electrolytic cell with a Pt anode and an O-2-diffusion cathode able to electrogenerate H2O2. At pH 3.0 about 80% of mineralization is achieved with the electro-Fenton method due to the efficient production of oxidant hydroxyl radical from Fenton's reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2, but stable Fe3+ complexes are formed. The photoelectro-Fenton method favors the photodecomposition of these species under UVA irradiation, reaching more than 96% of decontamination. The mineralization current efficiency increases with rising metabolite concentration up to saturation and with decreasing current density. The photoelectro-Fenton method is then viable for treating acidic wastewaters containing this pollutant. Comparative degradation by anodic oxidation (without Fe2+) yields poor decontamination. Chloride ion is released during all degradation processes. The decay kinetics of clofibric acid always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction, with a similar rate constant in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton that increases with rising current density, but decreases at greater metabolite concentration. 4-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol, along with carboxylic acids such as 2-hydroxyisobutyric, tartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic and oxalic, are detected as intermediates. The ultimate product is oxalic acid, which forms very stable Fe3+-oxalato complexes under electro-Fenton conditions. These complexes are efficiently photodecarboxylated in photoclectro-Fenton under the action of UVA light. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, differing metrics were utilized to measure effects of erythromycin (ER), trimethoprim (TR) and clindamycin (CL) on the structure and function of attached Wascana Creek, SK microbial communities. All three test antibiotics, especially ER, affected community structure and function of biofilms grown in rotating annular reactors. Biofilm thickness, bacterial biomass, and lectin binding biovolume (exopolymeric substances) were consistently less in ER treated biofilms when compared to the control. As well negative effects on protozoan numbers, and carbon utilization were detected. Finally, PCA analyses of DGGE results indicated that bacterial community diversity in ER exposed biofilms was always different from the control. ER exhibited toxic effects even at lower concentrations. Observations on TR and CL exposed biofilms indicated that bacterial biomass, lectin binding biovolume and carbon utilization were negatively affected as well. In terms of bacterial community diversity, however, CL exposed biofilms tended to group with the control while TR grouped with nutrient additions suggesting both nutritive and toxic effects. This study results represent an important step in understanding antibiotic effects, especially ER, on aquatic microbial communities. And because ER is so ubiquitous in receiving water bodies worldwide, the Wascana study results suggest the possibility of ecosystem disturbance elsewhere.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, including illicit drugs in aquatic systems, is a topic of environmental significance because of their global occurrence and potential effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health, but few studies have examined the ecological effects of illicit drugs. We conducted a survey of several drug residues, including the potentially illicit drug amphetamine, at 6 stream sites along an urban to rural gradient in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. We detected numerous drugs, including amphetamine (3 to 630 ng L-1), in all stream sites. We examined the fate and ecological effects of amphetamine on biofilm, seston, and aquatic insect communities in artificial streams exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g L-1) of amphetamine. The amphetamine parent compound decreased in the artificial streams from less than 1 mu g L-1 on day 1 to 0.11 mu g L-1 on day 22. In artificial streams treated with amphetamine, there was up to 45% lower biofilm chlorophyll a per ash-free dry mass, 85% lower biofilm gross primary production, 24% greater seston ash-free dry mass, and 30% lower seston community respiration compared to control streams. Exposing streams to amphetamine also changed the composition of bacterial and diatom communities in biofilms at day 21 and increased cumulative dipteran emergence by 65% and 89% during the first and third weeks of the experiment, respectively. This study demonstrates that amphetamine and other biologically active drugs are present in urban streams and have the potential to affect both structure and function of stream communities.

AB The aim of this study was to test if pharmaceuticals could explain observed responses of field collected and transplanted invertebrate species (Hydropsyche exocellata, Echinogammarus longisetosus, and Daphnia magna). The study was performed in the middle and lower course of Llobregat river basin, which is affected by pharmaceuticals and other pollutants coming from sewage treated effluents. Up to 10 different endpoints including enzyme activities related with detoxication mechanisms (i.e. glutathione S transferase, catalase, esterases), the oxidative stress damage marker (lipid peroxidation), and individual responses (mortality, post-exposure feeding rates) were assessed. Biological responses were complemented with a detailed chemical analysis of metals, detergents, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other general water quality variables to allow identifying causal abiotic factors. Estimated hazard indexes of measured pollutants indicated that pesticides and metals accounted for most of the predicted toxicity (>95%) in the most contaminated site and that the predicted toxicity of pharmaceuticals was marginal (<5%). The three species showed a clear impact across the studied gradient indicated by higher levels of feeding inhibition and of mortality towards lower reaches. Specific responses such as inhibition of cholinesterase activities were closely related to high and presumable toxic levels of diazinon, whereas unspecific responses such as enhanced levels of antioxidant defensive mechanism and of lipid peroxidation levels were associated with most pollutant classes as well as with high and presumable toxic levels of salt and ammonia. These results indicate that pesticides, salinity, ammonia probably had greater effects on the studied species than pharmaceuticals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmacologically active substances used in the treatment of human and animal illnesses may usually enter the aquatic environment via effluents from sewage treatment plants, as they are not completely biodegraded or removed during waste water treatment. 17 beta-Estradiol genotoxicity was evaluated in Oreochromis niloticus (family Cichlidae) using micronucleus test, other nuclear abnormalities assessment, and the comet assay with erythrocytes. Fish were exposed to aqueous systems contaminated with 6 ng/L 17 beta-estradiol for three periods: 24 h, 48 h, and 10 days. The results showed that 17 beta-estradiol has genotoxic potential in different periods, since significant differences (P = 0.036) were observed in the micronucleus frequencies of the 10-day exposure groups in relation to the control group. Also, the same was observed when comparing the nuclear abnormality frequencies (P = 0.018) of the 24-h exposure group with the negative control group, and when using comet assay (P < 0.001) for 48-h evaluations. The tested concentration of the 17 beta-estradiol gave rise to mutagenic and genotoxic effects on the blood cells of O. niloticus, therefore the substance being considered a clastogenic chemical contaminant on both acute and chronic exposures. The assessment using a combination of micronucleus test, nuclear abnormalities, and comet assays proved to be suitable and useful in the genotoxicity testing of 17 beta-estradiol at nanograms per liter.

AB The H295R cell bioassay was used to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting effects of 18 of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the United States. Exposures for 48 It with single pharmaceuticals and binary mixtures were conducted; the expression of five steroidogenic genes, 3 beta HSD2, CYP11 beta 1, CYP11 beta 2, CYP17 and CYP19, was quantified by Q-RT-PCR. Production of the steroid hormones estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P) was also evaluated. Antibiotics were shown to modulate gene expression and hormone production. Amoxicillin up-regulated the expression of CYP11 beta 2 and CYP19 by more than 2-fold and induced estradiol production up to almost 3-fold. Erythromycin significantly increased CYP11 beta 2 expression and the production of P and E2 by 3.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively, while production of T was significantly decreased. The p-blocker salbutamol caused the greatest induction of CYP17, more than 13-fold, and significantly decreased E2 production. The binary mixture of cyproterone and salbutamol significantly down-regulated expression of CYP19, while a mixture of ethynylestradiol and trenbolone, increased E2 production 3.7-fold. Estradiol production was significantly affected by changes in concentrations of trenbolone, cyproterone, and ethynylestradiol. Exposures with individual pharmaceuticals showed the possible secondary effects that drugs may exert on steroid production. Results from binary mixture exposures suggested the possible type of interactions that may occur between drugs and the joint effects product of such interactions. Dose-response results indicated that although two chemicals may share a common mechanism of action the concentration effects observed may be significantly different. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB As a macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin (CLA) has a high detection rate in surface water and sewage treatment plant effluents worldwide, posing a considerably high ecological risk to aquatic ecosystem. However, algal transcriptome and metabolome in response to CLA remains largely unknown. In this study, a model alga Raphidocelis subcapitata (R. subcapitata), was exposed to CLA at the concentrations of 0, 3, 10, and 15 mg L-1. Transcriptomic analysis was performed for all the treatment groups, whereas metabolomics was merely applied to 0, 3, and 10 mg L-1 groups because of the limited amount of algal biomass. After 7 d cultivation, the growth of R. subcapitata was significantly hindered at the concentrations above 10 mg L-1. A total of 115, 1833, 2911 genes were differentially expressed in 3, 10, and 15 mg L-1 groups, respectively; meanwhile, 134 and 84 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were found in the 3 and 10 mg L-1 groups. Specifically, expression levels of DEGs and DAMs related to xenobiotic metabolism, electron transport and energy synthesis were dysregulated, leading to the produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). To confront the CLA-induced injury, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids of R. subcapitata in 3 mg L-1 were up-regulated; although the photosynthesis was up-regulated in both 10 mg L-1 and 15 mg L-1 groups, the energy synthesis and the ability to resist ROS in these two groups were down-regulated. Overall, this study shed light on the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of macrolide antibiotics in algae. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investigation was made of the potential of in natura water hyacinth for use in the synthesis of a magnetic hybrid suitable for the removal of metals and pharmaceuticals from aqueous media. XRD and FTIR analyses confirmed that the synthesis method was effective in obtaining the hybrid (denoted AGMG). Assays to evaluate the influence of pH on the removal of copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, and ibuprofen (IBP) showed higher removal percentages at pH 4-5 for the metals and at pH 3 for IBP. The processes showed fast kinetics, with the removal rates in the first 5 min exceeding 50% for the metals and 90% for IBP. The maximum AGMG adsorptive capacities (q(max), in mg g(-1)) were 18.3 for Cu(II), 10.1 for Zn(II), 7.33 for Ni(II), and 1.02 mg g(-1) for IBP. The following order of selectivity was obtained in tests employing mixed solutions of the three metals: Cu > Zn > Ni. The AGMG was reused in four cycles for the metals and in six cycles for IBP, with reuse efficiencies in the ranges 72-77% and 70-100%, respectively. The metal-saturated AGMG remaining after the reuse assays showed catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH4 and could be reused in ten reduction cycles, with conversion rates from 89 to 100% and times from 21 to 26 s.

AB Methods of the root-mean-square normalization and the coefficient of variation weighting were employed to normalize and weight the biodegradation effect values of aerobic bacteria and fungi of FQs molecules, and then the comprehensive biodegradation effect 3D-QSAR model of FQs was constructed using the comprehensive biodegradation effect value as target function. It was obtained from the three-dimensional equipotential map of the constructed 3D-QSAR model, the substitution sites and substitution groups that affect the comprehensive biodegradability of FQs were screened, and the widely used levofloxacin (named FQ-16) as target molecule was selected and modified with total of 67 FQ-16 derivatives designed. It was also found that there were 5 kinds of FQ-16 derivatives' aerobic bacteria and fungi biodegradability ratio, which were predicted using FQs' aerobic bacteria and fungi biodegradability 3D QSARs, approaching to the weight ratio set by the coefficient of variation method (55.47:44.53), indicating the comprehensive biodegradation effect 3D-QSAR model of FQs effectively covering both aerobic bacteria and fungi biodegradation information, and three of above FQ-16 derivatives also passed through the functionality and photodegradability assessment with significantly improvement. Change rate in energy barrier of FQ-16 biodegradation before and after modification agreed well with the increase in their comprehensive biodegradation effect values, meaning that the designed FQ-16 derivatives' biodegradation was confirmed by biodegradation pathway simulation. This article aims to provide a theoretical method for constructing FQs molecular multi-effect 3D-QSAR model and its environment-friendly molecular modification.

AB Many glucocorticoids occur in the aquatic environments but their adverse effects to fish are poorly known. Here we investigate effects of the natural glucocorticoid corticosterone and the synthetic glucocorticoids betamethasone and flumethasone in zebrafish embryos. Besides studying the effects of each steroid, we compared effects of natural with synthetic glucocorticoids, used as drugs. Exposure at concentrations of 1 mu g/Land higher led to concentration-related decrease in spontaneous muscle contractions at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and increase in heart rate at 48 hpf. Betamethasone showed a significant increase at 0.11 mu g/L in heart rate. Corticosterone also accelerated hatching at 60 hpf at 0.085 mu g/L. Transcription of up to 24 genes associated with different pathways showed alterations at 96 and 120 hpf for all glucocorticoids, although with low potency. Corticosterone caused transcriptional induction of interleukin - 17, while betamethasone caused transcriptional down-regulation of the androgen receptor, aromatase and hsd11b2, indicating an effect on the sex hormone system. Furthermore, transcripts encoding proteins related to immune system regulation (irg1l, gilz) and fkbp5 were differentially expressed by corticosterone and betamethasone, while flumethasone caused only little effects, mainly alteration of the irg1l transcript. Our study shows that these glucocorticoids caused more potent physiological effects in early embryos than transcriptional alterations in hatched embryos, likely due to increased metabolism in later developmental stages. Thus, these glucocorticoids may be of concern for early stages of fish embryos in contaminated aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the agricultural reuse of pharmaceutical sludge is still limited due to environmental and agronomic issues (e.g. low stabilization of the organic matter, phytotoxicity). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics of a pharmaceutical sludge derived from the daptomycin production and to study the possibility of improving its quality through composting. The pharmaceutical sludge showed high content of macronutrients (e.g. total KjeldahlN content was 38 g kg(-1)), but it was also characterized by high salinity (7.9 dS m(-1)), phytotoxicity (germination index was 36.7%) and a low organic matter stabilization. Two different mixtures were prepared (mixture A: 70% sludge + 30% wood chips w/w, mixture B: 45% sludge + 45% wood chips + 10% cereal straw w/w) and treated through static composting using two different aeration systems: active and passive aeration. The mixtures resulted in the production of two different compost, and the evolution of process management parameters was different. The low total solids and organic matter content of mixture A led to the failure of the process. The addition of cereal straw in mixture B resulted in increased porosity and C/N ratio and, consequently, in an optimal development of the composting process (e.g. the final organic matter loss was 54.1% and 63.1% for the passively and actively aerated treatment, respectively). Both passively and actively aerated composting of mixture B improved the quality of the pharmaceutical sludge, by increasing its organic matter stabilization and removing phytotoxicity.

AB The occurrence and temporal-spatial distributions of 13 antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones) in the water of a high-intensity aquaculture lake, Honghu Lake, and its associated river network and ponds were investigated. Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and sulfadiazine are the four dominant antibiotics in this region, with maximum and median concentrations of 1454.8 and 304.8 ng/L, 2796.6 and 161.9 ng/L, 1431.3 and 349.9 ng/L, and 499.5 and 106.5 ng/L, respectively. The median concentrations of the other nine antibiotics are lower than 57.1 ng/L. The highest contaminated sites are located in the Four-lake main canal and its lake inlets. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in November than in May and the concentrations were strongly correlated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrates according to redundancy analysis. The source analysis indicated that besides untreated domestic and husbandry sewage, the aquaculture in the lake and ponds is a main source of antibiotics in the study region. The environmental hazards posed by the selected antibiotics were assessed by using the methods of hazard quotient and mixture hazard quotient. The results suggested that tetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, and ciprofloxacin pose medium to high ecological hazard to algae in almost all of the water samples, and the high combination ecological hazards of antibiotics are mainly posed by the high individual hazard quotient of tetracycline in the study area.

AB The chemical stock of emerging contaminants in Brazilian drinking water is of great interest due to the poor water quality at surface water intakes. In addition, little is known about the effect of some contaminants, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may be present in both raw and treated water. The aim of this work was to evaluate selected emerging contaminants in Brazilian waters using both chemical and biological analyses. Sampling sites were established in different municipalities based upon raw water quality data. Estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, 4-n-octylphenol and 4-n-nonylphenol were determined in the samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A yeast assay using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae bioluminescent bioreporter was used to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the water samples. The first integrated results revealed similarities between the two individual approaches, since higher values for the bioassay were accompanied by significant concentrations of some selected compounds in surface water samples. No estrogenicity was observed for drinking water samples. Our results also indicate that the usual paradigm of evaluating water quality by measuring selected EDCs in a given water sample via chemical analysis, needs to be reviewed since the observed estrogenicity of a water sample is now a better guiding parameter to the selection of samples and substances to be chemically investigated in further analysis. So far, the data bank produced in this work, i.e., the comparison between chemical burden and observed estrogenicity, is not yet sufficiently robust to fully guide this decision.

AB Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant and high-prescription-volume drug, is excreted unchanged or as a glucuronide from the human organism. Little is known about its fate in sewage treatment plants. Effects of fluoxetine on life-cycle parameters of the midge Chironomus riparius, especially development (mean emergence time), emergence, sex ratio, and fecundity, were assessed, as well as effects on reproduction of the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus and of the freshwater mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Due to the moderate lipophilic properties of the compound with a log POW of 4.05, C. riparius and L. variegatus were exposed to fluoxetine via spiked artificial sediment at a nominal concentration range between 0.15 and 5.86 mg/kg (dry weight). Additionally, a test was performed exposing P. antipodarum via water in a nominal concentration range between 0.64 and 400 mu g/L. As endpoints, emergence rate and timing, sex ratio, clutch numbers and clutch size of the midges, the number of worms in the oligochaete test, as well as the number of embryos in the snail test were monitored. For C. riparius, no clear substance-related effects were observed; for L. variegatus, the results indicated a slight increase in reproduction, which was statistically significant at nominal fluoxetine concentrations of 0.94 and 2.34 mg/kg. In P. antipodarum, the antidepressant reduced reproduction significantly. No observed effect concentration (NOEC) and 10% effect concentration (EC10) were determined to be 0.47 and 0.81 mu g/L, respectively, based on measured fluoxetine concentrations in water. These low values indicate that P. antipodarum and possibly other aquatic mollusks are sensitive to fluoxetine and that the drug might pose a risk to gastropod populations in the field.

AB Currently, it is estimated that over 1 billion people are short of adequate portable water and this is expected to increase to 2.5 billion in the year 2025. Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are now accepted as important tools to extend the availability of water by facilitating the reuse of wastewaters. Sludge Retention Time (SRT) and liquid flux rate are the two most important parameters for controlling the MBR process. In this study, the removal of selected endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs), diltiazem, progesterone, estrone (E-1), carbamazepine (Cbz) and acetaminophen (Acet), by one full scale (VRM) and one pilot scale (clear-box) MBR plants was investigated. During the study, sludge age was set at 10 days and the sludge concentration was fixed at about 5.0 g/L. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) got higher with either increasing flux or sludge concentration in the membrane chamber. Therefore, changing the flux from 13 to 30 L/m(2)-h in both plants caused enhancement in TMP from -25 to -300 mbar in the clear box and from 160 to over 350 in the full scale MBRs. It was understood that flux had very little effect on the removal of EDCs at very low concentrations. Moreover, diltiazem was completely removed in the full scale whereas no removal was achieved in the pilot scale. Estrone and progesterone were completely removed by biodegradation in both plants. Acetaminophen was completely removed in the full scale plant whereas over 95% removal was achieved in the pilot scale MBR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to provide new insights on accumulation and possible adverse effects of various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in mussels, Mytilus gallo-provincialis, exposed to an environmentally realistic concentration (0.5 mu g/L) of individual compounds, Acetaminophen (AMP), Diclofenac (DIC), Ibuprofen (IBU), Ketoprofen (KET) or Nimesulide (NIM). The measurement of drugs in mussel tissues was integrated with both functional alterations at cellular level and transcriptomic responses. Results indicated the capability of mussels to accumulate DIC and NIM, while AMP, IBU and KET were always below detection limit. A large panel of ecotoxicological biomarkers revealed the early onset of alterations induced by tested NSAIDs on immunological responses, lipid metabolism and DNA integrity. The gene transcription analysis through DNA microarrays, supported cellular biomarker results, with clear modulation of a large number of genes involved in the arachidonic acid and lipid metabolism, immune responses, cell cycle and DNA repair. The overall results indicated an ecotoxicological concern for pharmaceuticals in M. galloprovincialis, with transcriptional responses appearing as sensitive exposure biomarkers at low levels of exposure: such changes, however, are not always paralleled by corresponding functional effects, suggesting caution when interpreting observed effects in terms of perturbed cellular pathways. Fascinating similarities can also be proposed in the mode of action of NSAIDs between bivalves and vertebrate species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increased interest over the levels of pharmaceuticals detected in the environment has led to the need for new approaches to manage their emissions. Inappropriate disposal of unused and waste medicines and release from manufacturing plants are believed to be important pathways for pharmaceuticals entering the environment. In situ treatment technologies, which can be used on-site in pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and at manufacturing plants, might provide a solution. In this study we explored the use of Pyropure, a microscale combined pyrolysis and gasification in situ treatment system for destroying pharmaceutical wastes. This involved selecting 17 pharmaceuticals, including 14 of the most thermally stable compounds currently in use and three of high environmental concern to determine the technology's success in waste destruction. Treatment simulation studies were done on three different waste types and liquid, solid, and gaseous emissions from the process were analyzed for parent pharmaceutical and known active transformation products. Gaseous emissions were also analyzed for NOx, particulates, dioxins, furans, and metals. Results suggest that Pyropure is an effective treatment process for pharmaceutical wastes: over 99 % of each study pharmaceutical was destroyed by the system without known active transformation products being formed during the treatment process. Emissions of the other gaseous air pollutants were within acceptable levels. Future uptake of the system, or similar in situ treatment approaches, by clinics, pharmacists, and manufacturers could help to reduce the levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment and reduce the economic and environmental costs of current waste management practices.

AB Fluoroquinolones, such as enoxacin, are poorly removed by common sewage-treatment processes, leading to their discharge into the environment, where they have unknown, and potentially serious, impacts on plants and aquatic organisms. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to understand the degradation of enoxacin by direct UV (ultraviolet) photolysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) involving UV/H2O2 and photo-Fenton [UV/H2O2/Fe(II)], which may provide an alternative method of removing this compound from water in a treatment plant. Aqueous samples of enoxacin (0.06mM) were irradiated at 254nm (Io=2x1016photons-1). The presence of H2O2, as well as the addition of FeSO47H2O (photo-Fenton process) both resulted in faster degradation kinetics compared to direct irradiation, with all of these systems leading to significant mineralization of enoxacin [>80% removal of total organic carbon (TOC)] within 30min. The kinetics for the degradation of enoxacin in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) isolates were also evaluated. Analysis of reaction byproducts by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) suggested that photolysis of enoxacin results in hydroxylation, defluorination, and formation of a geminal diol. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance was used for further verification. In addition, the rate constant for the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) reaction with enoxacin was determined by pulse radiolysis studies to be (5.91 +/- 0.08)x109Lmol-1s-1. These results suggest that center dot OH may play an important role in the photoinduced removal of enoxacin from water, and these systems may be used to remove this compound in treatment plants.(C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Sites 1 and 2 are situated in an urban catchment (River Wandle, London, UK) with site 1 downstream of a sewage treatment work; site 3 is located in a suburban park (River Cray, Kent, UK), and site 4 is more rural (River Darent, Kent, UK). The change in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), the expression of the metal responsive genes metallothionein A (mta) and B (mtb), cytochrome P450 1A1 (cyp1a1) and 3A27 (cyp3a27), involved in phase 1 metabolism, were assessed following exposure to sample water for 24 h. TER was comparable between F1GCS exposed to 0.2 gm filtered river water and those exposed to synthetic moderately soft water for 24 h. During the first sampling time, there was an increase in mta, cyp1a1 and cyp3a27 gene expression in epithelium exposed to water from sites 1 and 2, and during the second sampling period an increase in cyp3a27 gene expression at sites 1 and 4. Urban river water is a complex mixture of contaminants (e.g., metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons) and the increase in the expression of genes encoding mta, cyp1a1 and cyp3a27 in FIGCS is indicative of the presence of biologically active pollutants.

AB The continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into the environment results in a chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to these substances and their metabolites. As concentrations in surface waters are in the ng/L range, and sometimes in the low mu g/L range, they are not likely to result in lethal toxicity. However, prolonged exposure to low concentrations of anthropogenic chemicals may lead to sublethal effects, including changes in behaviour. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of three pharmaceuticals, the antidepressant fluoxetine, the analgesic ibuprofen and the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, and one cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), on the activity of the benthic invertebrate Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae). We used the multispecies freshwater biomonitor to assess changes in activity of G. pulex in a quantitative manner.
   Exposure to low concentrations (10-100 ng/L) of fluoxetine and ibuprofen resulted in a significant decrease in activity, whereas the activity of G. pulex at higher concentrations (I mu g/L-1 mg/L) was similar to the control. Response to carbamazepine showed a similar pattern, however, differences were not significant. The tested surfactant CTAB evoked a decrease in activity at increasing concentration. These behavioural effect concentrations were 10(4) to 10(7) times lower than previously reported LOECs and in the range of environmentally occurring concentrations. The potential consequences of this decreased activity for G. pulex population growth and benthic community structure and the exposure to mixtures of pharmaceuticals deserves further attention.

AB Antibiotic resistance presents a serious and still growing threat to human health. Environmental exposure levels required to select for resistance are unknown for most antibiotics. Here, we evaluated different experimental approaches and ways to interpret effect measures, in order to identify what concentration of trimethoprim that are likely to select for resistance in aquatic environments. When grown in complex biofilms, selection for resistant E. coli increased at 100 mu g/L, whereas there was only a non-significant trend with regards to changes in taxonomic composition within the tested range (0-100 mu g/L). Planktonic co-culturing of 149 different E. coli strains isolated from sewage again confirmed selection at 100 mu g/L. Finally, pairwise competition experiments were performed with engineered E. coli strains carrying different trimethoprim resistance genes (dfr) and their sensitive counterparts. While strains with introduced resistance genes grew slower than the sensitive ones at 0 and 10 mu g/L, a significant reduction in cost was found already at 10 mu g/L. Defining lowest effect concentrations by comparing proportion of resistant strains to sensitive ones at the same time point, rather than to their initial ratios, will reflect the advantage a resistance factor can bring, while ignoring exposure-independent fitness costs. As costs are likely to be highly dependent on the specific environmental and genetic contexts, the former approach might be more suitable as a basis for defining exposure limits with the intention to prevent selection for resistance. Based on the present and other studies, we propose that 1 mu g/L would be a reasonably protective exposure limit for trimethoprim in aquatic environments.

AB Some organic contaminants can accumulate in organisms and cause irreversible damages in biological systems through direct or indirect toxic effects. In this study the feasibility of the electrokinetic (EK) process for the remediation of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and triclosan (TCS) in soils was studied in a stationary laboratory cell. The experiments were conducted using a silty loam soil (S2) at 0, 10 and 20 mA and a sandy soil (S3) at 0 and 10 mA. A pH control in the anolyte reservoir (pH > 13) at 10 mA was carried out using S2, too. Photo and electrodegradation experiments were also fulfilled. Results showed that ER is a viable method for the remediation of these contaminants, both through mobilization by electroosmotic flow (EOF) and electrodegradation. As EOF is very sensible to soil pH, the control in the anolyte increased EOF rate, consequently enhancing contaminants mobilization towards the cathode end. The extent of the mobilization towards the electrode end was mainly dependent on compounds solubility and octanol-water partition coefficient. In the last 24 h of experiments, BPA presented the highest mobilization rate (ca. 4 mu g min(-1)) with NP not being detected in the catholyte. At the end of all experiments the percentage of contaminants that remained in the soil ranged between 17 and 50 for S2, and between 27 and 48 for S3, with no statistical differences between treatments. The mass balance performed showed that the amount of contaminant not detected in the cell is similar to the quantity that potentially may suffer photo and electrodegradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) deserve attention because of their effect on ecosystems and human health, as well as their continuous introduction into the aquatic environment. Classification schemes are suggested to characterise their biological degradation, e.g., based on pseudo-first-order kinetics, but these schemes can vary significantly, presumably due to pharmaceutical loads, sludge characteristics and experimental conditions. Degradation data for PhAC transformation products (TPs) are largely lacking.
   The present work focuses not only on the biodegradation of the pharmaceutical compound ibuprofen but also on its best-known TPs (i.e., carboxyl ibuprofen and both hydroxyl ibuprofen isomers). Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly consumed PhACs and can be found in different environmental compartments.
   The experiment performed consisted of a set of aerated batch tests with different suspended solid and ibuprofen concentrations to determine the influence of these parameters on the calculated biodegradation constant (K-biol). Sampling of the liquid phase at different scheduled times was assessed, removal efficiencies were calculated and pseudo-first-order kinetics were adjusted to obtain experimental K-biol values for the parent compound and its TPs.
   The experimental data were successfully fitted to ASM-based models, with K-biol values for the target compounds ranging from almost 1 to 17 L gSST(-1) d(-1), depending on the concentrations of the biomass and ibuprofen. This work provides innovative knowledge not only regarding the removal of TPs but also the formation kinetics of these TPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutically active chemicals (PACs) in the natural aquatic environment is recognized as an emerging issue due to the potential adverse effects these compounds pose to aquatic life and humans. This study presents the monitoring of two major categories of PACs in surface water: steroid hormones and antibiotics. Surface water samples were collected in the fall season from 21 locations in suburban (4), agricultural (5) and mixed (12) use suburban and agricultural areas. The water samples collected were analyzed using GC/MS for aqueous concentration of eleven steroid hormones: six natural (17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, progesterone) and five synthetic (gestodene, norgestrel, levonorgestrel, medrogestone, trimegestone). In addition, 12 antibiotics (oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, lincomycin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, tylosin tartrate) were analyzed using LC/MS. Steroid hormones detected in surface water were: 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, estriol, estrone, progesterone and trimegestone. Estrone had the highest detection frequency of > 90% with concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 ng/l. The second most frequently detected estrogen was estriol (> 80%) with concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 19 ng/l. The detection frequency varied at different sampling locations. No antibiotics were detected in the 21 streams sampled. This study aims to give a better understanding on the presence, fate and transport of PACs derived from humans and animals.

AB Owing to the prevalence of depression during childbearing, mothers can be prescribed multiple antidepressants; however, little is known about the risk and consequences to the offspring or subsequent generations. Fluoxetine (FLX) is usually the first-line of pharmacological treatment for affective disorders in pregnant women, with venlafaxine (VEN) used as secondary treatment. Given that FLX and VEN readily cross the placenta, a fetus from a treated pregnant woman is potentially at risk of the endocrine disruptive effects of these chemicals. Pharmaceutical agents, including FLX and VEN, reach aquatic ecosystems through sewage release; thus, fish could also be inadvertently affected. We report the results from a 6-day FLX exposure during early zebrafish development to an environmentally relevant level (0.54 mu g/L in water) and a concentration detected in the cord blood of FLX-treated pregnant women (54 mu g/L in water). The FLX exposure reduced the stress response (arithmetic difference between the stress-induced and unstressed whole-body cortisol levels) in the adult female and male zebrafish, an effect that persisted for four generations. To model the possibility of a second antidepressant exposure, filial generation 4 was exposed to VEN (5 mu g/L). We found that FLX exposure sensitized these descendants to VEN. VEN treatment further suppressed cortisol production in females and decreased spawning rates in adult pairs. This is an important demonstration that in an animal model, a brief ancestral exposure of great-great-grandparents to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor FLX will shape the physiological responses of future generations to the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor VEN.

AB Industrial fermentations for the production of pharmaceuticals generate large volumes of organic wastes which disposal is, nowadays, an environmental and economic issue. In the present paper, the feasibility of energy and plant nutrients recovery from the pharmaceutical organic waste originated from a fermentative biomass used for the daptomycin production was investigated. To achieve this aim, an integrated anaerobic digestion-digestate composting treatment was evaluated, with the purpose of energy (biogas) and organic fertiliser (compost) production. Moreover, the effectiveness of the integrated biological treatment for xenobiotic degradation (e.g. daptomycin) was evaluated. The biomass was initially anaerobically treated to assess its suitability for the production of biogas. The yield in bio-methane obtained when the organic waste was treated in co-digestion with agricultural by-products was 396 Nm(3) tVS(-1). Once optimized the anaerobic digestion process, the produced digestate was composted in a pilot scale apparatus. The composting of the digestate produced an organic amendment rich in macro-nutrients (27.1, 6.2 and 17.8 g kg(-1) of total N, P and K, respectively) and compatible with the Italian legislation concerning the production of fertilisers. No traces of daptomycin were detected in the compost, confirming the suitability of the integrated anaerobic-aerobic treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals. Thus, through the anaerobic-aerobic treatment, it was demonstrated that energy and nutrients may be recovered from an organic waste which disposal, nowadays, is difficult.

AB An erythromycin-degrading bacterium was isolated from the activated sludge of a sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on the morphological and physiological characteristics, the isolated strain was identified and named as Pseudomonas sp. ERY-E. In an inorganic salt medium inoculated at 1 % (v/v) of ERY-E strain containing 50 mg/L of erythromycin (ERY), the removal efficiency of ERY as high as 83.7 % was obtained under the optimum conditions with temperature of 30 degrees C, pH of 7.0, and 10 mg/L of yeast as the external carbon source. Subsequently, the ERY-E strain was used for bioaugmenting a biological aerated filter (BAF) to treat surface water containing low-concentration ERY. The influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and air-liquid ratio (A/L) on the performance of BAF was investigated. The average removal efficiencies of ERY and permanganate index (CODMn) were about 60.6 and 26.1 % in bioaugmented system (BAF(2)) and 26.9 and 26.0 % in unbioaugmented system (BAF(1)), respectively, under the optimum conditions with HRT of 4.0 h and A/L of 4:1 at steady state. Due to the stable removal of CODMn in BAF(2) as compared with BAF(1), it can be concluded that the introduction of ERY-E strain could collaborate with the indigenous microorganisms to attain a better ERY removal efficiency. As a result, the bioaugmented BAF method can be considered as an alternative technology for the treatment of surface water containing low-concentration emerging pollutants.

AB Environmentally relevant polar persistent organic pollutants (pharmaceuticals and diagnostic agents) were chosen according to human consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment (sewage plant effluents, rivers and groundwater) to investigate their behavior during photocatalytic oxidation. From data compilation in the literature, the active metabolite clofibric acid of some lipid lowering agents, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and the X-ray contrast media iomeprol were selected. The degradation of the persistent pollutant was monitored by HPLC/DAD/FLD. The study also focuses on the identification and quantification of possible degradation products by HPLC/DAD/FLD and HPLC/MS/MS. The degradation process was also monitored by determination of sum parameters and inorganic ions. Various aromatic and aliphatic degradation products have been identified and quantified. From analytical data, a possible degradation scheme for carbamazepine was proposed. Kinetic studies showed that the TiO2 photocatalyst P25 was more active in clofibric acid degradation than Hombikat UV 100. For photocatalytic degradation of iomeprol Hombikat UV 100 was more suitable than P25. In general the presence of NOM and carbamazepine retarded the photocatalysis of clofibric acid. Radiation attenuation, competition for active sites and surface deactivation of the catalyst by adsorption are the reason for that. The results of this work proof that photocatalysis is a promising technology to reduce persistent substances even if they are present in low concentrations or in a complex matrix.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify firstly the extent of contamination both of the aquatic biota and of sediments and secondly any regional differences in the concentrations of these compounds. In 1996, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, including their coplanar congeners) were measured in 58 eel and 50 sediment samples. Furthermore, the veterinary pharmaceutical bromocyclene and the nitro musks were determined in 84 (1995) and 122 (1996) eel samples. Polycyclic musk fragrances were additionally determined in analyses carried out in;1996.
   The mean values obtained during the two measurement periods (1995 and 1996) were 24 and 12 mu g/kg fw. for musk xylene, 41 and 39 mu g/kg fw. for musk ketone, 14 and 7 mu g/kg fw. for bromocyclene and, in 1996, 592 mu g/kg fw, for HHCB (maximum: 4131 mu g/kg fw.). Decreasing contamination levels are seen for musk xylene and bromocylene but not for musk ketone. This tendency, and the high amounts of polycyclic musk fragrances in the edible parts of eel show that these musks are widely being used in place of nitro musks and that they reach the aquatic system via waste waters, especially those of sewage treatment plants.
   The mean levels of PCBs in the biota samples of a highly polluted area were 1227 mu g/kg fw. or 119 pgTEQ/g (sediment: 203 mu g/kg dw.) and of a slightly polluted area 340 mu g/kg fw. or 49 TEQ/g (sediment: 47 mu g/kg dw.). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Parabens react with aqueous chlorine, which is used in disinfection processes, leading to the formation of halogenated parabens. In the presence of Br-, parabens and HOBr (formed via oxidation of Br-) can react to form brominated parabens. Brominated parabens may result in pollution of river water through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants. The present study involved measuring brominated paraben concentrations in the Kitakami River, northern Japan, which flows through urban and agricultural areas. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity was also assessed using a yeast (YCM3) reporter gene and HepG2 ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) assays. Dibrominated methylparaben (Br2MP), ethylparaben (Br2EP), propylparaben (Br2PP), butylparaben (Br2BP), and benzylparaben (Br2BnP), and monobrominated benzylparaben (Br1BnP) were detected in 25-100% of river samples during the sampling period from 2017 to 2018 at median concentrations of 8.1-28 ng/L; the highest concentrations were measured during the low flow season (November) in urban areas (P < 0.01). In the yeast assay, 12 compounds exhibited AhR activity (activity relative to beta-naphthoflavone; 4.4 x 10(-4) -7.1 x 10(-1)). All monobrominated parabens exhibited higher activity than their parent parabens, however, further bromination reduced or eliminated their activity. In the EROD assay, five compounds caused significant induction of CYP1A-dependent activity at 100 mu M (P < 0.05). Monobrominated i-butylparaben (BrliBP) and s-butylparaben (Br1sBP), Br1iBnP, and Br2BP exhibited activity in both yeast and EROD assays. We found novel aspects of brominated parabens originating from PPCPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sorption studies of organic micropollutants to sediments are useful for predicting their fate and transport. They allow for a better understanding of the migration of contaminants through environmental media, the exposure of aquatic organisms to such chemical and their affect on human health.
   This study examined the sorption of carbamazepine, ketoprofen, diclofenac, bisphenol A and triclosan onto sediments sampled along a dam reservoir. The sediments differed in structure, chemical composition and particle size distribution. The potential effect on the quality of drinking water through the removal of micropollutants by sorption was also estimated.
   Sorption isotherms of micropollutants were constructed at pH 7.6 on three natural sediments. The sorption points were determined by measuring the concentrations of analytes in both the solution and sediment samples. The results of partitioning coefficients suggest that triclosan (187.5-1248.5 mu g(1-1/n) l(1/n) kg(-1)) and bisphenolA (11.4-51.0 mu g(1-1/n) l(1/n) kg(-1)) exhibited relatively higher sorption, whereas ketoprofen (1.3-2.0 l kg(-1)), diclofenac (4.8-5.5 l kg(-1)) and carbamazepine (2.9-5.5 l kg(-1)) did not sorb to the studied sediments. The affinity of all micropollutants was higher for the finest sediment with the highest content of organic carbon and clay minerals, collected in the deepest part of the reservoir near the water intake.
   The low values of partitioning coefficients suggest that all of the tested micropollutants, except triclosan, are predominantly freely dissolved, which can have an adverse effect on the quality of drinking water.

AB In this study, the analytical procedures for the improved extraction and determination of the selected micropollutants (anthracene, pentachlorophenol, octylphenol, benzo(a)pyrene, and diclofenac) in aqueous environment are proposed. These methods were based on application of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and solid phase extraction for isolation of tested analytes from water samples. Compared to standard procedures currently used in the range presented in this paper, the authors' modifications of analytical procedures allowed increasing the recovery rate of analytes. Within modification of procedures, hyamine, methanol were used. The substances increase solubility of analytes in water, for instance. Toxicological potential of samples containing tested micropollutants in different environmental matrix was evaluated. Proposed analytical procedures allow the quantitative determination of five different compounds in aquatic environment with satisfactory repeatability and precision of measurements. Applied modifications of analytical procedures had an influence on the increase of recovery degree of compounds. Extraction of micropollutants from effluent exceeded 60% and depended on compounds concentration in the samples, excluding the determination for lower concentration of anthracene. The limits of quantitation LOQ (in ng/L) were as follows: 6.5 for anthracene and octylphenol, 8.5 for diclofenac, and 10 for pentachlorophenol and benzo(a)pyrene. It was found that Microtox((R)) assay allows the quick evaluation of toxicological potential of selected micropollutants. The toxicological potential (expressed as EC50, in mg/L) of deionized water samples containing micropollutants was equal to: 12.8; 2.2; 1.4; 6.6; 23.1 for anthracene, pentachlorophenol, octylphenol, benzo(a)pyrene, and diclofenac, respectively. However, the toxicity was also dependent on environmental matrix. The explanation of this phenomenon requires further research.

AB Ozonation is one of the common methods for pollutant removal and disinfection in water treatment. The reaction between the ozone and organic pollutants involves complex oxidation pathway which may lead to the formation of various ozonation by-products. In some cases, toxic ozonation by-products may be produced. In this study, the ozonation by-products of acebutolol, one of the common B-blockers, were identified. The mechanisms for the transformation of acebutolol during ozonation were elaborated.
   In this study, ozonation was carried out at pH 2 (with the presence of radical scavenger), 7 and 12, in order to study the role of the ozone (O-3) and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) in the transformation of acebutolol. Structure elucidation of the ozonation by-products was carried out using HPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry. Sixteen ozonation by-products were identified, of which fifteen have never been reported elsewhere. Based on the detected ozonation by-products, acebutolol can be degraded by both O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot. When the O-3 itself becomes a reactive species, the transformation of the acebutolol proceeded via the reaction between the O-3 and the aromatic ring of the acebutolol to form the aromatic ring hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening by-products. Without the radical scavenger, ozonation at pH 7 and 12 showed that the transformation of the acebutolol proceeded via the involvement of the (OH)-O-center dot and different aliphatic chain degraded and hydroxylated by-products were detected.

AB The antimicrobial agents triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) and synthetic musks AHTN (Tonalide) and HHCB (Galaxolide) are widely used in many personal care products. These compounds may release into the soil environment through biosolid application to agricultural land and potentially affect soil organisms. This paper aimed to investigate accumulation, dissipation and potential risks of TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB in biosolid-amended soils of the three field trial sites (Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong) with three treatments (CK: control without biosolid application, T1: single biosolid application, T2: repeated biosolid application every year). The one-year monitoring results showed that biosolids application could lead to accumulation of these four chemicals in the biosolid-amended soils, with the residual concentrations in the following order: TCC > TCS > AHTN > HHCB. Dissipation of TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB in the biosolid-amended soils followed the first-order kinetics model. Half-lives for TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB under the field conditions of Shandong site were 191, 258, 336 and 900 days for T1, and 51, 106, 159 and 83 days for T2, respectively. Repeated applications of biosolid led to accumulation of these personal care products and result in higher ecological risks. Based on the residual levels in the trial sites and limited toxicity data, high risks to soil organisms are expected for TCC and TCS, while low-medium risks for AHTN and HHCB. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products, biocides and iodinated contrast media (ICM) are persistent compounds, which appear in ng to mu g L-1 in secondary effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this work, biogenic metals manganese oxides (BioMnOx) and bio-palladium (Bio-Pd) were applied in lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBR) as oxidative and reductive technologies, respectively, to remove micropollutants from STP-effluent. From the 29 substances detected in the STP-effluent, 14 were eliminated in the BioMnOx-MBR: ibuprofen (>95%), naproxen (>95%), diuron (>94%), codeine (>93%), N-acetyl-sulfa-methoxazole (92%), chlorophene (>89%), diclofenac (86%), mecoprop (81%), triclosan (>78%), clarithromycin, (75%), iohexol (72%), iopromide (68%), iomeprol (63%) and sulfa-methoxazole (52%). The putative removal mechanisms were the chemical oxidation by BioMnOx and/or the biological removal by Pseudomonas putida and associated bacteria in the enriched biofilm. Yet, the removal rates (highest value: 2.6 mu g diclofenac L-1 d(-1)) need to improve by a factor 10 in order to be competitive with ozonation. ICM, persistent towards oxidative techniques, were successfully dehalogenated with a novel reductive technique using Bio-Pd as a nanosized catalyst in an MBR. Iomeprol, iopromide and iohexol were removed for >97% and the more recalcitrant diatrizoate for 90%. The conditions favorable for microbial H-2-production enabling the charging of the Pd catalyst, were shown to be important for the removal of ICM. Overall, the results indicate that Mn oxide and Pd coupled to microbial catalysis offer novel potential for advanced water treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The space-resolved solid-phase microextraction (SR-SPME) technique was employed to study the tissue-specific bioconcentration of pharmaceuticals in live fish. The segmented design of the SPME fibers allowed for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceutical residues in fish dorsal-epaxial muscle and adipose tissue with a single SPME fiber. The miniaturized fiber endowed the technique with high spatial resolution allowing for quantification of analytes within adjacent, relatively small tissues of immature rainbow trout The pre-equilibrium sampling and kinetic calibration approach yielded efficient and accurate quantitation of pharmaceuticals in fish tissue, The ability of the SPME method to repeatedly sample the same fish circumvents problems arising from interanimal variation, thus improving the precision of generated bioconcentration kinetic profiles. In vivo monitoring with SR-SPME was validated with in vitro liquid extraction of tissue samples using methanol. Of the nine compounds evaluated, five (atrazine, gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and fluoxetine) bioconcentrated in adipose and muscle tissue over the eight exposure days. Although the accumulation of analytes in both tissues was positively correlated, each compound partitioned with differing affinities as modified by their hydrophobicity and unique molecular structure. Water samples analyzed using the SPME technique yielded results similar to those determined by solid-phase extraction (SPE); however, SPME was more rapid and operationally much simpler. This study illustrates the application conditions for in situ SR-SPME while demonstrating the potential of these miniaturized SPME fibers for simultaneous in vivo repeated sampling of multiple tissues.

AB Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been detected widely in surface waters in North America and Europe. The impact of diclofenac on river biofilm communities was investigated at exposures of 10 and 100 mu g L-1 of diclofenac or its molar equivalent in carbon and nutrients. Experiments were carried out with river water during spring and summer using rotating annular reactors as model systems. Diclofenac or nutrients at 10 mu g L-1 were observed to have no significant effect on algal, bacterial, and cyanobacterial biomass in spring, whereas in the summer the nutrient equivalent reduced algal biomass and diclofenac reduced cyanobacterial biomass relative to control biofilms (p < 0.05). In contrast, at 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac or nutrients, the result was increased cyanobacterial and bacterial biomass, respectively, relative to control biofilms in spring. In summer, 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac significantly increased bacterial biomass and the nutrient treatment had no significant effect (p < 0.05): both treatments resulted in increased biofilm thickness. The glycoconjugate composition of the exopolysaccharide matrix was influenced differentially by the treatments in both seasons. Biolog assessments ofcarbon use indicated that 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac or nutrients resulted in significant depressions in the use of carbon sources in summer and significant increases in spring. Impacts on protozoan and micrometazoan populations also were assessed. Denaturing gradient gel elec.trophoresis analyses of community DNA and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies indicated that diclofenac had significant effects on the nature of the bacterial community in comparison with control and nutrient-treated river biofilm communities.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment as a result of human and veterinary use, posing relevant environmental concerns. The present paper reports the acute toxic effects of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the hypersalinc crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica. This study specially focused on oxidative stress parameters, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) total Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and (4) glutathione-S-traiisferases (GSTs). The effects of tested substances on lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), and soluble cholinesterases (ChE) were also investigated. Diazepam caused a significant inhibition of ChE (LOEC = 7.04 mg/l) and total GPx activities. SDS was responsible for a decrease in the activity of both ChE (LOEC = 8.46 mg/l) and GRed (LOEC = 4.08 mg/l). Both fibrates (clofibrate and clofibric acid) were responsible for significant decreases in Se-dependent GPx, with LOEC values of 176.34 and 3.09 mg/l, respectively. Clofibrate also caused a slight increase of TBARS content of A. parthenogenetica homogenates. These results indicate that the exposure to all the tested compounds induced alterations on the Cellular redox status in A. parthenogenetica. In addition, diazepam was shown to have the capability of interfering with A. parthenogenetica neurotransmission, through the inhibition of ChE. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land application systems, also referred to as beneficial reuse systems, are engineered systems that have defined and permitted application areas based on site and waste characteristics to determine the land area size requirement. These terrestrial systems have orders of magnitude greater microbial capability and residence time to achieve decomposition and assimilation compared with aquatic systems. In this paper we focus on current information and information needs related to terrestrial fate pathways in land treatment systems. Attention is given to conventional organic chemicals as well as new estrogenic and pharmaceutical chemicals of commerce. Specific terrestrial fate pathways addressed include: decomposition, bound residue formation, leaching, runoff, and crop uptake. Molecular decomposition and formation of bound residues provide the basis for the design and regulation of land treatment systems. These mechanisms allow for assimilation of wastes and nondegradation of the environment and accomplish the goal of sustainable land use. Bound residues that are biologically produced are relatively immobile, degrade at rates similar to natural soil materials, and should present a significantly reduced risk to the environment as opposed to parent contaminants. With regard to leaching and runoff pathways, no comprehensive summary or mathematical model of organic chemical migration from land treatment systems has been developed. For the crop uptake pathway, a critical need exists to develop information for nonagricultural chemicals and to address full-scale performance and monitoring at more land application sites. The limited technology choices for treatment of biosolids, liquids, and other wastes implies that acceptance of some risks and occurrence of some benefits will continue to characterize land application practices that contribute directly to the goal of beneficial reuse and sustainability.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used pharmaceuticals to treat pain, fever and inflammation. NSAIDs are also known to have many side effects including adverse effects on reproduction in both humans and animals. As NSAIDs usage is not regulated they are frequently detected at high concentrations in the environment. In order to understand the effect of NSAIDs on zebrafish sex differentiation, we used seven different NSAIDs which were either Cox-1 selective, Cox-1 biased, non-selective or COX-2 selective. We show that at higher concentration, NSAIDs are toxic to zebrafish embryo as they lead to mortality and hatching delay. Gene expression analysis following short term exposure of NSAIDs led to downregulation of female specific genes including zp2, vtg2 foxl2 and wnt4. Long term exposure of larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of Cox-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs resulted in male-biased sex ratio which confirmed the qRT-PCR analysis. However, the Cox-1 selective acetylsalicylic acid and the Cox-1 biased ketoprofen did not alter sex ratio. The observed male-biased sex ratio could also be due to induction of apoptosis process as the genes including p21 and casp8 were significantly upregulated following exposure to the Cox-2 selective and the nonselective NSAIDs. The present study indicates that NSAIDs alter sex differentiation in zebrafish, primarily through inhibition of Cox-2. This study clearly demonstrates that the use of NSAIDs and their release into the aquatic environment should be carefully monitored to avoid adverse effects to the aquatic organisms.

AB Methylparaben, which is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical, is added to various personal care products, including cosmetics, and is also used as a food preservative and in pharmaceuticals. However, information on the toxicity of methylparaben in soil ecosystems is limited. Furthermore, unlike other substances such as metals and pesticides, there is no regulation of levels or safe concentrations of methylparaben in soil ecosystems. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the toxicity of methylparaben on soil species and to derive hazardous concentration (HC) values with respect soil ecosystem protection. We conducted acute bioassays on eight species within six taxonomic groups and chronic bioassays on five species within four taxonomic groups. On the basis of the results obtained, we derived an acute HC5 value of 44 mg/kg soil and a corresponding chronic value of 27 mg/kg soil for methylparaben using species sensitivity distribution methodology following Australian and New Zealand guidelines. Given that there has been no proposed standard value for methylparaben in soil in any country, it was not possible to compare the HC values calculated in this study with regulation standard levels. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study is first to assess the toxicity of methylparaben against soil-inhabiting species and to estimate acute and chronic HCs for soil fauna and flora. The results of this study will provide valuable fundamental data for the establishment of acceptable levels of methylparaben in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the environmental risks of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has become very important in the field of aquatic toxicology. Hydroxylpropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) is an amphiphilic, toroidal shaped molecule with the ability to form noncovalent inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules. The molecule can reduce volatility as well as improve the aqueous solubility of apolar guest compounds and is an emerging PPCP. As such, HP beta CD is the active ingredient in Febreze (Procter & Gamble) and is extensively used as an excipient in the pharmaceutical industry. With the potential for entering the environment through waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, HP beta CD poses an unknown risk to nontarget aquatic biota. A 145-d chronic full life-cycle exposure using American flagfish (Jordanella floridae) was completed using flow-through nominal concentrations of 0 mg/L (control), 5 mg/L, 16 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 160 mg/L, 500mg/L, and 1600 mg/L of HP beta CD maintained via a peristaltic pump. Fecundity, growth, and liver somatic index were all monitored, and no significant difference was found between treatments and controls (p>0.05). However, a significant increase in the gonadosomatic index was observed in females exposed to HP beta CD (p <= 0.05). Reduced offspring growth was observed after exposure in the same manner as the parental generation (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, an acute copper toxicity challenge assay was conducted on second-generation flagfish larvae, and a decrease in copper tolerance was observed in larval progeny from parents exposed to HP beta CD.
