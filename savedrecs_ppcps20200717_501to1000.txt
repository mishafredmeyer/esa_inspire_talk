AB p-Anisidine being a component of wastewater generated through dye and pharmaceutical industries is highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Therefore, its presence in wastewater requires prior treatment before its disposal from the point of safety of human and aquatic life. Fenton's oxidation is a type of advanced oxidation processes which is efficient, ecofriendly and reliable, and this was not studied for the removal of p-anisidine from wastewater. In this study, the effect of influent pH, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferrous ion (Fe2+) concentration on the removal of p-anisidine by Fenton's reagent was carried out on a laboratory scale. All samples were examined for initial and final concentrations of p-anisidine using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and also initial and final COD was analyzed. p-Anisidine shows maximum absorbance at 296 nm. At pH 2.5 and [H2O2]/[Fe2+] of 70:1 for the initial p-anisidine concentration of 0.5 mM and for 24 h reaction time, the maximum removal of p-anisidine was found to be 88.95% and maximum COD removal was 76.43%.

AB This study used wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to investigate the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Male, the capital of the Republic of Maldives. Raw wastewater 12-h composite samples were collected from nine pumping stations serving the city area - thus representative of the whole Male population. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for estimating the profile of use of a large number of substances including illicit drugs, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco and pharmaceuticals. The illicit drugs most used were cannabis (THC) and heroin (700 and 18 g/day), with lower consumption of cocaine and amphetamines (0.1-1.2 g/day). It is important to note that the consumption of cannabis in Male was comparable to that measured in other countries, while the consumption of heroin was higher. Among cathinones, mephedrone was detected at the highest levels similar to other countries. Consumption of alcohol, which is not allowed in Maldives, was found (1.3 L/day/1000 inhabitants), but at a low level compared with other countries (6-44 L/day/1000 inhabitants), while the consumption of caffeine and tobacco was generally in line with reports from other countries. Unique information on pharmaceuticals use was also provided, since no official data were available. Human lifestyle was evaluated by applying for the first time the full set of WBE methodologies available in our laboratory. Results provided valuable epidemiological information, which may be useful for national and international agencies to understand - Corresponding population lifestyles better, including illicit drug issues, and for planning and evaluation of drug prevention pro- grams in Male.

AB Four lab-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were built to treat simulated wastewater containing typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The efficiency in removing different PPCPs at different concentrations (1, 2 and 5 mg/L) and their effects on the performance of MBBRs were investigated. Results showed that the average removal efficiencies of sulfadiazine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine were 61.1 +/- 8.8%, 74.9 +/- 8.8% and 28.3 +/- 7.4%, respectively. Compared to the reactor without PPCPs, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of the reactors containing sulfadiazine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine declined by 21%, 30% and 42%, respectively. Based on the microbial community analysis, increasing the PPCPs concentration within a certain range (< 2 mg/L) could stimulate microbial growth and increase microbial diversity yet the diversity reduced when the concentration (5 mg/L) exceeded the tolerance of microorganisms. Furthermore the presence and degradation of different PPCPs resulted in a different kind of microbial community structure in the MBBRs.

AB Peracetic acid (PM) is an oxidizer widely used for the sterilization of equipment in hospitals, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries and also for water and wastewater disinfection. Even with its increasing applications, there have been no previous theoretical studies that explain the experimental results based on its molecular behavior. In this context, this work used calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) combined with experimental results to elucidate the decomposition mechanisms of PAA for predicting its stability and the possible products generated from its decomposition. The results obtained showed that the protonation of PAA promoted its spontaneous decomposition in acetic acid and molecular oxygen. The hydrolysis mechanism of PM in acidic medium indicated that the low energy difference involved in the mechanism's stages is responsible for the equilibrium between PAA and H2O2. The structural and electronic comparison of PM with H2O2 showed that the O-O bond length of PM is longer than that of H2O2 and is also weaker, therefore may demonstrate greater efficiency in advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis.

AB Ultraviolet filters (UVFs) are emerging organic compounds found in most water systems. They are constituents of personal care products, as well as industrial ones. The concentration of UVFs in the water bodies in space and time is mostly determined by degradation and sorption, both processes being determinant of their bioavailability and toxicity to ecosystems and humans. UVFs are a wide group of compounds, with different sorption behavior expected depending on the individual chemical properties (pK(a), K-oc, K-ow). The goal of this work is framed in the context of improving our understanding of the sorption processes of UVFs occurring in the aquifer; that is, to evaluate the role of biomass growth, solid organic matter (SOM) and redox conditions in the characterization of sorption of a set of UVFs. We constructed a conceptual and a numerical model to evaluate the fate of selected UV filters, focused on both sorption and degradation. The models were validated with published data by Liu et al. (2013), consisting in a suite of batch experiments evaluating the fate of a cocktail of UVs under different redox conditions. The compounds evaluated included ionic UV filters (Benzophenone-3; 2-(3-t-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)5-chloro-benzotriazole; 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-octylphenyl)-benzotriazole) and neutral ones (octyl 4-methoxycinnamatte; and octocrylene).

AB The occurrence of 24 pharmaceuticals (including 15 antibiotics, three analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs, three anti-epileptic/antidepressant drugs, two beta blockers, and one lipid regulator) was investigated in 75 water samples collected from four bays in the Ugandan part of Lake Victoria. In addition, the potential environmental risk of the target pharmaceutical compounds to aquatic organisms in the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Victoria was assessed. Water samples were extracted using solid phase extraction and analyzed for pharmaceuticals using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Eighteen of the 24 pharmaceuticals occurred at quantifiable concentrations. Sulfamethoxazole (1-5600 ng L-1), trimethoprim (1-89 ng L-1), tetracycline (3 -70 ng L-1), sulfacetamide (1-13 ng L-1), and ibuprofen (6-780 ng L-1) occurred at quantifiable concentrations in all water samples. Sulfamethazine (2-50 ng L-1), erythromycin (10-66 ng L-1), diclofenac (2-160 ng L-1), and carbamazepine (5-72 ng L-1) were only quantifiable in water samples from Murchison Bay. The highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in Murchison Bay, the main recipient of sewage effluents, industrial and municipal waste from Kampala city via the Nakivubo channel. Ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and diclofenac pose a high toxic risk to aquatic organisms in the lake, while ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ibuprofen pose a medium risk. This study is the first of its kind to report the levels and ecotoxic risks of pharmaceutical compounds in Lake Victoria waters, of Uganda, and East Africa as a whole. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence of 26 antibiotics from three groups of Sulfonamides, Quinolones and Macrolides were investigated in the surface water of Pudong New Area, Shanghai in March (dry season) and June (wet season). As a result, the detection rates of the three groups were 20%, 81% and 56% (n = 10) with the concentration range of not detected-9.73 ng L-1, 30-344 ng L-1, and 14-107 ng L-1, respectively. Comparably, during wet season, the detection rates were 20%, 56% and 25% with the range of ND -14 ng L-1, 32-92 ng L-1, and ND-22 ng L-1, respectively. This indicates higher concentrations in dry season than that in wet season, which was attributed to the water dilution and weaker self-purification of the river during dry season. In addition, significant correlations were observed between SMA and most of Quinolones during dry season, and Quinolones and Macrolides during wet season, due to the similar sources. Considering for the typical wastewater sources in the investigated area, Quinolones were identified to be the most significant group in the aquiculture water. Furthermore, pharmaceutical manufacturing factory (PMF) and sewage treatment plant (STP) should be the serious point source pollution as the concentration in their effluents could range from ng L-1 to mg L-1. The occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the aquatic system of Pudong New Area need to be paid more attention to prevent the potential risk for human beings in the future study.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging as environmentally problematic compounds. As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to mu g L-1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 mu g L(-1 )for citalopram, 320 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 473 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471 mu g L-1 for citalopram, 411 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 713 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. The results of this study conclude that tramadol and citalopram produce hypoactivity in 144 hpf zebrafish larvae. Further, a 1:1 binary mixture of the two caused the same response, albeit at a higher concentration, possibly due to SS. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Doxorubicin (DOX) originated from users' urine has been an emerging environmental pollutant due to its significant genotoxicity to mankind. Thus, urine source separation is a potential strategy to isolate DOX at a higher concentration and reduce the burden of downstream wastewater treatment. To develop highly efficient, easy separation and retrievable materials for individual patient to conveniently remove DOX from own urine, magnetic Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers were prepared through anchoring amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles on the Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers. Characterizations revealed the magnetic nanoflowers were spherical in shape with a mean size of 15 mu m, and porous and hierarchical in structure. Magnetic nanoparticles located the surface of petals. Multibatch experiments were performed to assess the removal performance of DOX from aqueous solution. The magnetic nanoflowers exhibited excellent removal efficiency of DOX under weakly alkaline condition at ambient temperature. Linear and non-linear analyses were carried out to compare the best fitting kinetics and isotherms. Sorption kinetic data best fitted the pseudo-second order model. The Freundlich isotherm explained equilibrium sorption data with R-2 = 0.993 higher than that for the Langmuir isotherm. When the pH of synthetic urine was adjusted to weakly alkaline (pH 8.0-9.0), over 95% of DOX (20 mg L-1) was removed by a little of magnetic nanoflowers (50 mg L-1) within 5 min. Meanwhile, the magnetic nanoflowers could be easily separated and recovered from the synthetic urine by a magnet. So, for individual urine source separation strategy, the magnetic nanoflower seems to be an efficient, convenient and inexpensive approach to remove DOX from human urine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (including pharmaceuticals) are not effectively removed by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), so particular concern is related to agricultural wastewater reuse due to their possible uptake in crops irrigated with WWTPs effluents. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and solar AOPs have been demonstrated to effectively remove pharmaceuticals from different aqueous matrices. In this study, an heterogeneous photocatalytic process using powdered nitrogen-doped TiO2 immobilized on polystyrene spheres (sunlight/N-TiO2) was compared to the benchmark homogenous AOP sunlight/H2O2 in a compound triangular collector reactor, to evaluate the degradation of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), trimethoprim (TMP)) in water. The degradation of the contaminants by sunlight and sunlight-AOPs well fit the pseudo-first order kinetic model (but for TMP under sunlight). High removal efficiency by solar photolysis was observed for DCF (up to 100%, half-life sunlight cumulative energy Q(s)(,1/2) = 2 kJ L-1, half-life time t(1/2) = 32 min), while CBZ (32%, Q(s)(,1/2) = 28 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 385 min) and TMP (5% removal after 300 min) removal was poor. The degradation rate of CBZ, TMP and DCF was found to be slower during sunlight/H2O2 (Q(s)(,1/2) = 5 kJ L-1, t(1/2)= 77 min; Q(s)(,1/2) = 20 kJ L-1, t(1/2) =128 min; Q(S,1/2) =4 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 27 min, respectively) compared to sunlight/N-TiO2 (Q(s1/2) =4 kJ L-1, t(1/2 )= 55 min; Q(S,1/2) = 3 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 42 min; Q(s)(,1/2) = 2 kJ L-1, t(1/2 )= 25 min, respectively). These results are promising in terms of solar technology upscale because the faster degradation kinetics observed for sunlight/N-TiO2 process would result in smaller treatment volume, thus possibly perspective compensating the cost of the photocatalyst.

AB Although, several recent greenhouse studies are beginning to address the uptake of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by a variety of crops, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on uptake. Hence, in this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in order to study the interactions occurring exclusively between PPCPs in soil, and in the edible plant part of beets (Beta vulgaris) after exposure to treated wastewater effluent. According to the findings, the interactions between the pharmaceuticals caffeine (CFN) with bisoprolol (BSP), carbamezapine (CMZ), clarithromycin (CMC), metoprolol (MPL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TMP) occurring in soil were almost 99% synergistic; it was noted variability in the interactive capacity of the pharmaceuticals; the concentrations of pharmaceuticals which measured did not affect unfavorably beet yield; interactions between the PPCPs via the PPCPs contribution in plant and soil affect the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the beets.

Microbes are adequately been used to biodegrade pharmaceutical industry wastewater and present study was envisaged to determine biodegradation of pharmaceutical effluent by Micrococcus yunnanensis. The strain showed 42.82% COD (Chemical oxygen demand) reduction before optimization. After applying Taguchi's L8 array as an optimization technique, the biodegradation rate was enhanced by 82.95% at optimum conditions (dextrose- 0.15%, peptone 0.1%, inoculum size 4% (wv(-1)), rpm 200, pH 8 at 25 degrees C) within 6 h. The confirmation of pharmaceuticals degradation was done by H-1 NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) studies followed by elucidation of transformation pathways of probable drugs in the effluent through Q-Tof-MS (Quadrupole Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry). The cytotoxicity evaluation of treated and untreated wastewater was analyzed on Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cells using Alamar Blue assay, which showed significant variance.

AB Among pharmaceuticals, the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment is a subject of special concern due to their environmental impact, namely the development of bacterial resistance. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics and it is regularly found, not only in effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs), but also in the aquatic environment. Photodegradation appears as an alternative process for the removal of this type of pollutants from contaminated waters. In order to be used for a remediation purpose, its evaluation under continuous flow mode is essential, as well as the determination of the final effluent antibacterial activity, which were assessed in this work.
   As compared with batch operation, the irradiation time needed for SMX elimination under continuous flow mode sharply decreased, which is very advantageous for the target application. Moreover, the interrelation between SMX removal, mineralization and antibacterial activity was evaluated before and during photodegradation in ultrapure water. Although mineralization was slower than SMX removal, bacterial activity increased after SMX photodegradation. Such increase was also verified in environmental water matrices. Thus, this study has proven that photodegradation is an efficient and sustainable process for both (i) the remediation of waters contaminated with antibiotics, and (ii) the minimization of the bacterial resistance.

Step-scheme (S-scheme) SnFe2O4/ZnFe(2)O(4 )nano-heterojunctions with nontoxicity, strong magnetism, and high visible-light photocatalytic performance were synthesized by one-step solvothermal strategy, and SnFe2O4 content was optimized. 5% SnFe2O4/ZnFe(2)O(4 )heterojunctions exhibited optimal visible-light photocatalytic performance in degrading tetracycline with 93.2% removal efficiency, and the COD of actual pharmaceutical wastewater decreased by 77.5% due to the efficient production of active species. Moreover, 5% SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 heterojunctions is very convenient to be recycled from solution using external magnetic field, and the photocatalytic activity remains almost unchanged in repeated use due to its strong magnetism and high stability. More significantly, the toxicity evaluation confirmed nontoxicity of SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 and rapid toxicity elimination process of tetracycline by photocatalysis, indicating that environment-friendly and magnetically recoverable S-scheme SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical manufacturing industries produce a vast range of substances by using organic and inorganic compounds as raw material thereby gives rise to huge volume of toxic and complex organic liquid effluents comprised of high levels of dissolved solids. High and low strength wastewater streams originating from manufacturing unit often contains different types of contaminants, including organic compounds which can be difficult to treat with conventional methods of treatment. In this study, the sequential treatment process of coagulation, electron beam (E-beam) irradiation and biological treatment was employed on real pharmaceutical industrial wastewater to study the impact of combined treatment on remediation and detoxification of the wastewater. Combined treatment was performed on low (L-OSW) and high (H-OSW) organic strength wastewater collected from representative pharmaceutical industry. Operational parameters like pH, absorbed dose and use of oxidants were systematically investigated to achieve the enhanced treatment of wastewater streams using E-beam irradiation. Biological treatment was carried out using activated sludge process at laboratory-scale reactor by utilizing acclimatized consortia in the experiments. Sequential hybrid coagulation, E-beam irradiation and biological treatment lead to synergistic degradation and detoxification of both the recalcitrant wastewater streams with overall chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 94% and 89% for LOSW and HOSW, respectively. Cytotoxicity assessment revealed that the combined treatment of wastewater was effective in eliminating the toxicity when tested against the selected microorganisms. The treatment cost of E-beam radiolysis alone, biological treatment alone and E-beam thorn biological treatment for LOSW was found to be 0.50, 2.35 and 2.85 USD m(-3); whereas, for HOSW, it was found to be 0.67, 0.7 and 1.37 USD m(-3), respectively. The overall cost of the set-up of an E-beam unit and the treatment cost for real pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated to establish the applicability of the E-beam technology at industrial scale. The feasibility of E-beam irradiation for wastewater remediation may ensure future smart cities with sustainable resource management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminant such as pesticides, veterinary products, industrial compounds, food additives, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals may cause a negative effect when comes into contact with the environment. The presence of these compounds can be generated toxic effects in the aquatic system and cause an irreparable ecological alteration. Antibiotic compounds are one of the main pollutants found in the aquatic systems, because they are often inadequately prescribed and as a part of antibiotics is not completely consumed or degraded in human and animal bodies. Their residues can be entered in aquatic systems by wastewater treatment plants. The presences of antibiotics in aquatic systems have been linked to increasing microorganism antibiotic resistance through different mutations. Advanced oxidation processes have been proposed for the treatment of antibiotic in aqueous systems, including solar photocatalysis. Several parameters are necessary to take into account in solar photocatalysis treatment to eliminate antibiotics, since these compounds display different physicochemical and biological properties. This chapter discusses the effect of parameters and pathways (transformation products) of solar photocatalysis of antibiotic groups usually found in aquatic systems as macrolides, sulfones, lincosamides, and quinolone.

AB Every day a large amount of products has been released by chemical and pharmaceutical industries threatening the environment and human health. Moreover, their removal using conventional oxidation methods is difficult because a lot of pollutants are biorecalcitrant. Photocatalysis, an advanced oxidation technology, appears one of the most viable solutions due to its ability to oxidize a wide range of toxic organic compounds into harmless compounds such as CO2 and H2O by irradiation with UV light. Organic pollutants can be removed from water by a UV-driven photocatalytic process involving nanoparticles with semiconducting properties. However, their use in a photoreaction system suffers of the disadvantage due to the no-uniform photon distribution inside the reactor core. The chapter describes a possible solution for enhancing the photon distribution inside the photoreactors, using inorganic and organic light-emitting particles (phosphors) coupled with photocatalysts to be applied in water and wastewater treatment. The chapter also underlines the difference between inorganic particles having down-conversion, up-conversion, and long-afterglow luminescence properties. Additionally, the use of up-conversion organic phosphors has been proposed. Finally, some examples concerning the use of semiconductors coupled with different photoluminescent materials in the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater are presented.

AB Antimicrobial compounds are widely used in human and veterinary medicine to protect human and animal health, to prevent economic losses, and to help to ensure a safe food supply. After administration, the antibiotics and their transformant products (TPs) may pass through the sewage system and end up in the environment, mainly in the water bodies. Apart from antibiotics and their TPs, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which have been identified as emerging pollutants of concern, enter ecosystems with treated wastewater and livestock manure. In the environment altered by human activity, the occurrence of bacteria resistant to almost all known antibiotics has been confirmed. Despite being universally considered relatively important, land runoff, drainage and seepage are not the sites with the most striking occurrence of the transfer of resistance genes among different species of bacteria. The most significant hot-spots are wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Together with treated wastewater which is released from WWTPs, antibiotics, their TPs, ARB, and ARGs can penetrate the surface water, rural groundwater supplies, drinking water, soil, and plants growing in soil irrigated with contaminated water. It creates a direct risk to human and animal health because drugs, ARGs, and ARB transported to the environment can be transferred back to people and animals. The authors of this article aim to familiarize readers with the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance in Poland: its occurrence, ranges of antibiotic concentration, and the number of ARB and ARGs occurring in Polish surface waters as well as main sources of these contaminants.

AB Due to their pervasive applications, phthalic acid esters or phthalates have ample presence in all environmental compartments. A principal source of their existence in freshwater is phthalate-laden wastewater treatment plant effluents. For its sustainable operation and biogas production, wastewater treatment scheme of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and polishing pond is more prevalent in developing countries. This yearlong study focused on evaluating the occurrence, fate and risk of four priority phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in a UASB+ polishing pond-based wastewater treatment plant. Concentration of the phthalates in raw wastewater ranged from nd to 17.36 mu g/L (DEP), 0.92 to 18.26 mu g/L (DBP), nd to 6.54 mu g/L (BBP), and nd to 53.21 mu g/L (DEHP). DEHP concentrations in UASB sludge were below 100 mg/kg, the recommended limit by the European Union for safe disposal of dewatered sludge. All four compounds were removed approximately 80% in the wastewater treatment plant, with larger removal in polishing pond than UASB. Sorption contributes a significant portion of BBP and DEHP removal (15-24%) in UASB than DEP and DBP (0-3%). Seasonally, larger removals of phthalates were observed during the summer season. Risk assessment showed that the treated effluents had low risk of DEP, DBP, and BBP. However, the hazard quotient (HQ) of DEHP was greater than 1. To comply with regulations, dilution requirement of effluents was investigated which showed that a dilution factor of 4.4 in summer and 2.1 in winter is required for effluents of UASB + Pond-based treatment plant.

AB Wastewater treatment plant effluents are important point sources of micropollutants. To assess how the discharge of treated wastewater affects the ecotoxicity of small to medium-sized streams we collected water samples up- and downstream of 24 wastewater treatment plants across the Swiss Plateau and the Jura regions of Switzerland. We investigated estrogenicity, inhibition of algal photosynthetic activity (photosystem II, PSII) and growth, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. At four sites, we measured feeding activity of amphipods (Gammarus fossarum) in situ as well as water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) reproduction in water samples. Ecotoxicological endpoints were compared with results from analyses of general water quality parameters as well as a target screening of a wide range of organic micropollutants with a focus on pesticides and pharmaceuticals using liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Measured ecotoxicological effects in stream water varied substantially among sites: 17 beta-estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQ(bio), indicating the degree of estrogenicity) were relatively low and ranged from 0.04 to 0.85 ng/L, never exceeding a proposed effect-based trigger (EBT) value of 0.88 ng/L. Diuron equivalent (DEQ(bio)) concentrations (indicating the degree of photosystem II inhibition in algae) ranged from 2.4 to 1576 ng/L and exceeded the EBT value (70 ng/L) in one third of the rivers studied, sometimes even upstream of the WWTP. Parathion equivalent (PtEQ(bio)) concentrations (indicating the degree of AChE inhibition) reached relatively high values (37 to 1278 ng/L) mostly exceeding the corresponding EBT (196 ng/L PtEQ(bio)). Decreased feeding activity by amphipods or decreased water flea reproduction downstream compared to the upstream site was observed at one of four investigated sites only. Results of the combined algae assay (PSII inhibition) correlated best with results of chemical analysis for PSII inhibiting herbicides. Estrogenicity was partly and AChE inhibition strongly underestimated based on measured steroidal estrogens respectively organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. An impact of dissolved organic carbon on results of the AChE inhibition assay was obvious. For this assay more work is required to further explore the missing correlation of bioassay data with chemical analytical data. Overall, the discharge of WWTP effluent led to increased estrogenicity, PSII and AChE inhibition downstream, irrespective of upstream land use.

AB Herein, we developed the waste-derived adsorbent, mesoporous Schumannianthus dichotomus (MSD) and used for the exploitation of Ibuprofen (IBP) in an economic and reliable way. The developed adsorbent was characterized by various physicochemical and spectroscopic analyses. Relatively higher surface area of 1058 m(2)/g, pore volume of 0.9909 cm(3)/g and average article size of 39.09 mu m justified the utilization of the developed material for the removal of IBP from aqueous phase. The effect of ionic strength (SO42-, Cl-, and NO3-), divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and surfactant on the removal of IBP onto MSD was investigated. Adsorption equilibrium is attained in 60 min with adsorbent load of 1.8 g/L. The removal efficiency of MSD is around 98% with sequestering capacity of 243.90 mg/g. Thermodynamic investigation revealed the adsorption process to be exothermic, (Delta H = -8.729 kJ/mol) and spontaneous in nature (Delta G = -7.06 kJ/mol) with a decrease in the randomness (Delta S = -5.57 JK/mol) at the solid/liquid interface. The energy recovered from the adsorbent-loaded IBP in terms of higher heating value (17.15 mJ/kg) further enhanced its utilization. The low cost of MSD (USD 14.39 per kg) also justified its utilization for wastewater treatment in an economic perspective. Density Function Theory studies showed that a weak interaction occurs between IBP and the developed activated carbon, MSD. The exothermic character of IBP adsorption onto MSD was confirmed by experimental investigation.

AB The emerging pollutants cover a wide range of synthetic chemicals that are indispensable to modern society but with little known effects for aquatic animals and for people who consume polluted waters with these products. Gels manipulated with hormones are widely used for hormone replacement, muscle growth, among other purposes. However, only a small part of these hormones are absorbed into the skin, and so these can be transferred to the domestic sewage during the washing of exposed body regions. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity levels for the bioindicator Artemia salina L., and cytotoxicity and mutagenicity for the bioindicator Allium cepa L. of gels handled with 1% testosterone and 0.1% estradiol. Data from immobile/dead A. salina numbers after 24 h of exposure showed that the highest concentrations of testosterone (10 and 25 mu g/mL) and the highest concentration of estradiol (15 mu g/mL) were toxic to this bioindicator. For the bioindicator A. cepa, mitotic indices and chromosomal aberrations did not indicate statistical differences between the groups treated with the testosterone gels (1, 10, 50 mu g/mL) and estradiol (0.03, 0.30, 1.5 mu g/mL) and the control group. However, all concentrations of the testosterone-containing gel decreased the percentage of cell division in relation to the time 0 h of each treatment and to the time 24 h of the negative control. Therefore, it is concluded that rivers or aquatic environments can be polluted if wastewater with the toxic concentrations found of these hormonal gels is discarded without previous treatment, compromising the life of organisms that live there. And, it encourages the development of techniques for treating sewage and water to reduce/eliminate the hormones present in them.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is an antimicrobial compound widely used in personal care products such as soaps, toothpaste, and shampoo. This agent is incompletely removed by wastewater treatment and represents an environmental contaminant. Recent studies have shown that TCC is associated with some endocrine disruptions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if TCC exposure during critical periods of development (gestation and lactation) could lead to adverse effects on reproductive and behavior parameters of female offspring. Pregnant female Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8-11/group): Control; TCC 0.3 mg/kg (TCC 0.3); TCC 1.5 mg/kg; TCC 3.0 mg/kg (TCC 3.0); and treated daily by oral gavage from gestational day 0 to lactational day 21. The female pups (F1 generation) were weaned on post-natal day 21 and included in the study. No litter-mates were used for the same group. There was a decrease in estradiol levels in the TCC 0.3 and TCC 3.0 groups. Moreover, there was a decrease in progesterone levels and an increase in pre-implantation loss in the TCC 3.0 group in adulthood. It is suggested, in this study, that the decrease in progesterone biosynthesis could interfere with implantation process. The exposure window to TCC is an important factor, as we found alterations only in the offspring.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in reclaimed water can enter into soil, groundwater, and air during the irrigation of urban green spaces, leading to potential risks due to their negative effects of feminization, on root elongation, and as carcinogens. In this study, a validated HYDRUS-1D model by field experiments and an exposure model were used to simulate the distributions of 67 PPCPs detected in the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants of Beijing under two scenarios (1, uniform irrigation concentrations; 2, detected irrigation concentrations) in soil, groundwater, and air. To determine the priority ranks of the 67 PPCPs, the effect values of the PPCPs in soil, groundwater, and air were calculated on the basis of distributions and toxicity data, and then weighted and scored. Under scenario 1, roxithromycin, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, characterized by high adsorption and low volatilization and degradation, had the highest accumulations in soil, and ofloxacin, characterized by the lowest degradation and adsorption, had the highest leaching to groundwater. The highest volatilization was observed for galaxolide abbalide, tonalid, and dioctyl phthalate. Under scenario 2, based on their overall scores and priority ranks, the 67 PPCPs were divided into three groups: I, high priority; II, moderate priority; III, low priority. Of the 67 PPCPs, 17 were classified in group I, with the highest priority rankings for ofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and sulfamethoxazole. In group III (total 33 PPCPs), 28 of the PPCPs were not of urgent concern under reclaimed water irrigation in Beijing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of micropollutants (MPs), including pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, by ozone-based advanced oxidation techniques (AOP) was investigated in this study. The effect of different factors, such as ozone concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and initial pH, on the removal rate was studied in detail. The combination of UV with ozone/ H2O2 increased the MPs degradation. For example, atrazine removal increased from 12.6% to 66.9%. Increasing the concentration of ozone and H2O2 can enhance the degradation efficiency of MPs, while excess H2O2 plays a role as a scavenger for (OH)-O-?. In addition, the optimizing conditions of degradation of MPs by an ozone-based AOP were investigated in this study. The optimal dosages of ozone for atrazine (ATZ), alachlor (ALA), carbamazepine (CBZ), 17-?-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), were in the range of 0.6?0.75, while for ATZ a much higher dosage (5.4?mg/l) is needed. The optimal dosages of H2O2 concentration were at 0.75, 0.2, 0.47, 0.75 and 0.63?mM, and pH were at 10, 10, 7, 10 and 10, and reaction time at 38.5, 33.5 43, 6 and 6 min, respectively. Ozone-based AOP and in particular combination of UV with ozone and H2O2 is efficient to degrade atrazine, alachlor, carbamazepine, 17-?-ethinylestradiol and pentachlorophenol, and is attractive for future application of real wastewater treatment.

AB A wide variety of pharmaceuticals are discharged in water courses on a daily basis due to their incomplete removal from effluent in treatment plants. The aim of the current study was to assess the occurrence, fate and removal of pharmaceuticals from effluent and sludge samples collected in the biggest sanitary sewer plant in Southern Brazil. In total, 13 pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent through UHPLC-MS/M - paracetamol and caffeine recorded the highest concentrations, 137.98 and 35.29 mu g L-1, respectively. The treated effluent presented 11 compounds. Antibiotics were the class recording the widest diversity; metronidazole showed the lowest concentration (0.023 mu g L-1) and sulfamethoxazole presented the highest concentration (1.374 mu g L-1) in influent samples. Seven pharmaceuticals were absorbed by the sludge; among them, one finds caffeine, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which were quantified both in the effluent and in the sludge. On the other hand, doxycycline, fenbendazole, norfloxacin and tetracycline were only detected in sludge samples - their concentrations ranged from 0.026 to 5.034 mg kg(-1). Clindamycin, oxytetracycline, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim concentrations increased throughout the treatment. There were high paracetamol and caffeine removal rates (>97%), and it may have happened due to degradation, photodegradation or chemical reaction. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin removal rate exceeded 83% mainly due to their sorption by sludge. Finally, the mass balance analysis highlighted high pharmaceutical loads (511.466 g d(-1)) discharged into recipient waterbodies. This outcome demands broadening the removal of these pharmaceuticals from sewage.

AB BACKGROUND Azoles are an important class of compounds that are widely used as corrosion inhibitors in aircraft de-icing agents, cooling towers, semiconductor manufacturing and household dishwashing detergents. They also are important moieties in pharmaceutical drugs and fungicides. Azoles are widespread emerging contaminants occurring frequently in water bodies. Azole compounds can potentially cause inhibition towards key biological processes in natural ecosystems and wastewater treatment processes. Of particular concern is the inhibition of azoles to the nitrification process (aerobic oxidation of ammonium). This study investigated the acute toxicity of azole compounds towards the anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) process, which is an important environmental biotechnology gaining traction for nutrient-nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. In this study, using batch bioassay techniques, the anammox toxicity of eight commonly occurring azole compounds was evaluated. RESULTS The results show that 1H-benzotriazole and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole had the highest inhibitory effect on the anammox process, causing 50% decrease in anammox activity (IC50) at concentrations of 19.6 and 17.8 mg L-1, respectively. 1H-imidazole caused less severe toxicity with an IC50 of 79.4 mg L-1. The other azole compounds were either nontoxic (1H-pyrazole, 1H-1,2,4-triazole and 1-methyl-pyrazole) or at best mildly toxic (1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid and 3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole) towards the anammox bacteria at the concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that most azole compounds tested displayed mild to low or no toxicity towards the anammox bacteria. The anammox bacteria were found to be far less sensitive to azoles compared to nitrifying bacteria. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWIN) and application of biosolids introduce numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into agro-food systems. While the use of TWW and biosolids has many societal benefits, introduction of PPCPs in production agriculture poses potential food safety and human health risks. A comprehensive risk assessment and management scheme of PPCPs in agro-food systems is limited by multiple factors, not least the sheer number of investigated compounds and their diverse structures. Here we follow the fate of PPCPs in the water-soil-produce continuum by considering processes and variables that influence PPCP transfer and accumulation. By analyzing the steps in the soil-plant-human diet nexus, we propose a tiered framework as a path forward to prioritize PPCPs that could have a high potential for plant accumulation and thus pose greatest risk. This article examines research progress to date and current research challenges, highlighting the potential value of leveraging existing knowledge from decades of research on other chemicals such as pesticides. A process-driven scheme is outlined to derive a short list that may be used to refocus our future research efforts on PPCPs and other analogous emerging contaminants in agro-food systems.

AB This work aims to analyse the performances of a new hybrid process: membrane filtration to concentrate biorefractory wastewater before treatment by a hydrothermal process such as wet air oxidation. The aim is to obtain a complete discharge of the effluent in the environment. The three different synthetic wastewaters under study were pharmaceutical wastewater, grey wastewater and bilge wastewater. The results of the membrane filtration showed high retention rates as it could reach between 75% and 100% of total organic carbon retention, more than 99% of turbidity removal and more than 70% of hydrocarbon retention. Moreover, it was possible to achieve high concentration factors comprised between 17 and 40 times. Membrane fouling was chemically reversible regardless of the type of pollution. Then, the treatment of the membrane retentates by wet air oxidation process (300 degrees C, 15 MPa) could eliminate more than 83% of organic pollution for all the tested effluents. In summary, the hybrid intensified process could finally decrease the volume and the waste load of wastewater before possibly discharging it into the environment.

AB Patent data present a number of advantages compared to other alternative measures of innovation. This paper presents research on the use of environmentally relevant technology patent data using a comprehensive analysis method to analyze the development of green technology innovation in China in 1990-2015. From the analysis, it can be concluded that during the period of 2000-2015, China's environmental-related technology innovation made great progress and was at the forefront of green technology growth; in particular, the areas of water and wastewater treatment, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, lighting, improvements related to bulk or fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles, and other technologies made great achievements. These technologies are closely related to environmental policies, such as climate change mitigation and green industry transformation, for which China has been advocating for more than a decade. However, after analyzing China's green development, it was found that, although some of the indicators, environmental-related patents, and green developments have made great progress, complete reliance on green technology is far off in the future.

AB Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the (bio)transformation of the antidiabetic sitagliptin (STG) and the antihistamine fexofenadine (FXF) during wastewater treatment. As inoculum either attached-growth on carriers or suspended sludge from a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor (HMBBR) was used. Both target compounds were incubated in degradation experiments and quantified via LC-MS/MS for degradation kinetics. Furthermore transformation products (TPs) were analyzed via high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Structural elucidation of the TPs was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass to propose a molecular formula and on MS2 fragmentation to elucidate the chemical structure of the TPs. In total, 22 TPs (9 TPs for STG and 13 TPs for FXF) were detected in the experiments with STG and FXF. For all TPs, chemical structures could be proposed. STG was mainly transformed via amide hydrolysis and conjugation of the primary amine moiety. In contrast, FXF was predominantly transformed by oxidative reactions such as oxidation (dehydrogenation) and hydroxylation. Furthermore, FXF was removed significantly faster in contact with carriers compared to suspended sludge, whereas STG was degraded slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge. Moreover, the primary TP of FXF was also degraded faster in contact with carriers leading to higher proportions of secondary TPs. Thus, the microbial community of both carriers and suspended sludge catalyzed the same primary transformation reactions but the transformation kinetics of FXF and the formation/degradation of FXF TPs were considerably higher in contact with carrier-attached biomass. The primary degradation of both target compounds in pilot- and full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) and MBBR reactors reached 42 and 61% for FXF and STG, respectively. Up to three of the identified TPs of FXF and 8 TPs of STG were detected in the effluents of pilot- and full-scale CAS and MBBR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recent emergence of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) in the aquatic environment emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways during rodent control. Pest control in municipal sewer systems of urban and suburban areas is thought to be an important emission pathway for AR to reach wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), respectively. To circumstantiate that AR will enter streams via effluent discharges and bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms despite very low predicted environmental emissions, we conducted a retrospective biological monitoring of fish tissue samples from different WWTP fish monitoring ponds exclusively fed by municipal effluents in Bavaria, Germany. At the same time, information about rodent control in associated sewer systems was collected by telephone survey to assess relationships between sewer baiting and rodenticide residues in fish. In addition, mussel and fish tissue samples from several Bavarian surface waters with different effluent impact were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of anticoagulants in indigenous aquatic organisms.
   Hepatic AR residues were detected at 12 out of 25 WWTP sampling sites in the low mu g/kg range, thereof six sites with one or more second-generation AR (i.e., brodifacoum, difenacoum, bromadiolone). 14 of 18 surveyed sites confirmed sewer baiting with AR and detected hepatic residues matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sites. Furthermore, second-generation AR were detected in more than 80% of fish liver samples from investigated Bavarian streams. Highest total hepatic AR concentrations in these fish were 9.1 and 8.5 mu g/kg wet weight, respectively and were observed at two riverine sampling sites characterized by close proximity to upstream WWTP outfalls. No anticoagulant residues were found in fish liver samples from two lakes without known influences of effluent discharges.
   The findings of our study clearly show incomplete removal of anticoagulants during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm exposure of aquatic organisms via municipal effluents. Based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic AR residues in effluent-exposed fish, sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into the aquatic environment.

AB Advancements on analytical strategies to determine the chemicals present in treated wastewater are necessary to clearly link their occurrence with the ecotoxicity of such effluents. This study describes the development of an integrated screening approach to determine the highest number of pharmaceutical transformation products (TPs) in a single run. The identification of TPs was based on the comparison of detected features with literature sources, compound prediction tools, in-house libraries and reference standards using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This integrated approach allowed a better estimation (in silica) of the ecotoxicological contribution of the individual TPs identified. As a proof of concept, this methodology was applied for identification of the TPs generated from metoprolol and its main human metabolite (metoprolol acid) in pure water, hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater treated by UV/H2O2. Twenty-four TPs with potential ecotoxicological implications were identified and their presence was pinpointed as a function of the treated wastewater. An integrated screening approach has been developed using four different screening methodologies in the same run. Additionally, the metabolite MTPA has been considered as a target pollutant in UV/H2O2 experiments.

AB Ultraviolet radiation (UV)-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) advanced oxidation processes were examined for their capacity to remove nine pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from secondary effluent. The effect of operational parameters (initial oxidant concentration, UV exposure time, pH, common coexisting anions and effluent organic matter (EfOM)) on UV/PDS and UV/PMS treatment efficiency was investigated in a collimated beam device housing a low-pressure mercury UV lamp emitting light at 253.7 nm.
   Both AOPs achieved high removals ( > 90%) when applied to pure water. Under otherwise similar conditions the removal percentage fell by 20-30% due to the scavenging of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in secondary effluent. Finally, eliminating EfOM but maintaining the inorganic composition, the radical scavenging effect was reduced and 98.3% and 85.6% average removals were obtained by UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively.
   Increasing pH improved degradation of several PhACs containing amine groups. Higher oxidant dosages created only a significant benefit in UV/PDS. The chloride anion produced a negligible effect on both processes, while higher nitrate concentrations increased removal percentage but did not affect degradation rate constants. Finally and surprisingly, the addition of bicarbonate had the strongest positive impact on the degradation kinetics observed, even stronger than the elimination of EfOM from secondary effluent.

AB A lab-scale mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was used to treat synthetic municipal wastewater with variable concentrations of antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and bulk organics in this study. The removal and biotransformation pathway of SMX in the AnMBR were systematically investigated during a 170 d of operation under hydraulic retention time of 1 d. Average SMX removal was 97.1% under feed SMX of 10-1000 mu g/L, decreasing to 91.6 and 88.0% under feed SMX of 10,000 and 100,000 mu g/L due to the inhibition effects of high SMX loading rate on anaerobic microorganisms. SMX biotransformation followed pseudo-first order reaction kinetics based on SMX removal independent of feed SMX of 10-1000 mu g/L during continuous operation and also in a batch test under initial SMX of 100,000 mu g/L. According to the identified 7 transformation products (TPs) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the biotransformation pathway of SMX from municipal wastewater treatment via AnMBR was first proposed to consist of 2 primary routes: 1) Butylbenzenesulfonamide without antibiotic toxicity dominated under feed SMX of 10-100 mu g/L; 2) Sulfanilamide with much lower antibiotic toxicity than SMX dominated under feed SMX of 1000-100000 mu g/L, further transforming to secondary TPs (4-Aminothiophenol, Aniline, Acetylsulfanilamide) and tertiary TPs (4-Acetylaminothiophenol, Acetylaniline).

AB Integrated hybrid systems coupling microfiltration (MF) with UVA photolysis (UVA-MF) or TiO2-P25 photocatalysis (UVA/TiO2-MF) were investigated for the removal of oxytetracycline (OTC) from synthetic (ultrapure water-UPW) and real (secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant-UWW) matrices, both spiked with 5 mg L-1 of OTC. The photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) was tested both using the TiO2-P25 nanoparticles in suspension or immobilized on the external surface of the membrane - nano-engineered membrane (NEM). In all cases, reaction occurs only inside the membrane module. The effect of transmembrane pressure (TMP) (1.0-2.0 bar) and of TiO2-P25 loading (0.1-0.4 g L-1) in slurry conditions, on the efficiency of the photocatalytic UVA/TiO2-MF system was investigated. Additionally, OTC oxidation efficiency was evaluated as a function of the amount of TiO2-P25 deposited on the external surface of the ceramic MF membrane. The membrane ensured the retention of TiO2-P25 particles, when using the PMR catalyst slurry system. The higher OTC removal efficiency (> 90% of antibiotic removal after 30 min) as well as the higher permeate flux decline (66% after 5 h) were observed when using the highest TiO2-P25 loading. The NEM contributed to the in-situ OTC and by-products oxidation, improving its antifouling properties, and, consequently, leading to a low permeate flux decline (8% after 5 h) when using UPW as solution matrix. However, a permeate flux decline of 66% was observed for UWW-NEM after the same reaction time. Despite the advantages of NEM, the OTC removal efficiency was higher when using TiO2-P25 slurry due to the higher photocatalyst surface area. Nevertheless, the NEM showed a good stability of the catalyst thin film during 3 consecutive reaction cycles.

AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) modified with mixed-linker strategy have shown advantages in various fields. In this article, a mixed-linker Zr-MOFs, PCN-134, was successfully prepared according to the thermodynamic method and used as a photocatalytic adsorbent for the removal of diclofenac (DF), a representative emerging contaminant. In PCN-134, the connection between Zr-6 clusters and benzene tribenzoate forms 2D layers, which are supported by TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) to form a 3D layer-pillar framework. Since Zr-MOFs allows the partial absence of linkers leading to structural defects while maintaining its framework integrity, the defect density and properties of PCN-134 can be controlled. We synthesized a series of PCN-134s with different TCPP ratios and found the DF uptake of PCN30 was the highest among them due to a delicate balance between porosity and defects. The selected PCN-134 (PCN30) exhibited excellent adsorption performance for the removal of DF from water. The adsorption process is affected by pH and ionic strength. The kinetic data can be well described by pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity of DF is about 2.04 mmol/g, calculated by Langmuir isotherm model. Under visible light irradiation, PCN-134 exhibited high photocatalytic activity in DF degradation experiments. The formation of O-1(2) indicated PCN-134 was dominated by type II photosensitization reaction, and the corresponding productivity was higher than that of single-linker PCN-224. The electron transform between TCPP linker and Zr6 clusters also contributed to the photodegradation of DF. The improved adsorptive and photocatalytic performance was mainly owing to the opened porous structure, extra defect sites, effective energy transfer and the synergistic effect between organic linkers. Further, as PCN-134 can be efficiently recycled, it is a promising photocatalytic adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB High surface area (2022 m(2).g(-1)) activated carbon (CSZ-C) is prepared by single step thermochemical activation of agro-waste lignocellulosic biomass. The turbostratic structure of CSZ-C enriched with microporosity promises the potential for adsorptive removal of organic dyes and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The pi-pi interaction between aromatic rings of organic pollutants and discrete graphitic clusters/units of CSZ-C facilitates the adsorption. The electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, trapping of organic pollutants by structural defects, etc. also play the roles and their contributions are governed by charge, chemical structure and molecular size of organic pollutants. The CSZ-C exhibited faster and higher adsorption of cationic dyes (523-537 mg.g(-1)) than the anionic dye (434.8 mg.g(-1)), whereas neutral organic pollutant tetracycline showed comparatively slower adsorption. Nevertheless, CSZ-C revealed significantly higher adsorption (595.2 mg.g(-1)) of tetracycline, which is governed by hydrogen bonding besides the p-p interaction between the oxygen functionalities-enriched tetracycline and the CSZ-C. The continuous flow separative unit having a fixed bed of CSZ-C efficiently removed the organic dyes from the industrial wastewater. Furthermore, the partition coefficients and breakthrough curves suggest the fast and high adsorptive removal efficiency of CSZ-C activated carbon for organic dyes.

AB A novel magnetic nanosphere/nanorod/nanosheet-like photocatalyst Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr was fabricated via a facile one-pot solvothermal method firstly and exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBU) removal, where the removal efficiencies of DCF and IBU were 93.81% and 96.78% after 40 min and 30 min visible LED light irradiation, respectively. The best preparation ratios with Bi2S3 mass were 4% and 1% for DCF and IBU removal respectively, which might be attributed to better crystallinities of (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets respectively. Besides, enhanced charge separation and better crystallinity with introduction of Fe3O4 and Bi2S3 promoted higher photocatalytic performance of Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr compared with pure BiOBr, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/BiOBr. Influencing factors experiments (pH, common anions, DOM) results showed beneficial or detrimental effects to a certain extent. While removal efficiencies in matrices of Yellow River (DCF: 55.65%; IBU: 54.90%) and Wastewater treatment plant (DCF: 68.66%; IBU: 58.90%) exhibited lower than those in ultrapure water. Moreover, h+ and e-played the uppermost roles in the DCF and IBU photodegradation according to active species trapping experiment results. Furthermore, four and two main degradation pathways for DCF and IBU removal respectively through 3D EEMs and HRMS analyses were proposed. Lastly, easy separation from water and excellent reusability proved its better potential for emerging pollutants removal in environment remediation area.

AB Ag2S-ZnO@rGO core-shell structured microspheres were prepared through a very simple, novel and green in-situ method using dimethyl sulfoxide as both the solvent and sulfur S source at low temperature (140 degrees C). The photocatalytic performance of synthesized samples was tested for degradation of acetaminophen (ACT) under visible light irradiation. ACT removal efficiency was directly depended on the GO-level in composite and the maximum photocatalytic yield was achieved for the sample with GO concentration of 0.2 g/L. Formation of Ag2S in the nanocomposite was confirmed using XRD, XPS and UV-Vis DRS and photoluminescence (PL) measurement. XRD patterns pointed to the existence of a wurtzite structure for all samples and by silver loading, Ag2S peaks were visualized in the XRD patterns, with increased intensity by rising the Ag content in the solution precursor. EDS and XPS data indicated the presence of sulfur and silver in the form of Ag+ and S2-. A considerable red shift in absorption edge and reduce in PL emission peak intensity was observed over the introduction of Ag in the precursor solution due to the existence of Ag2S. The Ag2S-ZnO@rGO composites indicated enhanced photocatalytic performance toward degradation of ACT under visible light compared to bare ZnO and ZnO@rGO. The underlying mechanism has been investigated based on the results of UV-Vis DRS, PL and reactive species scavenging experiments. The improved photocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to better light harvesting and increased photogenerated electron-hole separation. Ag2S play an important role in the composite due to the synergistic effect of Ag2S and rGO, which not only improve the light harvesting but also reduce the charge recombination. The as-made catalyst indicated a great potential for recycling, suggesting the potentially large-scale applications of prepared catalyst for emerging water contaminants and wastewater treatment. The cytotoxicity of untreated and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-treated ACT solutions was evaluated using the cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, which revealed that ACT solution in the developed PCO system could be significantly detoxified.

AB This study evaluates application of three different nanopowder mixtures for decomposition of diclofenac (DCF), one of frequently detected pharmaceutical in wastewater. Analyzed three photocatalytic mixtures ZnO/SnO2, ZnO/TiO2 and ZnO/In2O3 are for the first time used for diclofenac degradation. A set of experiments were performed in order to investigate influence of catalyst concentration (0.10-0.60 mg mL(-1)), initial concentration of diclofenac (0.002-0.010 mg mL(-1)) and pH value (5-9). The increase in the catalyst concentration leads to a decrease in the degradation rate constant, which is the most pronounced in the ZnO/TiO2 and ranges from 0.47 (6) min(-1) to 0.25 (3) min(-1). The influence of pH on efficacy shows completely different effects: ZnO/In2O3 is most effective in alkaline environments, ZnO/TiO2 in neutral environments, while ZnO/SnO2 efficiency is good in both alkaline and acidic environments. Initial concentrations of diclofenac showed a complex effect on the degradation rate. The four dominant intermediates were detected by LC MS/MS technique. In case of all three nanomaterials, intensive degradation was achieved in first 30 minutes. The economical analysis of photocatalytic treatment was provided where the preparation of nanomaterials does not demand high costs and with the highest diclofenac concentration, total operation costs are the lowest (77.14 US$/kWh).

AB Naproxen (NPX) is one of the most common pharmaceutical and personal care products found in surface water, which is recalcitrant to degradation by biological treatment or complete removal via traditional sewage treatment processes. In this study, nanoscale gamma-FeOOH was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, surface analysis, and analysis of the forbidden bandwidth. Under UV irradiation, gamma-FeOOH had the capacity to rapidly photodegrade NPX. The photodegradation rate of NPX was dependent on the concentration of gamma-FeOOH in solution, initial NPX concentration, and pH. By increasing the concentration of gamma-FeOOH, the NPX photodegradation rate was increased and then remained stable. Furthermore, the highest photodegradation rate for NPX was observed under acidic conditions. Through the analysis of the active substances (such as h(+), e(-), OH, O-1(2), and O2 center dot-) by electron spin resonance, the photocatalytic mechanism of NPX degradation on gamma-FeOOH was determined to be semiconductor photocatalysis.

AB Bio-refractory wastewater treatment is compulsory for a safe discharge into the environment. This paper aims to study the use of membrane processes to concentrate wastewater to be then treated by a hydrothermal process such as wet air oxidation for advanced and intensified wastewater treatment. The work focused on three different synthetic wastewaters of public or industrial interest: pharmaceutical wastewater, grey wastewater, and bilge wastewater. Membrane processes operated at the pilot scale enabled retentions as high as 100% of total organic carbon, more than 99% of turbidity, and 70% of hydrocarbon, respectively. High concentration factors were obtained. Membrane foulings were chemically reversible whatever the type of wastewater or the membrane process. Thanks to membrane filtrations, the volumes to be treated by wet air oxidation were drastically reduced, leading to high energy savings. Membrane retentates were then treated by wet air oxidation (300 degrees C, 15 MPa) and resulted in more than an 83% mineralization rate, regardless of the effluent. The hybrid intensified process presented in this work strongly increased the possibility of discharging into the environment by mixing the process outputs or greatly reducing the discharge volume and ultimately the waste load.

AB European policy is direct towards increasing the agricultural reuse of sludge on soil for improving the fertility; however, the effects of long-term pharmaceutical sewage sludge (PSS) application on soil properties are still unknown. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the agronomic and environmental effects on soil after 17 years of organic amendment with PSS derived from daptomycin production. Five different doses of PSS were spread on lands located in Anagni, Central Italy. Physico-chemical soil properties were investigated, as well as total and bioavailable heavy metals, changes in the soil organic matter quality and biochemical functioning.
   PSS application showed a positive agronomic potential, improving SOM quality, increasing soil humified organic matter and raising plant nutrients. SOM dynamic was different at low and high PSS supplies, as confirmed by the chemical and biochemical analysis (e.g. C biomass, FDA hydrolysis activity, basal respiration, dehydrogenase, urease and phosphatase activities). However, in a long-term agticultural reuse, environmental risks of PSS recycling were related to the increase of some heavy metals (Hg, Zn and Cu) and exchangeable Na. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The widespread distribution of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), particularly in the built environment, has led to increased concern about their effects on both human and ecosystem health. In this research, we investigated the role of algae species Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris in governing PPCP transfer and transformation mechanisms in algae-containing environments. Lab-scale algal bioreactors were created under various conditions of light, water matrix, and sterilization method to isolate and elucidate reaction mechanisms affecting carbamazepine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan. The parent compounds and their potential transformation products were analyzed in both the water and algae phases. The results showed that ibuprofen was primarily biotransformed due to synergistic relationships between the algae and the bacteria. Ibuprofen biotransformation products tentatively identified as hydroxy-ibuprofen, carboxy-ibuprofen, and 4-isobutylcatechol were detected in several samples. In all the reactors exposed to light, triclosan underwent both phototransformation and biotransformation. Triclosan biotransformation took place in Scenedesmus obliquus, as demonstrated by the presence of triclosan-O-sulfate in the algae extracts. No evidence of significant carbamazepine and gemfibrozil transfer or transformation was observed under the experimental conditions tested. These results suggest that microalgal-bacterial consortia can facilitate PPCP transformation in algae-based passive water treatment systems. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants present in wastewaters cause severe health hazards among chronically exposed population. Emerging pharmaceutically active contaminants pose a serious challenge to conventional treatment technologies. Employing advanced treatment technologies for the abatement of such contaminants is usually energy-intensive. In this study, a complex pharmaceutical wastewater from a pharmaceutical industry in California, USA, was treated by employing a novel bio-electrochemical treatment train system. Labeled "Bio-electroperoxone," our proposed system comprises (i) an electrically bound biofilm reactor (EBBR) that accelerates bacterial adhesion for the removal of biodegradable and persistent organics and (ii) an electroperoxone reactor that removes recalcitrant organics with minimal energy uptake. The EBBR comprises a platinum-coated titanium cathode and a conductive nematic liquid crystal display electrode (NLCE) obtained from electronic waste that serves as the anode. Characterization of functional groups, morphology, and elemental mapping of NLCE were carried out to explain mechanisms for rapid biofilm attachment. The concomitant electroperoxone reactor comprises a platinum-coated titanium (Pt-Ti) anode and a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) cathode that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of oxygen to form in situ H2O2. The bio-electroperoxone system (i) inactivated 99.99% of the micro-organisms, removed (ii) 92.20% of the color, (iii) 84.72% of the total suspended solids, and (iv) 89% of the total organic carbon (TOC). Possible mechanisms for the degradation of organic contaminants are elucidated. Bio-electroperoxone thus paves the way for an efficient and sustainable approach for the efficient removal of both biodegradable and recalcitrant, persistent organic contaminants from pharmaceutical and possibly other complex wastewaters.

AB Despite the fact that there are tens of thousands of thermal baths in existence, knowledge about the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in untreated thermal wastewater is very limited. Because used thermal water is typically legally discharged into surface waters without any treatment, the effluent poses environmental risks for the receiving water bodies. The aim of this study was to show the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal characteristics of 111 PhACs in thermal wastewater. Six thermal water outflows of different thermal baths were tested in different seasons in the Budapest metropolitan region (Hungary), and diurnal analysis was performed. After solid-phase extraction, the samples were analysed and quantified by coupling supercritical fluid chromatography and mass spectrometry to perform simultaneous multi-residue drug analysis. The results confirm that water discharge pipes directly transport pharmaceuticals into surface water bodies; 34 PhACs were measured to be over the limit of quantification at least once, and 21 of them were found in more than one water sample. The local anaesthetic drug lidocaine, antiepileptic carbamazepine, analgesic derivative tramadol and illicit drug cocaine were detected in more than half of the samples. Caffeine, metoprolol and bisoprolol (cardiovascular drugs), benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), diclofenac (NSAID), citalopram (antidepressant) and certain types of hormones also have a significant frequency of 30-50%. However, the occurrence and concentrations of PhACs vary according to the season and number/types of visitors. As demonstrated by the diurnal fluctuation, drug contamination of thermal waters can significantly vary, even for similar types of baths; furthermore, the quantity and types of some pollutants rapidly change in the discharged thermal wastewater.

AB In an extensive monitoring programme, event mean concentrations of 12 heavy metals, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nine pesticides/biocides, three pharmaceuticals, three benzotriazoles, acesulfame, and DEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) were measured at 10 combined sewer overflow (CSO) facilities throughout Bavaria, Germany, for more than 110 overflow events. A harmonised approach with large volume samplers was used to produce volume-proportional event composite samples. A wide range of event durations and volumes was covered successfully. All substances analysed were detected in CSO samples and the majority were quantified in more than 80% of the samples. Our results confirm that CSOs need to be considered in the debate on micropollutant emissions, and knowledge regarding their concentrations at a regional level needs to be solidified. Distinct substance-specific patterns can be observed in the variability between events and sites as well as in a correlation analysis of substance concentrations. These trends underline the need for differentiation of the substances by their predominant sources, pathways, and transport behaviours. Compared to wastewater treatment plants, CSOs are an important pollution source especially for ubiquitous, primarily stormwater-transported pollutants, including substances causing failure to achieve good chemical status of surface waters, such as the uPBT (ubiquitous, persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) substances Hg and PAH.

Consequently, the ever-growing presence of these emerging contaminants in aquatic environments has been reported. There is great concern about their potential adverse effects on organisms, and increasing interest in technologies to minimize these effects. More efficient technologies are needed to solve these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of two wastewater tertiary treatments. A mixture of 9 pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, norfloxacin, metoprolol, caffeine, antipyrine, sulfamethoxazole, ketorolac, hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac at 10 mg L-1 each) was added to a wastewater sample to further be ozonated and subjected to photocatalytic oxidation (black-light radiation/TiO2/O-2) for different time regimes (30 and 120 min). Resultant effluents were assessed for chemical efficacy (total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand) and toxicity (through a zebrafish embryo-larval bioassay including mortality and sublethal effects). Ozonation (120 min) and photocatalytic oxidation (30 min and 120 min) were effective processes to decrease both total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), with the latter under Directive 91/271/CEE recommended values. However, only the effluent subjected to 120 min photocatalytic oxidation was actually safe for the embryo-larval development and its functionality, with behavioral effects as the most sensitive endpoint. Thus, the toxic response of the zebrafish embryo-larval model proved to be more sensitive than the effluent physical-chemical monitoring itself, providing a tool to better characterize wastewater suitability.

AB The extensive use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) leads to a continuous increase of their presence in urban wastewater. These pollutants are discharged into natural waters and pose a threat to human health and the ecological environment. This study focused on five sewage treatment plants in three cities of China's Yangtze River Delta as research sites to study the distribution and degradation of drugs and their conversion products in wastewater. The concentration of target compounds in the water ranged from 0 to 510.8 ng/L, and both positive and negative removal rates occurred during the treatment. Acetaminophen (ACE) and ibuprofen (IPF) can be completely removed in the biological treatment stage. The addition of flocculants and sand filtration has a positive effect on the removal of naproxen (NPX) and bezafibrate (BZB). Ultraviolet disinfection is beneficial for the removal of antipyrine (ATP) and diclofenac (DCF). A small amount of PPCPs were found in the sludge and particulate matter, which had little effect on removal. Finally, the risk quotients were used to evaluate the harmfulness of the PPCPs detected in the effluent to the ecological environment, and the results showed that there was little hazard.

AB The occurrence of anti-inflammatory and analgesic pharmaceuticals (AIAPs) in the effluents of 16 hospitals, influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the contribution and mass load of each hospital to WWTP influent, and the removal efficiencies in WWTP were investigated. Environmental risk was also evaluated by toxicity tests using organisms from three different trophic levels. Acetaminophen had the highest concentration in summer and winter samples, followed by ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. The total daily load of AIAPs detected in influent of WWTP was 1677 mg/day/1000 inhabitants in summer and 5074 mg/day/1000 inhabitants in winter. The contribution of 16 hospitals to the total AIAP load in influent of WWTP was 11.30% in summer and 7.09% in winter. The highest mass loads were calculated as 203 mg/bed.day in general hospital in summer and 300 mg/bed.day in pediatric hospital in winter. The removal efficiencies of AIAPs in WWTP ranged between 13% and 100% in summer and 0.88% and 99% in winter. WWTP is not sufficient to remove all the AIAPs. Diclofenac (in summer), mefenamic acid, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone exhibited poor removal below 50%. The effluents of the WWTP exhibited a low risk for fish and Daphnia magna and an insignificant risk for algae.

AB Recently, strict standards for ship domestic sewage discharge have been implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The high salinity of ship sewage was considered a key factor influencing the removal efficiency of ship sewage treatment systems. In the present study, the salinity effect on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) from ship domestic sewage was investigated by using a novel air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR). Enzyme activity analysis and wavelet neural network (WNN) models were built to determine the mechanisms of the process. The experimental results indicate that high salinity levels (> 21 g/L) had a negative impact on COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies, and low saline concentrations (<= 21 g/L) caused a negligible effect. The COD and NH4-N removal efficiencies were 84% and 97%, respectively, at a salinity of 21 g/L, which were higher than those at low salinities (i.e., 7 g/L and 14 g/L). Invertase and nitrate reductase had a close relationship with removal performance, and they can be considered important indicators reflecting the operation effort under saline environments. With high predictive accuracies, the constructed WNN models simulated the complex COD and NH4+-N removal processes well under different saline concentrations, ensuring the long-term stable operation of the AMCMBR under different salinities.

AB Parabens (esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid) are xenobiosis belonging to endocrine disruptors and commonly used as a preservative in cosmetics, food, pharmaceutical, and personal care products. Their wide use is leading to their appearance in water and wastewater in the range from ng/L to mg/L. In fact, the toxicity of benzylparaben is comparable to bisphenol A. Therefore, it is important to find not only effective but also ecofriendly methods for their removal from aqueous environment since the traditional wastewater treatment approaches are ineffective. Herein, for the first time, such extended comparison of several radical-driven technologies for paraben mixture degradation is presented. The detailed evaluation included (1) comparison of ozone and hydroxyl peroxide processes; (2) comparison of catalytic and photocatalytic processes (including photocatalytic ozonation); (3) characterisation of catalysts using SEM, XRD, DRS, XPS techniques and BET isotherm; (4) mineralisation, biodegradability and toxicity assessment; and (5) cost assessment. O-3, H2O2/Fe2+, H2O2/UVC, O-3/H2O2, O-3/UVA, O-3/H2O2/UVA, UVA/catalyst, O-3/catalyst and O-3/UVA/catalyst were selected from advanced oxidation processes to degrade parabens as well as to decrease its toxicity towards Aliivibrio fischeri, Corbicula fluminea and Lepidium sativum. Research was focused on the photocatalytic process involving visible light (UVA and natural sunlight) and TiO2 catalysts modified by different metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic oxidation showed the lowest efficiency, while in combining ozone with catalysis and photocatalysis process, degradation efficiency and toxicity removal were improved. Photocatalytic ozonation slightly improved degradation efficiency but appreciably decreased transferred ozone dose (TOD). Results indicate that the degradation pathway is different, or different transformation products (TPs) could be formed, despite that the hydroxyl radicals are the main oxidant.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater by activated sludge (AS) and constructed wetlands (CWs). This analysis was carried out in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of a rural community where they implemented two technologies in parallel: AS and a pilot plant of horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands. In this case, these systems were fed by the same influent and the removal efficiencies of 14 OMPs, including analgesics/anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, stimulants, antifungals, fragrances, plasticizers, and transformation products, were evaluated in each system. Regarding the presence of OMPs in the wastewater, the concentrations of these compounds in the influent ranged from 0.16 to 7.75 mu g/L. In general, the removal efficiencies achieved by the AS system were between 10%-95% higher than those values reported by HSSFs with values above 80% for naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, caffeine, triclosan, methyl dihydrojasmonate, bisphenol-A, 2-hydroxyl ibuprofen, and carboxy ibuprofen (p < 0.05). This behavior can be related to the aerobic conditions that promote the AS system with oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values above -281 mV and 0.24 mg/L, respectively. However, the removal of galaxolide was greater in HSSF system than in AS with significant difference of 70% (p < 0.05). Despite these results, this study reveals that comparing both technologies, AS had the best removal performance of these OMPs studied.

AB In this study, two hormones 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and three phenolic compounds, bisphenol A (BPA), 4-N-nonylphenol (4-NP) and 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), were determined in surface water in the Cuautla River at the State of Morelos during the dry-season in Mexico. The endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) were extracted from water samples using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with end-capped C-18, and then the extracts were chemically derivatized to TMS (trimethylsylane)-compounds and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCMS). The most abundant compound was BPA (22.46 +/- 30.17 ng L-1), followed by 4-t-OP (11.24 +/- 11.76 ng L-1), 4-NP (7.53 +/- 14.88 ng L-1), EE2 (2.37 +/- 4.36 ng L-1) and E-2 (0.97 +/- 1.82 ng L-1). The residual amounts of target compounds could either reach stream surface water from direct domestic wastewater discharges, conventional wastewater treatment plant or can be a result from the use of agrochemicals in crop areas. The EDCs in Cuautla River exerted a high pressure on the aquatic ecosystem because their presences in surface water caused medium and high potential ecological risk.

AB The utilization of reclaimed water is a reliable and sustainable approach to enhance water supply in water-deficient cities. However, the presence of micro-organic pollutants (MPs) in reclaimed water has potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of 12 target MPs in the influent and reclaimed water collected from a local wastewater treatment plant, and the ultraviolet (UV)-chlorine process was applied to analyze its ability to remove MPs. The results showed that all 12 MPs were detected in both the influent and the reclaimed water, with the concentrations ranging from 25.5 to 238 ng/L and 8.6 to 42.5 ng/L, respectively. Over 52% of all the target MPs were readily degraded by the UV-chlorine process, and the removal efficiency was 7.7% to 64.2% higher than the corresponding removal efficiency by chlorination or UV irradiation only. The degradation efficiency increased with the increasing initial chlorine concentration. The pH value had a slight influence on the MP degradation and exhibited different trends for different MPs. The formation of known disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) during the UV-chlorine process was 33.8% to 68.4% of that in the chlorination process, but the DBPs' formation potentials were 1.3 to 2.2 times higher. The toxicity assay indicated that UV-chlorine can effectively reduce the toxicity of reclaimed water.

AB Hollow microsphere structure cobalt hydroxide (h-Co(OH)(2)) was synthesized via an optimized solvothermal-hydrothermal process and applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degradation of a typical pharmaceutically active compound, ibuprofen (IBP). The material characterizations confirmed the presence of the microscale hollow spheres with thin nanosheets shell in h-Co(OH)(2), and the crystalline phase was assigned to alpha-Co(OH)(2). h-Co(OH)(2) could efficiently activate PMS for radicals production, and 98.6% of IBP was degraded at 10 min. The activation of PMS by h-Co(OH)(2) was a pH-independent process, and pH 7 was the optimum condition for the activation-degradation system. Scavenger quenching test indicated that the sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) was the primary reactive oxygen species for IBP degradation, which contributed to 75.7%. Fukui index (f(-)) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted the active sites of IBP molecule for SO4 center dot- attack, and then IBP degradation pathway was proposed by means of intermediates identification and theoretical calculation. The developed hollow Co(OH)(2) used to efficiently activate PMS is promising and innovative alternative for organic contaminants removal from water and wastewater.

AB Two kinetic models were established for conservative estimates of photodegradation rates of contaminants under sunlight irradiation, in particular for wastewater stabilisation ponds and clarifiers in conventional wastewater treatment plants. These two models were designated for (1) contaminants with high photolytic rates or high photolytic quantum yields, whose photodegradation is unlikely to be enhanced by aquatic photosensitisers; and (2) contaminants withstanding direct photolysis in sunlit waters but subjected to indirect photolysis. The effortlessly intelligible prediction procedure involves sampling and analysis of real water samples, simulated solar experiments in the laboratory, and transfer of the laboratory results to realise water treatment using the prediction models. Although similar models have been widely used for laboratory studies, this paper provides a preliminary example of translating laboratory results to the photochemical fate of contaminants in real waters.

ID REGRESSION TREE
AB Over-standard discharge of enterprise sewage had severely weakened the processing wastewater ability of the wastewater and shortened the service life of the facility in the sewage treatment plant, more importantly, posed a serious threat to the water environment safety in the watershed. Based on the historical daily monitoring data of key monitoring enterprises and sewage treatment plant, temperature and precipitation data, the boosted regression tree (BRT) model was established. The feature variables (discharge flow, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) daily emission and COD daily monitoring concentration) were obtained by BRT model. The total contribution of feature variables accounted for 80.92%. The BRT model prediction accuracy and kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.78, respectively. Then, three single hidden-layer feedforward neural network models were constructed to analyze the importance ranking of enterprises according to each feature variable. The results showed that heavy industry and pharmaceutical enterprises ranked ahead. Last, using generalized extreme studentized deviate test (ESD) algorithm, the anomaly detection analysis was conducted to obtain the proportion of abnormal data and distribution regularities on the suspicious enterprises. Our study may provide scientific evidence and auxiliary decision support in the identification of illegal emission enterprises.

AB A charcoal was produced from primary pulp mill sludge and then used for the adsorptive removal of diclofenac, salicylic acid, ibuprofen and acetaminophen. A main aim was to assess the utilization of this material for the tertiary treatment of sewage. For this purpose, the adsorption of the selected pharmaceuticals from the secondary effluent of a sewage treatment plant (STP) was compared with their adsorption from ultrapure water. Differences in the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium were evident between the four pharmaceuticals considered. However, differences between the adsorption from the two aqueous matrixes considered were negligible. It was hypothesized that synergetic microorganism removal compensated the competitive effects in wastewater. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB In the present study green chemistry was employed for synthesizing ZnO nanoparticles using the extract of black tea solid waste and Zn acetate dihydrate. The characterization of the green synthesized ZnO was conducted by XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, DLS and EDAX. Urine samples from donors under medication with Ibuprofen, Ephedrine and Propranolol were separated and collected through a diversion toilet. A batch experiment was conducted in order to determine the optimum dose of green synthesized ZnO nanoparticles for the removal of the pharmaceutical compounds from human urine. The determined optimum dose of the ZnO nanoparticles was 1.5 g/l. ZnO nanoparticle possess the ability to adsorb the Pharmaceutical active compounds (PACs) on the surface. In addition, it binds such adsorbed particles and facilitates their precipitation. Coagulant reagents react with some of the suspended and colloidal particles in water/ wastewater to enhance their binding together, thus, allowing their removal in the subsequent treatment processes. The mechanism of aggregation consists of the combination of charge neutralization, entrapment, adsorption and/or complexion with the coagulant ions to form insoluble precipitate. Thus, the particles and colloids can be removed. A semi-pilot plant consisted of mixing tank for chemical coagulation using the predetermined ZnO nanoparticles followed by microfiltration unit, was designed and operated continuously for the treatment of the separated urine. The overall results of the semi-pilot study showed that the concentration of Ibuprofen, Ephedrine and Propranolol decreased from 5.0, 10.15 and 15.2 mg/l to 0.01, 0.10 and 0.03 mg/l respectively. The overall removal rate exceeded 99%. Meanwhile, the treatment system succeeded to improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the contaminated human urine. The treated urine could be safely used for agriculture purposes without any environmental threat. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB In recent years, application of biochar for removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions has been of interest due to favorable physicochemical properties and availability of feedstock. However, adsorption behavior has been reported only for raw and micro biochar particles and taking advantage of biochar nanoparticles, which offer superior specific surface area, did not receive any attention. The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption efficiency of produced nanobiochar from pinewood. For this purpose, removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), a globally prescribed pharmaceutical, at very low concentrations (0.5-20 ppb) on as-produced nanobiochar with average particle size of 60 nm was studied. The results showed that nanobiochar can remove up to 95% of CBZ (74 mu g CBZ/g nanobiochar) after 3 h contact time. Adsorption of CBZ on nanobiochar followed Freundlich isotherm model (R-2 = 0.9822) and pseudo-second order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.9994). It was found that increasing pH from 3 to 8 can enhance the adsorption efficiency by 2.3 folds. Also, due to the presence of surfactant in wastewater, the addition of Tween 80 as a model surfactant was studied in the range of 0 to 1 (Tween 80 to CBZ molar ratio) and the results showed that adsorption efficiency can be enhanced by 57%.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are one the main pollutant of the environment. In the present study, photocatalytic processes using zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoparticles have been investigated for the feasibility of dexamethasone (DXM) decomposition. The effects of different variables such as solution pH, catalyst dosage, DXM concentration, contact time, and different irradiation sources were investigated. The results showed that the maximum efficiency achieved at pH 3 for both catalyst. Optimum catalyst dosage for WO3 and ZrO2 was 500 and 1500 mg/l, respectively. Maximum degradation was obtained at DXM concentration of 5 mg/l. The investigation of different irradiation sources exhibited that BLB/WO3 process was capable of 100% removal of DXM. Furthermore, approximately of 50% of mineralization of DXM was achieved by Halogen/WO3 in synthetic solutions. The degree of DXM mineralization and process performance in the actual hospital wastewater were also studied which showed lower efficiency than synthetic solution. Moreover, the experimental kinetics data were analyzed using Pseudo-first-order and Pseudo-second-order reactions. The obtained results followed Pseudo-first-order with the highest R-2 value of 0.99 for UV/TiO2. In the actual hospital wastewater, DXM was completely decomposed using halogen/WO3 at a contact time of 100 min.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is an anti-inflammatory drug detected in various aquatic sources and found harmful to aquatic life. In spite of adopting various treatment techniques, complete removal is not observed and remaining DCF can interact with other existing contaminants leading to the generation of more toxic contaminants in wastewater. In the present work, investigations on removal of DCF from aqueous solutions were carried out through Pseudo-emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) technique with pseudo-emulsion consisting of Di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as carrier, n-heptane as diluent and HCl as stripping phase. Morphological features of hollow fiber membrane module were revealed through Field emission scanning electron microscopy which shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of membrane phase before and after extraction of DCF confirms interaction between D2EHPA and DCF. Contact angle measurement shows that due to hydrophobicity and strong capillary force, membrane phase retains within the micropores of the hollow fiber and helps to diffuse DCF forming DCF-D2EHPA complex. Uniform droplet sizes and size distribution of pseudo-emulsion provides high interfacial contact area and higher extraction efficiency. Studies on permeability and investigations regarding the effect of several operational parameters such as concentration of feed phase (F), carrier (C) and stripping phase (S) for the extraction of DCF as well as multivariable optimization were carried out by Response surface methodology using Box-Behnken design approach. 97.50% extraction of DCF was achieved with PEHFSD technique at optimum conditions.

AB The presence and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in wastewater have received growing attention due to their potential impacts on human health and the environment. In this study, the authors assessed the presence of CECs in the influent and effluent of the Sharjah wastewater treatment plant (SWWTP), a conventional activated sludge system, over a 1 year period. Sharjah is the capital city of the Emirate of Sharjah in the UAE. Characterisation of the CECs required development of elaborate analytical techniques for detection and quantification of CECs at the nanogram per litre level. A total of 57 CECs were detected and identified, of which ten pharmaceuticals, including seven antibiotics, an analgesic/antipyretic medicine, a b-blocker and an antipsychotic drug were quantified. The measured concentrations of the ten quantified pharmaceuticals were in the tens to hundreds of nanograms per litre, except for acetaminophen, which reached micrograms per litre levels. The quantified CECs in the effluent were 4-69% of their levels in the influent, indicating apparent removals in the range 31-97%. This study is the first one on the presence and removal of CECs in the SWWTP and contributes essential literature on the subject in Sharjah and the region.

AB Enhancing the understanding of the fate of wastewater-derived organic micropollutants in rivers is crucial to improve risk assessment, regulatory decision making and river management. Hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity are two factors gaining increasing importance as drivers for micropollutant degradation, but are complex to study in field experiments and usually ignored in laboratory tests aimed to estimate environmental half-lives. Flume mesocosms are useful to investigate micropollutant degradation processes, bridging the gap between the field and batch experiments. However, few studies have used flumes in this context. We present a novel experimental setup using 20 recirculating flumes and a response surface model to study the influence of hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity on half-lives of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACS). The effect of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange was tested by three treatment levels differing in number of bedforms (0, 3 and 6). Three levels of sediment bacterial diversity were obtained by diluting sediment from the River Erpe in Berlin, Germany, with sand (1 : 10, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 100 000). Our results show that ACS half-lives were significantly influenced by sediment dilution and number of bedforms. Half-lives of CBZ were higher than ACS, and were significantly affected only by the sediment dilution variable, and thus by bacterial diversity. Our results show that (1) the flume-setup is a useful tool to study the fate of micropollutants in rivers, and that (2) higher hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity in the sediment can increase the degradation of micropollutants in rivers.

AB Microalgae can utilize the pollutants from wastewater as substrate and act as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. In this study, the pharmaceutical wastewater was pretreated in photobioreactor (PBR) using microalgae Scenedesmus abundans. The pretreated effluent was further treated in a photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) for production of biomass and electricity. The biomass generated in PBR and PMFC was used for biodiesel production. At the end of pretreatment process, maximum 77 +/- 3% of the COD was removed along with nitrate and phosphate removal of 82 +/- 0.5 and 65.9 +/- 0.4%, respectively. In continuation of the treatment process, in PMFC a maximum of 88 +/- 3% COD was removed resulting in 97.24% total COD removal. Overall (97.12% Nitrate and 93.71% phosphate) were also removed. A maximum voltage of 745.96 mV and power density of 838.68 mW/m(2) were achieved. The amount of biomass produced in PBR and PFMC process was 0.97 +/- 0.01 g/L and 0.94 +/- 0.01 g/L, respectively. Fatty acid profile of Scenedesmus abundans from both the processes has shown the presence of ample amount of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with C16 and C18 carbon chain. This study indicates that the integration of microalgal pretreatment may help in an efficient bioremediation process of pharmaceutical wastewater as well as bioelectricity production.

AB In this study, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) from a pharmaceutical wastewater (PhW) was reduced by several techniques such as electro-Fenton (EF), photo electro-Fenton (PEF) and activated sludge (AS) processes and the obtained data were compared with each other. The effects of several parameters such as pH, current density, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW, reaction time and UVA light were studied on the COD reduction through the EF and PEF processes. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) under Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to design and then optimize these processes. The optimal conditions for 87% of COD removal through the EF process were at pH of 3.27, current density of 57 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe(2+)molar ratio of 3.5, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.34 ml/l and reaction time of 56.32 min while the optimal conditions for 91.6% of COD removal through PEF process were at pH of 3.5, current density of 57.5 mA/cm(2) , H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 3.81, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.5 ml/l, reaction time of 10.12 min and 6 W UVA light while 77.70% of COD removal was obtained by the AS process with residence time of 1020 min. According to the kinetic study, the second order reaction (with high R-2 data) could properly model the EF and PEF processes.

AB In this study, silanized nanodiamond (SND) was synthesized and used as a nano additive to develop the polysulfone (PSf) nanocomposite membrane in order to investigate the effects of the functionalization of nanodiamond (ND) nanoparticles on the structure and performance of PSf membranes for wastewater treatment process. ND was functionalized by silanization method using vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTS) and the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of silane groups on the surface of NDs. Afterward, neat and nanocomposite PSf membranes containing 1.0 wt.% ND and 1.0 wt.% SND were prepared via phase inversion method. Prepared membranes were then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), pure water flux (PWF), contact angle and mechanical strength analyses. FESEM images showed that the number of pores on the surface of membranes increased at the presence of ND and SND nanoparticles but the average pore size decreased. PSf/SND nanocomposite membrane had the maximum PWF of 112 Lm(-2) h(-1) and the lowest contact angle value of 76.44 degrees. However, the presence of ND and SND nanoparticles had no significant effect on mechanical strength of the membranes. Moreover, the EDX analysis showed that the SNDs were dispersed uniformly throughout the PSf matrix. After determination of critical flux, the performance of prepared membranes was investigated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed for 360 min operation. The obtained results revealed that PSf/SND nanocomposite membrane had the lowest irreversible fouling ratio (IFR) and the highest flux recovery ratio (FRR).

AB The degradation and the mineralisation of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide were studied by an advanced electrochemical oxidation process, `electro-Fenton', which generates in situ hydroxyl radicals that are able to successfully oxidise or mineralise organic pollutants. In this study, a 0.1 mM (29.8 mg L-1) hydrochlorothiazide solution was completely oxidatively degraded in 15 min under constant current electrolysis at 500 mA. The absolute kinetic rate constant of the oxidation reaction was also determined as (4.37 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). The quasi-complete mineralisation of the solution was obtained with electrolysis for 6 h under the same applied current. Several oxidation reaction intermediates were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The formed carboxylic acids during the mineralisation process were also studied; oxamic, oxalic, acetic and maleic acids were identified and their concentrations were monitored throughout the electrolysis. The ions released during the treatment were also considered. Based on these data and the total organic carbon (TOC) removal results, a possible mineralisation pathway was proposed. These findings enable the conclusion that the electro-Fenton process is an efficient and environmentally-friendly method to eliminate the hazardous drug hydrochlorothiazide from an aqueous environment.

AB Illicit drugs and their metabolites represent a new class of emerging contaminants. These substances are continuously discharged into wastewater which have been detected in the aquatic environment in concentrations ranging from ng.L(-)7(1) to mu g.L-1. Our study detected the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) in a subtropical coastal zone (Santos Bay, SP, Brazil) within one year. Water samples (surface and bottom) were collected from the Santos Submarine Sewage Outfall (SSOS) area. COC and BE were measured in the samples using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Concentrations ranged from 12.18 to 203.6 ng.L-1 (COC) and 8.20 to 38.59 ng.L-1 (BE). Higher concentrations of COC were observed during the end of spring, following the population increase at summer season. COC and its metabolite occurrence in this coastal zone represent a threat to coastal organisms.

AB Cytostatic drugs are compounds used to treat cancer, one of the deadliest diseases worldwide with a rising yearly incidence. However, the occurrence and concentrations of a large number of cytostatics in waters and waste-waters are unknown. Thus, this study sought to analyze the concentrations of these compounds in different aquatic environments worldwide to assess the risk that these compounds pose to aquatic organisms. The top five most monitored cytostatics in aquatic environments are fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Risk quotients (RQs) based on maximum reported measured concentrations revealed that mycophenolic acid and tamoxifen pose a high risk to aquatic organisms (ROmax >=( )1) at concentrations observed in surface waters. Moreover, methotrexate and tegafur were categorized as moderate risk compounds, and bicalutamide was found to pose a low risk. Importantly, the available analytical methodologies for the quantification of some cytostatics (e.g., cisplatin, fluorouracil, daunorubicin, imatinib, and mycophenolic acid) in water could not rule out potential risk to aquatic biota, since estimated risks for these compounds using the lowest method detection limits reported in the literature (RQ MDL) were all >= 0.01 (i.e., low risk or higher). Moreover, risks based on predicted concentrations (RQ PEC) were consistently lower than those based on measured concentrations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment based on measured values. Thus, accurate and sensitive analytical methods are crucial to identify and quantify cytostatic exposure in aquatic ecosystems in order to preserve biodiversity and ensure a safer environment.

AB This study experimented with the novel approach of using a microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) treatment train to treat the effluent of a primary settling tank at the Inland Empire Utility Agency in Chino, CA. The pilot used polyvinylidene fluoride hollow-fiber MF modules as pretreatment for an RO skid, which used Hydranautics ESPA2 membranes in a two-stage configuration with a feed capacity of 6 gallon per minute (gpm). In this pilot configuration, researchers monitored the removal of 38 most prevalent contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) through the MF/RO process. To investigate how operating the RO process at two fixed recovery rates of 55% and 80% would affect the performance of the MF/RO membranes, researchers applied different fluxes (8, 10, 12 and 14 gal/d/ft(2) (gfd)) and evaluated the removal of CECs in 1-stage and 2-stage RO configurations. The occurrence of CECs in the MF influent, MF effluent, RO permeate, and RO concentrate were analyzed and studied. In the first phase (1-stage the RO process), flux of 14 gfd showed a better rejection value of inorganics (95.2%) when compared with those of other fluxes. Meanwhile, in the second phase (2-stage RO process), flux of 12 gfd showed a better rejection of inorganics (93.7%) when compared with those of other fluxes. Although concentrations of CECs slightly decreased in the RO permeate as the flux has increased, statistical analysis showed no significant differences between different fluxes in terms of CEC rejection.

AB Boron nitride (BN) nanosheets are promising support materials for catalysts. A series of TiO2-BN enabled electrospun nanofibers were synthesized for the photocatalytic treatment of ibuprofen and secondary wastewater effluent under visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the existence of B-O-Ti bonds between the BN nanosheets and TiO2 nanofibers, resulting in energy rearrangement, narrowed band gaps, and enhanced light utilization efficiency of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites in the visible light spectrum. Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that the BN enhanced the transport of photogenerated holes from the bulk TiO2 nanofibers to its surface, resulting in more efficient separation and less recombination of the charge carriers. A kinetic study of ibuprofen degradation indicated the enhanced photocatalytic performance of TiO2-BN catalysts with a higher BN content in the nanocomposites. The kinetic rate constant of the TiO2-10% BN catalysts was 10 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanofibers. The degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater followed the same trend as ibuprofen and improved with increasing BN content. The stability of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites as an effective solar photocatalyst was demonstrated by multiple cycles of wastewater treatment. The results proved that TiO2-BN is an appealing photocatalyst under visible light.

AB Water diversion projects have been continuously used to alleviate water quality issues that arise during urbanization. However, studies about whether it has possible effects on the status of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are limited. In this study, the occurrence trends and spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of 50 PPCPs were investigated in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments in Nanjing urban rivers under the background of the water diversion project from the Yangtze River to the Qinhuai River. In the four field campaigns that were embarked on April to July 2018, a total of 40, 38 and 24 PPCPs were detected in surface water, SPM and sediments, respectively, with overall concentrations of 138-1990 ng/L, 3214-33,701 ng/g and 12.1-109 ng/g dry weight (dw) among nine sampling sites. The excessive concentration of caffeine (20.6-905 ng/L) may be evidence of the direct discharge of untreated sewage and an obvious indicator of the overall concentrations of PPCPs. The PPCPs contamination levels in surface water were increased along with the direction of the water diversion in urban runoff, and decreased by 8-31% due to the increase in volume attributable to the water diversion. The distribution coefficients (K-d) of pollutants in the SPM-water phases (3.0-5.6 L/kg) were two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sediment-water phases (0.3-3.3 L/kg). And the positive correlations between their log K-ow and SPM-water log K-d values indicated SPM was the important carrier determining the fate of organic UV filters. Furthermore, the results of ecological risk assessment demonstrated that although the increase in the volume of water caused by the water diversion reduced the overall ecological risks of PPCPs in urban rivers, the current contamination level still represents high risks to algae and fish.

AB We studied for the first time three ionophore anticoccidial drugs: monensin (MON), lasalocid (LAS), and salinomycin (SAL) as emerging pollutants originating from animal and plant husbandry in surface waters (n=89) in one of the most extensive hydrological basins in South America (Del Plata basin). The soluble fraction of ionophores was pretreated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS/MS at a limit of detection of 1.7 ng.L-1. A statistical approach noted the need to report parameters calculated by methods based on the number of observations and the censorship percentage over substitution methods for more precise estimations of environmental data with a high percentage of left-censored data. Water collectors adjacent to intensive-husbandry facilities, placed in direct runoffs from animal excreta, or in wastewater emissions contained median concentrations of MON and SAL approximately 70 times higher than those found in regional tributaries and main courses of 5 sub-basins of the pampas and mesopotamic regions, thus exhibiting a relevance to other similar agricultural pollutants widely reported as pesticides. Chemical speciation of these compounds in surface water was characterized especially for MON and SAL, where the pH and chemical oxygen demand of the natural water body was associated with the concentration of the soluble fraction. The concentrations in abundant rivers such as the Gualeguay deliver a contribution to a natural wetland such as the Parana-River delta, which registered only one sample with a [MON] <= the limit of quantification. Since wetlands possess a limited removal capability, these affluent contributions recorded strongly indicate that attention must be paid to the development of guidelines involving quality criteria for assessing the impact of ionophore antibiotics on such ecosystems.

AB Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) harbours large amounts of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the variation and fate of these emerging pollutants during sludge treatment processes must be thoroughly studied to reduce their potential risks to human health. In this study, 7 pilot-scale CSTR anaerobic digesters were established with the same seed sludge and fed with the same thermal hydrolysis pre-treated sewage sludge, while operating under different conditions. High-throughput quantitative PCR, UPLC-MS/MS and Illumina Hiseq-sequencing were used to systematically evaluate the responses of antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs in sewage sludge to thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment and various anaerobic digestion (AD) conditions. The results showed that thermal hydrolysis effectively reduced the abundance (> 94%) of almost all subtypes of ARGs and MGEs, and it was a powerful technology for reducing tetracyclines, macrolides, and lincosamides. Besides, the abundance of ARGs and MGEs in thermophilic digesters was lower than that in mesophilic digesters, suggesting that thermophilic digesters could be used to avoid the ARGs rebounding. In addition, the thermophilic system further reduced the concentrations of quinolones. For the digesters operated under the mesophilic conditions, a longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) facilitated the removal of antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs. Furthermore, the microbial community and MGEs had important effects on the persistence and proliferation of ARGs in AD process. The findings of this study provide effective clues for controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance and suggest the optimal operating conditions of digesters.

AB Contamination with fluoroaromatics (FAs), particularly polyfluorinated aniline, is becoming a serious environmental problem worldwide. To shorten the start-up time, and increase the stability of treatment systems, this work focused on the effects of three seeding sources on treatment performances of 2,3,4-trifluoroaniline (2,3,4-TFA) during start-up and shock, as well as the acclimated strategy. After 246-323 days of acclimation in a stepwise feeding according to the inhibition degree, three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) successfully achieved efficient removal, i.e., 300.00 mg/L of 2,3,4-TFA, with over 95.00% of degradation efficiency and 60.00-80.00% of defluorination rates. The sludge obtained from the fluorizated hydrocarbon wastewater treatment plant(FHS) without prior exposure to fluoroaniline was determined to be optimal, based on the observed shortest start-up time of 246 days, the highest defluorination rate of 70.00-80.00%, the fastest recovery time of 7 days after shock, and the highest microbial diversity with nine dominant bacterial groups. Furthermore, compared with the sludge obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater containing part of municipal wastewater treatment plant(PMS), the seeding source used in treating the comprehensive wastewater in industrial park (CIS) exhibited earlier defluorination reaction, higher defluorination rate and microbial diversity, but lower shock resistance. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that microbial diversity was dependent on the origin of the inoculum after acclimation. We identified two predominant phyla in PMS, namely, Deinococcus-Thermus (24.43%) and Bacteroidetes (18.44%), whereas these were Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi in FHS and CIS. During the shock of 400 mg/L 2,3,4-TFA, the predominant bacteria norank_f_Blastocatellaceae and norank_f_Methylobacteriaceae disappeared, and the defluorination reaction hardly occurred, indicating that the bacterial genera could contribute to the defluorination reaction.

AB Advanced oxidation processes offer practical and cost effective solutions for the treatment of poorly biodegradable industrial wastewaters. Here, column experiments were performed to understand the role of a complexing agent, citrate, on Fenton-treatment of an actual pharmaceutical wastewater with pyrite as the catalyst under dynamic flow conditions. Our results suggest that the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with Fenton reaction using pyrite as the catalyst was mainly regulated by the extent of Fe dissolution from pyrite, which, in turn, resulted in formation of hydroxyl radicals in solution. The Fenton treatment efficiency was much lower in the absence of citrate compared to citric acid containing systems due to clogging of column pores with oxidized Fe species. On the other hand, the addition of citrate to wastewater significantly improved Fenton process efficacy, and prolonged the lifecycle of pyrite-packed columns depending on solution pH. Low pH values were favorable for better Fenton efficiency in systems containing citrate due to combined effect of proton and ligand promoted dissolution and mobilization of oxidized Fe species.

AB Public concerns about potential ecological risks of androgens discharged to the environment through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has resulted in an increased interest regarding the occurrence and fate of androgens in WWTPs. In this study, the occurrence and removal of eight androgens from 12 municipal WWTPs distributed in eleven cities in China were investigated. The composition profiles of eight androgens in influent, effluent, and excess sludge were studied. Multiple factor analyses were performed to reveal the factors affecting the distribution of androgens in WWTP influent. Results showed similar composition profiles of androgens in the studied WWTPs, with androsterone and dehydroepi-androsterone confirmed as the dominant androgens. The distributions of androgens in WWTP influent were related to the chemical oxygen demand in influent and the gross domestic product (GDP) of WWTP-associated cities. The target androgens have high aqueous removal rates, with a mean removal rate of >90%. Additionally, the behaviors of androgens were evaluated by mass balance along anaerobicanoxic-oxic (MO) processes in a WWTP, in which many of the androgens were eliminated mainly in the anaerobic tank. Further, 15 biotransformation products of testosterone were identified under anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic sludge, respectively. Based on these metabolites, a general biotransformation pathway of testosterone under anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic sludge is presented. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microplastics can adsorb chemical pollutants such as metals or pharmaceuticals, and transferred them along the food chain. In this work, an investigation of the adsorption of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by five different types of microplastics was performed in Milli-Q water and natural waters (seawater, urban wastewater and irrigation water) via a series of batch adsorption experiments. The effects of concentration of metals and physicochemical characteristics of polymers were particularly studied. Results revealed a significant adsorption of lead, chromium and zinc on microplastics, especially on polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride. In the case of polyethylene terephthalate, it showed little adsorption capacity. Specific surface, porosity and morphology are characteristics that affect the molecular interactions. The adsorption isotherms were better described by Langmuir model, which indicates that the main adsorption mechanism might be chemical adsorption. Finally, results obtained in natural waters indicated that dissolved organic matter may play a major role on metal adsorption on microplastics. Results showed an enhancement of metal adsorption in waters with high chemical and biological oxygen demands as urban wastewater and irrigation water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is shown here that ZVI-Fenton is a suitable technique to achieve effective degradation of ibuprofen and phenol under several operational conditions. Degradation of ibuprofen was possible in the pH interval 3-6 in both synthetic laboratory systems and actual wastewater (secondary treatment effluent), but operation at the higher pH values required higher H2O2 concentration and/or higher ZVI loading. In the case of real wastewater we offset the lower degradation efficiency, caused by the occurrence of organic and inorganic interfering agents, by carrying out multiple H2O2 additions. The studied wastewater sample had a buffer-capacity minimum at pH 4-5, and optimal treatment for ibuprofen degradation might take place at either pH 4 or 6. With a reagents cost in the order of 0.06-0.10 $ m(-3), the technique appears as very competitive and promising for tertiary wastewater treatment. There is a clear trade-off between savings in pH-fixing reagents and higher consumption of ZVI-Fenton reagents at the different pH values. The final choice in real application scenarios could be based on cost considerations (which favour pH 4) and/or the eventual fate of wastewater. For instance, wastewater reuse might place requirements on the salinity that is increased by the acidification/neutralization steps: in this case, operation at pH 6 is preferred. Interestingly, the ZVI-Fenton degradation of ibuprofen led to very low generation of toxic 4-isobutylacetophenone (IBAP, which is the ibuprofen by-product raising the highest concern), because of the combination of low formation yields and limited IBAP stability in the optimal reaction conditions. In addition to ibuprofen, phenol could be degraded as well by ZVI-Fenton. Interestingly, the ability of ZVI-Fenton to degrade both ibuprofen and phenol under similar conditions might open up the way to apply this technique to additional pollutants as well as to pollutant mixtures.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are a major pathway for pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment. Many pharmaceuticals, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are chiral chemicals and the biological activity of their enantiomers can differ. Few studies have assessed the effects of different NSAID enantiomers on non-target organisms. However, this information is important for environmental risk assessment to ensure that the effects of more potent enantiomers are not overlooked. In the current study, enantiomers of naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and flurbiprofen were evaluated in bioassays with bacteria, algae and fish cells. All enantiomers induced bacterial toxicity, with (R)-naproxen more toxic than (S)-naproxen (EC50 0.75 vs 0.93 mg/L) and (S)-flurbiprofen more toxic than (R)-flurbiprofen (EC50 1.22 vs 2.13 mg/L). Both (R)-flurbiprofen and (S)-flurbiprofen induced photosystem II inhibition in green algae, with (R)-flurbiprofen having a greater effect in the assay after 24 h (EC10 5.47 vs 9.07 mg/L). Only the (R)-enantiomers of flurbiprofen and ketoprofen induced ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in fish cells, while (S)-naproxen was 2.5 times more active than (R)-naproxen in the EROD assay. While enantiospecific differences were observed for all assays, the difference was less than an order of magnitude. This indicates that the risk of overlooking the effect of more potent NSAID enantiomers is minor for the studied test systems and supports the use of racemic (or single enantiomer) effect data for environmental risk assessment. However, further investigation of the (R)-enantiomer of commonly used NSAID ketoprofen is recommended as it was at least six times more potent in the EROD assay than the inactive (S)-ketoprofen.

AB Detection and quantification of Pharmaceutical and Personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewaters and aqueous samples is crucial in terms of environmental monitoring and risk assessment for these emerging contaminants in the environment. The majority of the studies on PPCPs in wastewaters involve analysis only of representative compounds for each class, while few studies reported for the analysis of several compounds from multiple classes of PPCPs in samples. In this light, the aim of this work was to develop a multiresidue analytical protocol based on solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometer-(LC-MS/MS) for simultaneous determination of 138 substances including 37 different classes of PPCPs that can be used for monitoring in wastewater. Hence, an extensive monitoring survey of PPCPs in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities of North (Thessaloniki) and Central (Larisa, Volos) Greece region has been conducted. In addition, the occurrence of the target compounds in raw waters of effluents from two medium-size hospitals located in the Larisa Region was investigated. Analgesics-anti-inflammatories (paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, salicylic acid), diuretic (furosemide), antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), anti-hypertensives (valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram), stimulant (caffeine) and beta blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol) were among the most frequently detected compounds. The removal rates varied between the different therapeutic groups, as well within each therapeutic group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100%. Mass loading distribution in the different WWTPs was also evaluated. Finally, the risk quotient approach (RQ) for single substances and the cumulative RQ for the classes of the target PPCPs was used in order to identify the potential ecotoxicological risk posed in the tree trophic levels of aquatic organisms.

AB A microwave (MW) heat-activated the persulfate (PS) process was employed to treat paracetamol (PAM) in wastewater, and the powder-activated carbon (PAC) be used is used as a catalyst to accelerate this reaction process. The PAM added (100 mg) to the solution was nearly completely removed within 70 min, and the PH, temperature, PAC, and PS dosage have great influence on the degradation process; the total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate reached 98%. The PAC(1) still had a good catalytic effect after being reused six times. The radical mechanism was investigated to determine the type of dominant active species involved in PAM degradation. Sulfate radicals (SO4-.) were the dominant oxidizing agent for PAM degradation under acidic conditions. The degradation mechanism was proposed based on the PAM degradation intermediates, which were identified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear trap quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry. Three types of possible reaction pathways for PAM were identified as follows: including hydroxylation of the benzene ring, amine group oxidation at the benzene ring, and amine (HN-C=O) functional group N-C bond cleavage.

AB In this study, a binary mixture in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction was used for the preconcentration and determination of selected pesticides, pharmaceutical and hormone by GC-MS. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to optimize the amounts of binary mixture, dispersive solvent and salt. The optimum parameters obtained were dichloromethane/1,2-dichloroethane binary mixture (200 mu L), ethanol (2.0 mL) and potassium nitrate (1.0 g). Analytical performance of each analyte was determined under the optimum conditions and the lowest and highest detection limits calculated were 0.43 and 5.9 ng/mL. Low relative standard deviations were obtained even in the lowest concentrations in linear calibration plots, signifying high precision for the sample preparation procedure and instrumental measurement. Accuracy of the developed method and applicability to real samples was tested on well, lake, hospital and municipal wastewater. The percent recoveries acquired at different spiked concentrations were satisfactory (89%-108%), validating the accuracy of the method for the quantification of the analytes in the selected matrices.

AB Sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic with the high potential for propagation of the antibiotic resistance genes in the environment which pose a serious health effect on human health. The present work deals with the treatment of sulfamethoxazole by employing photocatalytic degradation. TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles were used as catalysts. The morphology and structure of catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of various operating parameters such as catalyst dosage, pH value, initial pollutant concentration, and irradiation source on the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was investigated. It was found out that acidic medium is better for degradation of sulfamethoxazole and hence optimum pH value for UV/TiO2 and UV/WO3 were 4 and 3, respectively. The optimum dosage of TiO2 and WO3 was 500 and 750 mg/l that resulted in removal efficiency of 61.28% and 43.3%, respectively. The effect of initial concentration was also studied: increasing the sulfamethoxazole concentration from 25 to 100 mg/l caused a reduction in removal efficiency. Moreover, it was found that the highest activation of TiO2 was in the presence of UVC irradiation and WO3 in the presence of halogen lamps. Also, the removal of sulfamethoxazole from actual hospital wastewater was studied. The results indicated that photocatalytic degradation was still effective even if the removal efficiency was lowered. TOC analysis proved that although sulfamethoxazole was completely removed from the synthetic solution, secondary photostability pollutants were generated. The obtained results revealed that pseudo-first-order model best fitted experimental data at various irradiation sources considered.

AB BACKGROUNDThe enzymatic process in continuous flow reactors has become attractive owing to the merits of in-line purification, improved mixing and mass transfer, etc. However, the construction of continuous flow reactors requires stable and surface-active monolithic scaffolds for enzyme immobilization.
   RESULTSIn this study, nanofibers of linear polyethyleneimine (LPEI) are formed on the surface of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-treated cordierite honeycomb (named LPEI/PSS cordierite-H) as monolithic scaffold for enzyme immobilization. The controlled self-assembly of LPEI ensures the formation of nanofibers (diameters of 20-80 nm) on the surface of cordierite-H, which roughens the surface and offers many active sites for enzyme loading. The electrostatic interaction between negatively charged enzyme and positively charged LPEI helps the enzyme firmly attach on the surface. The loading capacity of LPEI/PSS cordierite-H was 1.24 mg g(-1). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-loaded LPEI/PSS cordierite-H (HRP@LPEI/PSS cordierite-H) exhibited activity recovery of 55.33%, 2-fold higher than that of HRP-loaded branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI)/PSS cordierite-H (HRP@BPEI/PSS cordierite-H) (23.72%). Furthermore, a silica layer was formed on the surface of HRP@LPEI/PSS cordierite-H through LPEI-induced silicification, which could prevent the enzyme from deactivation under extreme conditions.
   CONCLUSIONThese monolithic biocatalysts have great potential for applications in wastewater treatment and even in other fields such as pharmaceutical synthesis. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Water pollution with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is widespread in water bodies due to the low effectiveness of industrial and urban wastewater treatment systems. In recent decades, the implementation of vegetation-based wastewater treatment systems such as wetlands has been observed to help solve this issue. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the removal percentage attributable to plants and how plants affect this removal improvement. In this study, we monitored planted (Phragmites australis) and unplanted sand columns to assess the effect of vegetation on the attenuation of 5 well-known CECs (benzotriazole, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, bisphenol A, and diclofenac) and link it to the presence of different root exudates. The columns were operated in a continuous feeding mode for more than 6 months at 3 hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) (70, 140, and 280 mm d(-1)). We found that the presence of vegetation increased CEC attenuation from no effect to more than 200% compared to the unplanted columns. The highest effect was observed for carbamazepine (94-200%), followed by diclofenac (22-171%), benzotriazole (48-127%), and sulfamethoxazole (no effect to 43%), depending on the tested HLR. Furthermore, the greater CEC attenuation in planted columns was linked to the release of certain root exudates that may shape the root microbiome. We expect our assay to be a starting point for exploring the role of root exudates in enhancing CEC removal efficiency in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phenolic wastewater containing phenol and 4-chlorophenol pose a risk to the environment and to human health. Treating them using chemical-biological coupling method is challenging. In this study, manganese oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) were enriched in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) using synthetic phenol wastewater (800 mg L-1) to facilitate in situ production of biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) after 90 days of operation. Then, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) was added to the MBBR to simulate mixed phenolic wastewater. Comparing the MBBR (R1) without feeding Mn(II) and the MBBR with BioMnOx (R2) production, R2 exhibited robust phenol and 4-CP removal performance. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to determine the microbial community. Subsequently, a batch experiment demonstrated that partly purified BioMnOx does not exhibits a capacity for phenol removal, but can efficiently remove 4-CP. Interestingly, 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was found in the products of 4-CP degradation, which was the unique product of 4-CP degradation by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O). In both reactors, only catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O) activity from microbes can be detected, indicating that the existence of BioMnOx provide an alternative pathway in addition to microbe driven 4-CP degradation. Overall, MBBR based MnOB enrichment under high phenol concentration was achieved, and 4-CP/phenol removal can be accelerated by in situ-formed BioMnOx. Considering the C23O-like activity of BioMnOx, our results suggest a new coupling strategy that involves nanomaterials and a microbial consortium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A ranking system for monitoring-based process control was developed to select indicator compounds that can predict the attenuation of a broader range of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in reclaimed water by low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP)-UV advanced oxidation processes (AOP5). The selected TOrCs were classified into three groups depending on their relative reactivity to UV direct photolysis and center dot OH oxidation. Group 1 includes the photolabile TOrCs, which are easily photodegraded with no additional oxidants by either LP or MP-UV light and include acesulfame, diclofenac, and sulfamethoxazole. Group 2 consists of the moderate photodegradable compounds with high reactivity of center dot OH oxidation, which include benzotriazole, fluoxetine, and hydrochlorothiazide as indicator compounds for assessing LP-UV AOP and propranolol, diltiazem, and diphenhydramine for MP-UV AOP. Group 3 is photo-resistant TOrCs, but highly reactive with center dot OH radicals and includes carbamazepine and DEET as appropriate indicator compounds. Therefore, the proposed ranking system is expected to provide a comprehensive monitoring tool to water reuse utilities for prioritizing a list of indicators to assess the treatment efficacy of UV AOPs that allows for subsequent operational control to achieve the treatment goal. This is the first strategic framework and guidelines for building a customizable tool of process control that depend on the site-specific occurrence profile of wastewater effluents and the UV system (UV lamp spectral output and power density).

AB This study evaluates a novel adsorbent for ciprofloxacin (CPX) removal from water using a composite derived from municipal solid waste biochar (MSW-BC) and montmorillonite (MMT). The composite adsorbent and pristine materials were characterized using powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) before and after the adsorption. Batch experiments were conducted to study the mechanisms involved in the adsorption process. Ciprofloxacin sorption mechanisms were interpreted in terms of its pH-dependency and the distribution coefficients. The SEM images confirmed the successful binding of MMT onto the MSW-BC through flaky structure along with a porous morphology. Encapsulation of MMT onto MSW-BC was exhibited through changes in the basal spacing of MMT via PXRD analysis. Results from FTIR spectra indicated the presence of functional groups for both pristine materials and the composite that were involved in the adsorption reaction. The Hill isotherm model and pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models fitted the batch sorption data, which explained the surface heterogeneity of the composite and cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Changes made to the MSW-BC through the introduction of MMT, enhanced the active sites on the composite adsorbent, thereby improving its interaction with ionizable CPX molecules giving high sorption efficiency.

AB The removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) is really important to minimize the risk for human health and environment. In this study, the homogeneous advanced oxidation process (AOP) UV-C/free chlorine (UV-C/FC) was investigated at pilot scale in the degradation of a mixture of four CECs, in different water matrices and compared to a consolidated AOP, namely UV-C/H2O2. As matter of fact 90% degradation of CECs was observed after 15 min (O-UVC = 033 kJ L-1) by UV-C/FC (5 mg L-1 of FC) and 30 min (0.67 kJ L-1) by UV-C/H2O2 (5 mg L-1 of H2O2) in natural water. However, CECs degradation by UV-C/H2O2 and UV-C/FC was comparable (>82%) in wastewater samples, under the investigated conditions (60 min, 1.33 kJ L-1). The effect of sunlight/FC process on the target CECs was also investigated (in a compound parabolic collector based reactor). Interestingly, a different behaviour was observed between the two light sources. In particular, a total removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and imidacloprid (IMD) was observed for UV-C/FC process with 0.27 kJ L-1 and 10 mgL(-1) of FC, while, in the sunlight/FC process (same FC dose), CBZ total removal took place quite fast (0.50 kJ L-1), but 90% removal of IMD was observed only after 60 min (7.09 kJ L-1). In conclusion, UV-C/FC process can be an interesting solution for tertiary treatment of urban wastewater for the removal of CECs and sunlight/FC is worthy of further investigation to evaluate its possible application in small UWTPs.

AB Acetaminophen (ACT) is commonly used as a counter painkiller and nowadays, it is increasingly present in the natural water environment. Although its concentrations are usually at the ppt to ppm levels, ACT can transform into various intermediates depending on the environmental conditions. Due to the complexity of the ACT degradation products and the intermediates, it poses a major challenge for monitoring, detection and to propose adequate treatment technologies. The main objectives of this review study were to assess (i) the occurrences and toxicities, (2) the removal technologies and (3) the transformation pathways and intermediates of ACT in four environmental compartments namely wastewater, surface water, ground water, and soil/sediments. Based on the review, it was observed that the ACT concentrations in wastewater can reach up to several hundreds of ppb. Amongst the different countries, China and the USA showed the highest ACT concentration in wastewater (<= 300 mu g/L), with a very high detection frequency (81-100%). Concerning surface water, the ACT concentrations were found to be at the ppt level. Some regions in France, Spain, Germany, Korea, USA, and UK comply with the recommended ACT concentration for drinking water (71 ng/L). Notably, ACT can transform and degrade into various metabolites such as aromatic derivatives or organic acids. Some of them (e.g., hydroquinone and benzoquinone) are toxic to human and other life forms. Thus, in water and wastewater treatment plants, tertiary treatment systems such as advanced oxidation, membrane separation, and hybrid processes should be used to remove the toxic metabolites of ACT.

AB Biofilm reactors are a promising biotechnology to eliminate pharmaceuticals from wastewater during tertiary treatment or in water works for drinking water production. This study aimed at investigating the effects of pulsed carbon feeding for promoting the co-degradation of indigenous pharmaceuticals from pre-treated wastewater in a fixed-bed porous biofilm reactor (slow sand filter). The addition of acetate (carbon source) resulted in three different enhancement/limitation effects, which were compound dependent: 1) atenolol and iohexol experienced enhanced co-degradation followed by constant (acetate independent) degradation; 2) metoprolol, iomeprol, diclofenac, propranolol and sulfamethizole co-degradation dependent on aerobic turnover, but inhibited at higher acetate concentrations (60 -300 mg C/L); 3) sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed independently of oxygen and acetate concentration. Carbamazepine, ditriazoic acid, iopromide; tramadol and venlavaxine were not removed at any acetate dosage. Biofilm reactors can be employed for polishing treated wastewater, and the addition of a primary carbon source can enhance the performance of the bioreactor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The selection of a natural bacterial consortium from an activated sludge system and the verification of the capability of these organisms for hormone biodegradation are important to the wastewater treatment process. An enrichment aerobic reactor was seeded with activated sludge and synthetic wastewater with estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and hormones were used as the sole external carbon sources. From 16S rRNA sequencing analyses, the entire structure of the bacterial community and the bacterial genera present in the system were identified. The enrichment, obtained from the supply of hormones in the system, made it possible to obtain a bacterial consortium able to perform the degradation of hormones. Aerobic bacteria were highly capable of degrading the natural hormones (24 h); synthetic hormone was degraded by 84.5% (34 days), and bacteria were selected in the presence of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol. The authors suggest that Emticicia, Nubsella, and Sphingobacterium, bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum, were responsible for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol biodegradation. Emticicia was first reported as being supposed to be a hormone-degrading bacterium.

AB Removal of low-concentration (ng/L similar to mu g/L) antibiotics from water calls for the development of cost-effective treatment technologies. In this study, a novel moving-bed electrochemical membrane bioreactor (MEMBR) was developed for removing sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Results showed that the introduction of external electric field and carbon felt particles could efficiently eliminate SMX (removal efficiency of 88.9%). In contrast, the moving-bed membrane bioreactor (MMBR) took a long time to acclimate microorganism, reaching a removal efficiency of 43.9%. Transmembrane pressure increase rate was much lower in MEMBR (1.06 kPa/d) compared to MMBR (1.72 kPa/d). The presence of carriers increased the generation of reactive oxygen species, contributing to SMX removal. Microbial community analysis revealed that the introduction of electric field could increase microbial community richness/diversity and enrich the phyla of Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadete, potentially capable of mineralizing SMX. These results clearly demonstrated the potential of this novel MEMBR to be used for enhanced micropollutants removal from water/wastewater.

AB Background: Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) are even more important in bacterial resistance, even at low concentrations. The aim of this research was to synthesize CuFe2O4@methylcellulose (MC) as a new nano-photocatalyst for degradation of CIP from aqueous solution.
   Methods: The nano-photocatalyst (CuFe2O4@MC) was characterized by FESEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Powder XRD and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of pure-phase spinel ferrites. After CuFe2O4@MC characterization, the effective parameters in removal efficiency of CIP such as reaction time, initial antibiotic concentration, pH, photocatalyst loading, and degradation kinetic were investigated and conditions were optimized. Then, CIP degradation experiments were conducted on the real sample in the optimal conditions. The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined under optimum conditions.
   Results: The structural characterization of the magnetic nanobiocomposite showed that it is in nanoscale, ferromagnetic property, and thermal stability. The optimal conditions were obtained at pH = 7, irradiation time (90 minutes), photocatalyst loading (0.2 g), and initial concentration of CIP (3 mg/L). The removal efficiency of CIP in the optimal conditions was obtained as 80.74% and 72.87% from the synthetic and real samples, respectively. The removal of COD was obtained as 68.26% in this process. The evaluation of kinetic linear models showed that the photocatalytic degradation process was fitted by pseudo-first order kinetic model and Langmuir-Hinshelwood. CuFe2O4@MC photocatalyst had a good stability and reusability for the fourth runs.
   Conclusion: The photocatalytic degradation of CIP from aqueous media with CuFe2O4@MC photocatalyst has a high efficiency, which can be used in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters.

AB In this study, we report removal of Diclofenac (DCF) through heterogeneous Fenton process using Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst. The parent catalyst was prepared by hydrothermal technique. Fe species were introduced by wet impregnation. Characterization of the catalysts was carried out using XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, and acidimetric-alkalimetric titration. The bimetallic catalyst had the high crystallinity (81.2%), specific surface area (291.8 m(2) g(-1)) and uniform spherical morphology. Effect of pH, temperature, catalyst concentration, and H2O2 concentration on DCF removal efficiency was investigated. The results showed that the optimum conditions were reaction temperature of 25 degrees C, H2O2 concentration of 10 mM, pH level of 3, and catalyst concentration of 2 g l(-1) which resulted in the highest DCF removal (97%). No significant change was observed in the catalytic performance when it was applied in the sequence cycles at the optimum reaction conditions. The prepared catalyst showed the high potential for the treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater due to the high efficiency and stability.

AB The behavior of ibuprofen (IBU) during the startup phase of a microfiltration membrane bioreactor (MBR) was determined. A full-scale experimental installation treating real urban wastewater was used for the study. The MBR was composed of an anoxic and an aerobic bioreactors working in pre-denitrification configuration, followed of a membrane reactor. A full mass balance was carried out to estimate the contribution of biotransformation and sorption to biomass to the overall removal of the IBU. During the startup phase of the MBR system there were significant oscillations of the operational variables, mainly of the sludge retention time (SRT); nevertheless, the capacity of the system for IBU removal was very high, with yields of over 94%, despite reaching minimum SRT values of 4.15 d. The main IBU removal occurs in the aerobic reactor, both in the liquid phase and the one associated with the sludge, while in the anoxic bioreactor the removal was scarce, although a certain transfer of IBU from the liquid phase to the sludge took place under anoxic conditions. Despite the high IBU removal yields during startup, the SRT was the most influential variable in IBU removal, an effect observed in all bioreactors, particularly in the anoxic one.

AB Due to the abundant binding sites and high stability, a synthesized meso-MIL-53(Al) was selected as the backbone and used for immobilizing laccase (Lac-MIL-53(Al)) to catalytically degrade of TCS. XRD, BET and FTIR analyses proved that the carboxyl groups on PTA of meso-MIL-53(Al) could provide sufficient adsorption sites for physically immobilizing laccase through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Although the catalytic efficiency of V-max/K-m slightly decreased from 785 to 607 min(-1) due to the mass transfer limitation upon immobilized, Lac-MIL-53(Al) showed high activity recovery (93.8%) and stability. The conformational analysis indicated the laccase could partially enter into the MOF by conformational changes without impairing laccase, although the laccase molecular (6.5 nm x 5.5 nm x 4.5 nm) was larger than the mesopore sizes of the MOF (4 nm). The kinetics indicated that Lac-MIL-53(Al) could remove 99.24% of TCS within 120 min due to the synergy effect of the adsorption of meso-MIL-53(Al) and catalytic degradation of laccase. Meanwhile, Lac-MIL-53(Al) could remain approximately 60% of activity for up to 8 times reuse without desorption. The GC/MS and LC/MS/MS analyses further confirmed that TCS could be transformed to 2, 4-DCP by laccase via the breakage of the ether bond, or to passivated dimers, trimers and tetramers by the self-coupling and oxidization of the phenoxyl radicals, and finally removed by precipitation. In summary, enzyme-MOF composite might be a potential strategy to control the micropollutants in the wastewater.

AB A novel p-n heterostructure of an FeWO4/BiPO4 nanocomposite was designed and synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. Among all the nanocomposites prepared with different weight percentages of FeWO4, 30% FeWO4/BiPO4 (S3) showed the highest photocatalytic performance for the degradation of Rhodamine B and tetracycline under visible light irradiation. The degradation efficiency of RhB for the S3 sample was 87% under neutral conditions within 300 min but interestingly, at pH 3, 99% degradation efficiency was observed within 30 min with good recyclability. The enhanced photocatalytic performance should be due to the maximum electron-hole pair decoupling efficiency of the S3 catalyst. The mineralization of RhB during the catalytic process was detected by GC-MS. Consequently, based on the experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism over the FeWO4/BiPO4 composite was anticipated, which indicated the substantial potential of the composite for the treatment of textile and pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Multi-drug resistant microbes, pathogenic viruses, metals, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water has become the crux of urban sustainability issues. However, vulnerability due to pollutant concurrences, source apportionment, and identification of better faecal indicators needs to be better understood. The present study focuses on the vulnerability of urban Guwahati, the largest city in Northeastern India, through analyzing the concurrence of PPCPs, enteric viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, metal, and faecal contamination in water. The study strives to identify a relevant marker of anthropogenic pollution for the Indian scenario. Samples from the Brahmaputra River (n = 4), tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain; n = 3), and Ramsar recognized Lake (Dipor Bil; n = 1) indicate caffeine > acetaminophen > theophylline > carbamazepine > crotamiton for PPCPs and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) > aichi > hepatitis A > norovirus GII > norovirus GI for enteric viruses. PMMoV was the better indicator of faecal pollution due to its prevalence, specificity and ease of detection. Antibiotic resistance was neither correlated with the prevalence of PPCPs nor E. coli. As, Co and Mn appear to be inducing antibiotic resistance in E. coli. While the risk quotient of the urban drain (Bharalu River) indicates one order higher magnitude than reported for other Indian rivers, the Lake exhibited the least pollution and better resilience. The concurrence of pollutants and multi-drug resistant E. coli, owing to the complete absence of wastewater treatment, puts the city in a highly vulnerable state. Pollution is being regulated only by the dilution capability of the Brahmaputra River, which needs to be further researched for seasonal variation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are not efficiently removed in conventional wastewater treatments. In fact, different advanced oxidation process (AOPs), including ozone, peroxide, UV radiation, among others, are being investigated in the elimination of microcontaminants. Most of AOPs proved to be efficient on the degradation of antibiotics, but the mineralization is on the one hand not evaluated or on the other hand not high. At this work, the UV-based hybrid process, namely Photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation (PEO), was applied, aiming the mineralization of microcontaminants such as the antibiotics Amoxicillin (AMX), Norfloxacin (NOR) and Azithromycin (AZI). The influence of the individual contributions of electrochemical oxidation (EO) and the UV-base processes on the hybrid process (PEO) was analysed. Results showed that AMX and NOR presented higher mineralization rate under direct photolysis than AZI due to the high absorption of UV radiation. For the EO processes, a low mineralization was found for all antibiotics, what was associated to a mass-transport limitation related to the low concentration of contaminants (200??g/L). Besides that, an increase in mineralization was found, when heterogeneous photocatalysis and EO are compared, due to the influence of UV radiation, which overcomes the mass-transport limitations. Although the UV-based processes control the reaction pathway that leads to mineralization, the best results to mineralize the antibiotics were achieved by PEO hybrid process. This can be explained by the synergistic effect of the processes that constitute them. A higher mineralization was achieved, which is an important and useful finding to avoid the discharge of microcontaminants in the environment.

AB The widely used artificial sweetener acesulfame K has long been considered recalcitrant in biological wastewater treatment. Due to its persistence and mobility in the aquatic environment, acesulfame has been used as marker substance for wastewater input in surface water and groundwater. However, recent studies indicated that the potential to remove this xenobiotic compound is emerging in wastewater treatment plants worldwide, leading to decreasing mass loads in receiving waters despite unchanged human consumption patterns. Here we show evidence that acesulfame can be mineralized in a catabolic process and used as sole carbon source by bacterial pure strains isolated from activated sludge and identified as Bosea sp. and Chelatococcus sp. The strains mineralize 1 g/L acesulfame K within 8-9 days. We discuss the potential degradation pathway and how this novel catabolic trait confirms the "principle of microbial infallibility." Once the enzymes involved in acesulfame degradation and their genes are identified, it will be possible to survey diverse environments and trace back the evolutionary origin as well as the mechanisms of global distribution and establishment of such a new catabolic trait.

AB The concern for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in purified wastewater has grown in recent years. In this context, efficient and economically viable processes are required for their removal. In this study, adsorption was conducted to assess the removal of ibuprofen, caffeine, diazepam and acetaminophen, both as separated processes as in combination with a biological process in sequencing batch reactors. Removal efficiencies of these pharmaceutical active compounds were evaluated using two commercial activated carbons in granular and powder form and a discarded (after its use) activated carbon from a drinking water treatment plant. Concerning the biological treatment tests, simulated municipal wastewater was doped with 3 mg/L of each pharmaceutical active compounds. Results showed that caffeine, acetaminophen and ibuprofen achieved excellent removal percentages, even without powder activated carbon addition (more than 94%); By contrast, whereas diazepam removal was low (lower than 50%); however, it was improved up to 68% with the powder activated carbon addition to the sequencing batch reactors. Regarding adsorption tests as separated process, ibuprofen was the pharmaceutical active compounds with the lowest removal percentage (around 50% for the granular activated carbon) and diazepam (around 80% for the granular activated carbon) was the compound with the maximum removal efficiency for the tested concentrations (between 0.5 and 3 mg/L). Finally, results were very promising for the reused activated carbon since the removal efficiency of the pharmaceutical active compounds was higher than 90% (except for ibuprofen) when 0.5 g/L of reused activated carbon was applied in powder form to solutions of 3 mg/L of each pharmaceutical active compounds. In this way, a low cost activated carbon could be applied in wastewater treatment plants for pharmaceutical active compounds removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread occurrence of sulfonamides (SAs) in natural waters, wastewater, soil and sediment has raised increasing concerns about their potential risks to human health and ecological systems. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have become promising technologies to remove such contaminants in the environment. The present study systematically investigated the degradation of four selected SAs with different five-membered heterocyclic rings, namely, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfisoxazole (SIX), sulfathiazole (STZ), and sulfamethizole (SMT), by thermo-activated persulfate (PS) process, and the role of heterocyclic rings was assessed particularly. The results revealed that all the selected SAs could be degraded efficiently by thermo-activated PS process and their decay rates were appreciably increased with increasing temperature. For instance, degradation rates of STZ increased from 0.3 x 10(-3) to 19.5 x 10(-3) min(-1) as the temperature was increased from 30 to 60 degrees C. Under the same experimental conditions, the degradation rates of SAs followed the order of SIX > SMX approximate to STZ > SMT, which was in accordance with decay rates of their R-NH2 moieties. Kinetic results indicated that five-membered heterocyclic rings could serve as reactive moieties toward SO4 center dot- attack, which were confirmed by frontier electron density (FED) calculations. Based on the transformation products identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), five different oxidation pathways, including hydroxylation, aniline moiety oxidation, dimerization, sulfonamide bond cleavage, and heterocyclic ring oxidation/cleavage were proposed. Moreover, the degradation efficiency in real surface water (RSW) was found to be slightly slower than that in artificial surface water (ASW), suggesting that SR-AOPs could be an efficient approach for remediation of soil and water contaminated by these SAs.

AB Traditional swine manure treatments are not fully effective in the removal of veterinary drugs. Moreover, they are costly and entail a significant carbon footprint in many cases. Innovative biological approaches based on phototrophic microorganisms have recently emerged as promising alternatives to overcome those limitations. This work evaluated the removal of 19 veterinary drugs (i.e., 16 antibiotics, 1 analgesic, 1 anti-parasitic and 1 hormone) from piggery wastewater (PWW) in two open photobioreactors (PBR) operated with a consortium of microalgae-bacteria (AB-PBR) and purple photosynthetic bacteria (PPB-PBR). Multiple hydraulic retention times (HRT), in particular 11, 8 and 4 days, were tested during stage I, II and III, respectively. Ten out of 19 target compounds were detected with inlet drug concentrations ranging from 'non-detected' (n.d.) to almost 23,000 ng L-1 for the antibiotic oxytetracycline. Moreover, three of the antibiotics (i.e., enrofloxacin, sulfadiazine and oxytetracycline) were found at concentrations above the analytical linearity range in some or all of the samples under study. AB-PBR supported higher removal efficiencies (REs) than PPB-PBR, except for danofloxacin. Overall, REs progressively decreased when decreasing the HRT. The highest REs (>90%) were observed for doxy-cycline (95 +/- 3%) and oxytetracycline (93 +/- 3%) in AB-PBR during stage I. The other drugs, except sulfadimidine that was the most recalcitrant, showed REs above 70% during stage I in the same photobioreactor. In contrast, removal was observed for danofloxacin in AB-PBR during stage III, sulfadimidine in PPB-PBR during stage III or marbofloxacin in PPB-PBR during the entire experiment.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) have been detected at significant concentrations in various natural and artificial aquatic environments. In this study, electro membrane bioreactor (eMBR) technology was used to treat simulated municipal wastewater containing widely-used pharmaceuticals namely amoxicillin (AMX), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ). The effects of varying current density on the removal of PhACs (AMX, DCF and CBZ) and conventional pollutants (chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic substances, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) species) were examined. High COD and DOC removal efficiencies (similar to 100%) were obtained in all the experimental runs regardless of applied current density. In contrast, enhanced removal efficiencies for AMX, DCFand CBZ were achieved at high current densities. Membrane fouling rate in eMBR with respect to conventional MBR was reduced by 24, 44 and 45% at current densities of 0.3,0.5 and 1.15 mA/cm(2), respectively. The mechanism for pharmaceutical removal in this study proceeded by: (1) charge neutralization between negatively-charged pharmaceutical compounds and positive electro-generated aluminium coagulants to form larger particles and (2) size exclusion by membrane filtration.

AB This work aimed to investigate the possible effect of 2 quenchers commonly used in H2O2-based advanced oxi-dation technologies (AOTs), i.e. catalase and sodium sulphite (Na2SO3), on the analytical signal of 3 detectors coupled to liquid chromatography (LC): tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), fluorescence detection (LCFD) and LC-diode array detection (LC-DAD). The observation of analytical interferences fora group of compounds when studying the removal by continuous mode UV/H2O2 of 26 micropollutants (MPs) from a spiked surface water (SW), for which the residual H2O2 in the samples was quenched by Na2SO3, triggered the need of understanding these effects and thus catalase was used as comparative quencher. From the 26 MPs having a wide range of polarity and pKa, those monitored after electrospray ionization (ESI) under positive ionization (PI) mode and presenting a pKa higher than 5.9 revealed a great signal suppression, but only when using Na2SO3 as H2O2 quencher. In this sense, we further explored this effect by selecting 2 MPs, metoprolol and diclofenac, which had respectively signal suppression and no interference in the LC-MS/MS response. These MPs were analysed be-fore and after addition of H2O2 and catalase or Na2SO3 in reaction vials, using: (i) different detectors coupled to LC, namely LC-MS/MS with ESI under PI and negative ionization (NI) modes, LC-FD and LC-DAD; (ii) different en-vironmental matrices (SW, drinking water, wastewater) and ultrapure water; and (iii) different magnitude levels (0.1-10 mg L-1). The results demonstrated a remarkable signal suppression in LC-MS/MS analyses under P1 mode for those compounds with pic higher than 5.9, confirming the interfering effect of H2O2/Na2SO3. To the best of our knowledge, the analytical interference in the LC-MS/MS analysis, after adding Na2SO3 to quench H2O2 in AOTs experiments was never reported before and the results presented herein support the recommendation to use catalase instead of Na2SO3 as quencher in AOTs studies.

AB Aquatic organisms are continuously exposed to multiple environmental stressors working cumulatively to alter ecosystems. Wastewater-dominated environments are often riddled by a myriad of stressors, such as chemical and thermal stressors. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an environmentally relevant concentration of a commonly prescribed antidepressant, venlafaxine (VFX) [1.0 mu g/L], in addition to a 5 degrees C increase in water temperature on zebrafish metabolism. Fish were chronically exposed (21 days) to one of four conditions: (i) 0 mu g/L VFX at 27 degrees C; (ii) 1.0 mu g/L VFX at 27 degrees C; (iii) 0 mu g/L VFX at 32 degrees C; (iv) 1.0 mu g/L VFX at 32 degrees C. Following exposure, whole-body metabolism was assessed by routine metabolic rate (RMR) measurements, whereas tissue-specific metabolism was assessed by measuring the activities of major metabolic enzymes in addition to glucose levels in muscle. RMR was significantly higher in the multi-stressed group relative to Control. The combination of both stressors resulted in elevated pyruvate kinase activity and glucose levels, while lipid metabolism was depressed, as measured by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity. Citrate synthase activity increased with the onset of temperature, but only in the group treatment without VFX. Catalase activity was also elevated with the onset of the temperature stressor, however, that was not the case for the multi-stressed group, potentially indicating a deleterious effect of VFX on the anti-oxidant defense mechanism. The results of this study highlight the importance of multiple-stressor research, as it able to further bridge the gap between field and laboratory studies, as well as have the potential of yielding surprising results that may have not been predicted using a conventional single-stressor approach.

AB In this study, the performance of activated sludge derived granular activated carbon (SGAC) was investigated for ciprofloxacin (CPX) removal from synthetic and simulated wastewaters in a fixed-bed adsorption column operated in continuous mode. The adsorbent was synthesized using chemical activation using ZnCl2 as activating agent. Its surface area and pore volume were found comparable to that of the commercial granular activated carbon (CGAC). The maximum saturation adsorption capacities for CPX were similar to 16 mg/g and similar to 14 mg/g, respectively, with SGAC column under identical operating conditions (CPX concentration = 50 mg/L, bed height = 4 cm and wastewater flow rate = 1.5 mL/min) for synthetic and simulated wastewaters. The presence of other organics reduced CPX adsorption capacity of SGAC. The breakthrough curve data for both wastewaters could be adequately fit in Thomas and Yoon-Nelson kinetic models. The addition of H2O2 in wastewater showed no considerable improvement in CPX removal. However, H2O2 oxidation of spent adsorbent exhibited better results compared to thermal treatment for adsorbent regeneration. The results showed that sewage sludge can be recycled as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from wastewater.

AB Hospital wastewater contains acetaminophen (ACT) and nutrient, which need adequate removal and monitoring to prevent impact to environment and community. This study developed a pilot scale vertical flow constructed wetland (CW) to (1) remove high-dose ACT and pollutants in hospital wastewater and (2) identify the correlation of peroxidase enzyme extruded by Scirpus validus and pollutants removal efficiency. By that correlation, a low-cost method to monitor pollutants removal was drawn. Plants, such as Scirpus validus, generated peroxidase enzymes to alleviate pollutants' stress. Results showed that the CW removed 3.5 to 6 logs of initial concentration 10 mg ACT/L to a recommended level for drinking water. The CW eliminated COD, TKN and TP efficiently, meeting the wastewater discharged standards of Thailand and Vietnam. By various multivariable regression models, concentrations of ACT in CW effluent and enzymes in S. validus exhibited a significant correlation (p < 0.01, R-2 = 68.3%). These findings suggested that (i) vertical flow CW could remove high-dose ACT and nutrient and (ii) peroxidase enzymes generated in S. validus, such as soluble and covalent ones, could track ACT removal efficiency. This would help to reduce facilities and analytical cost of micro-pollutants.

AB Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, which may contain various contaminants including pharmaceuticals, is often used as a soil amendment. These contaminants may subsequently be taken up by plants. In the present study we examined uptake of select pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge applied to soils by spinach plants. Seven soils were amended with sewage sludge from two wastewater treatment plants (A and B). Concentrations of compounds in plant tissues (roots and leaves) of spinach planted 45 days in these soils under greenhouse conditions were evaluated after harvest. The largest bioaccumulation in the roots and leaves was observed for sertraline (bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of 3.3-37.9 and 1-13.4, respectively), tramadol (1.3-10.0 and 4.8-30.0), and carbamazepine (2.2-17.2 and 6.1-48.8) and its metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (not-quantified to 7.3 and 9.3-96.7). Elevated bioaccumulation in spinach roots was also identified for telmisartan (3.0-20.3) and miconazole (4.3-15.1), and leaves for metoprolol acid (not-quantified to 24.3). BAF values resulting from application of sludge B were similar to or moderately higher than BAFs from sludge A. The BAF values of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide in all tissues were negatively correlated with soil cation exchange capacity (CEC). This negative correlation between BAF and CEC was also observed for tramadol (A-roots and B-leaves), citalopram (B-roots), and telmisartan (B-roots) or between BAF and clay content for metoprolol acid (A-leaves and B-roots), tramadol (B-roots and A-leaves) and venlafaxine (B-roots). However, in the case of some other compounds (i.e. sertraline, amitriptyline, mirtazapine, metoprolol), uptake and the subsequent translocation and transformation from 3 soils of a higher pH and base cation saturation (Stagnic Chemozem Siltic, Haplic Chemozem and Greyic Phaeozem) significantly differed from 4 soils with a lower pH and base cation saturation (Haplic Luvisol, Haplic Cambisol, Dystric Cambisol and Arenosol Epieutric). Such observations proved strong compound dependent influences of soil conditions on various compounds bioaccumulations in plants and necessity of studying these processes always in diverse soils.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4/Douglas fir biochar composites (MBC) were prepared with a 29.2% wt. Fe3O4 loading and used to treat As(III)-contaminated water. Toxicity of As(III) (inorganic) is significantly greater than As(V) and more difficult to remove from water. Removal efficiency was optimized verses pH, contact time and initial concentration. Column sorption and regeneration were also studied. Adsorption kinetics data best fitted the pseudo second order model (R-2 > 0.99). Adsorption was analyzed with three isotherm models at 20, 25 and 40 degrees C. The Sips isotherm showed the best fit at 25 degrees C with a 5.49 mg/g adsorption capacity, which is comparable with other adsorbents. MBC gave faster kinetics (similar to 1-1.5 h) at pH 7 and ambient temperature than previous adsorbents. The Gibbs free energy (Delta G) of this spontaneous As(III) adsorption was - 35 kJ/mol and Delta H = 70 kJ/mol was endothermic. Experiments were performed on industrial and laboratory wastewater samples in the presence of other co-existing contaminants (pharmaceutical residues, heavy metals ions and oxi-anions). The composite reduced the arsenic concentrations below the WHO's safe limit of 0.2 mg/L for waste water discharge. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies found As(III) and less toxic As(V) on Fe3O4 surfaces indicating adsorbed (or adsorbing) As(III) oxidation occurred upon contact with O-2 and possibly dissolved Fe(III) or upon drying under oxic conditions. Under anoxic conditions magnetite to maghemite transformation drives the oxidation. A pH-dependent surface chemisorption mechanism was proposed governing adsorption aided by XPS studies vs pH.

AB The European Union (EU) approved in 2015 a Watch List of pollutants of emerging concern especially harmful for the aquatic environment (Decision 2015/495/EU). In this work, we explore the application of an inexpensive and environmentally-friendly catalytic system based on modified natural magnetite (Fe3O4-R400) and H2O2 for the removal of all the pharmaceuticals included in the EU Watch List (hormones: estrone, 17-beta-estradiol and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol; macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin; and the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory diclofenac). The experiments were carried out with a representative initial concentration of the drugs (1000 mu g L-1) at a circumneutral pH value (pH(0) = 5) within the temperature range of 17-50 degrees C. A low catalyst concentration (0.2 g L-1) was used while the applied amount of H2O2 corresponded to the stoichiometric one for the complete mineralization of the drugs (4-6 mg L-1). Operating under ambient-like conditions, total conversion of the target pollutants as well as the aromatic intermediates was achieved. Notably, total organic carbon was strongly reduced (> 50%), being the residual carbonaceous products short-chain organic acids. The applicability of the catalytic system was demonstrated using different real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents spiked with the mixture of pharmaceuticals. Apart from the complete removal of pharmaceuticals in relatively short reaction times (60-90 min), the disappearance of total coliforms was warranted. Remarkably, the catalyst showed a reasonable stability, with low iron leaching (< 0.7 mg L-1) and maintaining its magnetic properties almost unchanged.

AB Passive sampling is a well-established tool for monitoring time-weighted average concentrations of polar and semi-polar organic contaminants in streams at flow velocities between 0.1 and 0.4 m s(-1). However, its application under low-flow conditions (10(-5) to 0.01 ms(-1)) - as encountered in hyporheic zones has been scarcely reported.-In this study, 3 novel passive sampler configurations were developed for the monitoring of (semi-)polar organic pollutants and related transformation products across the water sediment interface and thus across varying hydrodynamic conditions. Their design was inspired by Chemcatcher and diffusive gradients in thin films for organics. To determine the most optimal sampler design, an uptake experiment was completed involving the 3 novel passive sampler configurations and a reference Chemcatcher in polar configuration. The experiments consisted of a circular flume that simulated the main channel of a stream and an aquarium with stagnant water that represented the underlying hyporheic zone. The systems were exposed to 192 organic pollutants at environmental concentrations, and the samplers were then collected, extracted and analyzed using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry after 2, 6 and 14 days. The configuration that was most insensitive to different hydrodynamic conditions consisted of a reversed-phase sulfonated styrenedivinylbenzene disk as the receiving phase that was covered by an agarose diffusion gel and topped with a polyethersulfone membrane filter. To further evaluate its environmental application, samplers were installed downstream of a sewage treatment plant located at an urban stream in Berlin, Germany (Erpe). The samplers were mounted on custom-made holders which were subsequently embedded in the stream bed to position samplers above (0.30 m) and within the sediment (-0.15/-0.30/-0.45 m) for 11 days. Target and suspect screening workflows were then applied to identify common concentration patterns and link parent attenuation to transformation product formation. A total of 104 concentration profiles were determined, suggesting the efficiency of the proposed sampling strategy in the water sediment interface. Valsartan acid was the only known transformation product indicative of hyporheic zone-driven attenuation as its concentration in porewater by far exceeded its concentration in surface water. Similar patterns were observed for a larger list of suspected transformation products, of which a sotalol transformation product was tentatively identified. Overall, the established sampling methodology can be effectively used to quantify organic contaminants during low-flow conditions and is suitable for the characterization of attenuation patterns of organic pollutants in hyporheic zones.

AB In this work, g-C3N4 thin layer @ CeO2 core-shell composite photocatalyst was synthesized by simple hydro thermal and in situ synthesis method for the first time, and it was combined with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to degrade the antibiotic doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) under visible light. A series of techniques were employed to characterize the as-synthesized materials. XRD patterns indicated that the samples were successfully synthesized. SEM and TEM images displayed the core-shell microstructure of the as-synthesized composite. The surface element composition and the valence states of the samples were characterized by XPS. The optical properties of the materials were determined by DRS and FTIR. The results of FTIR and XPS indicated that strong interactions between g-C3N4 and CeO2 had formed during the synthesis process. Photodegradation experiments showed that the addition of H2O2 can greatly enhance the photocatalytic degradation rate of DOX. Active species trapping experiments and ESR experiments demonstrated that superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and holes (O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and h(+)) played major roles in the photocatalytic process. Finally, a possible degradation mechanism was proposed. This work has synthesized a new core-shell structure system for g-C3N4 and CeO2 composite photocatalyst and provides a solution for the purification of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The study characterizes the anamorphic Bjerkandera adusta strain CCBAS 930, including growth conditions, physiological properties, and enzymatic activities related to basic metabolism and specific properties coupled with the fungal secondary metabolism. It was established that the fungus grows in a wide pH range (3.5-7.5), up to 3% of salt concentration and a temperature of 5-30 degrees C. Media rich in natural organic components (potato, maize extracts, whey) are optimal for biomass propagation. Minimal media, containing mineral salts and glucose as well as static growth conditions, are required to obtain idiophasic mycelium, equivalent to the secondary metabolism of the fungus. Of the 7 complex C, N, and energy sources tested, the strain did not utilize only fibrous cellulose. Lipolytic activity reached the highest values of the enzymatic activities corresponding to those capabilities. The specific properties of strain B. adusta CCBAS 930 determined by the production of HRP-like peroxidase were related to the decolorization and biodegradation of anthraquinone derivative daunomycin. The decolorization of 30% of daunomycin effluents occurred most rapidly in iso-osmotic medium and non-enriched with nitrogen, containing 0.25% glucose, pH = 5.0-6.0, and 25-30 degrees C. In agitated cultures, the strain decolorized solutions of daunomycin by biosorption, which coincided with the inhibition of aerial mycelium production and HRP-like biosynthesis. Based on knowledge, potential and real possibilities of using the strain in bioremediation of colored industrial sewage were discussed.

AB A large amount of pharmaceuticals are flushed to environment via sewage system. The compounds are persistent in environment and are very difficult to remove in drinking water treatment processes. Degradation of fluoxetine (FLU) and fluvoxamine (FLX) by ferrate(VI) were investigated. For the 10?mg/L of FLU and FLX, 35% and 50% of the compounds were degraded in the presence of 50?mg/L FeO42? within 10 minutes, respectively. After 10 minutes of the reaction, degradation of FLU and FLX is affected by formation of by-products which were likely more reactive with ferrate and competed in the reaction with FeO42?. In the case of FLU, the identified degradation by-products were hydrofluoxetine, N-methyl-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine, 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol and 1-{[(1R,S)-1-Phenyl-2-propen-1-yl]oxy}-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene. In the case of FLX, the degradation by-products were fluvoxamine acid and 5-methoxy-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pent-2-en-1-imine. The results of the ecotoxicological study based on protozoa Spirostomum ambiguum have shown that 50?mg/L FeO42? reduced toxicity of 10?mg/L of FLU and FLX by around 50%. However, in the case of FLX, the results of the ecotoxicological study suggested formation of slightly more toxic compound(s) than FLX during reaction with FeO42?. Application of ferrate(VI) is a viable option for drinking water treatment process; however, caution is needed due to formation of by-products with unknown human health risk.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) arc frequently detected in water and wastewater, and have attracted wide attention due to potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. In this work, manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge (Mn-AGS) was successfully cultivated and applied to remove OMPs from wastewater. Biogenic manganese (III,IV) oxides (bio-MnOx) were generated and accumulated to 22.0-28.3 mg Mn/g SS in the final sludge. Neither the addition of allochthonous manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB; Pseudomonas putida MnB1) nor the reduction in hydraulic retention time (HRT) facilitated the cultivation of Mn-AGS. Batch experiments of OMPs degradation indicated that Mn-AGS significantly improved (1.3-3.9 times) degradation rates of most OMPs. Removal rates of bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha ethinylestradiol (EE2), tetracycline (TC), and chloramphenicol (CAP) were 3.0-12.6 mu g/h/g SS by the traditional AGS and 8.0-16.3 mu g/h/g SS by Mn-AGS; those of imazethapyr (IM) were relatively high, 64.7 +/- 0.1 and 127.8 +/- 25 mu g/h/g SS by AGS and Mn-AGS, respectively. However, degradation of dichlorophenyl phosphine (DCPP) was slower by Mn-AGS than AGS, 9.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 21.2 +/- 0.9 mu g/h/g SS, possibly due to inhibition of microbial activity by bio-MnOx. This work provides a promising method for treating OMPs in organic wastewater, but the possible inhibition of microbes by bio-MnOx should be noted. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pretreatment technologies prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) have been developed with the aim of enhancing bio-gas productivity and reducing the presence of pathogens in digested sludge. Among them, thermal hydrolysis (TH) appears as the most promising one. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) sludge is the end point of many organic micropollutants (OMPs), which was proved to lead to important environmental and human risks since sludge is commonly used in agriculture. The objective of this work is to determine the fate OMPs in TH and subsequent AD. Sewage sludge was pretreated in a TH pilot plant at 170 degrees C for 20 min. Afterwards, two anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 14 L fed with fresh and pretreated sludge were operated in parallel in mesophilic conditions. TH proved to be an effective technology to partially or totally remove the dissolved fraction of OMPs as well as the fraction sorbed into those suspended solids that are solubilised after this pretreatment. However, it did not affect the OMPs sorbed concentration into solids that are not solubilised. Globally, the OMPs removal efficiency during TH appears to be linked to the solids solubilisation during this process. Afterwards, the OMPs biotransformation efficiency in AD of fresh and pretreated sludge was determined. Noticeable differences between the microbiome of both reactors was determined, but the anaerobic biotransformation was not substantially different for most of the OMPs. However, it affected musk fragrances, which presented considerably lower biotransformation efficiency in the reactor fed with pretreated sludge. Therefore, TH was proved effective in partially removing OMPs but not in enhancing their bioavailability and subsequent anaerobic biotransformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as an emerging class of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we conducted the first nationwide survey to understand the distribution and environmental risk of 72 PPCPs in surface waterways of Sri Lanka. Forty-one out of 72 targeted compounds were detected with total concentrations ranging between 5.49 and 993 ng/L in surface waterways in Sri Lanka. The highest level of PPCP contamination was detected in an ornamental fish farm. Sulfamethoxazole was found with the highest concentration (934 ng/L) followed by N,N-diethyl-meta-oluamide (202 ng/L) and clarithromydn (119 ng/L). Didofenac, mefenamic add, ibuprofen, trimethoprim, and erythromycin were detected ubiquitously throughout the country. Our data revealed that hospital and domestic wastewater, and aquaculture activities potentially contribute to the presence of PPCPs in Sri Lankan waterways. The calculated risk quotients indicated that several locations face medium to high ecological risk to aquatic organisms from ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, didofenac, mefenamic acid, tramadol, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tridocarban, and tridosan. The aforementioned compounds could affect aquatic organisms from different trophic levels like algae, crustacean and fish, and also influence the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. These findings emphasize that a wide variety of pharmaceuticals have become pervasive environmental contaminants in the country. This data will serve to expand the inventory of global PPCP pollution. Further monitoring of PPCPs is needed in Sri Lanka in order to identify PPCP point sources and to implement strategies for contaminant reduction in wastewater to protect the aquatic ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a topic of concern. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a wide-spread antiepileptic drug and due to its physical-chemical characteristics minimal removal is achieved in conventional water treatments, and thus has been suggested as a molecular marker of wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater. The present study reports the biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain Labrys portucalensis F11. When supplied as a sole carbon source, a 95.4% biotransformation of 42.69 mu M CBZ was achieved in 30 days. In co-metabolism with acetate, complete biotransformation was attained at a faster rate. Following a target approach, the detection and identification of 14 intermediary metabolites was achieved through UPLC-QIDF/MS/MS. Biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain is mostly based on oxidation, loss of -CHNO group and ketone formation reactions: a biotransformation pathway with two routes is proposed. The toxicity of untreated and treated CBZ solutions was assessed using Vibrio Fischeri and Lepidium sativum acute toxicity tests and Toxi-Chromo Test. The presence of CBZ and/or its degradations products in solution resulted in moderate toxic effect on Vibrio Fischen, whereas the other organisms were not affected. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report that proposes the metabolic degradation pathway of CBZ by a single bacterial strain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundWastewater treatment plants are known as major sources for the release of micropollutants and bacteria into surface waters. To reduce this contaminant and microbial input, new technologies for effluent treatment have become available. The present paper reports the chemical, microbiological, biochemical, and biological effects of upgrading a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a powdered activated carbon stage in the catchment area of the Schussen River, the largest German tributary of Lake Constance. Data were obtained prior to and after the upgrade between 2011 and 2017.ResultsAfter the upgrading, the release of antibiotic resistant and non-resistant bacteria, micropollutants, and their effect potentials was significantly lower in the effluent. In addition, in the Schussen River downstream of the wastewater treatment plant, reduced concentrations of micropollutants were accompanied by both a significantly improved health of fish and invertebrates, along with a better condition of the macrozoobenthic community.ConclusionsThe present study clearly provides evidence for the causality between a WWTP upgrade by powdered activated carbon and ecosystem improvement and demonstrates the promptness of positive ecological changes in response to such action. The outcome of this study urgently advocates an investment in further wastewater treatment as a basis for decreasing the release of micropollutants and both resistant and non-resistant bacteria into receiving water bodies and, as a consequence, to sustainably protect river ecosystem health and drinking water resources for mankind in the future.

AB The fluctuation of domestic wastewater characteristic inhibits the current conventional microbial-based treatment. The bioremediation fungi has received attention and reported to be an effective alternative to treat industrial wastewater. Similar efficient performance is envisaged for domestic wastewater whereby assessed performance of fungi for varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in domestic wastewater is crucial. Thus, the performance of pre-grown wild-Serbian Ganoderma lucidum mycelial pellets (GLMPs) was evaluated on four different synthetic domestic wastewaters under different conditions of initial pH (pH 4, 5, and 7) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to nitrogen (COD/N) ratio of 3.6:1, 7.1:1, 14.2:1, and 17.8:1 (C3.6N1, C7.1N1, C14.2N1, and C17.8N1). The COD/N ratios with a constant concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) were chosen on the basis of the urban domestic wastewater characteristics sampled at the inlet basin of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The parameters of pH, COD, and NH3-N were measured periodically during the experiment. The wild-Serbian GLMPs efficiently removed the pollutants from the synthetic sewage. The COD/N ratio of C17.8N1 wastewater had the best COD and NH3-N removal, as compared to the lower COD/N ratio, and the shortest treatment time was obtained in an acidic environment at pH 4. The highest percentage for COD and NH3-N removal achieved was 96.0% and 93.2%, respectively. The results proved that the mycelium of GLMP has high potential in treating domestic wastewater, particularly at high organic content as a naturally sustainable bioremediation system.

AB Catalytic oxygen (O-2) activation for oxidative removal of pollutants under ambient condition is important for pollution control. Herein, we report a hybrid of MnO catalyst confined in a porous carbon matrix on a graphite felt support (MnO@C/GF) for electro-activation of O-2 toward degradation of various pollutants at ambient condition. The electro-assisted catalytic wet air oxidation (ECWAO) process on anodic MnO@C/GF is able to completely mineralize dyes and typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Mechanistic studies indicate the oxidation of the organic pollutants in the ECWAO process involves chemisorption of O-2 on MnO, activation of the chemisorbed oxygen species via electro-oxidation reaction, and oxidation of organic pollutants by the activated chemisorbed oxygen species. The carbon matrix prevents MnO leaching during the ECWAO process, thus endowing the composite with excellent stability and reusability. The process demonstrates high efficiency, low energy input and environmental friendliness, exhibiting a great potential for practical wastewater treatment.

AB The prevalent presence of antibiotic compounds (e.g., chloramphenicol [CAP]) in wastewater and effluents without pretreatment can bring adverse impacts on human and animals; therefore, the remediation of these substrates is emergently essential. To synthesize the novel mesoporous carbon for chloramphenicol remediation, we pyrolyzed a species of copper-based metal-organic framework, namely Cu-3(BTC)(2) (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid), at 700 degrees C, characterized by several physical analytical techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement. The procedure to optimize the optimum conditions for the removal of CAP was conducted based on investigating three factors including concentration (1.6 -18.4 mg/L), adsorbent dosage (0.08-0.92 g/L), and pH (2.6-9.4). As a consequence, up to 87.6% of chloramphenicol could be removed from water under these conditions. Moreover, the effects of contact time (0-120 min) and concentration (10-40 mg/L), as well as other adsorption kinetic and isotherm models, were vigorously studied. With a relatively high surface area (78.8 m(2)/g), many functional groups on the surface (2.44 mmoL/g for acidic and base groups), and high maximum adsorption capacity (37.2 mg/g), the mesoporous carbon from Cu-3(BTC)(2) can be used as an efficient adsorbent for CAP removal from wastewater.

AB Postaeration, where digested sludge is introduced into aerobic conditions, is a technology that could improve the quality of sludge and sludge liquor in many ways. Although it is a fairly simple process, only few data about the effect of postaeration have been published. In this study, batch experiments have been performed first, indicating that postaeration affects the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and sludge dewaterability. In the removal of TAN, both stripping and biological oxidation can play an important role depending on specific condition. Then the postaeration was investigated in a semicontinuous batch reactor. In addition, the effect of postaeration on the concentration of selected micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, EOX and AOX was studied. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8, 6, 4 and 2 days and different aeration intensities were tested. The TAN removal efficiency achieved was about 40-60%, sludge dewaterability expressed by sludge cake total solids (TS) concentration after dewatering improved relatively by 5-30%. In addition, TS degradation is also taking place and therefore the reduction of the amount of final sludge to be disposed could be even higher. The biggest changes in observed parameters were recorded at the longest HRT.

AB In this study, forward osmosis (FO) membranes and fouling solutions were systematically characterized to elucidate the effects of organic fouling on the rejection of two pharmaceutically active compounds, namely, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine. Municipal wastewater resulted in a more severe flux decline compared to humic acid and sodium alginate fouling solutions. This result is consistent with the molecular weight distribution of these foulant solutions. Liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection analysis shows that municipal wastewater consists of mostly low molecular weight acids and neutrals, which produce a more compact cake layer on the membrane surface. By contrast, humic acid and sodium alginate consist of large molecular weight humic substances and biopolymers, respectively. The results also show that membrane fouling can significantly alter the membrane surface charge and hydrophobicity as well as the reverse salt flux. In particular, the reverse salt flux of a fouled membrane was significantly higher than that under clean conditions. Although the rejection of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine by FO membrane was high, a discernible impact of fouling on their rejection could still be observed. The results show that size exclusion is a major rejection mechanism of both sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine. However, they respond to membrane fouling differently. Membrane fouling results in an increase in sulfamethoxazole rejection while carbamazepine rejection decreases due to membrane fouling.

AB The occurrence and fate of five drugs of abuse in raw influent and treated effluent wastewater were investigated over a period of 1 year in the Adelaide region of South Australia. Four wastewater treatment plants were chosen for this study and monitored for five drugs which included cocaine in the form of its metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE), methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and two opioids (codeine and morphine) during the period April 2016 to February 2017. Alongside concentrations in raw sewage, the levels of drugs in the treated effluent were assessed and removal efficiencies were calculated. Drug concentrations were measured by mixed-mode solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Drug concentrations detected in the raw wastewater ranged from 7 to 6510 ng/L and < LOD to 4264 ng/L in treated effluent samples. Drug removal rates varied seasonally and spatially. The mass loads of drugs discharged into the environment were in descending order: codeine > methamphetamine > morphine > MDMA > BE. Results showed that all the targeted drugs were on average incompletely removed by wastewater treatment, with removal performance highest for morphine (94%) and lowest for MDMA (58%). A screening-level environmental risk assessment was subsequently performed for the drugs based on effluent wastewater concentrations. Based on calculated risk quotients, overall environmental risk for these compounds appears low, with codeine and methamphetamine likely to pose the greatest potential risk to receiving environments. Given the recognised limitations of current ecotoxicological models and risk assessment methods for these and other pharmaceutical drugs, the potential for environmental impacts associated with the continuous discharge of these compounds in wastewater effluents should not be overlooked.

AB Spatial correlation of pollution of the water resource in Taipei, Taiwan, were examined by analyzing the antibiotic resistance patterns (ARPs) of 96 Escherichia coli colonies, which were isolated from 7 sampling sites in 3 river sections. The ARPs were the growth patterns of isolated E. coli colonies in the medium with seven kinds of antibiotics, including ampicillin, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, tetracycline, and salinomycin of different concentrations. The results showed that the survival rate of E. coli decreased with increasing concentration of antibiotics; however, various ARPs under different antibiotics of different concentrations significantly increased both the useful information and complexities. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to analyze the spatial correlations and interrelations of distinct ARPs among sampling sites in this study. It was found that the seven sampling sites can be categorized into three groups which may represent three possible pollution characteristics.

AB Antibiotics are known to enter the environment, not only by human excretion but also through livestock/aquaculture, healthcare facilities, and pharmaceutical industry waste. Once in the environment, antibiotics have the ability to provide a selective pressure in microbial communities thus selecting for resistance. Bayou Lafourche of Southeastern Louisiana serves as the raw source of drinking water for 300,000 people in the region and has previously been shown to receive high amounts of fecal contamination. Four sites along the bayou and one site from its input source on the Mississippi River were monitored for water chemistry, total and fecal coliform estimates, and presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) for a period of 1 year. Four waste-associated bacterial isolates were tested for resistance to antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin). Resistant bacteria were further examined with PCR/electrophoresis to confirm the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (Sul1, tet(A), tet(W), tet(X), IMP, KPC, and OXA-48). The bayou appears to meet the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) criteria for water chemistry, yet fecal coliforms were consistently higher than LDEQ thresholds, thus indicating fecal contamination. Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed 13.6%, 10.9%, and 19.8% resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cefoxitin, respectively, and 11 isolates were confirmed for presence of either tet(A) or Sul1 resistance genes. High fecal coliforms and presence of ARB/ARG may both indicate a presence of anthropogenic or agricultural source of fecal contamination.

AB Water scarcity has greatly increased the need for research into alternative irrigation methods. Irrigation with treated wastewater (TW) is considered an important alternative in terms of reducing our dependence upon groundwater and freshwater. In this study, we examined the effects of irrigation with TW on the nutrient contents of two alfalfa cultivars and compared them with the nutrient contents of plants irrigated with well water (WW). The two cultivars (Alhassawy-a local cultivar and CUV101) were cultivated from 2013 to 2015 and sampled twice. For both cultivars and in both sampling periods, irrigation with TW significantly affected the macronutrient and micronutrient contents of alfalfa tissues. Plants irrigated with TW had higher K and Ca contents, but lower N, P, and Mg contents. No significant variation in S content was noted between plants irrigated with WW and TW. Furthermore, cultivar and cutting time had significant effects on nutrient contents, and these variables interacted with the effect of the water type used for irrigation. However, before TW can be regularly used in irrigation processes, further long-term studies are needed that consider the variations in water treatment efficiency and differences between cultivated sites in addition to the crop being irrigated with TW.

AB In the current study, the Fe2O3/biochar nanocomposite was synthesized through a self-assembly method, followed by the immobilization of Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) on its surface to produce the P. putida/Fe2O3/biochar magnetic innovative nanocomposite. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized using different techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Then, the efficiencies of this material to remove calconcarboxylic acid (CCA) organic dye, ammonium ions (NH4+), and phosphate ions (PO43-) from industrial wastewater were analyzed. The removal rates of up to 82%, 95%, and 85% were achieved for CCA dye, PO43-, NH4+, respectively, by the synthesized composite. Interestingly, even after 5 cycles of reuse, the prepared nanocomposite remains efficient in the removal of pollutants. Therefore, the P. putida/Fe3O4/biochar composite was found to be an actual talented nanocomposite for industrial wastewater bioremediation.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the different aquatic compartments is a major environmental issue. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a heterocyclic antiepileptic, which is neutral between pH 3 and 11, is known to resist biodegradation. Its elimination in wastewater treatment plants is below 20% regardless of the primary and/or secondary treatments currently implemented. Its presence in groundwater raises questions about soil permeability in relation to this molecule. In order to provide meaningful answers, the CBZ adsorption performances of the principal mineral constituents of a natural soil (alumina, quartz, goethite, haematite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and a saponin stevensite) and of an industrial activated carbon were assessed. Prior to the batch adsorption tests, the texture, mineralogy, and zero point of charge of these products were determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible spectrometry were used to characterize the CBZ used. With the exception of stevensite, these minerals did not adsorb CBZ. However, stevensite's affinity for CBZ remained very low compared to that of activated carbon (235 mg/g, tap water), which proved to be the most appropriate product for eliminating CBZ. The pi-pi, CH-pi, and hydrogen bonds are the basis for the interactions established between CBZ and activated carbon, and their combination increases the overall adsorption efficiency.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and biomass concentration (C-TSS) in activated sludge systems on removal of various micropollutants (MPs), covering a wide spectrum of biodegradability. The influence of biomass concentration on the classical pseudo-first-order rate constant was verified. Results showed that the removal rate constants were affected by both the HRT and SRT. The enhancement of the SRT increased the removal of all the MPs except for two macrolide antibiotics. Application of a higher HRT also improved MP removal, as was expected from the measured removal rate constants. More interesting, our results indicated that, logically, the increase of biomass concentration (expressed as total suspended solids C-TSS) from 3 to 5 g(TSS) L-1 significantly enhanced the removal rate of the highly and moderately degradable compounds. Conversely, a further increase to 8 g(TSS) L-1 produced only an unexpected moderate effect, showing that the rate was not proportional to biomass concentration, contrary to what is generally postulated. Therefore, the use of classical kinetic models is questionable, since they do not cover the entire range of boundary conditions in activated sludge systems. This work opens new research paths and suggests potential improvements to processes.

AB Traditional Chinese medicine residue (TCMR) is the solid substances remaining after the extraction of pharmaceutical ingredients from medicinal plant materials, which include abundant soil nutrients. However, TCMR is nearly lost as domestic garbage, which not only occupies a large amount of land but also leads to the waste of resource, as well as causing the eco-environment potential pollution. Therefore, we implemented this study to assess whether TCMR could be used as an organic fertilizer in agricultural practices for realizing waste resource utilization, improving soil fertility, and enhancing plant growth. The results showed that (1) application of TCMR could improve soil fertility, particularly in enhancing the soil contents of SOM, TN, NaOH-N, NaHCO3-P, and HNO3-K; (2) the higher application ratios of TCMR (0.8-1.0%) that increased the soil EC values would cause the risk of soil secondary salinization; (3) the lower application ratios of TCMR (0.2-0.6%) has a better positive effect on improved the maize seedlings' physiological parameters and photosynthetic performance than the higher application ratios; (4) although application of TCMR lead to the heavy metal (Cr, Pb, Cd, As, and Hg) content increased in soil, there was no ecology risk under below 0.8% application ratio, compared with the China soil risk control standards, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), and pollution load index (PLI). Thus, TCMR could potentially be used as an organic fertilizer in agricultural practices. This approach is an effective strategy not only for achieving TCMR disposal but also for realizing waste resource utilization, as well as for improving soil fertility and plant growth.

AB Most sulfonamides, widely used around the world, are excreted via feces and urine along with their metabolites in humans and animals. Therefore, understanding the potential removal pathway of sulfonamides and their metabolites in wastewater treatment systems is of importance. The occurrence and fate of four sulfonamides and their acetyl metabolites in wastewater and sludge in a biological aerated filter in Xiamen city were evaluated. Six of the target compounds were detected in wastewater, but only parent compounds were detected in sludge. The highest concentration in wastewater was acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (Ac-SMZ) with a concentration of 75.2 ng/L. Removal efficiency and mass load in wastewater treatment systems were calculated. In terms of the overall removal efficiency, they ranged from 24.4 to 100%. The removal efficiencies of sulfamerazine (SM1), sulfamethazine (SM2), and sulfadiazine (SD) were up to 100% while N-acetyl sulfamerazine (Ac-SM1) showed the lowest removal efficiency. Biodegradation was the dominant remove pathway according to the mass balance analysis while SD and SM2 were sludge adsorption. The results can provide an insight into the fate of target sulfonamides in BAF systems and provide data to assess their potential ecological risks.

AB Investigation during 11-month period was performed to study the presence of caffeine in the Lis River in Leiria Town in Portugal, and a monitoring during 9-month period was realized to check the contribution of the human pollution of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that discharge their effluents to the studied river. The samples were collected in five sampling points along the river and in two influents and two effluents of the studied WWTPs. Caffeine was detected in all ninety-one collected samples. The caffeine concentration ranged from 25.3 to 321 ng/L in the river samples, from 112 to 1927 ng/L in the WWTP effluents, and from 9478 to 83,901 ng/L in the WWTP influents. The highest concentration in the river was detected in the two sampling points located after the effluent discharge points and reached 315 and 321 ng/L. Risk assessment was performed for three trophic levels using the risk quotient calculation and revealed that caffeine do not cause toxic effect on Daphnia magna and on fish but could be possibly toxic to algae. The results proved that caffeine can be an effective indicator of human-born pollution.

AB Various types of micropollutants, e.g., pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms, are usually found in hospital wastewaters. The aim of this paper was to study the presence of 74 frequently used pharmaceuticals, legal and illegal drugs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 5 hospital wastewaters in Slovakia and Czechia and to compare the efficiency of several advanced oxidations processes (AOPs) for sanitation and treatment of such highly polluted wastewaters. The occurrence of micropollutants and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was investigated by in-line SPE-LC-MS/MS technique and cultivation on antibiotic and antibiotic-free selective diagnostic media, respectively. The highest maximum concentrations were found for cotinine (6700 ng/L), bisoprolol (5200 ng/L), metoprolol (2600 ng/L), tramadol (2400 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (1500 ng/L), and ranitidine (1400 ng/L). In the second part of the study, different advanced oxidation processes, modified Fenton reaction, ferrate(VI), and oxidation by boron-doped diamond electrode were tested in order to eliminate the abovementioned pollutants. Obtained results indicate that the modified Fenton reaction and application of boron-doped diamond electrode were able to eliminate almost the whole spectrum of selected micropollutants with efficiency higher than 90%. All studied methods achieved complete removal of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria present in hospital wastewaters.

AB The presented study summarizes laboratory tests results to define the inhibition effect of selected pharmaceuticals on biogas production under anaerobic digestion conditions. Two sets of inhibition tests were realized: (i) with real anaerobic sludge (from municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) where sludge is present and includes a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals over a long period) and (ii) with laboratory sludge (sludge without pharmaceuticals). Methanogenic tests lasting 20 days were performed with three analgesics (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and tramadol), two antibiotics (amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin), beta-blocker (atenolol), three psychoactive compounds (carbamazepine, caffeine, and cotinine), and a mixture of these compounds. All tests were performed with two concentrations of pharmaceuticals (10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L). Results of the methanogenic tests showed the different behaviors of the investigated sludges in the presence of individual pharmaceuticals. Stimulation of anaerobic digestion was mostly detected for laboratory (unadapted) sludge (e.g., the addition of ibuprofen at a concentration of 500 mu g/L increased biogas production by 61%). On the other hand, pharmaceuticals inhibited biogas production for real sludge (e.g., the addition of ciprofloxacin 500 mu g/L decreased biogas production by 52%).

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent used in many personal care and cleaning products. It has been detected in most environmental compartments and the main entry pathway is wastewater effluents and biosolids. TCS was analyzed in 300 samples of raw influent, final effluent, and biosolids from 13 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Canada representing five types of typical wastewater treatment systems. TCS was almost always detected in influent (median 1480 ng/L), effluent (median 107 ng/L), and biosolids (median 8000 ng/g dry weight) samples. Removals of TCS from lagoons as well as secondary and advanced treatment facilities were significantly higher than primary treatment facilities (p < 0.001). TCS removal was strongly correlated with organic nitrogen removal. TCS removals at most lagoons and plants that use biological treatment were higher during summer compared with winter. However, no seasonal or temperature effects were observed at the two primary facilities, likely due to the absence of biological activity. Aerobically digested solids contained the lowest levels (median 555 ng/g) while anaerobically digested primary solids contained the highest levels of TCS (median 22,700 ng/g). The results of this large comprehensive study demonstrate that TCS is consistently present in wastewater and biosolids at relatively high concentrations and that removal from wastewater and levels in biosolids are strongly influenced by the wastewater and solids treatment types.

AB De facto (or indirect) wastewater reuse is the practice of extracting from surface water bodies which are impacted by treated wastewater (TWW) for anthropogenic use. The extent to which surface water bodies in the Netherlands are impacted by TWW is poorly understood, and the distribution of de facto reuse even more so. This study addresses these knowledge gaps, with a focus on reuse for agricultural irrigation. This is achieved via a novel application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Explorer water quality model, allowing for the distribution of different flow components-namely TWW and flow from transboundary rivers-to be discerned for the national surface water network. When paired with data on surface water extractions for irrigation, this identifies notable areas of de facto reuse. Results show that during dry conditions, TWW is a significant flow component in many surface water bodies, particularly in smaller streams located close to WWTPs. De facto reuse is indicated as widespread, with several key areas identified in which extractions are from impacted surface water bodies. This study represents a first attempt to directly link TWW emissions to agricultural irrigation, highlighting a mechanism by which wastewater-associated contaminants can propagate through the hydrological system.

AB Magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNT) of different dimensions and different magnetiteto-carbon nanotube (Mag:CNT) ratios were prepared and characterized for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ketoprofen (KET), diclofenac sodium (DIC) and ibuprofen (IBU)) from water prior to their HPLC determination. The results revealed that the best mixing ratio of (Mag:CNT) was at (1:1) ratio; long CNT was better than short CNT; the best external diameter was 60-100 nm. This sorbent was labeled as L-MCNT60-100(nm)(1:1). The optimum MSPE-HPLC method was as follows: 150 mg of L-MCNT60-100(nm)(1:1) sorbent was added to 50 mL solution containing KET, DIC and IBU at pH 5. The solution was shaken for 30 min and the sorbent was separated from the solution using an external magnet. The adsorbed analytes were eluted using 5 mL of 10% ammonia in methanol and the eluent was then injected into HPLC instrument. Figures of merit were estimated to be as follows (KET, DIC and IBU, respectively): detection limits: 0.4, 0.5, 0.5 -g L-1; sensitivity: 3.13, 3.40, 1.46 L mg(-1) ; %RSD range: [2.6-7.2], [2.2-5.1], [2.7-6.4] %; bias range (%): [(-26.8)-(14.0)], [(7.4)-(17.0)], [(-8.4)-(17.8)]%. Application on tap water and pharmaceutical wastewater gave spiked recovery as follows: Tap water: KET: 103.7%(+/- 5.4); DIC: 110.3%(+/- 5.3); IBU: 70.1%(+/- 6.5); Pharmaceutical wastewater: KET: 58.8%(+/- 7.2); DIC: 48.9%(+/- 5.9); IBU: 100.5%(+/- 8.2). Adsorption studies were conducted to measure the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents where the effect of MCNT dimensions, magnetite loading and competitive adsorption were investigated.

AB The concentrations of three fragrance materials (OTNE, HHCB, and AHTN) and triclosan at the inlet and outlet of a wastewater treatment plant were measured, and the decrease of these targeted compounds during aeration process of activated sludge was investigated experimentally and compared with that in the plant. The ratios of the decreases in the aeration experiments were 24%-46% for 8 h and were compared with the estimated decrease ratio in the plant. From a mass balance comparison including the transference to the air phase with bubbling, OTNE in the mixed liquor appeared to be majorly volatilized with bubble while HHCB to be volatilized and/or removed with excess sludge withdrawal. The volatilization for AHTN and triclosan was on the other hand, low (AHTN) or scarce (triclosan). The decrease of them is probably owing the biological decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several series of batch and continuous experiments were performed to investigate the removal of metformin and other contaminants from two wastewaters: wastewater I (WWI) containing 4 mg/L metformin and wastewater II (WWII) containing 110 g/L butanol. Biomethane potential (BMP) tests on WWII showed 77% of total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD = 110 g/L) degradability, and no apparent inhibition effects were observed. BMP tests on WWI showed an apparent inhibitory effect reflected in lower biogas production with increasing metformin concentration in the wastewater. Continuous flow hybrid vertical anaerobic biofilm (HyVAB (R)) experiments were consistent with the batch test findings. It was necessary to co-digest WWI (metformin) with WWII (easily degradable organics) to achieve complete metformin removal. After a period of adaptation, WWI and WWII co-digestion achieved up to 98% tCOD removal and 100% metformin removal. Most of the contaminants were removed in the anaerobic section of the HyVAB (R), which implies that higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) loads than tested here are possible, given some optimization. The pilot reactor was able to manage organic loads of 11 g COD/d and above 10 mg/L metformin with a removal of 98% and 100% for tCOD and metformin, respectively.

AB We assess how different micropollutants and microplastics, connected to wastewater are introduced into the Baltic Sea. The relevance of untreated wastewater, treated wastewater, treated and untreated rain runoff, as well as combined sewer overflow (CSO), is assessed in respect to mass balance, as well as relative inflows of micropollutants and -plastics into the Baltic Sea. To achieve this, modelling based on data on exemplary sewer systems and measured micropollutant concentrations in the single sources were used. Most compounds reach the receiving Baltic Sea via treated wastewater. A few exceptions are compounds that are removed to a very high extent in wastewater treatment plants. For these compounds, the emissions with stormwater (e.g., terbutryn) or untreated wastewater (e.g., triclosan) are dominating. Additionally, compounds that are discharged with the water that is running off urban surfaces are introduced into marine areas via rain runoff. These data are used to forecast a total mass load and concentrations that can be expected in the Baltic Sea. Massloads are expected to be between 0.1 and 5.9 t/a for triclosan and TCPP (iris (2-chloropropyl) phosphate) and 0.2 t/a for microplastic particles. The expected concentrations in open Baltic Sea waters range from 0.01 to 26 ng/L.

AB This study describes a promising porous and efficient adsorbent, a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF-SO3H), for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water and wastewater. COF-SO3H was prepared through introducing sulfonic acid polar functionalities via a facile solvothermal synthesis method. Studies have shown that COF-SO3H has a strong affinity for the thirteen drugs investigated in this study, especially for diclofenac (DCF). The maximum adsorption capacity for DCF was 770 mg g(-1), which amounted to 9.3 times that of commercial AC, 1.5 times that of graphene oxide (GO), and 3 times that of 18% SO3-UiO-66. Further discoveries were that the adsorption isotherm data conformed well with the Langmuir model. It was also found that adsorption of DCF follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and thermodynamic values, Delta H < 0 and Delta G < 0, showed the exothermic nature and spontaneity of the adsorption process. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms observed in this experiment, such as pi-pi interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds, were also verified through various characterization methods. The cyclic regeneration of adsorbents and the effects of water quality constituents were estimated to assess performance in actual water/wastewater systems. Ultimately, the overall results of this study emphasized the suitability of the COF-SO3H adsorbent to remove micropollutants from real water and wastewater systems.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX), the active ingredient in well-known therapeutic drugs such as Prozac, is highly prescribed worldwide to treat affective disorders even among pregnant women and adolescents. Given that FLX readily crosses the placenta, a fetus from a treated pregnant woman is potentially at risk from unintended effects of the chemical. Moreover, FLX reaches aquatic ecosystems at biologically active levels through sewage release, so fish may also be inadvertently affected. We previously demonstrated that FLX exposure to environmentally- (Low FIX Lineage; LFL) and human- (High FIX Lineage; HFL) relevant concentrations during the first 6 days of life in zebrafish (ZF; Danio rerio) reduced cortisol levels in the adults (F-0), an effect that persisted across 3 consecutive unexposed generations (F-1 to F-3). Here, we show that the transcriptional profile of selected genes in the staroidogenesis pathway in the F o whole-larvae varied in magnitude and direction in both FIX lineages, despite the same attenuated cortisol phenotype induced by both concentrations. We also observed an up-regulation in the transcript levels of some steroidogenic-related genes and a down-regulation of a gene involved in the inactivation of cortisol in the F-3 HFL larvae. These findings on the transcript levels of the selected genes in the larvae from F-0 and F-3 suggest that specific coping mechanism(s) are activated in descendants to attempt to counteract the disruptive effects of FIX. Our data are cause for concern, given the increasing prescription rates of FIX and other antidepressants, and the potential long-term negative impacts on humans and aquatic organisms.

AB The pollution of surface and drinking water with pharmaceuticals is one of the growing problems. One of the groups used in large quantities involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which can be bought without a prescription This group includes naproxen, which was identified in wastewater, surface water and even drinking water all over the world. The aim of the study was to assess the opportunities for the removal of naproxen sodium from water using carbon sorbents. The measurements were carried out for three commercial microporous (WG-12 and F-300) and micro-mesoporous (ROW 08 Supra) activated carbons. The kinetics and statics of adsorption were studied. The adsorption from solutions with pH from 6 to 10 and temperature from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C was analysed. It was found that the higher the pH, the lower the adsorption and the higher the temperature, the greater the adsorption of naproxen sodium. The highest adsorption of naproxen sodium was obtained for the F-300 activated carbon, whereas the lowest - for the ROW 08 Supra activated carbon. It was found that the adsorption results depend on many factors, the most important of which include hydrogen bonds between carboxyl groups of naproxen sodium and phenolic groups on the surface of activated carbons and electrostatic repulsion between the anions of naproxen sodium and negatively charged the surface of the activated carbon. The results of adsorption kinetics were described with the following models: pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order, intraparticle diffusion, and Elovich. The highest values of correlation coefficient R-2 were obtained for the pseudo-second order and Elovich model. The results of adsorption statics were described using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin models. A good match between isotherms and the obtained results was obtained for the Freundlich and Temkin equations. It was found based on the adsorption intensity 1/n and distribution coefficient R-L that this process was beneficial for all the considered activated carbons and the investigated adsorption conditions.

AB Antibiotics used during animal production are the same or very similar to antibiotics used by humans. Tylosin, structurally similar to erythromycin prescribed to humans, is a common livestock antibiotic. Therefore, tylosin and other similar antibiotics present a potential threat of environmental buildup resulting in increased microbial resistance. To mitigate this potential impact, a remediation method for reducing the load of antimicrobials entering the environment is needed. The binding properties of different types of diatomaceous earth (DE) were investigated for maximum binding and the influencing physical characteristics to determine the potential use as a binding agent for wastewater treatment. Swimming pool DE was 99% crystalline silica and did not sorb any tylosin. Raw DE was 65% amorphous silica, 20% clay, and had 3% organic matter by weight. Langmuir isotherms predicted a maximum binding capacity of 49 +/- 3 mg g(-1) with a binding constant of 37,342 +/- 5653 M-1. This was almost 3.3 times more than previously published work investigating the binding of tylosin to kieselguhr that is 96% amorphous silica with little to no clays or organic matter present. To determine the role of organic matter and clays in binding capacity, raw DE was digested with 3% hydrogen peroxide and adsorption isotherms were constructed. After removal of the organic matter, predicted maximum binding of tylosin increased to 88 +/- 2 mg g(-1), whereas the binding constant slightly decreased (23,482 +/- 3264 M-1). It was concluded that the DE-clay matrix was responsible for high binding and therefore had the greatest potential for application in a wastewater treatment process.

AB Today, the unusual use of antibiotics and the entry of these compounds into the environment have caused global concern. The antibiotics even in low concentrations in the range of ng/L and mu g/L can cause effects in humans and animals due to their low degradability, high solubility and cumulative properties in water. This study was performed to removal of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles in a batch system. The effects of different parameters including pH (3-11) adsorbent dosage (0.2-2 g/L), contact time (2-120 min), initial concentration (10-100 mg/L) and temperature (283-318 K) on the adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles were investigated. The results of this study showed that the maximum adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles has occurred in pH = 7. By increasing the adsorbent dose, adsorption capacity has decreased. Also, with increasing Penicillin G concentration, the adsorption capacity was increased. The maximum adsorption capacity of silica nanoparticles was 211.35 mg/g (optimum conditions of pH = 7, adsorbent dose of 0.2 g/L, contact time of 60 min, Penicillin G concentration of 100 mg/L and temperature of 218 K). The results showed that the adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles was more consistent with Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.81). Also, the results of kinetic study showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic. The result of temperature and thermodynamics parameter showed that the values of Delta S degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta G degrees were positive, negative and negative respectively.

AB DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is one of the most frequently detected trace organic contaminants (TOrC) in wastewaters and is used primarily as an insect repellent. It was introduced for use in the general public in 1957. It is ubiquitously present in the environment and DEET concentrations are usually among the highest reported for TOrCs. Due to recent concerns about possible analytical interferences in detection methods being reported, this study focused on possible artifacts caused by seasonal, spatial, and diurnal variations in wastewater influent concentration of DEET. We also compared usage data to observed wastewater concentrations of seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in four different regions in the US monitored from November 2014 to November 2016. Consumption data obtained reveal patterns of consumption according to climatic regions and season. During the summer DEET usage accounts for almost 60% of all usage during a year, while during the winter months DEET usage accounts for< 5%. Concerning spatial distribution, while per capita consumption of DEET in Florida is three times higher than the one observed in Arizona (44 g vs 14 g), DEET concentrations in wastewater tend to be much higher in Arizona. Regardless of WWTPs or monitoring period, concentrations as high as 15,200 ng/L were observed during the month of October 2016. While DEET has a diurnal variation in the wastewater influent, with a maximum at 18:00, the diurnal variability is not enough to explain the great discrepancies between consumption of DEET versus occurrence in wastewaters. Although LC-MS/MS analysis of isobaric and structural mimics suggests some possibility of interferences, NMR spectroscopy analysis of environmental samples does not support the presence of such mimics in real samples.

AB The solid phase extraction method has been developed and applied for the simultaneous analysis of the five most commonly used triazine pesticides. The analysis was conducted using a liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector, which was first optimized to improve the limit of quantification and detection. The extraction parameters (conditioning solvent and sample volume) that affect the recovery of the analytes for solid phase extraction were optimized. The recoveries obtained were between 107 and 111%. The limit of detection ranged between 0.668 and 1.16 mu g/L and the limit of quantification ranged between 2.01 and 3.54 mu g/L. Good precision with a relative standard deviation of less than 8% in all compounds was achieved. The developed and validated method was then applied to river water, wastewater and sludge samples from around KwaZulu-Natal. The quantified concentrations ranged from 8.35 to 2820 mu g/L, 2.41-48.7 mu g/L and 3.20-65.0 mu g/L in sludge, wastewater, and river water respectively.

AB Micropollutants are a major concern for aquatic organisms and human health. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are an efficient wastewater treatment and water reuse solution, but their micropollutant removal performances are still not fully determined. Modeling micropollutant behavior in MBRs could help better understand and optimize the removal process. Here we provide detailed explanation on a model of micropollutant removal in MBRs that predicts biodegradation and sorption rates. Parameters were calibrated following an iterative two-step procedure developed in this work and using data from two full-scale plants. The calibrated set of parameters was then used (i) to determine the influence of MBR operating conditions such as the duration of aerobic time and the sludge concentration in bioreactor, on micropollutant removal, and (ii) to better understand micropollutant behavior and removal performances in MBRs in response to sudden changes in operating conditions (rain event, F:M ratio). These predictive simulations showed that increasing sludge concentration in bioreactor can decrease effluent concentrations of most of the micropollutants studied by up to 15%, and increasing the duration of aerobic time decreases effluent concentrations of few organic micropollutants tested by up to 15%. Rain events and F:M ratio can increase effluent concentrations of six out of nine micropollutants tested by more than 15%.

AB In this research, treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PhW) obtained from a factory by electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes was investigated. The effects of several parameters involving pH, current density, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW, UVA light, and time were studied. The experiments were designed by Design Expert software, and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum conditions for the highest COD removal. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), time was the most significant parameter on the process response (COD removal) followed by current density. The optimal conditions for 86.85% of COD removal through the EF process were at pH of 2.96, current density of 42.90 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 3.78, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.37 ml/L, and reaction time of 58.49 min, while the optimal conditions for 93.00% of COD removal through PEF process were at pH of 2.91, current density of 43.71 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 4.29, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.67 ml/L, UVA light of 6 W, and reaction time of 54.24 min. It was concluded that UVA light can increase the COD removal through PEF process around 7% more than that of the EF process at optimum conditions. Practitioner points
   Treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater by EF and PEF processes was investigated. Effects of several parameters were entirely studied on both the processes. RSM was applied to determine optimum conditions for the highest COD removal for both the processes. UVA light increased COD removal through PEF process (around 7%) at the optimum conditions.

AB In this study, an experimental design was used to optimize dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for the extraction/preconcentration of micropollutants that have endocrine disruption potential, for the determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analytes were selected from endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as pesticides, phthalates, hormones, alkyl phenols and pharmaceuticals. The most influential parameters of the extraction method determined in a pre-optimization step were included in the design model to determine their optimum amounts and to evaluate their interactions in a series of combinations. The design model predictor was used to obtain optimum experimental values, with which analytical performance of each analyte was determined with calibration plots. Deuterated bisphenol A (BPA D16) was added as an internal standard to all samples and calibration standards to improve the precision of the results. The limits of detection for analytes ranged between 0.10 and 16 mu g/L. The developed method was applied to synthetic and municipal wastewater samples, and the results obtained from spiked recovery tests ranged between 79 and 113%. These results confirmed the applicability of the method for the selected sample matrices. The complex nature of the samples tested in this study affected the recovery of analytes. However, matrix matching calibration was employed to overcome the matrix effects and this improved the recovery results.

AB This work compares the sonochemical degradation of losartan and valsartan (antihypertensives) in water. Initially, the suitable operational conditions of ultrasonic power density and frequency were established. Under such conditions, losartan was eliminated in a higher percentage than valsartan, which was associated to differences in their hydrophobicities. Additionally, degradations in presence of isopropanol and ferrous ions confirmed that losartan was closer to cavitation bubble than valsartan. The structures of primary products indicated that sonogenerated hydroxyl radical attacked biphenyl tetrazole moiety (common nucleus of both pharmaceuticals). Then, theoretical calculations were applied to the products to estimate the toxicity, degree of oxidation and probable routes of aerobic biodegradation suggesting a beneficial action of sonodegradation. Finally, the sonochemical degradation of the antihypertensives was carried out in two simulated complex matrices (i.e., seawater and hospital wastewater) and an actual wastewater. Interestingly, the losartan and valsartan eliminations in such waters were similar to the observed in distilled water. This fact indicates the high potentiality of ultrasound to degrade losartan or valsartan in waters containing other substances, even at higher concentrations than these pollutants.

Observations demonstrated the halo-tolerant capability of isolated strains up to around 3.2%. The influence of varying organic loading rates and TDS concentrations were evaluated on bioreactor efficiency and biokinetic coefficients. A COD removal of 77% was observed for organic loading rate of less than 2.7 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and TDS concentrations of 25,000 and 30,000 mg L-1. Growth yield (Y) varied from 0.178 to 0.129 mg VSS mg COD-1 in different TDS concentrations. Results indicated that the biokinetic coefficients were in the range close to typical ranges reported for similar industrial wastewaters, except that of the half saturation constant (K-s).

AB Recently the synthesis and application of bio-based composite materials, which contain polymeric and inorganic units such as TiO2, has gained much attention in the field of water/wastewater treatment, due to their better (and more practical) performance parameters. In the present study, recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been used and evaluated as supporting polymer for Aeroxide P25 TiO2 immobilization. PET-TiO2 composite films were synthesized at different TiO2 content (10%, 30% and 47% TiO2) and characterized with different techniques such as X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), etc. The photocatalytic activity of the new (synthesized) bio-based TiO2 composite films was investigated under simulated solar irradiation for the degradation of a mixture of antibiotic pharmaceuticals (Isoniazid, Metronizadole, Sulfadiazine, Sulfamethoxazole, Trimethoprim, Norfioxacin, Moxifloxacin and Lincomycin). The immobilization of TiO2 was successful in all cases and by increasing the photocatalyst concentration results in higher photocatalytic efficiencies. The new composite films were tested two times to assess their reusability, which found to be better for PET-10%-TiO2 composite films; therefore the latter has been used for further investigation thus exhibiting good stability even after five cycles. The results showed that PET-10%-TiO2 was efficient in degrading the antibiotic mixture in water and in wastewater matrix. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) is a serious concern in wastewater industry especially for public acceptance of reclaimed water. Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the ubiquitous and detectable plasticizers in municipal wastewater across the globe. Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) has prioritized it for the establishment of discharge regulations. A cost-effective strategy, especially for developing nations, may be the re-engineering of the existing biological process for the simultaneous removal of ECs and conventional pollutants. Wastewater treatment plants are one of the main sources for DEHP occurrence in surface water. In this study, possible role of activated sludge process operational parameters in effective removal of DEHP was assessed. Principal component analysis of occurrence data showed dissimilarity with the organic and nutrient characteristics of sewage. DEHP concentration in more than half (55%) of treated wastewater samples was more than environmental quality standard value for inland and surface water bodies (1.3 mu g/L). At a mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) concentration range of 3461-4972 mg/l, overall removal was 23.9 mu g/gMLSS.d (92 +/- 6%) with biodegraded portion as 22.4 mu g/gMLSS.d (85 +/- 4%) and sorbed portion of 1.5 mu g/gMLSS.d (7 +/- 4%). DEHP removal showed an increasing trend at higher oxygen uptake rates (OUR) of sludge with DEHP removal of 8.1 mu g DEHP/gMLSS.d (70 +/- 6%), in the OUR range of 20-28mgO(2)/L/h. Increase in overall removal of DEHP showed a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.7) with increasing sludge retention time (SRT) and so does the decreasing food to microorganism (F/M) ratio with increasing removal of DEHP (r(2) = 0.8). A temperature decrease of 13 degrees C caused a decrease of 30% in overall removal of DEHP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceutical products and pesticides are still present in treated wastewater. Several of these compounds are photoactive, either by direct or indirect photodegradation. An innovative on-site experimental protocol was designed to investigate the contribution of photodegradation processes to eliminate micropolluants in constructed wetland (CW). The solar photodegradation of 23 organic micropollutants was studied using in situ photoreactors at different depths. A CW-photodegradation model was designed and calibrated to further scrutinize the contribution of direct and indirect photodegradation processes in the elimination of micropollutants.
   The results show that photodegradation is most effective in the first 10 cm of the water column. A classification of micropollutants in 3 groups was developed to characterize their photodegradation. A significant increase of the half-life by direct photodegradation was observed in winter compared to summer due to a lower light intensity in winter. On the opposite, for direct + indirect photodegradation, no significant difference was observed between seasons. The decrease in light intensity in winter was compensated by higher nitrates concentration which promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals and increased indirect photodegradation.
   The CW-photodegradation model successfully simulated the measured concentrations for direct and indirect photodegradation for 23 micropolluants. Nonetheless, it overestimated the indirect photo degradation with hydroxyl radicals when using default parameter values derived for surface waters. Hence, the consumption of hydroxyl radicals was increased by a factor of 20 for treated water. This model highlighted the predominance of direct photodegradation in the elimination of all micropollutants, except sotalol for the winter campaign. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane fouling is considered as a main drawback for MBR technology especially treating industrial wastewater. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of fouling in membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater with the addition of ferric hydroxide. Two identical lab-scale MBRs, namely, a control MBR (Co-MBR) and an enhanced MBR dosed with ferric hydroxide (Fe-MBR), were operated in parallel. The results demonstrate membrane fouling was retarded by 35% with the addition of iron. Further exploration of membrane fouling mechanisms showed iron addition resulted in increase in biomass floc size, enhancement of bacteria activity and reduction of dissolved organic concentration, especially carbohydrate, biopolymer and low molecular weight compounds concentrations in mixed liquor. There was also lower abundance of bacterial associated with biofilm formation in the Fe-MBR compared with the Co-MBR. These findings collectively contributed to the positive impacts on membrane fouling mitigation.

AB The removal of fi-estradiol (E2) and alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) would need to be improved in order to comply with prospective Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) of 0.4 and 0.035 ng.L-1 respectively. The effluent concentration of a micropollutant in an activated sludge process is a function of the removal rate, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the flow pattern, which is usually overlooked. In order to better understand this aspect, we carried out tracer studies in eight WWTPs in the UK and found that relatively modest changes in aeration tanks would translate into tangible improvements in their flow pattern. We further evaluated the degradation rates for El (estrone), E2, E3 (estriol) and EE2 in each WWTP and we estimated that the modification of the flow pattern would be sufficient to place effluent concentrations of E2 (23.2 L.giA " d(-1)<kbio<210 L"gi,7s " d-1) far below the prospective EQS, while EE2 (0.3 L"gcts"d-1<kbia<2.9 L"gis"c1-1) would have to rely on river dilution for compliance. Regarding El and E3, with no prospective legislation, the modifications would place E3 (9.9 L"girils " id-1<kbio<39.5 L"gris"c1-1) effluent concentrations easily below its predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC = 60 ng.L-1) while for El, (2.6 L " gc,Is " d(-1)<kbio<19.2 L"Zis " c1-1) it would very much depend on the degradation rates of the specific WWTP (PNEC = 6 ng.1.-1). Improvement in flow pattern had the additional benefit of improving the effectiveness of other plausible changes in HRT or biological removal rates. Managing the flow pattern of existing WWTPs is a cost-efficient tool for managing the fate of estrogens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focused on the performance of an up-flow bio-electrochemical system (UBES) for treating the 3-lactams pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). UBES is added a bio-electrochemical system below the three-phase separator based on up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Comparisons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, accumulation of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and biogas production were investigated during the 316-day operation time, which was divided into five parts with HRT of 96 h, 72 h, 48 h, 36 h and 20 h, respectively. The average COD removal efficiency of UBES could reach 45.3 +/- 7.5%, 72.2 +/- 3.5%, 86.2 +/- 1.4%, 75.9 +/- 1.8% and 64.9 +/- 2.0%, which were 2.4%, 6.1%, 6.4%, 10.2%, 8.7% more than those of UASB under different HRTs, respectively. Biogas production as well as methane production of UBES were significantly higher than UASB during the whole changing HRT process, the maximum methane yield of UBES was 0.31 +/- 0.07 L/gCOD(removed). Accumulation of VFA in UBES was discovered to be lighter than UASB, the minimum average VFA in UBES was 131.9 +/- 18.5 mg/L, which was obtained at HRT of 48 h. These results proved that UBES can slow down the inhibition of VFA on methanogens to make sure a good performance on COD removal and biogas production than UASB. Moreover, the relationships between methane production and VFA, biogas production and COD consumption were analyzed. A cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of UBES in practical applications compared with UASB. Finally, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was developed and fitted well with the experimental data, which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of the UBES and UASB.

AB An immobilized photoactive TiO2 coating grown directly on titanium meshes was successfully exploited for the electrochemical photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in real secondary wastewater effluent. The catalyst was prepared by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation and during the photocatalytic water treatment an electrical polarization (bias) was applied to the catalyst. The investigated process was compared with the conventional one employing suspended TiO2 powder (Degussa P25). Results showed that carbamazepine degradation rate follows the order UV/supported TiO2+bias approximate to UV/TiO2 Degussa P25 > UV/supported TiO2 > UV. The investigation also included the identification of other micropollutants and degradation products. This allowed the detection of 201 compounds present in the secondary wastewater effluent employed for the photocatalysis tests, 51 of them also successfully associated to compounds of emerging concern (CECs), and 194 to transformation products (TPs). The degradation of detected compounds followed first-order kinetics and the mean kinetic constant values of the 51 CECs resulted to be 0.048, 0.035 and 0.043 min(-1) for the TiO2+Bias + UV, TiO2+UV and UV, respectively. As for TPs, results showed that the TiO2+Bias + UV treatment is much more efficient than both TiO2+UV and UV in minimizing the intensity of the organics in the real wastewater. Such a better performance was more pronounced at higher reaction time reaching 60% reduction of mean peak area of TPs at 90 min of reaction. Among the detected TPs also compounds belonging to known carbamazepine TPs were found. This allowed to propose a degradation pathway of carbamazepine. The supported catalyst was positively tested for 15 cycles demonstrating that it has the potential to be used in real wastewater tertiary steps aimed at removing CECs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2) as an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to attenuate five widespread PhACs (carbamazepine (CBZ), primidone (PMD), phenobarbital (PBB), thiamphenicol (TAP) and florfenicol (FF)) was investigated in this paper. The degradation of these compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (R-2>0.96). The optimum CaO2 dosage was 0.1 g L-1 and lower initial contaminants concentration was beneficial to their degradation. The UV/CaO2 treatment of test PhACs was attributed to the combination of UV/H2O2 and UV-base-photolysis (UV/Ca(OH)(2)), and the degradation mechanism was recognized as both UV direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by reactive radicals (center dot OH, triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*), and O-1(2)). Furthermore, the tentative transformation pathways of the five PhACs were proposed based on the detected intermediates and the degradation mechanisms. The final products of inorganic carbon and nitrogen indicate UV/CaO2 treatment can significantly mineralize test PhACs. Also, the CaO2 addition significantly reduced the energy consumption of UV irradiation according to electrical energy per order. The effective removal of CBZ and PMD in a secondary wastewater effluent by UV/CaO2 treatment demonstrates the potential use of this AOP technology in advanced treatment of wastewater-derived PhACs.

AB This study compared the degradation efficiency of diatrizoate (DTA) by UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes. DTA could be effectively degraded by the UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes compared with chlorination and chloramination solely. Although the UV/chlorine process was more sensitive to the variations of oxidant dosages, solution pH, the concentration of bicarbonate and chloride, UV/chlorine degraded DTA more efficiently than UV/chloramine process. The reactive chlorine species (RCS) and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) are predominant contributors to DTA degradation in the UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes respectively, and the specific contribution of each reactive specie changed with solution pH. The performance of UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes on DTA degradation was obviously inhibited in natural waters (e.g., wastewater, rainwater, river water and tap water), however, degradation of DTA in the UV/chlorine are still satisfactory compared with UV/chloramine process. Formation of chloroform, dichloroacetonitrile, and iodoform (IF) from DTA was observed in both UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes. It is notable that formation potential of IF from DTA was significantly enhanced in UV/chloramine process, and thus the overall cytotoxicity of generated DBPs in UV/chloramine process is far greater than that in UV/chlorine process.

AB The quality of both surface waters (SW) and groundwater (GW) can be affected by anthropogenic activities and by faecal pollution sources from humans and animals. This study investigated the concentration of a group of chemical markers for tracking anthropogenic pollution in the Vega de Granada aquifer (VGA). A group of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, pantoprazole and caffeine, trace elements (TEs) and other potential marker species of anthropogenic pollution were selected. The parameter values (PV) for these contaminants in many of the samples exceeded it the guideline values. We also analysed some vegetables (VEG) grown in the area. The most alarming finding was that amoxicillin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and caffeine were detected in all the samples. Geostatistical methods were used to map the spatial distribution of the estimated PC scores for each principal component extracted (PCi). All the markers selected, including the CECs, appeared in different sectors of the aquifer. By analysing the results for the different parameters, it was possible to clearly define the areas affected by anthropic activities (urban and agricultural) and distinguish them from other areas with a water quality that is almost natural and is less influenced by human activity. This is a first attempt to map a group of CECs and TECs that can be hazardous to human health and the environment.

AB Metformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical product mostly biotransformed in the environment to a transformation product, guanylurea (GUA). In ready biodegradability tests (RBTs), however, contrasting results have been observed for metformin. The objective of this study was to measure the biodegradation of MET and GUA in RBTs, using activated sludge from the local wastewater treatment plant, either directly or after pre-exposure to MET, in a chemostat. The activated sludge community was cultivated in chemostats, in presence or absence of MET, for a period of nine months, and was used in RBT after one, three and nine months. The results of this study showed that the original activated sludge was able to completely remove MET (15 mg/l) and the newly produced GUA (50% of C-OMET) under the test conditions. Inoculation of the chemostat led to a rapid shift in the community composition and abundance. The community exposed to 1.5 mg/l of MET was still able to completely consume MET in the RBTs after one-month exposure, but three- and nine-months exposure resulted in reduced removal of MET in the RBTs. The ability of the activated sludge community to degrade MET and GUA is the result of environmental exposure to these chemicals as well as of conditions that could not be reproduced in the laboratory system. A MET-degrading strain belonging to the genus Aminobacter has been isolated from the chemostat community. This strain was able to completely consume 15 mg/l of MET within three days in the test. However, community analysis revealed that the fluctuation in relative abundance of this genus (< 1%) could not be correlated to the fluctuation in biodegradation capacity of the chemostat community.

AB Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae provides a very promising alternative for producing carbohydrate-rich biomass to convert into bioethanol and value-added biocompounds, such as vitamins, pigments, proteins, lipids and antioxidant compounds. Spirulina platensis may present high yields of biomass and carbohydrates when it is grown under mixotrophic conditions using cheese whey. However, there are no previous studies evaluating the influence of this culture system on the profile of fatty acids or antioxidant compounds of this species, which are extremely important for food and pharmaceutical applications and would add value to the cultivation process. S. platensis presented higher specific growth rates, biomass productivity and carbohydrate content under mixotrophic conditions; however, the antioxidant capacity and the protein and lipid content were lower than that of the autotrophic culture. The maximum biomass yield was 2.98 +/- 0.07 g/L in growth medium with 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentration was the same for the biomass obtained under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with 2.5% and 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentrations showed no significant differences except for that in the growth medium with 10.0% whey, which presented an average value of 22.37 +/- 0.14 mg gallic acid/g. Mixotrophic cultivation of S. platensis using whey can be considered a viable alternative to reduce the costs of producing S. platensis biomass and carbohydrates, shorten cultivation time and produce carbohydrates, as it does not require adding expensive chemical nutrients to the growth medium and also takes advantage of cheese whey, an adverse dairy industry byproduct.

AB Wastewater is a potential treasure trove of chemicals that reflects population behavior and health status. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been employed to determine population-scale consumption of chemicals, particularly illicit drugs, across different communities and over time. However, the sociodemographic or socioeconomic correlates of chemical consumption and exposure are unclear. This study explores the relationships between catchment specific sociodemographic parameters and biomarkers in wastewater generated by the respective catchments. Domestic wastewater influent samples taken during the 2016 Australian census week were analyzed for a range of diet, drug, pharmaceutical, and lifestyle biomarkers. We present both linear and rank-order (i.e., Pearson and Spearman) correlations between loads of 42 biomarkers and census-derived metrics, index of relative socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage (IRSAD), median age, and 40 socioeconomic index for area (SEIFA) descriptors. Biomarkers of caffeine, citrus, and dietary fiber consumption had strong positive correlations with IRSAD, while tramadol, atenolol, and pregabalin had strong negative correlation with IRSAD. As expected, atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide correlated positively with median age. We also found specific SEIFA descriptors such as occupation and educational attainment correlating with each biomarker. Our study demonstrates that wastewater-based epidemiology can be used to study sociodemographic influences and disparities in chemical consumption.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW) has become a prevailing agricultural practice due to the scarcity of fresh water resources, which may have a significant impact on the microbial communities that are critical to many biogeochemical processes in soils. However, it is unclear whether there are links between soil microbial responses to long-term irrigation with different sources of wastewater and soil depth. Here we assess the influence of treated domestic (DTWW), leather industry (LTWW) and pharmaceutical (PTWW) wastewater on microbial communities in vertical soil profiles using high-throughput sequencing based on 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene profiling. We found that microbial alpha-diversity in the vertical profiles of soils was significantly influenced by TWW irrigation. Bacteria and fungi in different soil depths showed distinct responses to TWW; irrigation with TWW markedly increased abundance of bacterial OTUs and inhibited abundance of fungal OTUs. beta-diversity analysis showed that the effect of TWW irrigation on microbial communities was greater than the effect of soil depth, and microbes in subsurface soil were more sensitive to different sources of irrigation water. We also found that, based on beta-diversity analysis, irrigation with treated industrial wastewater, including LTWW and PTWW, had a greater impact on microbial community structures than DTWW. TWW irrigation significantly affected the composition of indigenous soil microbial communities at different depths and might introduce exogenous microbes into the soil environment. Our work explicitly demonstrates the vertical responses of bacterial and fungal communities in soils to irrigation with TWW from different sources, which can provides insights into the microbial-dominated geochemical processes from the perspective of the entire soil profile under the context of wastewater irrigation.

AB According to International Diabetes Federation estimates, China has the highest rate of diabetes in the world. To monitor the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in near real-time, a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, was used. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was applied to estimate the consumption of metformin in Dalian from 2015 to 2018. Quantification of metformin was undertaken using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and N-methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) derivatization prior to GC-MS analysis. The concentrations of metformin in eleven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) ranged from 1.7 mu g/L to 239.0 mu g/L, with an average value of 68.3 mu g/L. For metformin consumption, there was a gradual increase from 12.1 mg/d/capita in 2015 to 28.4 mg/d/capita in 2018. Meanwhile, the prevalence of metformin in the Dalian population ranged from 1.6% in 2015 to 3.8% in 2018. Similarly, the prevalence of DM showed an increasing trend from 12.2% in 2015 to 21.6% in 2018, which is consistent with the data predicted by traditional surveys (15.2-19.8%). Additionally, the prevalence of DM in 2015 estimated based on WBE was 12.2%, which agreed with the results from the traditional survey (12.3%). These results indicated that the proposed method provided a feasible way to reveal the prevalence of DM through metformin monitoring by the WBE approach. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Ferric-nitrilotriacetate complex (Fe-III-NTA) has been adopted to catalyze the photo-Fenton degradation of emerging pharmaceutical micropollutants in water and wastewater at neutral pH. The generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) in UVA/Fe-III-NTA/H2O2 was identified by using electron spin resonance (ESR) trapping technique. The effects of critical parameters (e.g., NTA:Fe-III molar ratio, Fe-III-NTA and H2O2 dosages) on the steady-state HO center dot concentrations were studied in terms of the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ, as a model compound) in Milli-Q water. In addition, the degradation of pharmaceuticals mixtures (induding CBZ crotamiton (CRMF) and ibuprofen (IBP)) in wastewater effluents from a biological aerated filter (BAF) by UVA/Fe-III-NTA-NTA/H2O2 was studied in continuous-flow mode. The results showed that the efficacies of Fe-III-NTA in catalyzing photo-Fenton degradation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents were comparable to those obtained by Fe-III-ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (Fe-III-EDDS), and far exceeded other Fe-III-L complex (e.g.,citric acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid and tartaric acid). More than 92% degradation efficiencies of CBZ, CRMT and IBP were obtained in continuous-flow mode under the given conditions of 0.178 mM Fe-III-NTA (1:1), 4.54 mM H2O2, UVA intensity 4.05 mW cm(-2), hydraulic retention time (HRT) 2 h, influent pH 7.6 (+/- 0.2) and temperature 20 degrees C. The results presented herein suggest that Fe-III-NTA-catalyzed neutral photo-Fenton reaction can be an alternative tertiary process for the treatment of pharmaceutical micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluents.

AB Due to the lack of wastewater treatment facility in Pakistan, the wastewater is directly discharged via urban drains, which might cause a high load of contaminants of emerging concerns and potential environmental risks. The present study focused on the occurrence and risk assessment of 52 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) of diversified classes in the water and sediment samples of urban drains and canal of Lahore, Pakistan. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the predominant PPCPs detected in the wastewater of urban drains and surface water of canal. The highest concentration was observed for acetaminophen, with median concentration of 13,880 ng/L followed by caffeine with median concentration of 6200 ng/L. Antibiotics were the predominant PPM in the sediment samples with highest concentration of ofloxacin (median value of 1980 mu g/kg) followed by ciprofloxacin and oxytetracycline. Spatial variation showed that the population density has significant correlation with the level of many PPCPs in surface water while one of the drainage systems is affected by the direct wastewater discharge from the nearby industrial arca. Ecological risk assessment in terms of risk quotient revealed that most of the PPCPs may cause high risk to the aquatic community. This high risk may lead to further contamination of food and crops. therefore enforcement of environmental legislations for treatment of wastewater is recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Agriculture production in California is negatively impacted by soilborne fungi, such as Verticillium dahliae, and limited water availability for irrigation. Some regions have adapted the use of recycling wastewater, i.e., reclaimed water, to supplement the potable water supply. Wastewater purification is not fully efficient at removing all contaminants and small amounts of pharmaceutical products, known as chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), remain. Acetaminophen, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and gemfibrozil are some of the most common CECs found in treated wastewater and were therefore used in this study. These CECs were evaluated for their potential to interact with microorganisms directly, or for their ability to alter the development of Verticillium wilt disease in eggplants. The microorganisms Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Piriformospora indica, Phytopthora capsici, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum were used for in vitro growth assays in the presence of CECs. CECs induced varying responses in strains of the same fungi by promoting growth of one strain while inhibiting growth of the other. CECs influenced spore germination of V. dahliae and F. oxysporum. Greenhouse experiments in which Solanum melongena (eggplants) were inoculated with V. dahliae and irrigated with CECs were used to evaluate the impacts of these chemicals on disease development. Overall our results found that most of the organisms we tested were sensitive to the CECs. P. capsici was found to be the most sensitive microorganism, while B. japonicum growth was unaffected by the CECs at the concentrations used. The greenhouse assays results indicated that plant disease severity may be influenced by given CECs at certain stages of plant growth. Overall the results of this study indicate that the concentrations of CECs found in reclaimed water are occurring at biologically relevant concentrations.

AB This study investigated, for the first time, the distribution and fate of 28 multiple-class veterinary pharmaceuticals and antibiotics (PhACs), and their corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), in a full-scale on-farm livestock waste treatment plant. The plant relies on several technologies, including: anaerobic digestion (AD), solid-liquid separation, and two stages reverse osmosis (RO) of the liquid digestate. Tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, lincosamide and pleuromutilin antibiotics, together with anti-helmintic (flubendazole) and anti-inflammatory (flunixin) drugs were the most frequently detected compounds in livestock waste and in slaughterhouse sludge. This last fraction is used as co-substrate in the AD process and showed to be an important input source of PhACs and ARGs. In terms of treatment performance, AD exhibited moderate to low PhACs and ARGs reduction, while a large fraction (<50%) of the PhACs present in the digestate were distributed onto the solid fraction, after solid-liquid separation. Both solid and liquid digestates had relatively high copy numbers of ARGs. Finally, RO showed high rejection percentages for all PhACs (<90%), with concentrations in the low ng L-1 range in permeates, for most target PhACs. Nevertheless, moderate copy numbers of ARGs were detected in permeates.

AB The co-generation of electricity and electrodialysis of seawater in a hybrid system is a promising approach to overcome water scarcity. Reverse electrodialysis harvests energy from the salinity gradient, where seawater is used as a high salinity stream while secondary treated wastewater can be used as a sustainable low salinity stream. Treated wastewater contains organic micropollutants, which can be transported to the seawater stream. The current research establishes a connection between adsorption and transport of organic micropollutants in ion exchange membranes, using a cross-flow stack in adsorption and zero-current experiments. To mimic the composition of treated wastewater, a mixture of nineteen organic micropollutants of varied physicochemical characteristics (e.g. size, charge, polarity, hydrogen donor/acceptor count, hydrophobicity) at environmentally relevant concentrations was used. Depending on the charge, micropollutants develop different types of mechanisms responsible for short-distance interactions with ion-exchange membranes, which has a direct influence in their transport behavior. This study provides a rational basis for the optimization/design of next-generation ion-exchange membranes, in which the permeability toward organic micropollutants should be also included. This investigation highly contributes to understanding the potential hazard posed by organic micropollutants in reverse electrodialysis in seawater desalination systems, where treated wastewater is used as a low salinity stream.

AB TiO2-supported chitosan scaffolds (TiO2/CS) are here proposed as promising material for wastewater treatment, in particular for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. TiO2/CS are tested for the amoxicillin photodegradation under UV/Vis irradiation. Amoxicillin (AMX) is an antibiotic of the betalactam family. Due to the release of antibiotics in wastewater and their persistence in the environment, harmful effects can develop on the aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   TiO2 chitosan scaffolds with photocatalytic activity for wastewater remediation have been prepared by 3D printing using commercial P25-TiO2. The formulation for the 3D printer was prepared by dispersion of chitosan and TiO2 in powder form at the concentration 6% w/v and 1% w/v, respectively. The TiO2 particles (crystalline anatase and rutile phases) embedded in the chitosan have a size of about 20 nm, like in the starting material, as verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and are homogeneously distributed in the scaffold, also after repeated photocatalytic tests, as revealed by SEM-EDS.
   The mechanical properties of the 3D structures are suitable for the targeted application as they can be easily handled without breakage.
   The AMX photodegradation efficiency under light irradiation by TiO2/CS made with scaffolds of different thicknesses (3, 5,15 layers), was assessed in water by means of UV-Vis absorption and HPLC/UV measurements, at two different AMX:TiO2 molar ratios: 1/100 and 1/10. The 3D printed TiO2/CS system, even after repeated cycles, shows a high photodegradation efficiency, compared to the direct AMX photolysis. A zero-order kinetics for TiO2 supported photodegradation was found, whereas a pseudo-first order was observed for water dispersed TiO2.
   Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of AMX degradates such as penilloic and penicilloic acids and diketopiperazine.
   The proposed 3D printed chitosan scaffolds may be used as reusable substrate for the TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many chemicals with different physico-chemical properties are present in municipal wastewater. In this study, the removal of a broad range of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was determined in two biological treatment processes differing in hydraulic retention time: sequential biofiltration (SBF) and soil-aquifer treatment (SAT), operated in Germany and Spain. Occurrence and the degree of removal of more than 150 TOrCs with different physico-chemical properties were analysed, including precursors as well as human metabolites and environmental transformation products (TPs). Ninety TOrCs were detected in the feed water of the SBF system, 40% of these showed removal efficiencies of higher than 30% during biological treatment. In SAT, 70 TOrCs were detected in the feed water, 60% of these could be reduced by more than 30% after approximately 3 days of subsurface treatment. For uncharged and negatively charged TOrCs biological degradation was mainly responsible for the removal, while positively charged TOrCs were most likely also removed by ionic interactions. The detections of TPs confirmed that biodegradation was a major removal process in both systems. The analysis of positively and negatively charged, neutral and zwitterionic TOrCs and the simultaneous analysis of precursors and their biologically formed TPs enabled a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms of their removal in the two systems. On this basis, criteria for site-specific indicator selection were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Strategies to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are widely discussed. Especially the evaluation of the potential benefit of further advanced treatment steps such as an additional tertiary treatment based on ozonation or activated carbon have come into focus. Such evaluation strategies are often based on the removal behavior of known micropollutants via target or suspected analysis. The utilization of nontarget analysis is considered to lead to a more comprehensive picture as also unknown or not expected micropollutants are analyzed. Here, the results of an evaluation via target and nontarget analysis were compared for biological treatment (BT) processes of eleven full-scale WWTPs and three different post-treatments (PTs): one sand filter (SF) and two granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. The similarity of the determined removals from target and nontarget analysis of the BTs increased significantly by excluding easily degradable "features" from the nontarget evaluation. A similar ranking of the removal trends for the BTs could also be achieved by comparing this new subset of nontarget features with a set of nine readily to moderately biodegradable micropollutants. This observation suggests that a performance ranking of BTs based either on target or nontarget analysis is plausible. In contrast to the BTs, the evaluation of the three PTs revealed that the difference of feature removal between SF and the two GACs was small, but large for the target analytes with substantially higher removal effciencies for the GACs compared to the SF. In addition to the removal behavior, the nontarget analysis provided further information about the number and quantity of transformation products (TPs) in the effluent from the BTs. For all BTs more than half (55-67%) of the features detected in the effluent were not found in the influent. A comparable proportion of TPs was also detected after GAC and sand filtration due to their microbial activities. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The seasonal and diurnal patterns of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and its formation potential (NMOR FP) were examined with water samples taken from five outlets of four sewage treatment plants (STPs), seven main stream sites, and five tributary sites in the Yodo River basin. STPs were shown to be the main sources of downstream NMOR load. The highest NMOR levels were found in the discharge from one STP (26.4-171 ng/L). Continuous sequential samplings over a period of 24 h at this STP revealed that NMOR flux at the influent point fluctuated in both summer (0.4-3.2 g/h) and winter (0.3-5.4 g/h), while it was steady in the effluent In addition, levels of NMOR remained stable during the biological treatment and disinfection processes. The present research demonstrated that NMOR could be formed from morpholine (MOR) in raw sewage treated by this STP, with a possible mechanism being formaldehyde-catalyzed nitrosation of MOR by nitrites, prior to raw sewage entering the STP. This implies that the NMOR detected here might not be a disinfection byproduct per se under low-chlorine disinfection (around 1.0 mg/L), but is primarily a contaminant that is difficult to remove during sewage treatment NMOR attenuated significantly in the rivers in the daytime with production of MOR, but persisted during nights, which demonstrated the importance of monitoring NMOR levels in the water environment during periods of low UV intensity, especially nights.

AB This study evaluates the influence of UV dose on degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in wastewater under UV-C (lambda = 254 nm) photolysis with and without H2O2. The rate of degradation of CBZ exhibited a direct dependence on the intensity of incident UV irradiation as the rate of degradation was observed to increase linearly (R-2 = 0.98) with UV intensity between 1.67 and 8.95 x 10(17) photons/s. More than 95% of the CBZ that spiked in wastewater rapidly degraded within 4 min with a first-order rate constant of 1.2 min(-1) for an optimum H2O2 dose of 100 mg/L. Bench-scale continuous flow reactor experiments also showed that CBZ degraded with first-order kinetics at a rate constant of 1.02 min(-1). The kinetic parameters obtained for a continuous bench-scale reactor were in good agreement with the relationships developed through batch experiments with only a marginal deviation of +/- 6.5%. The relationship between UV intensity and CBZ degradation rate obtained in this study was extrapolated to the UV disinfection unit of a wastewater treatment plant to predict possible degradation of CBZ during UV disinfection. The addition of 100 mg/L of H2O2 to the secondary-treated effluent entering the UV disinfection unit is predicted to achieve over 60% degradation of CBZ.

AB Paired electrolysis can take advantage of both anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, and thus improve current efficiency for electrochemical wastewater treatment. In this work, differential control of anode/cathode potentials of paired electrolysis for simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN, including ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite) was studied. We first determined the optimal potentials for anodic oxidation of COD/NH4+ or cathodic reduction of NO3/NO2 (minimization of over-oxidation or over-reduction) by preliminary cyclic voltammetry and constant-potential electrolysis experiments, i.e., 1.6 V for anodic oxidation and -1.26 V for cathodic reduction in this case. The optimal working potential of the cathode was achieved at appropriate current density in the paired electrolysis system, the working potential of the anode was independently controlled by adjusting the ratio of its surface area to that of the cathode. In this way, both the cathode and anode could work under optimal potentials. At an optimized cathodic current density of 5.0 mA cm(-2) and cathode/anode surface area ratio of 2: 1, the removal efficiencies of COD and TN from simulated wastewater reached 91.9% and 86.2%, respectively. Additionally, the developed paired electrolysis system was validated by treating an actual pharmaceutical wastewater, results for which showed that a total current efficiency of 84.8% was achieved, which was at least twice as high as that of traditional electrochemical processes.

AB Gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging are difficult to impossible to remove in wastewater treatment plants, and may enter groundwater production wells and hence municipal tap water via bank filtration. As anthropogenic gadolinium (Gd) may be accompanied by other, more harmful waste water-derived (micro) pollutants such as endocrine disruptors, we investigated the potential pathway of anthropogenic Gd into popular tap water-based beverages sold in highly frequented fast food restaurants. We, therefore, determined the concentration and distribution of geogenic and anthropogenic rare earth elements (REE) in tap water and in a related tap water-based popular soft drink (Coca Cola) from two fast food franchises (McDonalds and Burger King) in six major German cities. We observed anthropogenic Gd in both tap water and corresponding soft drinks in all investigated cities, extending the database for anthropogenic Gd in tap waters and highlighting its widespread distribution. In Berlin and Dusseldorf, where tap water is (mainly) produced by river bank filtration, 85 to 99% of the total Gd is of anthropogenic origin. The surprisingly high anthropogenic fraction (91%) in tap water from Munich reveals that even the shallow groundwater tapped in two Alpine valleys is eventually exposed to anthropogenic pollution. The REE distribution in post-mix soft drinks generally follows that of the corresponding tap water, except for enrichments of ytterbium (Yb), lutetium (Lu) and cerium (Ce), which are derived from the syrup. The concentration of anthropogenic Gd is similar in the soft drinks and in the corresponding tap water, demonstrating that the highly stable Gd-based contrast agents are not removed in soda fountains but are directly transferred to the beverages. This study highlights a pathway for anthropogenic waste water-derived xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors into the food chain, and hence, reveals the potential for human exposure to potentially harmful anthropogenic compounds.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in the aquatic compartment due to their continuous release in wastewater effluents or direct dispersal in aquaculture practices raising serious threats to human and environmental health. Erythromycin (ERY) is a macrolide antibiotic widely prescribed in human and veterinary medicine to threat a number of bacterial infections, being consequently found in the aquatic environment. The present work intends to evaluate the sub-lethal effects of ERY on juveniles of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in terms of tissue damage using histochemical staining procedures. Individuals were exposed for 96 h (acute exposure: 0.001-10 mg/L) and 28 days (chronic exposure: 0.05-0.8 mu g/L) to environmentally realistic concentrations of ERY. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to assess O. mykiss gills and liver tissue alterations after exposure to ERY. For both exposures the most common gill changes recorded were progressive (e.g. hypertrophy of mucous cells and hyperplasia of the epithelial cells). However, circulatory (e.g. aneurysms and oedemas) and regressive (e.g. epithelial lifting of lamellae and lamellar fusion) changes were also observed in the acute assay. Gill morphometric analysis revealed to be a good indicator of subtle alterations in gill architecture in agreement with the qualitative scoring system. In liver, regressive (e.g. cytoplasmic vacuolization, pyknotic nucleus and hepatocellular degeneration) and circulatory disturbances (e.g. hemorrhage and increase of sinusoidal space) were the most frequently observed alterations, but only for the acute assay. Furthermore, all histological changes observed contributed to a significant increase in the pathological index for both organs. The current data demonstrate the existence of a direct dose-effect relationship between the exposure to this specific macrolide antibiotic and the histological disorders recorded in different tissues of the exposed fish. The histopathological findings observed in this study may have been the result of several physio-metabolic dysfunctions. However, the observed tissue lesions were of minimal or moderate pathological importance, non-specific and reversible. Further investigation into the cellular mechanism of action of ERY is needed.

AB This study examined the distribution of pharmaceuticals in Yeongsan River and at point sources (PSs) in the associated water system, and performed a risk assessment based on our findings. The samples included effluents collected from three sewage treatment plants (PS1, PS2, and PS3) and two industrial complexes (PS4 and PS5) as well as surface water collected from seven mainstreams and 11 tributaries of the river. The target pharmaceuticals were acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, naproxen, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole, and trimethoprim, which were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All pharmaceuticals except acetylsalicylic acid and sulfathiazole were found in PS1, PS2, and PS3 samples, whereas acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole were found in PS4, most of the pharmaceuticals were not present in PS5. The rank order of pharmaceutical concentration in surface water was carbamazepine (97.2%, 0.2067 mu g/L) > sulfamethoxazole (88.9%, 0.1132 mu g/L) > naproxen (51.4%, 0.0516 mu g/L) > clarithromycin (43.1%, 0.0427 mu g/L). The distribution of pharmaceuticals in the Yeongsan River at PSs and non-PSs differed, and higher concentrations of human pharmaceuticals were detected in upstream and midstream areas whereas higher concentrations of animal pharmaceuticals were found downstream. Hazard quotients (HQs) evaluated at each sites based on mean concentration and 95% upper confidence limits (95% UCLs) were all less than one, indicating a low risk of toxicity. The findings of this study are expected to be useful for risk assessment of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Raman spectroscopy yields a fingerprint spectrum and is of great importance in medical and biological sciences as it is non-destructive, non-invasive, and available in the aqueous environment. In this study, Raman spectroscopy and Raman mapping were used to explore the dynamic biochemical processes in screened bacteria under ceftazidime stress. The Raman spectral difference between bacteria with and without antibiotic stress was analyzed by principal component analysis and characteristic peaks were obtained. The results showed that amino acids changed first and lipids were reduced when bacteria were exposed to ceftazidime stress. Furthermore, in Raman mapping, when bacteria were subjected to antibiotic stress, the peak at 1002 cm(-1) (phenylalanine) increased, while the peak at 1172 cm(-1) (lipids) weakened. This indicates that when bacteria were stimulated by antibiotics, the intracellular lipids decreased and the content of specific amino acids increased. The reduction of intracellular lipids may suggest a change of membrane permeability. The increase of specific amino acids suggests that bacteria resist external stimuli of antibiotics by regulating the activities of related enzymes. This study explored the processes of the action between bacteria and antibiotics by Raman spectroscopy, and provides a foundation for the further study of the dynamics of microbial biochemical processes in the future.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and removals of micropollutants in the sewage treatment tank (STT) which is a typical private wastewater treatment facility used in the rural communities in Korea, and their impact on receiving water. STTs were selected in eight provinces to examine the regional difference in the composition of micropollutant occurrence. We measured ten selected micropollutants in influents and effluents of STTs, as well as upstream and downstream of its receiving surface water. The dominant micropollutants in the influent of the STTs were caffeine (13,346 ng/L), acetaminophen (11,331 ng/L), ibuprofen (1440 ng/L), and naproxen (1313 ng/L), in agreement with the amounts produced annually in Korea. In the effluent, caffeine (1912 ng/L), acetaminophen (1586 ng/L), naproxen (475 ng/L), and ibuprofen (389 ng/L) were detected in relatively high concentrations. The composition of micropollutants in STT influents showed little regional variation by provinces, suggesting that the consumption pattern of these micropollutants did not show regional variation. The removal efficiencies of the selected micropollutants at the STTs ranged from 12% (carbamazepine) to 88% (acetaminophen), lower than typical removal by sewage treatment plants (STPs). This result is probably due to the automatic operation systems and simple treatment processes in STTs compared with STPs. The concentrations of selected micropollutants upstream of the receiving water were generally lower compared with those observed downstream, indicating that effluent from STTs was the main source. The per capita discharge loads of STTs and annual emissions rates (kg/year) from private wastewater treatment facilities were estimated for the selected micropollutants.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants worldwide. The presence of this compound in various water resources even at very low concentrations poses a big threat both to human health and aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the removal of diclofenac from aqueous solution using Fe-Mn binary oxide (FMBO) adsorbents was investigated. FMBO adsorbents were prepared at varying Fe/Mn molar ratios (1:0, 3:1, and 1:1) through simultaneous oxidation and co-precipitation methods. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of important parameters, such as initial DCF concentration, FMBO dosage, solution pH, and Fe/Mn molar ratio, on DCF removal. Acidic to neutral pH conditions were more favorable for DCF adsorption, while increasing initial DCF concentration and adsorbent dosage resulted in higher DCF removal efficiencies for the three oxides. Lower Fe/Mn molar ratio during FBMO synthesis favored higher DCF removals of up to 99% within a wide pH range. Optimization of operating parameters (initial DCF concentration, FMBO dosage, and solution pH) by Box-Behnken design resulted in up to 28.84 mg g(-1) DCF removal for 3:1 FMBO. Freundlich isotherm best described the experimental data, indicating that adsorption occurred on heterogeneous adsorbent surface. Chemisorption was the rate-limiting step of the DCF removal, as best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

AB Fluoroquinolone (FQ) derivatives with environmental friendliness regarding photodegradation, bioconcentration, and genotoxicity were selected from our previous works so that their transformation pathways of biological metabolism, photodegradation, microbial degradation, and chlorination disinfection could be studied. The pathways of these molecules and their derivatives were simulated to investigate the genotoxicity of their transformation products. The results showed that the genotoxicity of the biological metabolites, photodegradation products, and microbial degradation products of the maternal FQ derivatives partially increased, whereas the disinfection by-products exhibited lower genotoxicity than their precursors. Some designed FQ molecular derivatives still had potential environmental risks in biological metabolism, photodegradation, and microbial degradation. This study demonstrated that it is necessary to take into account the potential environmental risks of the transformed products of the modified FQs molecules during biometabolism, photodegradation, microbial degradation, and chlorination processes when designing novel FQ molecules. In future studies, assessing the potential environmental risks during various artificial or natural processes can be applied to screen environmentally friendly novel FQ molecules to avoid and or reduce their threat to environmental and human health.

AB The effective disposal of industrial pharmaceutical waste waters with the desired quality has become a challenge. Supercritical water oxidation which involves water beyond critical point has been preferred due to its near complete conversions. This research work made an attempt to degrade the organic matter into fuel gases by gasifying the pharmaceutical waste water stream over sub- to supercritical temperature range (200-400 degrees C). A maximum of 126.5 mmol/L of H-2 gas yield was obtained at 400 degrees C for 45 min. To achieve complete conversion, supercritical experiments have been performed in the presence of H2O2. The experiments resulted near complete conversion of 99.5% for an oxidation coefficient of 4 at 400 degrees C in 5 min. The experimental results conveyed that useful products (H-2, CO and CH4) can be attained with gasification in the absence of oxidant, while complete conversion can be achieved in the presence of oxidant in supercritical water.

AB Pharmaceuticals are one of the most used compounds present in various environmental compartments. Due to their high consumption and possible unhealthy effect on ecosystems, pharmaceuticals have been identified as "emerging organic contaminants". Since these compounds have medium to high polarity, they end up in the water compartment after being used. This work deals with the sorption of three pharmaceutical substances from the therapeutic group of antibiotics. Specifically we have focused on Azithromycin, Clarithromycin and Erythromycin. Three fractions of the natural Slovak zeolites (200 mu m, 0.5-1 mm and 1.5-2 mm) were used as the sorption medium. Experimental results have proven very effective sorption of antibiotics by zeolites. Azithromycin removal of over 99 % for all three zeolite fractions from wastewater treatment plant Stupava and wastewater treatment plant Devinska Nova Ves was achieved. Clarithromycin removal of 79 % for fraction 1-2.5 mm, 87.3 % for fraction 0.5-1 mm and of 99.8 % for fraction 200 mu m from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant Stupava was observed. Erythromycin removal of 31.3 % for fraction 1-2.5 mm, 66.9 % for fraction 0.5-1mm and of 94.7 % for fraction 200 pm from effluent of wastewater treatment plant Stupava was measured. More than 95 % of Clarithromycin and Erythromycin were eliminated from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant Devinska Nova Ves. The highest elimination percentage was observed for the smallest zeolite fraction due to the highest specific surface area.

AB The valorization of food wastes is a challenging opportunity for a green, sustainable, and competitive development of industry. Approximately 30 million m(3) of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) are produced annually in the world as a by-product of the olive oil extraction process. In addition to being a serious environmental and economic issue because of their polluting load, OMWW can also represent a precious resource of high-added-value molecules such as polyphenols that show acclaimed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and can find useful applications in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, the possibility to develop novel nutraceutical ophthalmic formulations containing free radical scavengers would represent an important therapeutic opportunity for all inflammatory diseases of the ocular surface. In this work, different adsorbents were tested to selectively recover a fraction that is rich in polyphenols from OMWW. Afterward, cytotoxicity and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenolic fraction were evaluated through in vitro tests. Our results showed that the fraction (0.01%) had no toxic effects and was able to protect cells against oxidant and inflammatory stimulus, reducing reactive oxygen species and TNF-alpha levels. Finally, a novel stable ophthalmic hydrogel containing a polyphenolic fraction (0.01%) was formulated and the technical and economic feasibility of the process at a pre-industrial level was investigated.

AB The pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) residues in freshwater lakes are being highlighted around the world. The occurrence and ecological risk of 34 PPCPs classified as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), cardiovascular drugs, psychotropic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, psychostimulants, and pesticides during rainstormperiod in surface water of the Dongting Lake, China, were studied. Twenty-six out of thirty-four PPCPs were detected, and the total concentrations of antibiotics ranged from 0.15 to 214.75 ng L-1 in surface water. The highest average concentration was observed for diclofenac, followed by diethyltoluamide (DEET). The PPCP concentrations were much lower in Dongting Lake compared to other rivers and lakes due to the strong dilution effect of rainstorm, while the detection rate remains high. Caffeine and DEET were detected with 100% frequency in Dongting Lake, and the detection rates of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, and roxithromycin were above 90%. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution of aquaculture plants, sewage treatment plants, and population density. The risk quotient (RQ) method was used to evaluate ecological environment risk under the worst case and the results suggested that clarithromycin, diclofenac, roxithromycin, and erythromycin might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially clarithromycin. This study can provide data support for further research on the dilutive effect and mechanism of rainwater runoff on PPCPs in lakes on a large scale.

AB Pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, have received increasing global concern, due to their intensive use in the environment and potential harm to ecological system as well as human health. Among various antibiotics, fluoroquinolones are of extreme interest, since they are broad-spectrum antibacterials with agrowing demand in hospitals, households, and veterinary applications. Wastewater discharge from conventional wastewater treatment plants isthe main source of fluoroquinolone in the aquatic environment. Removal of fluoroquinolone residue from aquatic environment is, therefore, considered as a priority and serves as an important study. For the degradation of FQs in aqueous solution, interesting remedy processes are required such as oxidation-degradation process in which formed intermediates mineralized into CO2, water, and mineral species. The electron transfer reactions and their mechanisms are of much importance in understanding various types of biochemical, pharmaceutical and industrial reactions. Kinetics has played a significant role in understanding the intricacies' of such reactions. Nanosized colloidal manganese dioxide, hexacyanoferrate(III), diperiodatocuprate(III), potassium permanganate etc. used as effective oxidants for oxidative degradation of different fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents in aqueous acidic/alkaline system. In this regard, we investigated a kinetic study of oxidation of moxifloxacin (MF) by diperiodatocuprate(III) (DPC) in aqueous alkaline medium. The reaction was first order with respect to [DPC] and less than unity order with [MF]. The pseudo first order rate constant (k(obs)) changes differently under different concentration of alkali. The results indicates at higher hydroxyl ion concentration DPC complex exist in CuL whereas at lower hydroxyl ion concentration in form of Cu(HL)(2). The thermodynamic parameters associated with the oxidation reaction have been evaluated and discussed.

AB This paper reported the first example on the use of chitosan films, without further modification, to remove and recover, through bio-sorption processes, the emerging pollutant Diclofenac from water. The latter was adopted as a model, among non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, by obtaining a maximum adsorption capacity, q(max), on chitosan of about 10 mg/g, under the applied experimental conditions of work. The literature gap about the use of chitosan films, which was already used for dyes and heavy metals removal, to adsorb emerging pollutants from water was covered, claiming the wide range application of chitosan films to remove a different class of pollutants. Several parameters affecting the Diclofenac adsorption process, such as the pH and ionic strength of solutions containing Diclofenac, the amount of the bio-sorbent and pollutant, and the temperature values, were investigated. The kinetics and the adsorption isotherms, along with the thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, and Delta S degrees) were also evaluated. The process occurred very efficiently, and Chitosan/Diclofenac amounts dependent, remove about the 90% of the pollutant, in 2 h, from the tested solutions, through electrostatic interaction involving the carboxylic moiety of Diclofenac and Chitosan amino groups. This finding was confirmed by the pH and salt effects on the bio-sorption process, including swelling measurements of Chitosan films and by FTIR-ATR analysis. In detail, the maximum adsorption was observed at pH 5, when pollutant and Chitosan were negatively and positively charged, respectively. By reducing or increasing the pH around this value, a reduced affinity was observed. Accordingly, the presence of salts retarded the Diclofenac removal screening its charges, which hinders the interaction with Chitosan. The sorption was spontaneous (Delta G degrees < 0) and endothermic (Delta H degrees > 0) following the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The process was Diclofenac and Chitosan amount dependent. In addition, the Freundlich and Temkin isotherms well described the process, which showed the heterogeneous character of the process. Experiments of the complete desorption were also performed by using NaCl solutions 0.25 M (like sea water salt concentration) proposing the reuse of the pollutant and the recycling of the bio-sorbent lowering the associated costs. The versatility of the adsorbent was reported by exploring the possibility to induce the Diclofenac light-induced degradation after the adsorption and by-products adsorption onto chitosan films. To emphasize the chitosan capacity of treating water, the removal of another pollutant such as Ketoprofen and the mixture of Diclofenac and Ketoprofen were investigated. In this way, a green and eco-friendly production-pollution prevention technology for removing emerging pollutants from water was presented, which reduced the overall environmental impact. This illustrated experiments both in static and dynamic conditions for potential industrial applications.

AB There is growing interest in determining the unidentified peaks within a sample spectra besides the analytes of interest. Availability of reference standards and hyphenated instruments has been a key and limiting factor in the rapid determination of emerging pollutants in the environment. In this work, polar compounds were silylated and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the abundant fragments within the single ion monitoring (SIM) mode and methodology. Detection limits and recoveries of the compounds were established in river water, wastewater, biosolid and sediment matrices. Then, specific types of polar compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the environment were targeted in the Mgeni and Msunduzi Rivers. We also performed suspect and non-target analysis screening to identify several other polar compounds in these rivers. A total of 12 compounds were quantified out of approximately 50 detected emerging contaminants in the Mgeni and Msunduzi Rivers. This study is significant for Africa, where the studies of emerging contaminants are limited and not usually prioritized.

AB Antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as emerging environmental contaminants and possess potential crisis to global public health. However, little is known about the differences between various configurations of two-stage combinations of constructed wetlands (CWs) on antibiotics and ARG removal from wastewater. In the study, three configurations of two-stage hybrid CWs (horizontal subsurface flow-down-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-DVF; horizontal subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-UVF; down-flow vertical subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, DVF-UVF) were operated to evaluate their ability to remove high-concentration antibiotics (tilmicosin-TMS and doxycycline-DOC), ARGs (seven tet genes and three erm genes), intI1, 16S rRNA, and nutrients from goose wastewater. The results showed that all three hybrid CWs could remove more than 98% of TMS and DOC from wastewater, without significant difference among treatments (p > 0.05). For ARGs, DVF-UVF showed significantly higher removal efficiencies of intI1, ermB, ermC, ermF, tetW, and tetG compared to HF-UVF (p < 0.05), mainly because they might remove and arrest growth of bacteria. The relatively high removal efficiencies of NH4+-N, NO3-N, and NO2--N were also observed from DVF-UVF, ranging from 87% to 95% (p > 0.05), indicating that anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) might be established in the CWs. Our results demonstrate that the removal performances of antibiotics using two-stage hybrid CWs are not affected by the combined configuration, whereas the combination of DVF and UVF CWs perform better on the removal of ARGs and nutrients compared with HF-DVF and HF-UVF CWs.

AB The largest wastewater treatment plant in Jordan was monitored in the summer to determine the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Grab samples were collected from the influent and effluent of As-Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were utilized to determine the concentrations of 18 compounds of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The results showed that 14 compounds were detected in the collected samples from the influent and effluent of As-Samra WWTP. These compounds are 1,7-dimethylxanthine, amphetamine, acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cimetidine, cotinine, diphenhydramine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), morphine, phenazone, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, thiabendazole, and trimethoprim. However, four compounds were below the detection limit (<0.005 mu g/L), namely cimetidine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methamphetamine, and sulfachloropyridazine. Among PPCPs, the highest estimated average concentrations in raw wastewater were caffeine, acetaminophen, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, cotinine, and carbamazepine sampled during the summer, at an estimated concentration of 155.6 mu g/L, 36.7 mu g/L, 10.49 mu g/L, and 1.104 mu g/L, respectively. However, the highest estimated average concentrations in treated wastewater were for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, caffeine, cotinine, and acetaminophen, at 0.856 mu g/L, 0.096 mu g/L, 0.086 mu g/L, 0.078 mu g/L, and 0.041 mu g/L, respectively. In general, the results showed that some compounds in the collected samples of wastewater in Jordan have concentrations exceeding the values reported in the literature. The removal efficiency rates of 1,7-dimethylxanthine, acetaminophen, caffeine, cotinine, morphine, and trimethoprim were higher than 95%, while those of carbamazepine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole were lower than 22.5%. Moreover, diphenhydramine and thiabendazole had negative removal efficiency rates. The removal efficiency rates of the PPCPs in As-Samra WWTP were generally consistent with those of indicator compounds reported in the literature for conventional WWTPs.

AB The aim of the research was to show the presence of micropollutants contained in the wastewater of Mexico City within the distribution canals of the Mezquital Valley (MV), as well as their retention in agricultural soil and aquifers. This system constitutes the world's oldest and largest example of the use of untreated wastewater for agricultural irrigation. The artificial recharge associated with the MV aquifers, with groundwater extracted for human consumption showing its importance as a water resource for Mexico City. The results of sampling show the presence of 18 compounds, with 10 of these considered as endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs). The concentration of these pollutants ranged from 2 ng/L for 17 beta-estradiol to 99 ng/L for DEHP, with these values decreasing throughout the course of the canals due to the wastewater dilution factor, their retention in agricultural soil, and their accumulation in the local aquifer. The main mechanisms involved in natural attenuation are adsorption, filtration, and biodegradation. Drinking water equivalent levels (DWELs) were estimated for 11 compounds with regard to acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), by assuming local exposure parameters for a rural Mexican population. These were compared with the maximum groundwater concentrations (Cgw) to screen the potential risks. The very low ratios of Cgw to DWELs indicate no appreciable human health risk from the presence of trace concentrations of these compounds in the source of drinking water in the MV. Despite this, far from being exceeded after more than 100 years of irrigation with residual water, the natural soil attenuation seems to remain stable.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the wastewater effluents has confirmed that conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not sufficiently effective in the pharmaceuticals' removal. The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare the photocatalytic degradation of PhACs using TiO2-P25, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) and a heterojunction of perovskite strodium titanate and graphitic carbon nitride SrTiO3/g-C3N4 (20% g-C3N4, 20CNSTO) photocatalytic materials, in hospital wastewater effluents, by simulated solar irradiation. The experiments were performed by using real wastewater samples collected from the university hospital wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent of Ioannina city (Northwestern Greece) and inherent pharmaceutical concentration levels. The analysis of the samples was accomplished by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the cases of TiO2 and CN, more than 70% of the initial concentration (e.g., venlafaxine) was degraded after 90 min, while 20CNSTO presented lower photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, some compounds were sporadically detected (e.g., fluoxetine) or their concentrations remained stable during the photocatalytic treatment time period (e.g., trimethoprim). In total 11 transformation products (TPs) were formed along the degradation processes and were identified by using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry.

AB The impacts of biofouling on the retention of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by a commercially available nanofiltration membrane (NF 270) were systematically studied. Biofouling was achieved through inoculating live and dead Pseudomonas aeruginosa into artificial wastewater. In comparison to a clean membrane, an increase in PhAC rejection during biofouling with live cells was observed. However, the rejection behaviors presented more complex changes during biofouling with dead cells: PhAC rejection was below the clean membrane in the early biofouling stage; however, in the later stage, PhAC rejection was above the clean membrane. In addition, PhAC rejection behaviors present the similar tendency as salt rejection under both biofouling conditions. In addition, solute rejections were much lower for biofouling with dead cells than those for biofouling with live cells. Combined with biofilm characterization under both biofouling conditions, we could conclude that biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure (BEOP) due to higher cell counts and biofilm thickness led to a decrease in PhAC retention, especially for the dead cells. In addition, more dominant steric exclusion in the later stage of biofouling due to higher extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) concentration on the membrane surface resulted in an increase in PhAC retention.

AB Biodegradation is an important route for the removal of sulfamethazine (SMZ), one of the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotics, in the environment. However, little information is known about the kinetics, products, and pathways of SMZ biodegradation owing to the complexity of its enzyme-based biotransformation processes. In this study, the SMZ-degrading strain A01 belonging to the genus Paenarthrobacter was isolated from SMZ-enriched activated sludge reactors. The bacterial cells were rod-shaped with transient branches 2.50-4.00 mu m in length with most forming in a V-shaped arrangement. The genome size of Paenarthrobacter sp. A01 had a total length of 4,885,005 bp with a GC content of 63.5%, and it contained 104 contigs and 55 RNAs. The effects of pH, temperature, initial substrate concentration and additional carbon source on the biodegradation of SMZ were investigated. The results indicated that pH 6.0-7.8, 25 degrees C and the addition of 0.2 g/L sodium acetate favored the biodegradation, whereas a high concentration of SMZ, 500 mg/L, had an inhibitory effect. The biodegradation kinetics with SMZ as the sole carbon source or 0.2 g/L sodium acetate as the co-substrate fit the modified Gompertz model well with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.99. Three biodegradation pathways were proposed involving nine biodegradation products, among which C6H9N3O2S and C12H12N2 were two novel biodegradation products that have not been reported previously. Approximately 90.7% of SMZ was transformed to 2-amino-4, 6-dimethylpyrimidine. Furthermore, sad genes responsible for catabolizing sulfonamides were characterized in A01 with high similarities of 96.0%-100.0%. This study will fill the knowledge gap in the biodegradation of this ubiquitous micropollutant in the aquatic environment.

AB The dissemination of pharmaceuticals in agroecosystems originating from land application of animal manure/ sewage sludge and irrigation with treated wastewater in agricultural production has raised concern about the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in food products. The pathways of pharmaceutical entries via plant roots, transport to upper fractions, and the factors influencing these processes have yet been systematically elucidated, thus impeding the development of effective measures to mitigate pharmaceutical contamination in food crops. In this study, lettuce uptake of thirteen commonly used pharmaceuticals was investigated using a hydroponic experimental setting. Pharmaceutical sorption by lettuce roots was measured in order to evaluate the influence on pharmaceutical transport from roots to shoots. Small-sized pharmaceuticals e.g., caffeine and carbamazepine with molecular weight (MW)< 300 g mol(-1) and a low affinity to lettuce roots (sorption coefficient Kp < 0.05 L g(-1)) manifested substantial transport to shoots. Small-sized molecules lamotrigine and trimethoprim had a relatively strong affinity to lettuce roots (Kp > 12.0 L g(-1)) and demonstrated a reduced transport to shoots. Large-sized pharmaceuticals (e.g. MW> 400 g mol(-1)) including lincomycin, monensin sodium, and tylosin could be excluded from cell membranes, resulting in the predominant accumulation in lettuce roots. Large-sized oxytetracycline existed as zwitterionic species that could slowly enter lettuce roots; however, the relatively strong interaction with lettuce roots limits its transport to shoots. The mass balance analysis revealed that acetaminophen, beta-estradiol, carbadox, estrone and triclosan were readily metabolized in lettuce with > 90% loss during 144-h exposure period. A scheme was proposed to describe pharmaceutical uptake and transport in plant, which could reasonably elucidate many literature-reported results. Molecular size, reactivity and ionic speciation of pharmaceuticals, as well as plant physiology, collectively determine their uptake, transport and accumulation in plants.

AB Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can purify wastewater, they also discharge numerous contaminants into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal. The occurrence, emission flux, and risk assessment of traditional pollutants (e.g., heavy metals [HMs]), and emerging pollutants (e.g., perfluoroalkyl substances [PFASs] and pharmaceutical and personal care products [PPCPs]) in WWTP emissions are of important concern. The present study analyzed 17 PFASs, 25 PPCPs, and 8 HMs in influent, effluent, and excess sludge from six WWTPs along the Yanghe River, North China. Samples were collected during four sampling campaigns from November 2016 to July 2017. The mean concentrations of PFASs and PPCPs in influent were 46.4 ng L-1 and 6.57 mu g L--1,L- respectively; while those in effluent were 38.5 ng L-1 and 2.14 mu g L-1, respectively. The highest concentrations of HMs was detected of Zn in influent (2,866 mu g L-1) and effluent (3,960 mu g L-1). According to the concentration composition, short-chain PFASs, fluoroquinolones (FQs), and Zn were the predominant components in both influents and effluents. The mean PFAS and PPCP concentrations in excess sludge were 5.95 ng g(-1) and 3.74 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw). Zn was the most abundant HMs in excess sludge with the concentration range of 156-14,271 mu g g(-1) dw. The compositions of PFASs, PPCPs and HMs differed between wastewater and excess sludge. The estimated emission flux of these pollutants was ordered as HMs > PPCPs> PFASs through effluent discharge and sludge disposal. Sludge disposal discharged more PPCPs and HMs into the environment than effluent discharge, which was contrary for PFASs. Relative risk of each pollutant is calculated by comparing the mean effluent concentration with the median effective concentration. Algae and fish were selected as recipient organisms to calculate the relative risk of 23 selected pollutants towards aquatic organisms. The highest-risk pollutant was Zn on both algae and fish, while perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and atenolol (ATE) posed the lowest risk. In general, HMs (regarded as traditional pollutants) presented higher risks in effluent, followed by the emerging pollutants (PPCPs and PFASs). Therefore, control of traditional pollutants should be prioritized in WWTPs in this region. This study presents an overall assessment of the current status of traditional and emerging pollutants in WWTPs and provides useful information for upgrading wastewater treatment processes.

AB Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is well known as agricultural wastewater that has a high potential as a medium for microalgal growth due to its high macro- and micronutrient content. The cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis is considered as a species with a high C-phycocyanin (C-PC) content which is important for fine chemical and pharmaceutical applications. However, cultivation of A. platensis on POME to produce economically feasible amounts of C-PC has not been well explored. For this, environmental, nutritional, and cultivation modes (batch, semi-continuous) were varied to optimize C-PC productivity when cultivated at various POME concentrations. Arthrospira platensis was found to grow well on POME. Highest biomass and C-PC concentrations were found on 30-100% POME. Central composite rotatable design (CCRD) response surface methodology demonstrated that C-PC productivity was influenced by urea addition at the optimum salinity. The highest C-PC productivity was found on 100% POME during semi-continuous cultivation, while the addition of phosphorus and urea did not significantly improve C-PC productivity. By applying semi-continuous cultivation with 50% POME at the first stage and 100% POME at the second stage, a similarly high C-PC productivity (4.08 +/- 1.3 mg L-1 day(-1)) was achieved as compared with (artificial) Zarrouk medium during batch cultivation. We conclude that, when using a two-stage semi-continuous cultivation process, A. platensis can produce economically feasible amounts of C-PC when cultivated on 100% POME.

AB The increasing concern about the emerging contaminants, especially the endocrine disrupting chemicals, which include pesticides and the pharmaceuticals and personal care products, has stirred up the rate of monitoring their presence in the environment. Triclosan is one such chemical used as an antibacterial and antimicrobial in many personal care products. This chemical is present in very low amounts in the personal care products, but its appearance in the environment becomes a matter of concern due to its detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, this paper focuses on determination of Triclosan concentration in the personal care products used by the residents of Patna municipal area. It also focuses on finding out the ultimate load of Triclosan discharged and its corresponding concentration in the wastewaters of Patna.

AB Illicit and pharmaceutical drugs are considered to be emerging contaminants of concern, and much research effort has gone into assessing their occurrence in wastewater. However, little information exists on their presence in treated sludge or biosolids. In this study, we examined sludge and biosolids from a large metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Australia to determine the occurrence of five drugs of abuse, including benzoylecgonine as indicator of cocaine consumption, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) as representative illicit stimulants, and codeine and morphine as pharmaceuticals with potential environmental risk. The samples were solid-phase extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Benzoylecgonine and MDMA were present in raw sludge but were notably degraded during solids treatment processes, and were not detected in the dewatered sludge (after treatment) or in biosolids. Methamphetamine, codeine, and morphine were detected in all biosolids samples at mean concentrations of 20-50 mu g.kg(-1). The presence of these three drugs in biosolids shows that these compounds are relatively stable in the solids and in soil, and can persist in biosolids for at least several years. A simple environmental risk assessment based on estimated risk quotients (RQs) for these compounds indicated that the potential environmental risks associated with the land application of biosolids are very low at typical Australian biosolids application rates.

AB In the context of xenobiotics' removal in biological wastewater treatment processes, this study investigated the biodegradation of phenol and paracetamol as sole carbon sources by open mixed cultures. Biodegradation of these chemicals was investigated in batch and SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) lab-scale experiments. In batch experiments, phenol was biodegraded by unacclimated microorganisms at concentrations 0.2-0.5 g/l. The acclimation time increased with increasing phenol concentration and no biodegradation was observed with an initial concentration of 1 g/l. However, 1 g/l of phenol was biodegraded after previous exposure of the microorganisms to lower concentrations of phenol or to yeast extract and peptone. Batch degradation of paracetamol (0.5 g/l) only occurred after previous exposure of the microorganisms to yeast extract and peptone. SBR experiments were run with 1.0 g/L feed concentration of phenol or paracetamol in a range of SRT (solids residence time, 1-45 d for phenol and 1-145 d for paracetamol). Both substrates were removed as sole carbon sources and COD removal generally increased as the SRT increased, and was higher than 90% for phenol and 80% for paracetamol. A higher fraction of the removed substrate was assimilated into microorganisms for paracetamol than for phenol with growth yields 0.51 and 0.20 g/g COD, respectively. This study shows how process conditions (acclimation, substrate concentration, medium composition, SRT) affect the removal of phenol and paracetamol and gives guidance on their selection for the optimum biodegradation performance.

AB The degradation kinetics, the operational influencing factors, the determination of short-chain organic by-products, the mineralization degree, the evolution of residual toxicity, as well as the treatment of complex matrices were systematically investigated on removal of piroxicam by Electro-Fenton process (EF), due to its persistence and low removal in water matrices. The second order reaction rate constant between piroxicam and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) was determined as (2.19 +/- 0.01) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). It was found that the process was able to almost completely mineralize 0.08 mM piroxicam solution (92% TOC removal) at 6 h treatment. Based on identification of short-chain carboxylic acids, released inorganic ions and the removal of total organic carbon, a schematic proposal of piroxicam degradation by EF treatment was done. The evolution of the acute toxicity of treated piroxicam solution was monitored by Microtox method, showing a significant toxicity reduction at 180 min treatment. Remarkably, piroxicam in simulated urine and hospital wastewater was completely degraded after 120 min of EF treatment. Therefore, the results indicate that the tested EF process constitutes an efficient option for the elimination of piroxicam in aqueous media.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and the environment has attracted growing public concern. Although studies have been performed to detect pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents, little research has been conducted to assess the efficiency of pharmaceutical removal using different treatment technologies. To assess the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, samples from 22 municipal treatment plants in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were analyzed for 12 commonly used pharmaceuticals and 2 primary metabolites. The medians of removal efficiencies for 9 technologies: aerated lagoon, extended aeration, facultative lagoon, membrane bioreactor, modified secondary, oxidation ditch, primary treatment, rotating biological contactor, and sequencing batch reactor technologies, were determined to be 98.0%, 96.4%, 98.2%, 99.8%, 68.4%, 99.0%, 3.0%, 81.3%, and 98.3%, respectively. The medians of removal efficiencies of individual pharmaceuticals were found from -14.4% to 100%. Primary treatment showed significant differences comparing to other treatment technologies. Very strong correlations of removal efficiencies were found between acetaminophen and warfarin, between cotinine and warfarin, between cotinine and paraxanthine, and between ramipril and atorvastatin. In general, there was no strong correlation of removal between pharmaceuticals and total organic waste load or total suspended solids.

TI Coupling of nanofiltration and UV, UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2 processes for the

AB The detection of anti-cancer drugs in surface waters at ng/L indicates that most wastewater treatment processes currently applied are not effective enough to remove these resilient compounds from wastewater. Therefore alternative treatment processes should be tested to avoid discharges in the environment of drugs that have been linked to genotoxic effects. The innovative contribution of this study stands in coupling nanofiltration with advanced oxidation processes to treat real secondary wastewater effluents spiked with 4 widely consumed anticancer drugs. Direct photolysis was found to be extremely effective to degrade etoposide and paclitaxel from the secondary effluent as well as from the highly concentrated retentate produced by nanofiltration. The two drugs were not detected after 10 min of exposure that corresponds to higher than 98% removals given the method detection limits by direct injection. This is equivalent to pseudo-first order degradation rate constants higher than 0.46 min(-1), which, to the best of the author's knowledge, has not yet been reported for paclitaxel in the literature. However, none of the tested oxidation processes (UV, UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2) using the reactor setup, exposure times and concentrations of TiO2 and H2O2 tested, were able to degrade cyclophosphamide or ifos-famide effectively. Compared to literature data, this is probably related to the low amount of photons received by the treated media. Finally important aggregation of catalyst particles was observed in secondary effluent, and photocatalysis had no advantage compared to the other two processes tested.

AB The focus of this study was on developing a method for the effective removal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, fenoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and carbamazepine from wastewater using nanofibres from Moringa seeds protein/PVA blend. Parameters that could affect the removal of selected pharmaceuticals such as adsorbent dosage, pH, initial concentration, temperature and contact time were optimised. The optimized method was applied to real wastewater samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant. Under optimum conditions, the percentage removal was found to range from 84.5 to 97.4% for standard mixture solution and from 70.5% to 92.5 and 77.8. to 96.1% for the real wastewater (i.e. influent and effluent respectively). The adsorption data was well fitted in the Freundlich isotherm than Langmuir isotherm for all the groups of pharmaceuticals studied. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained ranged from 31.25 to 333.33 mg g(-1). The interaction between the drugs and the nanofibres predominantly occurred by chemisorption rather than by physisorption. The results obtained demonstrated that nanofibres fabricated from biomaterials could perform better than previously published materials.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of drug residues in hospital wastewater has been studied. Treatment performances were evaluated by measuring the residual concentrations of twelve pharmaceutical compounds from different categories (caffeine, cihydrocarbamazepine, desvenlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen, carbamazepine, 4-hydroxy diclofenac, diclofenac, ibuprofen and clarithromycin). In order to follow the evolution of the treatment performances, high resolution mass spectrometry and spectral (UV-VIS and fluorescence) analysis were conducted and single correlations were proposed. Current densities were applied (4.42 mA.cm(-2), 17.7 mA.cm(-2) and 35.4 mA.cm(-2)) for a period of 120 min using boron-doped diamond (NB/ BDD) anode and titanium (Ti) cathode. Results showed that pollutants abatement rates in wastewater could reach 100% after 120 min at 35.4 mA.cm(-2). The UV254 absorbance and total fluorescence (TF) were applied as surrogate parameters in order to monitor the degradation of the targeted contaminants in hospital wastewater. For each molecule, single correlation (0543 < R-2 < 0944) were proposed for on-line monitoring in future works.

AB Discharge of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from wastewater has been increasingly alarmed, led to the advent of the treatment techniques. Among these methods, adsorption is regarded as a tunable and green approach with the utilization of mesoporous carbon (MC) as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent. Herein, we described the strategy for the synthesis of novel MC from Fe-MIL-88B as a self-sacrificial template. Three thermolysis temperatures (550, 750, and 950 degrees C) were investigated to compare the structural characteristics and absorbability towards selected NSAIDs compounds including diclofenac sodium (DCF), aspirin (APR), and ibuprofen (IBU). Effect of contact time (0-480 min), concentration (10-40 mg/L), pH (2-10), and MC dosage (0.1-0.5 g/L) was systematically studied. Kinetic and isotherm models were also used to find out the adsorption mechanism and behavior of NSAIDs pharmaceutical over MC materials. Proposed mechanism and recyclability test were rigorously studied to gain more insight into how the NSAIDs molecules adsorb on the MC materials and their potential towards drug treatment.

AB The variability of fecal microorganisms and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) loads in relation to influent flow rates was evaluated for a water resource recovery facility (WRRF) in support of a vulnerability assessment of a drinking water source. Incomplete treatment and bypass discharges often occur following intense precipitation events that represent conditions that deviate from normal operation. Parasites, fecal indicator bacteria, and WWMPs concentrations and flow rate were measured at the WRRF influent and effluent during dry and wet weather periods. Influent concentrations were measured to characterize potential bypass concentrations that occur during wet weather. Maximum influent Giardia and C. perfringens loads and maximum effluent Escherichia coli and C. perfringens loads were observed during wet weather. Influent median loads of Cryptosporidium and Giardia were 6.8 log oocysts/day and 7.9 log cysts/day per 1,000 people. Effluent median loads were 3.9 log oocysts/day and 6.3 log cysts/day per 1,000 people. High loads of microbial contaminants can occur during WRRF bypasses following wet weather and increase with increasing flow rates; thus, short-term infrequent events such as bypasses should be considered in vulnerability assessments of drinking water sources in addition to the increased effluent loads during normal operation following wet weather.

AB This work has focused on a pharmaceutical plant waters and the environmental impact of its discharges. The Water Quality Index (WQI), the Organic Pollution Index (OPI) and the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of incoming and outgoing waters were analyzed over seasonal variations for 5 months using classical and mathematical indices. Highly significant increases were observed at the output (p < 0.001) for electrical conductivity, alkalinity, calcium and sodium; very significant (p < 0.01) for nitrites, COD and BOD5; significant (p < 0.05) for turbidity, potassium and chlorides. The sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, ammonia, TSS, magnesium, aluminum, iron and manganese showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). These parameters remained high all over the study period except for the BOD5. The WQI was reported in input waters in the range 85.9-89.5 indicating water safe for domestic use, range 42.3-60.9 (medium to bad) in output waters highlighting the water pollution. The OPI highlighted waters with low-to-moderate pollution, essentially due to high levels of nitrites. The SAR was found in "medium-to-high" salinity and "low sodium" ranges, thus precautions required in soils but without significant global effects. The COD/BOD5 ratio highlighted a wastewater sometimes difficultly biodegradable (ratio > 3). In conclusion, often throughout all the study period, the outgoing waters were found with bad quality and non-negligible risks for soils; it is thus strongly advocated that these waters must undergo appropriate treatment to improve its physicochemical quality.

AB De facto potable reuse occurs when treated wastewater is discharged upstream of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and can lead to contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) occurring in potable water. Our prior research, focusing on larger communities that each serve >10,000 people across the USA, indicates that elevated de facto reuse (DFR) occurs in Texas, and thus we added to our model DWTPs serving smaller communities to understand their vulnerability to CECs. Here, we show that two-thirds of all surface water intakes in Texas were impacted by DFR at levels exceeding 90% during even mild droughts, and under average streamflow DFR levels range between 1 and 20%. DWTPs serving lower population communities (<10,000 people) have higher DFR levels, and fewer than 2% of these communities have advanced technologies (e.g., ozone, activated carbon) at DWTPs to remove CECs. Efforts to improve water quality in these less populated communities are an important priority. The model approach and results can be used to identify prioritization for monitoring and treatment of CECs, including in underserved communities, which normally lack knowledge of their impacts from DFR occurring within their watersheds.

AB An environmental risk assessment is presented for mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressive pharmaceutical used for prevention of organ rejection, and its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MPM). Mycophenolic acid will not significantly adsorb to activated sludge. In activated sludge, C-14-MPA attained >80% degradation, supporting an older environmental fate test with the same compound. Based on n-octanol/water distribution coefficient (log D-OW) values of 2.28, 0.48, and <=-1.54 at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively, MPA is not expected to bioaccumulate. Sales amounts of MPA+MPM in Europe were used to derive predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in surface waters; PECs were refined by including expected biodegradation in sewage treatment, average drinking water use, and average dilution of the effluents in the receiving waters per country. In addition, the exposure to pharmaceuticals in the environment (ePiE) model was run for 4 European catchments. The PECs were complemented with 110 measured environmental concentrations (MECs), ranging from below the limit of quantitation (<0.001 mu g/L) to 0.656 mu g/L. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived from chronic tests with cyanobacteria, green algae, daphnids, and fish. The comparison of PECs and MECs with the PNECs resulted in a differentiated environmental risk assessment in which the risk ratio of PEC/PNEC or MEC/PNEC was <1 in most cases (mostly >90%), meaning no significant risk, but a potential risk to aquatic organisms in generally <10% of instances. Because this assessment reveals a partial risk, the following questions must be asked: How much risk is acceptable? and Through which measures can this risk be reduced? These questions are all the more important in view of limited alternatives for MPM and MPA and the serious consequences of not using them. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2259-2278.

AB The use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of infections in humans and animals has increased in Argentina, and they can be found in large amounts in water bodies. The present study investigated the occurrence and associated ecological risk of 5 fluoroquinolones in rivers and farm wastewaters of San Luis, Santa Fe, Cordoba, Entre Rios, and Buenos Aires provinces of Argentina by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fast-scanning fluorescence detection and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry detection. The maximum concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and difloxacin found in wastewater were 1.14, 11.9, 1.78, 22.1, and 14.2 mu g L-1, respectively. In the case of river samples, only enrofloxacin was found, at a concentration of 0.97 mu g L-1. The individual risk of aquatic organisms associated with water pollution due to fluoroquinolones was higher in bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, plants, and anurans than in crustaceae and fish, with, in some cases, risk quotients >1. The proportion of samples classified as high risk was 87.5% for ofloxacin, 63.5% for enrofloxacin, 57.1% for ciprofloxacin, and 25% for enoxacin. Our results suggest that the prevalence of fluoroquinolones in water could be potentially risky for the aquatic ecosystem, and harmful to biodiversity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2305-2313.

AB Among the vast list of xenobiotics that may promote harmful effects in aquatic ecosystems, pharmaceuticals are currently a prominent class due to their ability to persist in these environments and also due to the lack of information regarding their effects on the different components of the aquatic biota. Antifungals in particular, despite their massive use, are not extensively studied in environbmental terms. The main objective of this study was to characterize the toxicity of the antifungal clotrimazole to the aquatic organism Daphnia magna. To attain this purpose, the effects of this compound were measured, focusing on the determination of acute lethality, and quantification of biomarkers, such as neurotoxicity (soluble cholinesterases, ChEs); and oxidative stress and metabolism (such as catalase, CAT; and glutathione-S-transferases, GSTs). The toxicity assessment with biomarkers was based on animals exposed to concentrations similar to those already found in surface waters in order to increase the ecological relevance of the obtained data. The results showed that exposure to clotrimazole was able to induce significant increases in both CAT amd GSTs activities. ChE activity was not significantly altered after clotrimazol exposure. In view of the above, it is concluded that the drug studied caused adverse effects in terms of oxidative stress, at an ecological relevant levels, showing that the presence of clotrimazol in the wild is not innocuous.

AB Antibiotics in manure, soil, wastewater, and groundwater samples from the livestock and poultry farms in Xuzhou City were investigated in the present study. The concentrations of antibiotics in all matrices varied greatly among farms. Total concentrations of fluoroquinolones and macrolides were much higher than those of sulfonamides in manures and soil samples. Total concentrations of antibiotics in wastewater of livestock farms were higher than those of poultry farm. Josamycin (JM) and tilmicosin (TIL) accounted for more than 74% of the nine macrolides in all groundwater samples. Sulfamethizole (SMT), fleroxacin (FLE), cinoxacin (CIN) and JM were the main antibiotics detected in manure and soil samples, while sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), sulfameter (SME), SMT, FLE, JM and TIL accounted for a large proportion of antibiotics in surface and groundwater. The risk assessment of target antibiotics revealed that JM in wastewater showed relatively high RQs for aquatic organisms.

AB A growing concern exists over water contamination by veterinary pharmaceuticals from small pig farms in Yucatan, Mexico, where the anaerobic digesters installed as the wastewater treatment system are not operated properly. Therefore, considerable interest exists to develop analytical methods to detect these compounds and characterize their fate in the environment. In this study, the detection of three antibiotics (enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole) and a beta-agonist (ractopamine) was carried out using fluorescence spectrophotometry, with a semi-quantitative approach and a low environmental impact. Wastewater samples from 10 pig farms were analyzed, detecting concentrations of approximately 0.043 mu g mL(-1) for enrofloxacin, 1.427 mu g mL(-1) for oxytetracycline, and 9.748 mu g mL(-1) for sulfamethoxazole. The detection of these pharmaceuticals in the effluents of treated wastewater from the biodigesters of the pig farms suggests the need to optimize the system and prevent the entry of these compounds into the environment.

AB In this study, photocatalytic degradation of synthetic hospital wastewater containing two pharmaceutical contaminants, namely amoxicillin trihydrate (a commonly used antibiotic) and metformin HCl (a widely used diabetic medicine), was carried out using a laboratory-scale photoreactor (200 mL), TiO2 as photocatalyst, and 125 W low-pressure mercury vapour lamp emitting UV rays at 365 nm. The response surface methodology based on face-centred central composite design was used to optimize the independent variables, namely the initial concentrations of contaminants (10-50 mg/L), TiO2 dosage (250-1250 mg/L), initial pH (3-11), and reaction time (30-150 min). Results showed that both amoxicillin and metformin removals were influenced by all the four variables individually and also by the interaction between these variables. Response surface and overlaid contour plots were used to evaluate the optimum conditions. It was found that the maximum removal of amoxicillin (90%) and metformin (98%) could occur when the pH is 7.6, TiO2 dosage is 563 mg/L, and reaction time is 150 min for an initial concentration of the contaminants at 10 mg/L. Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of photocatalytic degradation. Low adsorption of contaminants on TiO2 surface and negligible degradation of contaminants using acetonitrile as solvent suggest that hydroxyl radical attack could be the predominant pathway in the removal process. The COD and TOC analyses of the samples confirmed the mineralization of the compounds to more than 60%.

AB Thirteen wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals were selected to explore their variations and behavior under hydrodynamic conditions in urban river systems. Four flow velocities were set, i.e., 0 cm/s for static condition, and 5, 10 and 20 cm/s for dynamic conditions. In the water phase, most of target compounds emerged big fluctuations between static and dynamic conditions. The lower concentrations were detected in the dynamic conditions. However, carbamazepine had minimum relative change during the whole 15-day tests with at least 85% of the initial concentration remaining. In the sediment, the concentrations of most pharmaceuticals in the dynamic conditions were higher than in the static condition, whereas carbamazepine showed big fluctuation in both static and dynamic conditions. With the change of the flow velocities, all target pharmaceuticals showed obviously different variation tendencies mainly due to the changes of environmental parameters, such as turbidity, dissolved matters, microbial biomass, and suspended particulates. In addition, five metabolites were selected to further investigate the transformation of diclofenac and carbamazepine with different flow velocities in the water phase. More diclofenac were transformed into 4-Hydroxy diclofenac in the water phase in the dynamic conditions. Moreover, in the case of a set flow velocity, the concentrations of some pharmaceuticals changed remarkably between the straight and turning channels of an urban river system. Overall, hydrodynamic conditions showed significant influences on the levels of target compounds in the aquatic environment and, therefore, could be taken into account in the risk assessment and control of these compounds.

AB This study focuses on the use of advanced oxidation processes as a tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants to degrade contaminants of emerging concern at the natural pH of the biologically treated wastewater. Different peroxide dosages and initial concentrations of a mix of three pharmaceuticals commonly present in wastewater (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen) were tested in a batch photoreactor. The addition of Fe2+ and TiO2 as catalysts was also tested with the aim of improving the degradation rate of the pharmaceuticals. Among the contaminants tested, ciprofloxacin was the pollutant that showed the best degradation. It was completely removed from water after 20 min of treatment under any of the experimental conditions assessed. High degradation percentages, between 89.83 and 100%, were achieved for ibuprofen, while carbamazepine shows the lowest degradation, ranging from 80.14 to 100%. In terms of global efficiency, a complete degradation was achieved when the concentration of the tested contaminants was similar to current concentration levels in urban wastewater effluents. The addition of the catalysts did not significantly improve the degradation rates.

AB In the present research, removal of a common pharmaceutical contaminant from wastewater was studied using micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) process with applying a laboratory-scale system. Sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant was used in this process. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied for evaluating the MEUF process performance. The results obtained from the experiments showed that sotalol hydrochloride drug rejection using ultrafiltration membrane was maximum 32.41%, while by adding the surfactant and forming the micelle this amount increased to 96.82%. By using the RSM and investigating the interaction of surfactant concentration, transmembrane pressure (TMP), and pH, it was found that the surfactant concentration had the most impact on the rejection. Moreover, among the studied parameters, TMP and surfactant concentration played an important role in variations of the permeate flux.

AB Magnetic carbon nanotube-TiO2 (MCNT-TiO2) composites that rely on the inherent magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes were synthesized and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole under solar irradiation and environmentally relevant conditions. Compared with a TiO2 reference catalyst, the MCNT-TiO2 composites exhibited a higher photodegradation rate due to the high surface area and extended visible light absorption. The photodegradation rate constants for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in pure water were (similar to)1.5 and (similar to)1.2 times greater than those for TiO2, respectively. The catalysts were tested in the presence of natural organic matter and rapid photodegradation rates for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were observed relative to bare TiO2, indicating that MCNT-TiO2 may be suitable for practical applications. Solar and UVC reactivation were used to recover the photocatalytic activity, and UVC irradiation was more efficient and maintained the performance of MCNT-TiO2 for consecutive treatment cycles. MCNT-TiO2 with its unique fast kinetics and high photodegradation activity toward micropollutants exhibits great potential as an alternative method for water and wastewater treatment.

AB Hydrogels are three dimensional materials with modifying surface which containing more functional groups and it is used in many applications such as hygienic products, agriculture, drug delivery systems, sealing, coal dewatering, food additives and pharmaceuticals. Mostly, it is implemented in biomedical applications like tissue engineering and regenerative medicines, diagnostics, wound dressing, separation of biomolecules or cells and barrier materials to regulate biological adhesions and in biosensors. Herein we report the preparation of aminated guar gum/graphene oxide (AGG/GO) hydrogel using borax as a crosslinker, which has a high surface area with a crosslinked structure for enhanced removal of dyes and heavy metals. The chemical moieties, morphological and structural properties of the AGG/GO hydrogel were examined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis respectively. The swelling properties of hydrogels were demonstrated, followed by viscoelastic studies using rheological analysis found that the material is stable up to an applied frequency of 10 Hz. Interestingly, removal efficiency of the AGG/GO hydrogels for Cu(II), Malachite green, Methylene blue and Rhodamine B dyes were found to be 88, 98, 90, and 75% respectively from aqueous solutions.

AB This study is focused on the fouling of flat-sheet and hollow-fiber membranes in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). A comprehensive investigation including scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), zeta potential, optical profilometer and contact angle, and flux modelling was presented in this study. The effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulated on cake-layer were also considered. The cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane formed much more than that on the hollow-fiber membrane. The thickness of cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane was effectively decreased by physical stripping. However, proteins indicating structures of Amide I and Amide II, and carbohydrates were observed on the stripped hollow-fiber membrane. According to the flux modelling results, the cake-layer formation and intermediate-adsorption were found as effective mechanisms on both membranes. Especially, these mechanisms were more effective for the hollow-fiber membrane due to irreversible fouling.

AB In this research, modification of bentonite and synthesis of Fe3O4/Bentonite nanocomposite are reported in the presence of ultrasound. The samples were prepared by chemical co-precipitation and sonochemical methods and the structural order, textural, magnetic, and surface area properties were examined using XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, VSM, BET, and point of zero charge pH (pH(pzc)) analysis. Then the as synthesized nanocomposite was used to remove nitrate, BOD and COD from water and industrial wastewater. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted, where the influence of several parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent amount, and nitrate concentration were studied. According to the results, the best nitrate removal (79%) by using the prepared nanocomposite was achieved at the pH of 5, the contact time of 90 min, adsorbent amount of 0.6 g and the initial nitrate concentration of 30 mg/l. For further investigation, some tests were conducted on industrial wastewater of pharmaceutical units to evaluate the BOD and COD reduction. Using 2 g of synthesized sample, 84.88% of BOD and 88.8% of COD of the industrial wastewater were removed.

AB This research surveyed influent and effluent concentration of pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants to analyze detection state. On the basis of analysis results, lab experiments were carried out to improve treatment rate and the result was proposed as a water quality control guideline of wastewater treatment plants. According to monthly pharmaceuticals concentration analysis result, antiinflammatory analgesic drug and antibiotics including Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, and Trimethoprim were detected in high concentration in the winter while antiepileptics including Carbamazepine were detected similar regardless of season. Existing biological treatment processes removed little of 4 pharmaceuticals except for the acetaminophen so they may be exposed to the surface water. In a lab experience to improve removal rate of pharmaceuticals, the compromise was not effect in removing pharmaceuticals while the ozonation was effective to remove 99% or more of pharmaceuticals. In addition, the activated carbon adsorption process showed high removal efficiency. Therefore, the biological treatment process and combined physicochemical oxidation process of ozone or AOP are effect in removing pharmaceuticals and it is proposed as the base data for water quality control so as to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants.

AB Three activated carbon coated titanium dioxide composites are evaluated as adsorbents for the removal of three pharmaceutical compounds: clofibric, gallic and salicylic acids from aqueous solutions. These composite materials are characterized by several techniques as SEM, FT-IR, TGA and point of zero charge determination. The adsorption mechanism of acids was investigated and compared to the adsorption on the virgin carbon. The analysis of adsorption isotherms and kinetic properties reveals that the addition of TiO2 increased the adsorption capacities of the initial material. The adsorption kinetics has been studied in terms of pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic models, and the Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Toth and Sips isotherms models have also been applied to the equilibrium adsorption data. The analysis of results indicated that the adsorption of acids on the activated carbon-titanium dioxide composites is well described by the pseudo-first order kinetic model and the Sips isotherm equation fitted the sorption experimental results better than other models.

AB Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/ oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90 min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/ H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC-MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process. Four byproducts(benzene-1-ethenyl-4-(2-methypropyl), benzene 1-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-isobutyl, 4'-(2-methylpropyl)acetophenone, ibuprofen methyl ester) were detected after UV-LED catalytic degradation of IBP solution. The present study showed that the UV-LED/catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of IBP in comparison to direct photolysis by UV-LED.

AB Increasing presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in water sources and their adverse health effects on aquatic life are major concerns for water utilities and authorities worldwide. The oxidation kinetics for degradation of ozone resistant steroid hormones were investigated to quantify their removal in natural water under varying water temperatures and pH. Studying effect of temperature on oxidation of these compounds is one of the novel aspects of this research. The fate of four progestogens (progesterone, medroxyprogesetrone, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone) and, for the first time, of the androgenic steroid testosterone, in the presence of ozone was measured at bench scale in ultrapure water, natural surface water and wastewater. The estimated second order constant rate for testosterone of 590 +/- 0.13 M(-1)s(-1) was comparable to our estimates and previous reports for similar structure progesterone (444-601 M(-1)s(-1)) and medroxyprogesterone (532 +/- 0.04 M(-1)s(-1)) and significantly lower than for levonorgestrel (2233 M(-1)s(-1)) and norethindrone (2292 M-1 s(-1)). For all compounds the second-order rate constants increased from 3 folds for norethindrone to 5.5 folds for progesterone with temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 degrees C. The required activation energy was estimated for the five selected steroids and ranged from 30 Kj mol(-1) (norethindrone) to 39 Kj mol(-1) (progesterone). The removal rates of the selected compounds were predicted in natural water and wastewater. Finally, we showed that ozonation using typical disinfection dosages (Ct(o3) = 2 mg min L-1) were capable of removing 77% (progesterone) to 99% (levonorgestrel) at 21 degrees C and even less (47% medroxyprogesterone to 96% norethindrone) at 5 degrees C of the selected compounds.

AB Effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) contains a complex mixture of contaminants and is a major worldwide source of aquatic pollution. We examined the effects of exposure to treated effluent from a municipal WWTP on the metabolic physiology of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We studied fish that were wildcaught or experimentally caged (28 d) downstream of the WWTP, and compared them to fish that were caught or caged at clean reference sites. Survival was reduced in fish caged at the effluent-contaminated site compared to those caged at the reference site. Resting rates of O-2 consumption (MO2) were higher in fish from the contaminated site, reflecting a metabolic cost of wastewater exposure. The increases in routine MO2 did not reduce aerobic scope (difference or quotient of maximal MO(2 )and resting MO2), suggesting that physiological compensations accompanied the metabolic costs of wastewater exposure. Fish exposed to wastewater also had larger hearts and livers. The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (cytochrome c oxidase, citrate synthase) per liver mass was unaltered across treatments, so the increased mass of this organ increased its cumulative oxidative capacity in the fish. Wastewater exposure also reduced glycogen content per liver mass. The effects of caging itself, based on comparisons between fish that were wild-caught or caged at clean sites, were generally subtle and not statistically significant. We conclude that exposure to wastewater effluent invokes a metabolic cost that leads to compensatory physiological adjustments that partially offset the detrimental metabolic impacts of exposure.

AB The current study aims to investigate the production of microalgae biomass as a function for different wet market wastewater ratios (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) and Scenedesmus sp. initial concentrations (10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7) cells/mL) through the phycoremediation process. The biomass production, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total organic compounds (TOC) were determined daily. The pseudo-first order kinetic model was used to measure the potential of Scendesmus sp. in removing nutrients while the Verhulst logistic kinetic model was used to study the growth kinetic. The study revealed that the maximum productivity of Scenedesmus sp. biomass was recorded with 10(6) cells/mL of the initial concentration in 50% wet market wastewater (98.54 mg/L/day), and the highest removal of TP, TN, and TOC was obtained (85, 90 and 65% respectively). Total protein and lipid contents in the biomass yield produced in the wet market wastewater were more than that in the biomass produced in the BBM (41.7 vs. 37.4 and 23.2 vs. 19.2%, respectively). The results of GC-MS confirmed detection of 44 compounds in the biomass from the wet market wastewater compared to four compounds in the BBM. These compounds have several applications in pharmaceutical and personal care products, chemical industry and antimicrobial activity. These findings indicated the applicability of wet market wastewater as a production medium for microalgae biomass.

AB In the present study, sole adsorption, Fenton's oxidation, ozone treatment and biochemical treatment by Alcaligenes feacalis (A. feacalis) and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum (E. aurantiacum) and combination of the above treatments have been studied. It was observed that Fenton's treatment is efficient for degradation of Pantoprazole in any concentration pantaprazole. In Fenton's process, the degradation obtained 56.77% at pH 3.5 in an hour and in ozone treatment, 36% removal was achieved in 8 min for 600 ppm concentration. The microbial treatment is proved to be a good one but in the lower range of pantoprazole about 200 mg/L. The degradation of pantoprazole was achieved 58.40% and 60.08% by using A. feacalis and E. aurantiacum respectively in 72 h. Combination treatment has been designed, and the system worked efficiently. In the first step either Fenton's treatment, activated carbon or ozone treatment were performed followed by biochemical treatment. The maximum percentage removal of pantoprozole was observed 90.17%, 81.57%, and 71.07% respectively. The process also proves that it is partially cost effective, energy saving and environmentally safe operation.

AB The presence of xenobiotics in the aquatic environment has drawn scientific concern due to possible detrimental effects on the ecosystems. With EU Decision 2015/495, a first Watch list of compounds that could potentially represent a threat for the environment was created, with the objective of gathering high quality monitoring data and support their prioritization. Literature data are still very scarce and the presence of many of the compounds has not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, all the 17 compounds of the EU Watch list 2015/495 were monitored in 14 sampling locations, comprised of freshwater and, for the first time, wastewater. The study was carried out in the Ebro delta, in the north east of Spain, a representative and crucial area not only for its environmental and naturalistic significance, but also for Spain's productivity, especially as regards rice agriculture. Results show that contamination originates both from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and agricultural activities. High levels of pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater, with azithromycin and diclofenac present at mean concentrations of 1.65 mu g/L and 636 ng/L respectively. In freshwater samples, besides antibiotics and diclofenac, substantial contamination by pesticides was reported, with oxadiazon reaching up to 591 ng/L and imidacloprid being present in 93% of samples. Moreover, the study provided insight into the origin of the selected contaminants. The removal of the studied micropollutants in WWTPs was low to moderate. The assessment of risk quotients, calculated based on the available PNECs, demonstrated that the concentrations recorded for these compounds may pose a significant risk in most sampling sites.

AB While wastewater treatment plants have been identified as the most prominent source of emerging micropollutants in surface waters, prediction of their ambient concentrations remains a challenge. This is due to the variability of loads entering individual treatment plants and of the elimination capacity by the latter as well as potential attenuation in the river network. Although geospatially detailed models exist, they suffer from the same data input uncertainties. Here, we investigated the concentration profiles of 20 emerging pollutants in different river stretches in Luxembourg with variable sanitary pressures. Using carbamazepine as a recalcitrant wastewater indicator, the correlation of the compounds to the latter revealed source and fate variability as well as specific emitters. Relating carbamazepine to sanitary pressure, expressed as the sum of population equivalents in a catchment divided by its surface [PE ha(-1)] allowed predicting the impact of emerging pollutants on the entire river network. The limited variability of the pollutant profiles allowed for prioritization of impacted stretches depending on the different sanitary pressures at risk quotient exceedance. The main drivers of impact were triclosan, diclofenac, clarithromycine and diuron. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was performed to investigate the ability of three different types of activated carbon to remove paroxetine from wastewater through adsorption. These types were extruded activated carbon (EAC), granular-activated carbon (GAC), and powdered-activated carbon (PAC). The three adsorbents were investigated using atomic force microscope, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the adsorption was dependent on the pH, and the removal efficiency of paroxetine increased with a decrease in pH value. The maximum removal efficiencies were 34, 40, and 86.5% for EAC, GAC, and PAC, respectively, at a pH of 4.5. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of paroxetine onto the three adsorbents can be expressed by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The intra-particle adsorption model showed that the adsorption mechanism of paroxetine using these adsorbents was controlled by a multistep mechanism. The Boyd kinetic model indicated that the liquid film diffusion may be involved in controlling the adsorption of paroxetine on the three adsorbents. Equilibrium studies showed that the adsorption isotherms could be expressed by the Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms for EAC, GAC, and PAC, respectively. The change in morphologies of adsorbents confirmed the occurrence of adsorption.

AB This study investigated the transformation of secondary amine pharmaceuticals in UV-C/NO3- and in nitrate-rich wastewater at 254 nm by taking diclofenac, diphenylamine, mefenamic acid and furosemide as probe compounds. The degradation of targeted compounds were positively related to nitrate concentration and mainly caused by the formation of peroxynitrite and related reactive nitrogen species (e.g., nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide radicals). Major transformation products were identified to provide fundamental understanding of the selective oxidation of secondary amine with reactive nitrogen species. UV photolysis, hydroxyl radical oxidation, nitration and nitrosation processes were found to be the most significant transformation pathways. In case of diphenylamine, for which most of the identified intermediates were available as standard, the relative significance of each transformation route could be established, highlighting for the first time the important role of N-nitrosation processes in UV/NO3- treatment followed by the decomposition of the resulting N-nitroso compounds by an alpha hydroxylation mechanism. This specific transformation pathway was of concern because it constitutes the molecular basis of N-nitrosamine carcinogenicity and may contribute to the increase in effluent genotoxicity under UV-C treatment in addition to the formation of nitrophenols. Hydrogenocarbonate ions at concentration values higher than 300 mg/L appeared to be a protective specie against nitrosation processes due to the formation of carbamate adducts but H2O2 in UV-C/H2O2 could be responsible for an exacerbation of the N-nitrosation pathway due to an addition source of hydroxyl radical in the system. The occurrence of major transformation products of diclofenac was confirmed in nitrate-rich wastewater under UV-C treatment at pilot-scale operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic resistance is an emerging global health crisis, driven largely by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, there are examples in which the production of these antimicrobial agents has polluted the environment with active antibiotic residues, selecting for antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry. In this work, we have used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the taxonomic structure and resistance gene composition of sludge communities in a treatment plant in Croatia receiving wastewater from production of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin. We found that the total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was three times higher in sludge from the treatment plant receiving wastewater from pharmaceutical production than in municipal sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Zagreb. Surprisingly, macrolide resistance genes did not have higher abundances in the industrial sludge, but genes associated with mobile genetic elements such as integrons had. We conclude that at high concentrations of antibiotics, selection may favor taxonomic shifts towards intrinsically resistant species or strains harboring chromosomal resistance mutations rather than acquisition of mobile resistance determinants. Our results underscore the need for regulatory action also within Europe to avoid release of antibiotics into the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sequential biofiltration (SBF) has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to achieve enhanced biological removal of various trace organic compounds (TOrCs) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents by establishing oxic and carbon-limited conditions. This study investigated options to further advance the feasibility of SBF systems by reducing empty bed contact times (EBCTs). Additional experiments were conducted to investigate the pre-treatment of WWTP effluent by coagulation as an option to further decrease the organic carbon availability during SBF. Results indicated that an EBCT reduction in the first filter stage from 90 to 45 and 30 min adversely affected process performance regarding the removal of organic bulk parameters and several TOrCs over short-term. However, after an extended adaptation period of ten weeks comparable performance was observed in two SBF systems with first stage filters operated at EBCTs of 90 and 45 min. The pretreatment of secondary effluent by coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation was not found to enhance the performance of an SBF system despite substantial removal of organic bulk parameters during the pretreatment. However, despite the vast removal of total phosphorous during coagulation, nutrient limitation was not found to adversely affect the biological performance of the subsequent SBF system.

AB The removal efficiencies (REs) of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (six antibiotics-clarithromycin, ofioxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim -, four beta-blockers -atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol-, two antihypertensives/diuretics -furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide-, three lipid regulators -bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil-, and four psychiatric medications -carbamazepine, diazepam, lorazepam and paroxetine) were ascertained in a pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A(2)O) system treating urban wastewater, long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of bacteria, archaea and fungi communities in the activated sludge. The results showed that mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) were operational parameters significantly influencing the REs of five of the analyzed PhACs in the A(2)O system. Biota-environment (BIO-ENV) analysis revealed strong correlations between population shifts of the activated sludge community and the REs of PhACs of the different pharmaceutical families. Increased REs of clarithromycin, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were concomitant to higher relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes classified within the Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), while those of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomethylovorans (Euryarchaea) correlated positively with the REs of up to seven PhACs belonging to different therapeutic groups.

AB This study examined the removal of varying concentrations of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (CIP) over the long-term (120 days) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The results showed that 50-76% CIP was removed with 0.5-1.5 mg CIP/L in the feed, although at 4.7 mg/L its removal efficiency decreased to < 20%. It was found that biological degradation was the main mechanism for removing CIP, while adsorption onto the sludge only contributed a small fraction, and an even smaller fraction was due to the waste sludge discharged. CIP was biodegraded to some degree in the AnMBR, with some intermediate compounds detected using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. This work showed the effectiveness of an AnMBR in removing CIP at low concentrations of < 1.5 mg/L, and hence may be an effective treatment for removing other antibiotics from wastewater.

AB This study elucidates the impact of draw solution chemistry (in terms of pH and draw solute species) and membrane fouling on water flux and the rejection of trace organic contaminants by forward osmosis. The results show that draw solution chemistry could induce a notable impact on both water flux and TrOCs rejection. In addition, the impact was further influenced by membrane fouling. The reverse flux of proton (or hydroxyl) could alter the feed solution pH, which governed the separation of ionisable TrOCs. In addition, charged compounds generally exhibited higher rejections than neutral ones by the clean membrane. Electrostatic interaction, rather than size exclusion, was therefore the dominant rejection mechanism for most compounds. There was also a weak correlation between rejection and molecular sizes of the 43 TrOCs. Compared with Na+, Li+ with a larger hydrated radius showed a significantly lower reverse salt flux, resulting in a lower ionic strength and therefore a stronger electrostatic interaction. A fouling cake layer consisted of low molecular weight neutral organics could also affect TrOC rejection due to pore blockage and cake-enhanced concentration polarisation.

AB Agriculture is considered as the main source of water contamination by pesticides. However, food packaging or processing industries are also recognised as relevant point sources of contamination by these compounds, not yet investigated in depth. The objective of this work has been to improve current knowledge about the presence and concentration of pesticides in the effluent of a food processing industry, as well as to investigate their main transformation products (TPs). An analytical strategy combining target and suspect analysis has been applied to provide an evaluation of the effluents. The methodology involves solid-phase extraction (SPE) of wastewater samples followed by (i) liquid chromatography quadrupole-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS/MS) for quantitative target analysis and (ii) liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-HRMS) to identify non-target pesticides and possible TPs. The results revealed the presence of 17 of the target pesticides analysed and 3 additional ones as a result of the suspect screening performed by HRMS. The TPs were investigated for the pesticides found at the highest concentrations: imazalil (7038-19802 ng/L), pyrimethanil (744-9591 ng/L) and thiabendazole (341-926 ng/L). Up to 14 TPs could be tentatively identified, demonstrating the relevance of this type of studies. These data provide a better understanding of the occurrence of pesticides and their TPs in agro-food industrial effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the growth of both the pharmaceutical industry and the human population and longevity, more drugs are used and processed each day. Inevitably, these pharmaceuticals enter wastewater through human excretion and improper disposal of leftovers. One such medication, diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is of importance due to its widespread consumption, and prevalence in aquatic environments. To study the sub-lethal effects of diltiazem on aquatic animals, we investigated its impacts no feeding behaviour, heart rate, respiration, growth, and reproduction of a bioindicator species, Daphnia magna. When exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, D. magna increased their heart rate by 12% and oxygen consumption by 48%. However, exposure did not have any effects on thoracic limb movement frequency or peristalsis (i.e. feeding behaviour). Individuals exposed to diltiazem for a longer duration (16 days) showed a 44% decrease in lipid reserves and produced between 17 and 28% fewer neonates which were 10-12% larger. Our study demonstrated that exposure to diltiazem creates an energy imbalance in D. magna which could, in the long run, influence their populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anticancer drugs are currently widely used for the treatment of cancer and have been detected in hospital effluents, wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water samples in concentrations up to the mu g.L-1 range. Within the next two decades, the annual number of cancer cases is expected to rise, which will lead to an increase in the consumption of anticancer drugs. These drugs are extremely important due to their highly potent mechanism of action and their potential risk for humans and the environment. Therefore, the development of effective treatment options is crucial to avoid the release of these emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to assess the viability of nanofiltration for remediation, using as benchmark two representative membranes (Desal 5DK and NF270) to remove four widely consumed anticancer drugs (paclitaxel, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide) from different matrices (laboratory grade water, synthetic urine and real secondary effluent). Experimental results showed that the Desal 5DK membrane is more effective than the NF270 membrane for the rejection of these compounds. It presented average rejections higher than 89% for all the target anticancer drugs spiked in synthetic urine and real secondary effluent, showing no significant matrix influence on the rejection results. Daphnia magna toxicity tests showed that the immobilization effect observed in the permeate samples was lower than the feed samples.
   The target compounds have very different structures and physico-chemical properties and thus the high effectiveness reported for the Desal 5DK membrane is a good indication of what can be expected to a multitude of compounds.

AB Levofloxacin-a fluoroquinolone antibiotic-is a potential wastewater contaminant generated by pharmaceutical industries. Novel one-dimensional disilver dimolybdate (Ag2Mo2O7) structures were developed to form a heterojunction with thin nanosheets of MoS2 on the surface of Ag2Mo2O7. A photocatalyst was used for the efficient removal of levofloxacin under visible light. The processing of the Ag2Mo2O7 structures was optimized by altering the hydrothermal duration with structural analysis using Rietveld refinement. An enhanced catalytic activity for levofloxacin degradation (efficiency of 97%) was observed with 30 wt% MoS2/Ag2Mo2O7, following first-order kinetics. The superior activity is ascribed to the well-aligned and favorable band positions, which allowed efficient charge transfer between the photogenerated charge carriers. The direct Z-scheme led to the photogeneration of a large number of electrons at the MoS2 surface. An investigation with radical scavengers indicated that superoxide radicals played a significant role in the degradation process, which was confirmed by electron spin resonance spectral measurements. Detailed parametric studies were performed, and the reaction mechanism was examined, providing an insight into the development of such hybrid microcomposites for the removal of hazardous pharmaceuticals from the environment.

AB Emerging pollutants appear more frequently in the environment and adverse effects affects not only human health but also the environment. This study evaluated the efficiency of two types of constructed wetlands (CWs) and a 12-unit mesocosm-scale system to remove ibuprofen and caffeine compounds: (i) vertical flow constructed wetland (VF-CW) planted with Heliconia rostrata using sand as filter media with and without earthworms; (ii) free-floating surface horizontal flow constructed wetland with Eichhornia crassipes macrophyte (FFM-CW); and (iii) mesocosm-scale 12 unit system using Eichhornia crassipes with clean water (opposed to wastewater), where the intention was to evaluate the removal of the added compounds without effects from wastewater or biofilm. The systems were efficient in removing the pollutants and demonstrated a limit for the applied COD and BOD rates, where the adequate application rate was 120 g COD.m(-2).d(-1) and 70 g BOD.m(-2).d(-1) to obtain maximum removal efficiency. TP varied independent of the applied load, while TN and NH4+ showed removals (99%) close to the applied rates (9 g TN.m(-2).d(-1) and 7 g NH4+.m(-2).d(-1) for the VF-CW and 8.5 g TN. m(-2). d(-1) and 5 g NH4+. m(-2). d(-1) for the FFM-CW). The emerging contaminants removal efficiency in the VF-CW was 97 and 89% for caffeine and ibuprofen, respectively. Inserting earthworms did not show a significant variation in relation to compound removal. The FFM-CW system removed 94 and 89% of the caffeine and ibuprofen, respectively. The VF-CW system with filter media presented better removal for caffeine and ibuprofen when compared to the FFMCW. The performance between the macrophyte E. crassipes systems in the mesocosm units showed potential to remove emerging compounds even though clean water was used, with a 70% removal efficiency for caffeine and ibuprofen.

AB The release of pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments is a serious concern due to the persistence and potential health and environmental risks of these substances. Surface and ground waters are polluted with a variety of pharmaceuticals due to insufficient water purification processes in wastewater treatment plants. Here, we report a simple procedure for the production of composite materials consisting of zero-valent iron embedded in few-layer graphene, Fe/graphene, through induction annealing at 900 degrees C. Zero-valent iron was observed as magnetic 1 mu m-sized crystals embedded in the graphene matrix appearing in the alpha- and gamma-forms. This Fe/graphene composite was applied as an adsorbent for the removal of tetracycline (a pharmaceutical) from water. The Fe/graphene showed high tetracycline removal efficiency (422 mg/g) under optimized conditions. Furthermore, the Fe/graphene possessed self-regenerating features prolonging its lifetime and total removal capacity up to 660 mg/g, thus making it a potential material for removing tetracycline from water.

AB Natural and synthetic estrogens have been widely detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent as well as in the corresponding receiving aqueous environment and other ecosystems. Microalgae can be used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater, but the species-dependent removal of estrogens needs further investigation. In this study we investigated estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol removals and transformation products by four common microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum and S. quadricauda could more effectively remove all three estrogens in synthetic wastewater effluent. The estrogenic activities i.e. 1713-estradiol equivalency determined by yeast estrogenic screening assay showed substantial estrogenic activity reductions after biotransformation by H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum, and S. quadricauda. Quadrupole Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry results identified several possible ring-cleavage metabolites as well as their metabolic pathways, which had not been reported yet, confirming the estrogen degradation rather than mere absorption or uptake by microalgae. The findings demonstrate that not only can some specific bacteria degrade estrogens, but also the widely living microalgae are able to degrade these emerging pollutants, suggesting that microalgae could be an advanced treatment of WWTPs to remove nutrients and estrogens.

AB Chitin and chitosan are biopolymers that have diverse applications in medicine, agriculture, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, wastewater treatment and textiles. With bio-origins, they easily blend with biological systems and show exemplified compatibility which is mandatory when it comes to biomedical research. Chitin and chitosan are ecofriendly, however the processes that are used to recover them aren't ecofriendly. The focus of this work is to attempt an ecofriendly, sustainable phytomediated one pot recovery of chitosan from commercial chitin and from crab and shrimp shells and squid pen solid wastes. Graviola extracts have been employed, given the fact file that their active ingredients acetogenins actively interact with chitin in insects (resulting in its application as an insecticide). With that as the core idea, the graviola extracts were chosen for orchestrating chitin recovery and a possible chitin to chitosan transformation. The results confirm that graviola extracts did succeed in recovery of chitosan nanofibers from commercial chitin flakes and recovery of chitosan particles directly from solid marine wastes of crab, shrimp and squids. This is a first time report of a phyto-extract mediated novel chitosan synthesis method.

AB Sewage output contains a wide range of organic materials, such as pharmaceutical compounds. These compounds have harmful effects on the environment, such as generation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; therefore, their degradation has been considered as one of the environmental challenges. The purpose of this research is to synthesize graphene reinforced with nanocomposites of iron oxide/zinc oxide/tin oxide and evaluate its ability to photocatalytic degradation of azithromycin in the aqueous environment. GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposite was characterized by various techniques including XRD, FT-IR, TEM and VSM. In the batch system, the effect of pH, contact time, catalyst content and initial concentration of azithromycin was investigated; in this system, under optimal conditions of pH = 3, 120 min with 1 g/L of GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2, 90.06% of 30 mg/L azithromycin were degraded under UV-C irradiation. In the continuous system, the variables of bed height, flow rate and initial concentration of azithromycin have been investigated. The times to reach the column breakthrough point (C-b = 0.02C(0)) at heights of 6, 8 and 10 cm are 5, 8 and 14 min, respectively. By increasing the height of the bed from 6 to 10 cm, the azithromycin degradation rate increases; the reason for this increase can be due to the increase in contact time. The results indicate that the degradation of azithromycin in a constant bed column strongly depends on these parameters; actually, the time to reach the breaking point decreased with increase of flow rate and initial concentration of azithromycin while increasing with increase of bed height. Estimating the empty bed residence time showed that this model is in good agreement with laboratory data. Therefore, considering the high ability of GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2 to eliminate azithromycin, this compound can be used as an effective catalyst for the degradation of antibiotics in aquatic environments.

AB Freshwaters are increasingly exposed to complex mixtures of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from municipal wastewater, which are known to alter freshwater communities' structure and functioning. However, their interaction with other disturbances and whether their combined effects can impact ecological resilience (i.e., the ability of a system to tolerate disturbances without altering the system's original structure and processes) remain unexplored. Using in situ mesocosms in 2 lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic), we assessed whether a pulse exposure to sublethal concentrations of 12 PPCPs affects the ecological resilience of natural phytoplankton communities that experienced an abrupt environmental change involving the destabilization of the water column through mixing. Such mixing events are predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold, leading to more frequent storms, which disrupt stratification in lakes and force communities to restructure. We assessed their combined effects on community metrics (biomass, species richness, and composition) and their relative resilience using 4 indicators (cross-scale, within-scale, aggregation length, and gap length), inferred from phytoplankton communities by discontinuity analysis. The mixing disturbance alone had negligible effects on the community metrics, but when combined with chemical contaminants significant changes were measured: reducing total biomass, species richness, and altered community composition of phytoplankton. Once these changes occurred, they persisted until the end of the experiment (day 20), when the communities' structures from the 2 highest exposure levels diverged from the controls. The resilience indicators were not affected by PPCPs but differed significantly between lakes, with lower resilience found in the eutrophic lake. Thus, PPCPs can significantly alter community structures and reinforce mechanisms that maintain ecosystems in a "degraded state." Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Conceptual sewer models are useful tools to assess the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in integrated wastewater systems. However, the definition of their model structure is highly subjective, and obtaining a realistic simulation of the in-sewer hydraulic retention time (HRT) is a major challenge without detailed hydrodynamic information or with limited measurements from the sewer network. This study presents an objective approach for defining the structure of conceptual sewer models in view of modelling MP fate in large urban catchments. The proposed approach relies on GIS-based information and a Gaussian mixture model to identify the model optimal structure, providing a multi-catchment conceptual model that accounts for HRT variability across urban catchment. This approach was tested in a catchment located in a highly urbanized Italian city and it was compared against a traditional single-catchment conceptual model (using a single average HRT) for the fate assessment of reactive MPs. Results showed that the multi-catchment model allows for a successful simulation of dry weather flow patterns and for an improved simulation of MP fate compared to the classical single-catchment model. Specifically, results suggested that a multi-catchment model should be preferred for (i) degradable MPs with half-life lower than the average HRT of the catchment and (ii) MPs undergoing formation from other compounds (e.g. human metabolites); or (iii) assessing MP loads entering the wastewater treatment plant from point sources, depending on their location in the catchment. Overall, the proposed approach is expected to ease the building of conceptual sewer models, allowing to properly account for HRT distribution and consequently improving MP fate estimation.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) containing wastewater with a concentration of 1-5 mg/L was treated in an activated sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR), for 60 days, in order to investigate the overall performance of the SBR, the parameter variations during a typical cycle, the chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the evolution of microbial community. The average removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N and TN were > 85%, while > 40% of the IBU was removed and the removal efficiencies of TP fluctuated around similar to 75%. The EPS content increased significantly with IBU addition (p < 0.01). Fulvic acid-like substances in the chemical composition of EPS increased during the stable operation phase. Proteobacteria associated with nitrogen removal was the dominant phylum, which can also resist IBU stress. For the denitrifying bacteria, the OTUs of both Rhodobacter and Pseudomonas increased from day 1-30 and reduced on day 60 (p < 0.01), which was opposite to the results observed for Rhodocyclaceae (phosphorus-accumulating bacteria). The OTUs of Acidovorax showed an increasing trend (p < 0.01), whereas the OTUs for Nitrospira (nitrite oxidizers) and Nitrosomonas (ammonia oxidizers) decreased significantly (p < 0.05).

AB A bench-scale column experiment was performed to study the removal of 31 selected organic micropollutants (MPs) and phosphorus by lignite, xyloid lignite (Xylit), granular activated carbon (GAC), Polonite (R) and sand over a period of 12 weeks. In total 29 out of the 31 MPs showed removal efficiency > 90% by GAC with an average removal of 97 +/- 6%. Xylit and lignite were less efficient with an average removal of 80 +/- 28% and 68 +/- 29%, respectively. The removal efficiency was found to be impacted by the characterization of the sorbents and physicochemical properties of the compounds, as well as the interaction between the sorbents and compounds. For instance, Xylit and lignite performed well for relatively hydrophobic (log octanol/water partition coefficient (K-ow) >= 3) MPs, while the removal efficiency of moderately hydrophilic, highly hydrophilic and negatively charged MPs were lower. The organic sorbents were found to have more functional groups at their surfaces, which might explain the higher adsorption of MPs to these sorbents. The removal of several MPs improved after four weeks in sand, Xylit, GAC and lignite which may be related to increased biological activity and biofilm development. GAC and sand had limited ability to remove phosphorus (12 +/- 27% and 14 +/- 2%, respectively), while the calcium-silicate material Polonite (R) precipitated phosphorus efficiently and increased the total phosphorus removal from 12% to 96% after the GAC filter.

AB In this study, we examined eight typical and widely detected pharmaceuticals (PhAs) removal in an anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge system (five antibiotics: sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enoxacin (ENO), and three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET) and diclofenac (DIC)). The results showed that the SRB sludge had the higher removal efficacy (20 to 90%) for antibiotics (SD, SMX, TMP, CIP and ENO) than NSAIDs (<20%) via adsorption and biodegradation under different operating conditions. Based on a series of batch studies, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (CIP and ENO) were instantly (<15 min) removed (similar to 98%) via adsorption on SRB sludge with adsorption coefficient (K-d) as high as 25.3 +/- 1.8 L/g-suspended solids (SS). And thermodynamics results indicated that the adsorption of CIP and ENO on SRB sludge was spontaneous (Gibbs free energy change (Delta G degrees) <0 kJ/mol), exothermic (enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) <0 kJ/mol), and the adsorption process involved both physisorption and chemisorption (absolute value of Delta H degrees = 20 to 80 kJ/mol). Three widely prescribed antibiotics (SMX, TMP and an) were further investigated for their possible biodegradation pathways along with functional enzymes involved through a series of batch experiments. The biotransformation intermediates indicated that biotransformations of SMX and CIP in SRB sludge system could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase (SR) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, respectively. TMP was likely biotransformed via O-demethylation and N-acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with CYP450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes. This study provided new insight into PhAs removal in SRB sludge system, and has significant potential of implementing sulfur-mediated biological process for the treatment of PhAs containing wastewater.

AB Electrodialysis (ED) is a promising emerging electrochemical membrane technology for nutrient concentration and recovery from wastewater. However associated environmental safety aspects have to be assessed before utilizing concentrated nutrient produced by ED, for instance as fertilizer. Municipal wastewaters contain various micropollutants that have the potential of being concentrated during the ED treatment processes. This study quantified the transport of pharmaceuticals during ED nutrient recovery from synthetic centrate wastewater. Specifically, it is evaluated whether pharmaceutical micropollutants are mobile, and therefore able to transport across the cation exchange membranes and concentrate into the ED concentrate product. Results demonstrate that NH4+-N, PO43--P and K+ could be concentrated up to 5 times in the concentrated ED product (3700-4000 mg/L NH4+-N, 21-25 mg/L PO43--P, 990-1040 mg/L K+). Target micropollutants, such as diclofenac, carbamazepine and furosemide were largely retained in the diluent, with less than 8% being transported across to the concentrate product (feed micropollutant concentration 10 or 100 mu g/L) based on the final target pharmaceutical amounts in the ED concentrate product (mu g). Some transport of micropollutants such as atenolol, metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide was observed to the concentrate product. For instance a final concentration of 10.3, 9.4 and 8.6 mu g/L on average was measured for these pollutants in the final ED concentrate product (final volume similar to 1 L) in experiments with a feed water (initial volume 20 L) containing only 10 mu g/L of target pharmaceuticals. Transport of pharmaceuticals across the ED membranes was concluded to be dominated mainly by the molecule hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity as well as electrostatic interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and ED membranes. Particularly excluded were those having a negative charge and high hydrophobicity such as diclofenac and ibuprofen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), as an emerging contaminant in aquatic environments, has sparked increasing concerns about its impact on the environment. Nitrification in wastewater treatment processing has removed DCF to a large extent. However, the removal characteristics and mechanisms of DCF in the nitrification process are still poorly understood. In this study, enriched nitrifying sludge was used to investigate the transformation of DCF during the nitrification process. Elimination of DCF caused by volatilization, hydrolyzation and adsorption was limited. Abiotic nitration removal was confirmed as significant in enriched nitrifying sludge at a low pH and high nitrite concentration. Free nitrite acid was proposed as the reaction species participating in the DCF transformation process, and a regression equation was developed to predict the contribution of abiotic nitration on DCF removal in enriched nitrifying sludge. By slowly and continuously adding an ammonia stock solution and controlling the pH, we avoided the effect of abiotic nitration removal, and DCF biodegradation was positively correlated to specific ammonium oxidation rates (SAORs). The removal of DCF fit the first order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.8285, p < 0.05) with an SAOR of 0.25 mg NH4+-N/(gMLSS.min). The high removal rate constant of k (0.1286 L/(gMLSS.h)) and short half-life (2.48 h) revealed the strong capability of nitrifying bacteria to transform DCF. Nine DCF transformation products were identified and three of them were quantified in the transformation process. The formation of kinetic profile 4-OH-DCF, 5-OH-DCF and DCF-Benzoic acid (DCF-BA) implied that hydroxylation may be the first reaction of DCF and DCF-BA may be a terminal product that resists further degradation. The postulated reactions concerning the transformation of DCF were hydroxylation, lactam formation and oxidation. Accordingly, a detailed degradation pathway was presented.

AB This work aimed to assess the fixed-bed adsorptive performance of a primary paper mill sludge-based granular activated carbon (PSA-PA) for the removal of pharmaceuticals, namely carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and paroxetine (PAR), from water. The breakthrough curves corresponding to the adsorption of CBZ at different flow rates and in two different matrices (distilled and municipal wastewater) were firstly determined, which allowed to select the most favorable flow rate for the subsequent experiments. The fixed-bed adsorption of CBZ, SMX and PAR from single and ternary solutions in wastewater showed that the performance of PSA-PA was different for each pharmaceutical. According to the obtained breakthrough curves, the poorest bed adsorption capacity, either from single or ternary solution, was observed for SMX, which may be related with electrostatic repulsion at the pH of the wastewater used (pH similar to 7.3-7.7). Also, the bed adsorption capacity of PSA-PA for SMX, in the ternary solution, was notoriously lower compared to the single solution, while it slightly decreased for CBZ and even increased for PAR. The regeneration studies showed that the CBZ adsorption capacity of the PSA-PA bed decreased about 38 and 71% after the first and the second thermal regeneration stages, respectively. This decline was comparatively larger than the corresponding reduction of the PSA-PA specific surface area (SBET), which decreased only 5 and 25% for the first and second regeneration stages, respectively, and pointed to the lack of viability of more than one regeneration stage.

AB A series of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes based on mixed matrix of chromium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3-Cr) photocatalyst and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) were systematically prepared by non-solvent induced phase inversion technique. Porous PVDF membrane and mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporated with 3-10 wt% SrTiO3-Cr were produced in the UF range using polyethylene glycol as a porogen additive. The crystal morphology and electronic property of as-synthesized Cr-doped SrTiO3 nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and UV-Vis DRS. We found that the SrTiO3-Cr nanoparticles are cubic perovskite structure of approximately 30-40 nm in size with a low band gap energy of 2.05 eV. The morphology, surface roughness, hydrophilicity and textural properties of SrTiO3-Cr/PVDF MMMs were comprehensively characterized using field emission-scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, sessile drop technique, and capillary flow porometer. The SrTiO3-Cr was observed to be homogeneously dispersed in all the MMMs and provided additional anti-fouling properties from Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein. The membrane UF property and tri-cycling performance were evaluated under three distinct protocols in (1) Dark, (2) constant UVA exposure, and (3) UVA during post-treatment clean only. By increasing the SrTiO3-Cr concentration, the MMMs displayed an improved homogeneity and macropore distribution with enhanced water permeability given by 51-110 LMH bar(-1) pure water flux and 37 to 45 LMH bar(-1) BSA water flux in the Dark. A consistently high BSA rejection of 95% and an improved anti-fouling property under constant UVA irradiation were achieved due to a combination of photo-induced hydrophilic and photocatalytic effect. Also, a significant improvement in UF performance in terms of membrane flux recovery was observed in the 3rd protocol signifying that the effect of protein fouling on membrane filtration was further reduced due to a lower degree of BSA fragment deposition in the membrane pores. The findings in this study dramatically lower the operational constraints (transmembrane pressure, membrane cleaning, use of UVA) in the protein filtration process and offer an innovative membrane material for the research of photo-induced, anti-fouling membranes for protein separation applications.

AB The phytotoxicity and degradation of ofloxacin (OFX) in duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza based system was estimated in this study. For that, OFX was added in an environmentally relevant range (0.01-1.0 mg L-1) in medium (Hoagland nutrient) and toxicity biomarkers, i.e. changes in plant biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), photopigment (Chl-a, Chl-b and carotenoids), protein content, antioxidative enzymes (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; and ascorbate peroxidases, APX) in fronds were estimated. The batch-scale setups (250 ml) was prepared in triplicate for each concentration of OFX and reared in growth chambers (Algae Tron AG 230) for 7 d. Results suggested that the high concentrations of OFX caused a reduction in biomass (4.8-41.3%), relative root growth (RGR), protein (4.16-11.28%) and photopigment contents. The fronds in OFX spiked setups showed an increased level of antioxidative enzymes: CAT (0.230-0.338 mmol(H2O2) mg(-1) protein), APX (0.043-0.074 mmol(ascorbate) mg(-1) protein), and SOD (0.267-0.317 U mg(-1) protein) than control. At the end (7 d), the residual OFX content in the medium was also estimated, and results suggested a significant (p < 0.05) reduction (93.73-98.36%) in OFX content than control setup (54.76-75.53%) at the end of the experimentation. The trend of residual OFX suggested phytodegradation as a significant mechanism of antibiotic degradation other than hydrolysis and photodegradation processes. This study indicates that duckweed can be an effective bio-tool for the removal of environmental relevant concentration of the antibiotics from the wastewater.

AB The membrane aerated biofilms reactor (MABR) is an emerging technology in wastewater treatment with particular advantages including high rate nitrification, and very high oxygen transfer efficiencies. In this study a synthetic feed water incorporating tetracycline (TC) was investigated in a MABR. Simultaneous removal of ammonium and tetracycline (TC) in the reactor, formation of TC transformation products (TPs), and microbial community analysis in the biofilm growing on the membrane were performed. A range of TC and ammonium loading rates and the effect of different infra-membrane oxygen pressures were on treatment performance were systematically investigated. Successful nitrification and TC degradation were achieved with the highest TC removal (63%) obtained at a HRT of 18 h HRT and 0.41 bar gas pressure. It has shown that different operating conditions (HRT and gas pressure) do not cause a significant change in ammonium removal. The concentration of TPs such as ETC, EATC, and ATC was determined to be at the ppb level. Molecular results showed that MABR reactor was mainly dominated by beta-proteobacteria. The relative abundance of this group decreased in parallel with the increasing ammonium and TC loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly fluorescent carbon nanodots are promising fluorophores for biochemical, pharmaceutical, and environmental analysis due to their facile preparation, biocompatibility, tunability, and low-cost precursors. The selectivity improvements towards an environmentally interesting analyte are challenging in analytical chemistry. Herein, a surface modification using a mixed solvent was used to prepare fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) as selective fluorophores for the detection of mercury ions (Hg2+). The solvothermal method was used for the fabrication of 4-6 nm CDs using xylose as a carbon precursor and ethanol-H2O as a mixed solvent. Moreover, optical, morphological, and surface characterizations were thoroughly conducted. The fluorescence emission of the CDs was selectively quenched after the addition of mercury ions and restored by the addition of cysteine. The CDs were successfully used for the quantitative detection of Hg2+ ions without interferences. The fabricated nanoprobe exhibited the good linearity range of 50-800 nM (R-2 = 0.9947), and a low detection limit down to 10 nM for Hg2+ was calculated. The selectivity experiments showed that the fluorescent probe was specific for Hg2+ even in the presence of interferences. The CDs were stable under rigorous conditions such as extreme ionic strength and low and high pH values. In addition, the CDs were photo- and thermostable; this made the CDs a promising fluorophore for the fabrication of a rugged and robust nanoprobe towards the detection of Hg2+. The Hg2+ ions in tap and wastewater were determined quantitatively with statistically good spike recoveries and standard deviations.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment is not sufficient for the removal of hygienically relevant bacteria and achieves only limited reductions. This study focuses on the reduction efficiencies of two semi-industrial ultrafiltration units operating at a large scale municipal wastewater treatment plant. In total, 7 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, together with 3 taxonomic gene markers targeting specific facultative pathogenic bacteria were analysed via qPCR analyses before and after advanced treatment. In parallel with membrane technologies, an ozone treatment (1 g ozone/g DOC) was performed for comparison of the different reduction efficiencies. Both ultrafiltration units showed increased reduction efficiencies for facultative pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes of up to 6 log units, resulting mostly in a strong reduction of the bacterial targets. In comparison, the ozone treatment showed some reduction efficiency, but was less effective compared with ultrafiltration due to low ozone dosages frequently used for micro-pollutant removal at municipal wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, metagenome analyses demonstrated the accumulation of facultative pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factor genes, and metabolic gene targets in the back flush retentate of the membranes, which opens further questions about retentate fluid material handling at urban wastewater treatment plants.

AB The environment receives antibiotics through a combination of direct application (e.g., aquaculture and fruit production), as well as indirect release through pharmaceutical manufacturing, sewage and animal manure. Antibiotic concentrations in many sewage-impacted rivers are thought to be sufficient to select for antibiotic resistance genes. Yet, because antibiotics are nearly always found associated with antibiotic-resistant faecal bacteria in wastewater, it is difficult to distinguish the selective role of effluent antibiotics within a 'sea' of gut-derived resistance genes. Here we examine the potential for macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing in England to select for resistance in the River Thames catchment, England. We show that 64% and 74% of the length of the modelled catchment is chronically exposed to putative resistance-selecting concentrations (PNEC) of macrolides and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Under current macrolide usage, 115 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (8% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Similarly, under current fluoroquinolone usage, 223 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (16% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Our results reveal that if reduced prescribing was the sole mitigating measure, that macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing would need to decline by 77% and 85%, respectively, to limit resistance selection in the catchment. Significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing are feasible, but innovation in sewage-treatment will be necessary for achieving substantially-reduced antibiotic loads and inactivation of DNA-pollution from resistant bacteria. Greater confidence is needed in current risk-based targets for antibiotics, particularly in mixtures, to better inform environmental risk assessments and mitigation.

AB Clean water became one of the major concerns of the 21st century. The occurrence of micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems poses serious public health and environmental problems, leading to true challenges in the development of sustainable and cost-effective alternative technologies for wastewater treatment processes. As a result, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been emerging as easy-to-prepare, inexpensive, and environmentally benign media showing a high potential for water applications. The main goal of this work is the development of hydrophobic DESs for the removal of ciprofloxacin, identified as one of the top 10 priority micropollutants, from water environments. In particular, DESs composed of natural neutral components, such as menthol and fatty acids, and also DESs based on the combination of quaternary ammonium salts and natural fatty acids were evaluated as potential extractants. The molar ratio of C-12:C-10 displays the second highest solubility value of ciprofloxacin and the lowest water solubility, which leads to the best extraction efficiency of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, extraction efficiencies were maximized by optimizing the experimental factors using a central composite design combined with a response surface methodology. Finally, aiming at full sustainability, a circular process was developed by recycling and reusing the hydrophobic DES through the use of activated carbon.

AB Increasing global reliance on stormwater control measures to reduce discharge to surface water, increase groundwater recharge, and minimize contaminant delivery to receiving water-bodies necessitates improved understanding of stormwater-contaminant profiles. A multiagency study of organic and inorganic chemicals in urban stormwater from 50 runoff events at 21 sites across the United States demonstrated that stormwater transports substantial mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, bioactive contaminants (pesticides and pharmaceuticals), and other organic chemicals known or suspected to pose environmental health concern. Numerous organic-chemical detections per site (median number of chemicals detected = 73), individual concentrations exceeding 10 000 ng/L, and cumulative concentrations up to 263 000 ng/L suggested concern for potential environmental effects during runoff events. Organic concentrations, loads, and yields were positively correlated with impervious surfaces and highly developed urban catchments. Episodic storm-event organic concentrations and loads were comparable to and often exceeded those of daily wastewater plant discharges. Inorganic chemical concentrations were generally dilute in concentration and did not exceed chronic aquatic life criteria. Methylmercury was measured in 90% of samples with concentrations that ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 ng/L.

AB Mathematical modelling plays a key role in understanding and quantifying uncertainties of emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs). This paper presents for the first time a simplified emerging pollutant pathway that incorporates two pathways to sequestration. It develops deterministic and stochastic ordinary differential equations to gain insight into the fate and behaviour of a case study pharmaceutical, with particular focus on sorption to the solid phase, as well as the nature of the experimentally measured solid parent compound. Statistical estimation and inferential procedures are developed and via a proof-of-concept examination, the study explores the transformation pathways of the bioactive chemicals (BACs) in the bioreactor, which is the heart of the WWTP. Simulations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a case study, show good agreement with data. The results suggest that the measured EE2-parent concentration in the solid phase is very similar to the model-based sequestered (rather than adsorbed) EE2-parent concentration.

AB Owing to the prevalence of depression during childbearing, mothers can be prescribed multiple antidepressants; however, little is known about the risk and consequences to the offspring or subsequent generations. Fluoxetine (FLX) is usually the first-line of pharmacological treatment for affective disorders in pregnant women, with venlafaxine (VEN) used as secondary treatment. Given that FLX and VEN readily cross the placenta, a fetus from a treated pregnant woman is potentially at risk of the endocrine disruptive effects of these chemicals. Pharmaceutical agents, including FLX and VEN, reach aquatic ecosystems through sewage release; thus, fish could also be inadvertently affected. We report the results from a 6-day FLX exposure during early zebrafish development to an environmentally relevant level (0.54 mu g/L in water) and a concentration detected in the cord blood of FLX-treated pregnant women (54 mu g/L in water). The FLX exposure reduced the stress response (arithmetic difference between the stress-induced and unstressed whole-body cortisol levels) in the adult female and male zebrafish, an effect that persisted for four generations. To model the possibility of a second antidepressant exposure, filial generation 4 was exposed to VEN (5 mu g/L). We found that FLX exposure sensitized these descendants to VEN. VEN treatment further suppressed cortisol production in females and decreased spawning rates in adult pairs. This is an important demonstration that in an animal model, a brief ancestral exposure of great-great-grandparents to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor FLX will shape the physiological responses of future generations to the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor VEN.

AB Ten pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were determined in northern Taiwan estuarine waters and Taiwan Strait (TS) seawater. The ecological risk of these PhACs was assessed using risk quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of the measured maximum concentration to the predicted no-effect concentration. Six PhACs were detected within the estuarine waters. Caffeine concentration (130-718 ngl(-1)) was the highest among the analyzed PhACs. The distribution of PhACs in the Danshuei River Estuary generally exhibited addition behavior, except that caffeine showed conservative behavior. Carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, caffeine, and ketoprofen were detected in TS seawaters. Their concentrations follow the sequence: gemfibrozil > ketoprofen > caffeine > carbamazepine. The caffeine concentrations in TS seawaters were 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those in Danshuei estuarine waters. With few exceptions for caffeine, erythromycin, and sulfadiazine posing low risk in some estuarine waters, most of the RQ values were < 0.01, suggesting no adverse effects on aquatic organisms.

AB Narragansett Bay is an urban estuary that historically has been impacted by long-term discharge of sanitary wastewater (WW) effluents. High-density water sampling was conducted in Narragansett Bay, RI, USA, in an effort to understand the distribution and behavior of sucralose, an artificial sweetener that has shown utility as a sanitary wastewater tracer. Water samples were collected at sixty-seven sites and analyzed for sucralose, whose performance was compared to other tracers present in wastewater effluents. Concentrations of sucralose were much higher than the other tracers measured, carbamazepine and caffeine, ranging from 18 to 3180 ng/L and corresponded well with salinity (r(2) = 0.88), demonstrating conservative behavior throughout the Bay. Mapped interpolation data using an empirical bayesian kriging model clearly show the spatial trends of WW and how estuarine processes influence dilution and dispersion throughout the Bay. These findings provide further evidence of the efficacy of sucralose as a wastewater tracer in large urban estuaries where continuous high-volume discharge of WW occur.

AB Fifteen antibiotics, including seven sulfonamides (SAs); three macrolides (MLs); three quinolones (QNs); one lincosamide, lincomycin (LIN); and one tetracycline (TC), were detected in the surface water of the Xi'an section of the Weihe River by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The detection rates were 12.50-100%, and the detected concentrations were in the range of nd-270.60 ng/L. The average detected concentrations of the SAs, MLs, QNs, LIN and TC were 113.68, 111.79, 20.55, 23.81 and 25.66 ng/L, respectively. Among these, SAs and MLs were the dominant antibiotics detected in the Weihe River. Compared with those in other water bodies in China and abroad, the antibiotic residues in the Weihe River were at a moderate contamination level. The SAs concentration distribution followed upstream > midstream > downstream, while the MLs concentration distribution was midstream < downstream < upstream. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that domestic sewage, livestock discharge, and aquaculture and pharmaceutical wastewater are the main sources of antibiotic residues in the Weihe River. In addition, the detected ciprofloxacin (CFX), ofloxacin (OFX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) pose high ecological risk in the short and long term.

AB Despite that diclofenac has been embodied to the European watch list of priority substances of concern, studies on diclofenac biodegradation are limited and the diversity of diclofenac-degrading microbiota remains unknown. In this work, an immobilized cell biofilter was constructed and operated to evaluate its effectiveness to depurate high strength diclofenac wastewater and to identify the diclofenac-degrading community accommodated in activated sludge by employing high-throughput sequencing techniques. After a two-month adaptation period, biofilter removal efficiencies reached values as high as 97.63 +/- 0.62%, whereas utilization of diclofenac in the immobilized cell biofilter led to a drastic pH decrease. Based on Illumina sequencing, the major bacterial taxa identified in the immobilized cell biofilter were members of the species Granulicella pectinivorans and Rhodanobacter terrae, followed by members of the species Castellaniella denitrificans, Parvibaculum lavamentivorans, Bordetella petrii, Bryocella elongata and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The ability of such taxa to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to effectively adapt under acidic conditions seemed to be the main parameters, which favored their prevalence in the immobilized cell biofilter. In addition, Wickerhamiella was the predominant fungal taxon in the immobilized cell biofilter, which appears to be actively involved in diclofenac degradation in activated sludge systems.

AB The highly prescribed antidepressant, citalopram, as one of newly emerging pollutants, has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Citalopram oxidation was examined during sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) chlorination processes since conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot remove citalopram effectively. Citalopram has been demonstrated to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during chlorination in our previous study. Further investigation on NDMA formation kinetics was conducted in the present study. Influences of operational variables (disinfectant dose, pH value) and water matrix on citalopram degradation, as well as NDMA generation, were evaluated. The results indicated high reactivity of citalopram with NaOCl and ClO2. NDMA formation included two stages during CIT oxidation, which were linear related with reaction time. NaOCl was more beneficial to remove CIT, but it caused more NDMA formation. Increasing disinfectant dosage promoted citalopram removal and NDMA formation. However, no consistent correlation was found between citalopram removal and pH. Contrary to the situation of citalopram removal, NDMA generation was enhanced when citalopram was present in actual water matrices, especially in secondary effluent. DMA, as an intermediate of citalopram chlorination, contributed to NDMA formation, but not the only way.

AB The contaminant removal and microorganism response in activated sludge exposed to sulfamethazine (SMT) for 66 days was investigated. The average removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+ -N), total phosphorus (TP) and SMT were 93%, 71%, 98%, 69% and 84%, respectively. The content of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) increased significantly from day 0 to day 66 (p < 0.05). Microorganisms secreted more PN to protect cells from SMT damage under the stimulation of SMT. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) results showed that fluorescence intensity of tyrosine like aromatic protein in EPS increased significantly from day 0 to day 66. The total reads of Pseudomonas (denitrifying bacteria, DNB) and Acinetobacter (phosphorus-accumulating bacteria, PAO) increased significantly from day 0 to day 66 (p < 0.05), which indicated that the above-cited bacteria could resist the SMT stress.

AB In this work, zebrafish embryo bioassays were performed to assess the efficiency of microalgae in the removal of acetaminophen from water. Chlorella sorokiniana (CS), Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) were the strains used for water treatment. Toxic effects on zebrafish embryo caused by effluents from microalgae treatment were compared with those observed under exposure to experimental solutions with known concentrations of acetaminophen. The three microalgae strains allowed for the reduction of acetaminophen concentration and its toxic effects, but CS was the most efficient one. At the end of the batch culture, a 67% removal was provided by CS with a reduction of 62% in the total abnormalities on the exposed zebrafish embryo. On the other hand, toxic effects observed under exposure to effluents treated by microalgae were alike to those determined for acetaminophen experimental solutions with equivalent concentration. Thus, it may be inferred that microalgae biodegradation of acetaminophen did not involve an increased toxicity for zebrafish embryo.

AB Numerous studies have analyzed the viability of the biodegradation and removal of different compounds of emerging concern in biological systems for wastewater treatment. However, the effect on the heterotrophic biomass of organic matter removal is sometimes missed. The aim of the present research was to study the effect of the addition of a mix of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and ibuprofen) on the behavior of the biomass in two different membrane-based biological systems treating urban wastewater. The present research studied a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant operating at a similar mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration (about 5.5 g/L). This system works as an MBR and is combined with a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR-MBR) to treat real urban wastewater at 6 and 10 h of hydraulic retention time (HRT) under three different shocks of pharmaceuticals with increasing concentrations. In all cases, the organic matter removal was, in average terms, higher than about 92% of biochemical oxygen demand on the fifth day (BOD5), 79% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 85% of total organic carbon (TOC). Nevertheless, the removal is higher in the MBBR-MBR technology under the same HRT and the MLSS is similar. Moreover, the removal increased during the shock of pharmaceutical compounds, especially in the MBR technology. From a kinetic perspective, MBBR-MBR is more suitable for low HRT (6 h) and MBR is more effective for high HRT (10 h). This could be due to the fact that biofilm systems are less sensitive to hostile environments than the MBR systems. The removal of N-NH4+ decreased considerably when the pharmaceutical compounds mix was introduced into the system until no removal was detected in cycle 1, even when biofilm was present.

AB Psychoactive pharmaceuticals release into the environment and reach humans through a variety of routes, including sewage, drinking water, contaminated irrigation water, biosolids, soil, and food. It was assumed that these compounds via the environment could induce genetic effects in the etiology of human neurological disorders. With the help of in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches, we demonstrated that psychoactive pharmaceuticals in drinking water can cross maternal biological barriers and alter in vitro molecular and genetic mechanisms that potentially have a key role in the development, growth, and regulation of neuronal systems during embryonic brain development.

AB Wastewater irrigation is widely practiced and may cause serious environmental problems. However, current knowledge on the effects of long-term irrigation with wastewater from different sources on the biouptake of trace metals (TMs) in the rhizosphere zone by plants in farmlands is limited. Here, we analyzed wheat rhizosphere soil and wheat roots collected from a typical wastewater irrigation area in North China to evaluate the influence of wastewater irrigation from different sources on the bioavailability of trace metals in soils. Results showed that irrigation with tanning and domestic wastewater helped enhance the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing the active organic carbon content, soil redox potential, and catalase activity, thus enhancing the proportion of the potentially bioavailable part of trace metal speciation. Conversely, irrigation with pharmaceutical wastewater can reduce the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing total soil antibiotics and thus decreasing the proportions of bioavailable and potentially bioavailable parts of trace metal speciation. These findings can provide insights into the migration and transformation of trace metal speciation in soil rhizosphere microenvironments under the context of wastewater irrigation.

AB Novel thermally responsive mesoporous silica nanosphere molecularly imprinted polymers (T-MMIPs) were prepared via a two-step precipitation polymerization process for selective adsorption and removal of dichlorophen (DCP) in aquatic environments. The innovative part was that T-MMIPs were first used for the identification and separation of DCP. The obtained materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and XRD. Static adsorption, kinetic, temperature sensitivity, and selective recognition experiments were implemented to test adsorption performance of T-MMIPs and T-MNIPs (thermally responsive mesoporous silica nano-sphere molecularly nonimprinted polymers). Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were found more consistent with experimental data, and T-MMIPs had a higher selective adsorption capacity and better temperature response. T-MMIPs have the best adsorption performance, and their adsorption equilibrium capacity can reach 108.35 mg/g at 298 K. In addition, regeneration and real-sample experiments demonstrated that T-MMIPs have good repeatability and practicality. Therefore, this study provides a potential application for the adsorption of dichlorophen in wastewater environments.

AB The present study provides robust consensus quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models developed from 334 organic chemicals covering a wide chemical domain for the prediction of effective concentrations of chemicals for 50% and 10% inhibition of algal growth. Only 2D descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning were employed for QSAR model building, whereas development, validation and interpretation were achieved following the strict Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommended guidelines. Genetic algorithm along with stepwise approach was used in feature selection while the final QSAR models were derived using partial least squares regression technique. The applicability domain of the developed models was also checked. The obtained consensus models were then used to predict 64 organic chemicals having no definite observed responses while the confidence of predictions was checked by the 'prediction reliability indicator' tool. The developed models should be applicable for data gap filling in case of new or untested organic chemicals provided they fall within the domain of the model and can also be implemented to design safer alternatives to the environment.

AB The process of embalming human remains as part of the funeral home industry, entails replacing blood with embalming fluid. Typically the unused/excess fluids are disposed of directly to the sewershed or septic system. The presence of select contaminants in sewer discharges from 8 funeral homes (facilities) in York Region, Ontario during active embalming processes was studied. A wide range of contaminants including embalming fluids (formaldehyde and triclosan); metals, conventional parameters, persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated byphenyls), nonyl phenols and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were measured in the final embalming effluent and compared to regulatory sewer limits where available. Two main constituents of embalming fluids-formaldehyde and triclosan-were detected at maximum concentrations of 561,000 mu g/L and 505 mu g/L respectively. Other persistent organic pollutants detected in embalming effluent included banned pesticides lindane (83 ng/L) and metabolites of DDT (DDE; 2,300 ng/L). Elevated APIs found in over-thecounter drugs and products were also frequently detected at elevated concentrations (oxybenzone, hydrocortisone, lidocaine, naproxen, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin and DEET). Most contaminants did not exceed regulatory sewer limits where available, however others including biochemical oxygen demand (cBOD(5)) and conventional parameters were consistently above regulatory limits. Large amounts of formaldehyde and triclosan may pose a risk to receiving sewersheds and receiving sewage treatment plants due to their antimicrobial activities.

AB A novel and porous molecularly imprinted polymer (PMIP) was synthesized and used as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent for preconcentration of carbamazepine (CBZ) prior to its quantitation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in various sample forms (e.g., drinking water, river water, hospital wastewater, and pharmaceuticals). PMIP-CBZ was applied to a polymerization process in which polystyrene spheres were coated with a silica layer. Removal of polystyrene spheres and formation of porous silica facilitated the recovery of CBZ (99.4%) during the extraction process. Site accessibility to the surface of PMIP-CBZ increased the density of high recognition sites. PMIP-CBZ was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The key variables influencing the extraction efficiency of PMIP (e.g., adsorbent loading, eluent type, eluent volume, reusability of the adsorbent, and cross-reactivity) were optimized. The optimized protocol was successfully employed to quantify CBZ with limit of detection and limit of quantification as 0.082 and 0.270 ng/mL, respectively (linear detection range: 0.5-250 ng/mL and a relative standard deviation: < 5%). Use of the PMIP adsorbent resulted in a sensitive and stable method for efficiently quantitation of CBZ from various real sample matrices.

AB Urban wastewater effluents bring large amounts of nutrients, organic matter and organic micro contaminants into freshwater ecosystems. The effects of this complex mixture of pollutants on freshwater invertebrates have been studied mainly in temperate rivers and streams with high dilution capacities. In contrast, Mediterranean streams and rivers have lower dilution capacities especially during the seasonal drought, and are therefore exposed to high concentrations of pollutants. Here, we assess the effects of urban wastewater pollution on invertebrate communities from Mediterranean streams under different hydrological conditions. Specifically, we assessed the invertebrates taxonomic composition and functional biological traits in 12 streams, differing in stream and substrate size (sand or cobbles), under low (2 surveys) and baseflow (1 survey) conditions. In each stream, we selected reaches both upstream and downstream of the wastewater discharge point. Our results indicate that urban wastewater pollution favours the most tolerant invertebrate taxa and homogenises functional trait composition over time. Changes in functional traits were more evident during the seasonal drought, when the low flow conditions at the upstream and downstream sites were more severe and, pollutant concentrations downstream were at their highest. However, the effects of urban wastewater pollution were not uniform in the downstream sites; as local invertebrate communities differed in according to the river substrate and stream size (i.e., width and discharge). Overall, urban pollution caused by wastewater enhanced both, taxonomic and functional differences between the invertebrate communities. Such an absence of homogenisation among wastewater pollution impacted sites was probably related to the relevant role of stream substrate-size as well flow conditions in the rivers receiving the impact. These are attributes that need to be considered when setting the pollutant discharge limits in rivers and streams receiving effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treated wastewater is increasingly used to meet agriculture's water needs; however, treated wastewater contains numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). With exposure and uptake of CECs, phytotoxicity and health of crop plants is of concern, but is poorly understood. This study evaluated the effect of low-dose, chronic exposure to a mixture of 10 CECs, including 4 antibiotics, 3 anti-inflammatory drugs, 1 antiepileptic, 1 beta-blocker, and 1 antimicrobial, on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cucumber (Cucumis sativa L.) plants. The CEC mixture was added in nutrient media at 1 to 20X of their typical levels in treated wastewater effluents. Biological endpoints including germination, growth, phytohormone homeostasis, and CEC bioaccumulation were determined. Exposure to the CEC mixture did not affect the germination rate of lettuce seeds, but stimulated root elongation and increased the root-to-shoot biomass ratio during a 7 d cultivation. A dose-dependent decrease in biomass was observed in cucumber seedling after a 30 d exposure, with the highest rate CEC treatment resulting in decreases of 51.2 +/- 20.9, 26.3 +/- 34.1, and 33.2 +/- 41.7% in the below-ground, above-ground, and total biomass, respectively. Levels of abscisic acid were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in the leaves, but decreased (p < 0.05) in the roots. The dose-response of auxin was characterized by a hormesis effect. A significant 6-fold increase in the stem auxin level was observed at the 1X CEC rate, followed by a decrease to 2-fold the control at the 20X rate. Leaf auxin concentrations also significantly increased at the 1X CEC rate to 16-fold, followed by a decrease at the highest CEC rate. The results of this study suggeste that chronic exposure to low levels of CEC mixtures may compromise the fitness of plants, and the impairments are underlined by alterations in hormone balances.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are widely detected in surface waters. So far, the removal processes of these compounds in situ in river systems are not yet totally revealed. In this study, a combined monitoring and modelling approach was applied to determine the behaviour of 1-H benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and galaxolide in a small river system. Sewage treatment plant effluents and the receiving waters of the river Swist were monitored in 9 dry weather sampling campaigns (precipitation < 1 mm on the sampling day itself and <5 mm total precipitation two days before the sampling) during different seasons over a period of 3 years. With the results gained through monitoring, mass balances have been calculated to assess fate in the river. With the DWA Water Quality Model, OMP concentrations in the river were successfully simulated with OMP characteristics gained through literature studies. No removal was determined for 1-H benzotriazole and carbamazepine, whereas diclofenac showed removal that coincided with light intensity. Moreover, modelling based on light sensitivity of diclofenac also suggested relevant degradation at natural light conditions. These two approaches suggest removal by photodegradation. The highest removal in the river was detected for galaxolide, presumably due to volatilisation, sorption and biodegradation. Furthermore, short-term concentration variability in the river was determined, showing that daily concentration patterns are influenced by dynamics of sewage treatment plant effluent volumes and removal processes in the river.

AB The polypyrrole (PPy) was used as an adsorbent material for efficient removal of pharmaceutical metronidazole from aqueous solutions. The physiochemical parameters influencing the adsorption process such as adsorbent dose, temperature, pH, initial concentration and contact time were systematically investigated. The optimum adsorption efficiency is achieved at pH 6.17 after 120 min of contact time. In addition, the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order models were found to explain the metronidazole adsorption process on the PPy. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption of metronidazole on the PPy is a spontaneous and exothermic process. The quantum calculations using density functional theory (DFT) was used to confirm the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the PPy. The obtained results of the interaction energy indicate that the adsorption was a physical process. The metronidazole was adsorbed by its oxygen atoms on the amine groups of PPy. Finally, the PPy polymer can be used as an efficient adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater.

AB Chitosan-glyoxal/Polyvinylpyrrolidone/MoS2 (CSG/PVP/MoS2) nanocomposites were synthesized via hydrothermal-ultrasonic method. The CSG/PVP/MoS2 nano catalyst was characterized by XRD, UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and diclofenac was used for the adsorption and photo-degradation test. SEM revealed the CSG/PVP/MoS2 nanocomposite has coarse and semi-flake structure and UV-vis absorbance spectra indicated its strong UV light response. Additionally, the CSG/PVP/MoS2 presents enhanced adsorption-photocatalytic activities in comparison to CSG/PVP, and the degradation was reaching 94.5%. Kinetic study results demonstrated that the diclofenac photo-degradation could be explained by pseudo-first-order model. The material may have great potential in wastewater treatment applications. The synthesized nanomaterials were tested for their antibacterial properties against microorganisms Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antimicrobial property CSG/PVP/MoS2 nanocomposite was observed with a maximum of zone inhibition. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical derivatives have been reported to affect several water bodies around the world. Therefore, developing treatments that remove them from the environment is a significant need. The main goal of this work was to use powdered diatomaceous earth (DE) as a low-cost natural adsorbent for ciprofloxacin (CIP) in aqueous solutions, employing synthetic CIP solutions of pure water and treated domestic wastewater. The influences of adsorption time, initial pH, CIP concentration, and DE dosage were evaluated after DE structure characterization using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Diatomaceous earth was shown to have significant capabilities to remove CIP in aqueous phase, achieving pollutant equilibrium adsorption in 24 h. The best CIP removal efficiency was 97% (19.4 mg L-1) using 2 g of DE, 20 mg L-1 of CIP, and pH = 2.0. The experimental results were fitted using second-order rate kinetics, with rate constant values in the 0.0077 <= k(2) (g mg(-1) h(-1)) <= 0.1984 range and correlation coefficients above 0.95. The adsorption results were fitted to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations and isotherm constants were estimated. The maximum adsorption capacity was assessed to be 105.1 mg CIP g(-1) DE, suggesting good affinity between the pharmaceutical drug and the adsorbent.

AB Cleft lip and cleft palate also known as orofacial cleft is a congenital malformation involving the partial or total lack of anatomical continuity of craniofacial tissue. The most common environmental factors that may cause orofacial clefts include pharmaceuticals, alcohol, addictive drugs, and tobacco smoke. Living in the area of industrial factories, garbage, ironworks, crematoria, wastewater treatment plants, and plastic waste landfills also has a significant impact on the development of the craniofacial defects. Some of the main factors causing the formation of congenital craniofacial defects are dioxins, of which emission to the environment is an important environmental and health problem. Dioxins are a diverse group of organic chemical compounds, derivatives of oxanthrene and fumarates, which are organoleptically imperceptible. Acting mainly through induction of inflammation, they influence a number of metabolic processes, including the process of bone mineralization and embryonic development. In this work, we highlight the problem of orofacial cleft including the impact of dioxin on development of this defect and the recommended prevention.

AB Concentrations of widely used antibiotics were predicted to be the highest in the Haihe River Catchment across China previously, potentially resulting in high ecotoxicological risks in this region. As a result of growing usage and regulation of antibiotic use in animals, the pattern of use may have altered temporally for different antibiotics. It is important to monitor the occurrence of antibiotics within different categories for understanding their mass loading to the catchment and the potential ecotoxicological risks involved. This study investigated the seasonal occurrence and spatial variation of 15 antibiotics in the Haihe River Catchment during 2016-2017. The investigated compounds included veterinary antibiotics, human-use antibiotics, and those intended for both human and animal use. Measurements reported from previous studies were compared with the results of this study and indicated that the use of veterinary antibiotics is probably increasing around the catchment. The antibiotics concentration (i.e. the summed concentration of the 15 target antibiotics) ranged from 414 to 1951 ng/L, with an average of 821 ng/L. Discharges from wastewater treatment plants were the main sources of these compounds. The mass loading of antibiotics to the river waters was higher during we seasons than during dry seasons. The mass fluxes of the antibiotics continuously increased towards the lower reaches of the rivers. The total annual input of the antibiotics from the Haihe River and Yongdingxin River into the Bohai Bay was 5008 kg/yr. Ofloxacin, trimethoprim, leucomycin, anhydro erythromycin and florfenicol were the predominant antibiotics, whilst amoxicillin, anhydro erythromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and enrofloxacin may pose high ecotoxicological risks to the investigated aquatic ecosystem. Several antibiotics selected in this study were reported for the first time in this catchment. This study provides important information for chemical management and indicates that further monitoring is needed on the more harmful and veterinary antibiotics in the catchment.

AB Emerging contaminants are a global concern, as Directive 2013/39/UE shows. Given the possible consequences that may lead to the presence of these compounds in water resources, different proposals are being evaluated to avoid their discharge into the environment. This study focuses on the use of a biological and physicochemical combined treatment formed by a membrane bioreactor with an H2O2/UltraViolet (UV) advanced oxidation process coupled subsequently to degrade contaminants of emerging concern in real urban wastewater. The membrane bioreactor operated at 16 h of hydraulic retention time and 4,250 mg/L of mixed liquor suspended solids. Different hydrogen peroxide dosages (25, 50, and 100 mg/L) were tested in the photoreactor at 20 degrees C and the natural pH of the wastewater. Different initial concentrations of a mix of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and ibuprofen) were tested. Removal efficiencies obtained in the biological stage ranged from 66.23%-96.18%, 90.63%-100%, and 90.04%-96.48%, respectively. However, complete removal was achieved after the physicochemical stage when the concentrations of contaminants in the mix were similar to current concentration levels in urban wastewater.

AB Improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters. In this study, biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems, and moreover, the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants. First, the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first-order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data. The degradation rate constants (k(bio)) were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals, indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals. Further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed, for the first time, that the electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k(bio) than the conventional log K-ow (a measure of hydrophobicity) in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems. However, the correlation strength (goodness-of-fit) between omega and k(bio )deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent. Our results show that omega can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes.

AB A simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week's period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full-scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance. Independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full-scale elimination rate determinations. As opposed to common assumptions, this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times - read: higher active biomass - showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases. Multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to SRT drove the grouping. The dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants. The application of WWTP balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in-depth analysis of degradation pathways.

AB Several pharmaceuticals were followed through a drinking water production process on the river Meuse. Tramadol and levetiracetam were the most common compounds while cytostatics were not detected. All compounds found at that intake point had an annual consumption greater than 90 mg/inhabitant. The tracer substance 1,2,3-benzotriazole allowed estimation of the maximal concentration of pharmaceuticals and the evolution profile for tramadol and sotalol. After pre-ozonation of raw water, most pharmaceuticals were completely removed, except levetiracetam and irbesartan, confirming the efficiency of this advanced oxidation process. Irbesartan and levetiracetam were completely removed by granular activated carbon filtration. Levetiracetam was the most reluctant compound. A conventional multi-barrier treatment combining ozone and activated carbon, already used for several decades before implementation in wastewater treatment, can completely remove most pharmaceuticals. Therefore, drinking water without any significant health-related amount of these pharmaceuticals can be produced from surface water.

AB Biodiesel wastewaters contain high amounts of oil, methanol, soap and glycerin. These wastewaters pollutant concentrations as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), glycerin and Me0H are fluctuating in the ranges of 250,000-450,000 mg/L, 54,000-110,000 mg/L, 800-1,500 mg/L, and 6,000-15,000 mg/L, respectively. Biodiesel wastewaters lead to blockage of oil drainage systems and reduction of biological activity in biological treatment systems. The purpose of this study was to treat wastewater by ozonation after the electrocoagulation process as pre-treatment. In the ozonation process, the initial wastewater pH value was 13.9, ozone dose was 1.5g/L h, reaction time was 7 h and reaction temperature was 45 C. As a result of 7 h of ozonation, 98.64% of COD, 97.48% of TOC and 99.37% of Me0H removal efficiencies achieved. With these results, biodiesel waste water can be discharge to into the receiving environment according to standards.

AB The present study aimed to investigate Klebsiella sp. SQY5-mediated tetracycline (TEC) degradation, nitrogen (N) conversion, and mechanisms underlying this process as influenced by various carbon and N sources under aerobic conditions. Effects of additional organic carbon sources on TEC degradation and N conversion processes were explored, and we found that 34.71% of TEC was degraded at removal rates of 0.97 mg.L-1.h (-1) for NH4+-N and 1.97 mg.L-1.h(-1) for NO3--N. A study examining powder natural algal powder in aquaculture wastewater as a carbon source for TEC degradation and denitrification process was also discussed. It suggested that 49.95% of TEC and 60.45% of NO3--N were removed with a reduction and denitrification rate of 0.11 mg.L-1.h(-1) and 1.34 mg.L-1.h(-1), respectively, within 72-108 h. Mechanisms underlying TEC degradation and N conversion processes were also proposed, and analysis indicated that specific functional genes played an important role in this process.

AB The temporal dynamics of the wastewater influent loads of 25 drug target residues (DTR, both pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs) was assessed during 84 consecutive days. This monitoring scale enables longer temporal patterns than weekday/weekend patterns to be explored. In this study, we focus on day to day variations and the potential statistical correlation of each DTR analyzed in order to better understand the potential forcings that lead to the load variation of DTRs (alone or in clusters). The weekly patterns based on the weekly loads of DTRs were also analyzed and the impact of social and meteorological events on their variations was investigated.
   Two cold events occurred during the monitoring period and were associated with the highest loads of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as the lowest loads of stimulants. During the Easter holidays, a significant decrease in some year-long medication as well as analgesics was found, consistent with the demographic decrease within the catchment during this period. Lastly, a good correlation between the academic calendar and the loads of stimulants was found, emphasizing the over-representation of students in the consumption of recreational drugs.
   This study furnishes new insights in order to better understand the variations in DTR loads in wastewater influents, beyond the weekday/weekend pattern and the seasonal effect. Further investigations remain necessary, especially a real-time monitoring of the population figures within the catchment in order to improve our understanding of these results.

AB We developed a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method for the high throughput determination of 28 common veterinary antibiotics in swine wastewater using one-step dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) for sample cleanup and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for detection. The orthogonal test method was used to systematically investigate the parameters that might influence d-SPE efficiency. The optimal d-SPE procedure utilized 40 mg primary secondary amine sorbent and 3 g L-1 Na(2)EDTA. The recoveries ranged from 50 to 100% with relative standard deviations <20% for all target analytes except for enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for all the analytes ranged from 0.002 to 0.200 ng mL(-1) and 0.005-0.500 ng mL(-1), respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 28 antibiotic residues in swine wastewater from 10 pig farms located in central China. Fourteen antibiotics including 4 sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamonomethoxine and trimethoprim), 5 fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefioxacin, enrofloxacin, and ofloxacin), 1 lincosamide (lincomycin) and 4 tetracyclines (doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline) were detected at levels ranging from 0.0560 to 1793 ng mL(-1). Our results demonstrated that the optimized method is a simple but reliable analytical technique for the routine monitoring of veterinary antibiotics in swine wastewater. Swine wastewater samples that we analyzed from 10 pig farms in Jiangxi Province, China were highly contaminated and pose a serious threat to ecosystems and to public health. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although traditional water treatment systems can remove various substances from wastewater, these conventional systems fail to remove many chemical molecules that pose potential ecological and health risks. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) appear attractive to adsorption of many substances, but CNTs adsorbed with toxic substances becomes a nanocomposite still more toxic. Here, we employ zebrafish embryos as biosensor to examine how a hybrid micro/nanostructured carbonaceous material (HMNC) derived from a combination of activated carbon (AC) with hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can remediate waste-water contaminated with the pharmaceutical fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX). AC and HMNC are practically non-toxic to zebrafish embryos (LC50 > 1000 mg.L-1). HMNC addition to culture medium containing FLX significantly reduces sublethal effects and lethality. Interaction between FLX and HMNC involves chemical adsorption such that embryo co-exposure to HMNC adsorbed with FLX in the range of concentrations evaluated herein does not elicit any behavioral changes in zebrafish.

AB Herein, a sponge membrane bioreactor (Sponge-MBR) combined with ozonation process was performed to remove the antibiotics which frequently existed in the hospital wastewater. Whilst seven antibiotics i.e., norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim were widely used in medications, this integration was applied for the evaluation of treatment performance under different fluxes. As the results, whilst the antibiotics were eliminated about 4593%, the tetracycline was completely removed (100%) using Sponge-MBR operated at the flux of 10 LMH. For enhancement of antibiotics removal, the ozonation process was introduced to treat the membrane permeate. Overall efficiencies were 97 +/- 2% (trimethoprim), 92 +/- 4% (norfloxacin), 90 +/- 1% (erythromycin), 88 +/- 4% (ofloxacin), 83 +/- 7 (ciprofloxacin) and 66 +/- 1% (sulfamethoxazole). These results demonstrated Sponge-MBR coupled with ozonation could be a prospective technology for the hospital wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acesulfame potassium (ACE) is a widely used artificial sweetener that has consistently been detected in wastewater and surface waters. The high-valent iron-based green oxidant known as ferrate(VI) (potassium ferrate(VI); Fe(VI)) had low reactivity with ACE (i.e. 4 h (or 240 min) contact time removed only similar to 67% ACE) at a molar ratio of 6.0 ([Fe(VI)]:[ACE]). Comparatively, it took 60 s (or 1 min) to remove similar to 94% ACE when HCI (786 mu M) was added to a mixture of Fe(VI)-ACE at the same molar ratio of 6.0 (or acid-activated Fe(VI)). Significantly, the final pH (i.e. 7.6-8.1) was similar for Fe(VI) and acid-activated Fe(VI). An empirical model using response surface methodology was developed that could describe reasonably well the removal efficiency of ACE. Inorganic constituents of wastewater (Cl-, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) had no significant effect on the oxidation of ACE by acid-activated Fe(VI). The degradation efficiency of ACE decreased in the presence of 10 mg/L of natural organic matter (NOM) but remained unchanged at 5 mg NOM/L. Sulfamic acid as the oxidized product of ACE was identified by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method. Reaction pathways include ring opening of ACE through hydrolytic transformation. Acid-activated Fe(VI) has advantage of rapid removal of ACE under mild alkaline conditions of wastewater treatment plants compared to other oxidation processes such as chlorination, ozonation, and light-based processes.

AB This research investigates the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on micropollutant biodegradation of two-stage activated sludge (AS) system augmented with acclimatized sludge treating low-micropollutants wastewater. The experimental wastewater was a mixture of landfill leachate and agriculture wastewater, and HRT was varied between 24, 18, and 12 h. The results showed that, under 24 h HRT, the micropollutant biodegradation efficiencies were 87-93% for bisphenol A (BPA), 2,6-di-tertbutyl-phenol (2,6-DTBP), di-butyl-phthalate (DBP), di-(ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP); 75-81% for carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF); and 88% for N,N-diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET). The degradation efficiencies were similar under 18 h HRT: 87-93% for BPA, 2,6-DTBP, DBP, DEHP; 75-80% for CBZ, DCF; and 80% for DEET. However, the efficiencies substantially declined under 12 h HRT: 71-93%, 55-60%, and 50%, respectively. Importantly, the findings revealed that HRT plays a crucial part in micropollutant biodegradation of bioaugmented AS system. More specifically, too short an HRT (12 h) results in low micropollutant removal efficiency, and too long an HRT (24 h) contributes to low daily throughput and high treatment operation cost. As a result, moderate HRT (18 h) is operationally and economically optimal for bioaugmented AS system treating low-micropollutants wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diosgenin is an important raw material for the synthesis of steroid hormone drug and largely required in the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, a novel process for biorefinery of Dioscorea composite Hemsl (DCH) with ferric chloride was developed to investigate the conversion of saponins to diosgenin. Furthermore, the waste, including sugary wastewater and starch residue, as recyclable biomass resources after diosgenin extraction was devoted to biomethane. Consequently, the highest yield of diosgenin (3.02%) was obtained using ethanol/ water/petroleum ether (15/16/20, v/v/v) with a total volume of 255 mL containing 80 mL 5.0 g/L ferric chloride aqueous solution at 150 degrees C for 2 h. The yield extracted with FeCl3 was 16.6% higher than the traditional sulfuric acid hydrolysis method and was even 2.3 times more than the biphasic sulfuric acid hydrolysis method. Similarly, without consuming sulfuric acid, the yield was 79.76% higher than the control method. After fermentation, a maximum biomethane yield of 310.5 mL/g COD (chemical oxygen demand) was achieved from wastewater and the decomposition efficiency reached 91.1% with an initial COD concentration of 10,800 mg/L decreasing to 960 mg/L. The final biomethane productivity of waste residues was 278.8 mL/g VS and the VS degradation efficiency was 95.8% after a week. Therefore, the novel method with FeCl3 -catalyzed acidolysis to produce diosgenin and biomethane may be an alternative much cleaner approach to better utilize dioscorea resources.

AB Four horizontal subsurface flow pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) named as S1, S2, M1 and M2 were constructed to treat aquaculture wastewater. And two different plant species (Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) were cultivated in single and mixed planting patterns in these four CWs. The removal rate of conventional pollutants (nutrient and organic compounds), antibiotics including enrofloxacin (ENR), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated among those CWs. The total nitrogen and NH4+-N removal rates of all CWs were 73.24%-91.46% and 61.20%-92.27%, respectively. CWs with mixed planting patterns, such as M1 (planted with Iris pseudacorus at the forepart and Phragmites australis at the back) and M2 (alternate cultivation with Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) showed better performances than CWs planted with single plant species, such as S1 (Iris pseudacorus) and S2 (Phragmites australis). However, S1 and S2 exhibited higher removal efficiencies for emerging contaminants: S1 had removal efficiencies of 77.64%, 68.70%, and 58.21% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively, and S2 had removal efficiencies of 81.11%, 64.94%, and 56.26% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively. Compared with single planting, the dominant genera in mixed planting exhibited lower relative abundance in anaerobes and higher percent of bacteria associated with nitrogen metabolism, indicating that different plant physiological characteristics affected the microbial community structures of the CWs.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds have been introduced into aquatic ecosystems by diverse sources and routes, which could lead to potential negative consequences for the environment and human health. The main incorporation route of these compounds is the Wastewater Treatment Plants effluents, due to its low removal efficiency to treat these types of pollutants. Coupled systems between biological treatments and Advance Oxidation Processes emerge as an alternative to reduce costs and obtain high removal efficiencies of these types of substances. In this study, the removal efficiency of micropollutants such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen using a coupled system between a Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland planted with Cyperus ligularis and an Ozonation reactor was evaluated. Three Ozone doses (10, 15 and 21 mg/L) were assessed as explanatory variable and the experiment was performed in six set of samples. In addition, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Total Nitrogen (TN) and in situ variables such as pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, Redox Potential, Electric Conductivity and Temperature were monitored as Covariates. The main results revealed that overall removal efficiency averaged 97.2% and >= 97.3% for Ibuprofen and Naproxen respectively, using the medium Ozone dose (15 mg.L-1) were obtained. Results indicated that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the ozone doses used, whereas significant statistical differences were found between coupling performance and individual technologies. Likewise, the coupled system demonstrated versatility regarding organic matter and nitrogen removal, with performances above to 70% and 50% in terms of DOC and TN, respectively.

AB Nowadays, waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as the pollution sources of nitrogen and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In the present study, the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and typical PPCPs, ibuprofen and triclosan, was evaluated in a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3- hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) based solid-phase denitrification (SPD) system. Results after 602 days showed that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process occurred with average 83.85 +/- 13.09% NH4 (+) -N and 93.88 +/- 10.19% NO3- -N removals in the SPD system. Interestingly, the system achieved average 79.69 +/- 6.35% and 65.96 +/- 7.62% removals of ibuprofen and triclosan, respectively, under stable influent conditions of 50 mu g L-1. Cometabolic activities of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) probably played a role in the biodegradation of the two PPCPs. Illumina MiSeq sequencing results revealed that microbial composition enhanced the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and PPCPs in the SPD system.

AB This study focuses on the intensification of heterogeneous TiO2 photocatalysis for the removal of a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC), oxytetracycline (OTC), as a polishing step of urban wastewaters, using an innovative NETmix mili-photoreactor under UVA-LEDs illumination. The effect of catalyst coated surface per reactor volume and the illumination mechanism, back-side (BSI) or front-side (FSI) irradiation, on arc oxidation were evaluated. For that, a thin film of photocatalyst was uniformly deposited on the front borosilicate slab (BS) (BSI mechanism; 333 m(catalyst)(2)m(reactor)(-3)) or on the network of channels and chambers imprinted in the back stainless-steel slab (SSS) (FSI mechanism; 989 m(catalyst)(2)m(reactor)(-3)) using a spray system. OTC removal was also assessed as a function of TiO2 film thickness immobilized on both slabs. The photocatalyst reactivity in combination with photoreactor was significantly enhanced (3.4 times) from 0.64 to 2.19 mmol(OTC) m(illuminated reactor volume)(-3) s(-1), when considering the BSI and FSI mechanisms, respectively. In addition, the influence of UVA-LEDs intensity on OTC oxidation rate was investigated. UVA-LEDs plates were placed on the top of the NETmix borosilicate window. Moreover, the effect of water matrix was assessed using a secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant fortified with OTC. OTC oxidation rate was only inhibited in about 1.3 times in the presence of the real matrix, showing the ability of the NETrnix to overcome matrix effects due to its unique characteristics. Catalyst film stability over four consecutive reaction cycles was evaluated using synthetic and real matrices fortified with OTC. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, long-term performance of a persulfate (PS)-assisted direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process was examined for the treatment of secondary treated effluent spiked with a mixture of micropollutants including three pesticides and nine pharmaceuticals. A stand-alone DCMD (`control') was also operated under identical operating conditions for comparison. Depending on the micropollutant, the stand-alone DCMD achieved 86 to > 99% removal. In comparison, removal by the PS-assisted DCMD was > 99% for all investigated micropollutants. This was attributed to the fact that sulfate radicals (SO4-center dot) formed following the activation of PS at the DCMD operating temperature (i.e., 40 degrees C) achieved micropollutant-specific degradation, which reduced the accumulation of micropollutants in the feed. Chemical structures of the micropollutants governed their degradation by PS. Effective degradation ( > 90%) was achieved for micropollutants that contain strong electron -donating functional groups (EDGs) in their molecules (e.g., amitriptyline and trimethoprim). Micropollutants containing both strong electron-withdrawing functional groups (EWGs) and EDGs in their molecules were moderately degraded (60-80%). In addition to the micropollutants, activated PS significantly degraded total organic carbon (70%) and total nitrogen (40%) from the secondary treated wastewater. This helped to reduce the fouling layer on the membrane-surface in the PS-assisted DCMD system. PS-addition appears to slightly increase the toxicity of wastewater, but with effective retention of PS and degradation products, DCMD permeate (i.e., treated effluent) was not toxic. This is the first study demonstrating the performance of the persulfate oxidation process in a continuous-flow membrane system for micropollutant removal and membrane fouling control.

AB Anticancer drugs used in cancer treatment are excreted unchanged or as metabolites by feces and urine in hospitals and households. These drugs enter the municipal sewage system but wastewater treatment plants are not capable of removing all of these micro pollutants. In many countries such as Brazil, sanitation departments do not provide service, nor have access to all of the population, therefore most sewage is still released into untreated receiving bodies. This study analyzes the consumption of anticancer drugs in a Brazilian hospital located in one of the 10 municipalities with the best sanitation index in the country. It estimates its environmental risk in aquatic matrixes by the European Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use. Among the 20 drugs analyzed, the three most consumed (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluoruracil, and cytarabine) show a predicted environmental concentration value greater than the action limit of 0.01 mu g/L recommended by the guideline. The risk assessment was performed on all pharmaceuticals consumed to get a greater awareness of risk. Results do not indicate local environmental risk but, considering that the study was performed under the best sanitation scenario, it cannot be extrapolated in the other municipalities. The study highlights that development of suitable methodologies should be considered to perform environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in developing countries sanitation conditions.

AB Drugs of addiction, have been recognized as potential contaminants of concern to the environment. Effluent wastewater discharge is a major source of contamination to aquatic receiving environments. A year-long monitoring program was undertaken in Australia to characterise the fate of four emerging drugs of addiction: methamphetamine; MDMA; pharmaceutical opioids: codeine and morphine and a metabolite: benzoylecgonine in four wastewater treatment plants operating with different secondary treatment technologies: conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactors (MBR), integrated fixed-film AS (IFAS) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The effect of subsequent tertiary treatment (coagulation/flocculation) on the removal efficiency was also assessed.
   Drugs were detected in influent and effluent samples (mean concentration ranged from 43-4777 and 17-1721 ng/L, respectively). Treated effluents had noticeably lower levels compared to raw influents. Removal efficiency of compounds depended on the secondary treatment employed, with IFAS and MBR performing the best with significant removal of compounds (approximate to 90%) followed by CAS (54-96%) and lastly SBR (42-83%). Despite the low levels of drugs measured after the secondary treatment, near complete removal after tertiary treatment (approximate to 99%) was recorded, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using the coagulation/flocculation process as an effective step for enhancing the removal efficiency. The levels of drugs were at a low level in the effluents released into the environment and used for recycling and all posed a low environmental risk in urban water courses based on the risk assessment. The information given here provides new and useful information to the water industry and regulators on the efficiency of drug removal in a range of wastewater treatment configurations.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are pervasive anthropogenic contaminants of receiving waters where they can induce various adverse effects to aquatic life. Their ubiquitous environmental occurrence is primarily attributed to discharge from wastewater treatment plants due to incomplete removal by common biological wastewater treatment processes. Here, we assess a new strategy for promoting the degradation of six representative OMPs (i.e., sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, tylosin, atrazine, naproxen, and ibuprofen) by intentionally stimulating the production of microbial oxidoreductases to counter oxidative stress caused by oxygen perturbations. Mixed microbial cultures from a dairy farm wastewater were subjected to cyclic perturbations of dissolved oxygen (DO). A distance-based redundancy analysis was used to show that DO perturbations correlate with the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, activities of peroxidases and cytochromes, and the degradation of OMPs. DO perturbation of 0.25 and 0.5 cycles/h led to most abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, showed higher activity of peroxidase and cytochrome, and gave largest removal of OMPs (removal of 92 +/- 3% for sulfamethoxazole, 84 +/- 3% for naproxen, 82 +/- 3% for ibuprofen, 66 +/- 2% for carbamazepine, 57 +/- 15% for tylosin, and 88 +/- 1% for atrazine).

The obtained experimental results revealed that over the reaction time of 10 min and solution pH of 3, the maximum removal efficiency of 98.57% is achieved where the value of MET initial concentration, current density, and H2O2 dosage is set at 10 mg.L-1, 6 mA.cm(-2), and 250 mu L.L-1, respectively, which is in satisfactory agreement with the predicted removal efficiency of 98.6% with the desirability of 0.99. The presence of radical scavengers throughout the mineralization of MET under the EF process revealed that the generation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals, as the main oxidative species, controlled the degradation mechanism. The obtained kinetics data best fitted to the first order kinetic model with the rate constant of 0.4224 min(-1) (R-2 = 0.9940). The developed treatment process under response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for modeling the obtained experimental data and successfully applied for efficient removal of the MET contaminant from pharmaceutical wastewater as an adequate and cost-effective approach.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the water environment. One of the main removal routes of DCF in wastewater is sludge adsorption, and the mechanisms need to be investigated. In this study, the effects of adsorption time, temperature, pH value, and ionic strength on the adsorption of DCF on suspended particles (SP), secondary sedimentation tank sludge (SSTS) and concentrated sludge (CS) were investigated. The results showed that most of the adsorption of DCF by the three matrices was conducted in the first 4 h and equilibrium was achieved at 8 h. The adsorption kinetics were well fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and the rate constants were 0.29-0.88 mg center dot(mu g center dot min)(-1), with chemical adsorption as the dominant one. Adsorption isotherm conformed to Freundlich, Langmuir and Linear adsorption isotherm models. The order of adsorption capacity was: CS > SSTS > SP, which was proportional to the organic matter content and specific surface area of the adsorbents. The decrease of the pH value and the increase of ionic strength promoted the adsorption of DCF. The results can provide data support for the removal of DCF from different treatment unit types in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The occurrence and spatio-temporal patterns of five tetracyclines (TCs) and six of their degradation products were investigated in twenty-eight drinking water sources along the lower Yangtze River (LYR) over dry, normal and flood seasons. Tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxytetracycline (DXC) were the dominant antibiotics detected with the highest occurrence. The maximum concentrations of TC, OTC and DXC were found in dry season as 11.16, 18.98, and 56.09 ng/L, respectively, because of the low dilution, low degradation, and high consumption in this season. Cluster analysis indicated distinct variations in the TCs' compositional profiles in both space and time. OTC and its metabolites contributed 18.5-59.6% of the TC load in dry season, possibly due to the seasonally increased release of pharmaceutical OTCs from sewage effluents, but they were seldom detected in other seasons. Pollution load index analysis showed that tributaries carrying large amounts of veterinary TCs derived from breeding wastewater and untreated rural sewage contributed larger proportions of the TC load for most drinking water sources than sewage outlets. The contribution ratio of the TC load from tributaries (74.5%) was approximately three times higher than that from sewage discharges (25.5%). The study demonstrated that the control of load from tributaries is the key to mitigating TC pollution of the drinking water sources in the LYR. An effective source tracking method for evaluating the contribution of antibiotic load from multiple diffuse pollution origins and identifying the high-risk contamination sources was established for antibiotic management and control.

AB Since it is known that conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove pharmaceutical compounds, such as carbamazepine, the need for their removal has intensified. The use of biocatalysts, such as enzyme is an environmentally friendly method for carbamazepine biodegradation. Nevertheless, enzyme immobilization is required to facilitate the recovery and reusability and avoid the loss of enzyme. In this work, laccase was immobilized on modified polyimide aerogels by means of covalent bonding. Results showed that the immobilized laccase on polyimide aerogels possesses significantly improved activity under acidic or basic pH range in comparison with the free enzyme. Furthermore, for all the temperature range the activity of the immobilized enzyme was higher compared to the free enzyme form. The storage stability improved by the immobilization on this support material. The reusability tests towards oxidation of 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) showed that the immobilized laccase maintained 22% of the initial activity after 7 cycles. Immobilized laccase on polyimide aerogels for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation exhibited 76% and 74% removal in spiked water and secondary effluent, respectively. Furthermore, after 7 cycles the CBZ removal efficiency remained higher (50% and 65% for spiked water and secondary effluent, respectively).

AB The presence of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) poses potential risks to the aquatic system and human health. This study comprehensively characterized the presence, elimination, and transformation of micropollutants in the WWTP using the suspect screening approaches by employing the gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Overall, 5724 features were identified in influent, while only 3418 features existed in effluents. Hierarchical duster analysis (HCA) was used to group features based on intensity profiles to investigate the behavior and fate of detected features. Four representative trends were defined with the corresponding features. Among 117 compounds identified during the treatment process, there were 99 compounds in influent, 10 biological transformation products (TPs), 3 ozone Ws, and 5 ultraviolet TPs. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies for the detected compounds were determined. The study findings highlight the importance of the removal of emerging pollutants and TPs such as fipronil, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone.

AB In this study, copper-boron-ferrite (Cu-B-Fe) composites were prepared and immobilized on treated graphite electrodes via rice husk silica-based sol-gel approach. The effect of different bimetallic loading ratios was relatively evaluated for fast in-situ electrogeneration of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot) via a new droplet flow-assisted heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactor system. The optimum loading ratios of 20 wt% Fe3+ and 10% wt. Cu2+ greatly improved the catalytic activities towards efficient pharmaceutical beta blockers (atenolol and propranolol) degradation in hospital wastewater. By using Central Composite Design optimization, high correlation coefficients (R-2 and R-2-(adj)) between the experimental and predicted data of 96.83% and 93.43% were realized. At optimized conditions, higher degradation efficiencies of 99.9% for both propranolol and atenolol in hospital wastewater were achieved. The critical contribution of( center dot)OH radicals in the degradation process was assessed using radical scavengers. As a result, a surface mechanism at the integrated cathode electrode was proposed highlighting the contributions of iron and copper. It was confirmed that both copper and iron embedded in the porous graphite electrode surface catalyzed the efficient conversion of H(2)O(2 )to (OH)-O-center dot which in turn enhanced the degradation process. The fabricated cathode electrodes showed stable catalytic activities even after 20 experimental replicates at both neutral and acidic conditions.

AB There is a lack of data on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in estuaries worldwide, with little understanding of their temporal and spatial variations globally. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, diclofenac, trimethoprim and citalopram were measured in twelve estuaries in the UK. Initially, these compounds were monitored in the Humber Estuary, where samples were taken every two months over a twelve month period in order to assess their spatial and temporal variations. Ibuprofen was found at some of the highest concentrations ever measured in an estuary globally (18-6297 ng l(-1)), with paracetamol also measured at relatively high concentrations (4-917 ng l(-1)) in comparison to the other compounds. In terms of spatial distribution, a pattern was observed where the highest concentrations were found at a site at which wastewater is discharged, whilst compound concentrations were often lower upstream and downstream of this site. The downstream profile of pharmaceuticals differed temporally with concentrations highest downstream when input from wastewater effluent was highest. Eleven further estuaries were sampled around the UK in order to put the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the Humber Estuary into a wider context. Pharmaceutical concentrations in the other estuaries sampled were <210 ng l(-1) but, again, ibuprofen and paracetamol were found at concentrations higher than other compounds, whereas diclofenac and citalopram were absent in many estuaries. The Humber, which is the receiving environment for the sewage effluent of approximately 20% (13.6 million people) of the population of England, was observed to have the highest overall concentration of pharmaceuticals in contrast to the other estuaries sampled, thereby representing a worst case scenario for pharmaceutical pollution.

AB The study reports the biodegradability enhancement of pharmaceutical wastewater along with COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) color and toxicity removal via O-3, O-3/Fe2+, O-3/nZVI (nano zero valent iron) processes. Nano catalytic ozonation process (O-3/nZVI) showed the highest biodegradability (BI- BOD5/COD) enhancement of pharmaceutical wastewater up to 0.63 from 0.18 of control with a COD, color and toxicity removal of 62.3%, 93% and 82% respectively. The disappearance of the corresponding Fourier transform infrared (MR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) peaks after pretreatment indicated the degradation or transformation of the refractory organic compounds to more biodegradable organic compounds. The subsequent aerobic degradation study of pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater resulted in biodegradation rate enhancement of 5.31, 2.97, and 122 times for O-3/nZVIO(3)/Fe2+ and O-3 processes respectively. Seed germination test using spinach (Spinacia oleracea) seeds established the toxicity removal of pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ag-BiOBr-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized for the first time and used to promote photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. The Ag-BiOBr-rGO showed an excellent photocatalytic activity to degrade ketoprofen compared with other photocatalysts. The composites were comprehensively characterized to explore the mechanisms of the enhancement. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and scavenger experiments demonstrated that the superoxide radical was the active species. Ketoprofen was completely removed in 120 min. The high photocatalytic activity and stability of the catalyst indicated that the Ag-BiOBr-rGO may have broad application prospects for eliminating pharmaceuticals from wastewater. Four reaction intermediates of ketoprofen were detected by LC-MS/MS and degradation routes were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the applicability of fixed bed bioreactors in two configurations - anaerobic structured bed reactor (ASBR) and anaerobic packed bed reactor (APBR) - in the removal of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Cipro-floxacin (CIP), two antibiotics frequently detected in sanitary sewage. The problem of these pharmaceuticals as emerging contaminants in conventional sewage treatment systems is mainly because they encourage the development and spread of resistance genes in bacteria. Both reactors had similar performances, and the antibiotics were highly removed - APBR: 85 +/- 10% for SMX and 81 +/- 16% for CIP; ASBR: 83 +/- 12% for SMX and 81 +/- 15% for CIP. The ASBR showed to be potentially more feasible in operating and economic terms compared to the APBR, as the former presents a smaller amount of support material in the bed. SMX was completely biotransformed, while the influence of the sorption mechanism was observed for CIP, as its presence was detected sorbed onto biomass throughout the reaction bed of the reactors, with a partition coefficient (log K D ) of around 2.8 L.kg(-l) TSS. The degradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals were fitted using a first-order kinetic model, whereby the reactors behaved as plug flow ones, indicating the possibility of optimizing the operation for a hydraulic retention time of 6 h. The removal kinetics was more favorable for CIP (higher apparent constant kinetic- K-CIP(app)>K-SMX(app). since its biodegradation is linked to the biomass, which is more concentrated in the bed bottom layer. The experimental results showed the potential of anaerobic fixed bed reactors in removing environmentally relevant concentrations of SMX and CIP found in sewage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study aimed towards the utilization of hybrid approaches for the effective treatment of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The focus was to treat pharmaceutical wastewater with low (LSW) and high organic strength (HSW), which was collected from the effluent treatment plant of the representative bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing unit. The hybrid approach included coagulation treatment, biological treatment and gamma irradiation which were employed individually and in sequence to determine the most appropriate treatment sequence for effective remediation of real pharmaceutical wastewater. To compare process performance, gamma-irradiation was employed as pre-treatment and post-treatment stage to biological treatment. To achieve the enhanced removal efficiency using gamma irradiation treatment, oxidant like H2O2 and persulfate ions S2O82- were used and optimized for LSW and HSW. Results indicated that use of H2O2 lead to enhanced COD and TOC removal efficiency when compared to S2O82-. The sequential approach of coagulation, gamma irradiation and biological treatment accounts for the synergistic degradation and detoxification of recalcitrant pharmaceutical wastewaters, and lead to overall 92.7% +/- 2.3% and 90.2% +/- 2.9% of COD removal of LSW and HSW, respectively. The pre-treatment using gamma-irradiation enabled effective treatment, achieving 58.7% +/- 3.2% COD and 80.4% +/- 2.1% TOC removal efficiencies for LSW; whereas 62.0% +/- 2.9% COD and 71.0% +/- 2.7% TOC removal efficiencies were achieved for HSW. Cytotoxicity assessment and cost analysis of the treatment process were examined and analyzed.

AB Traditional wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove trace pharmaceutical and personal care products. In particular, quinolone antibiotics are mainly adsorbed on microbial cell surfaces in excess sludge and are released into the water environment during agricultural supplementation, mainly due to the exfoliation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) caused by changes in environmental conditions. Here, the occurrence of seven typical quinolone antibiotics from three generations in excess sludge was investigated at trace concentrations using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). EPS facilitated adsorption independent of pH and quinolone antibiotic type, and the solid-liquid distribution coefficient decreased markedly as pH increased (pH 5-9, range of municipal wastewater). Metal ions bound in EPS were predominantly responsible for the adsorption of antibiotics in sludge, rather than the macroscopic size of the sludge floc. pH affected patterns of quinolone antibiotics, the zeta potential of sludge floc, and the contents of metal ions contained in sludge. The adsorption capacity of antibiotics first increased and then decreased with increasing pH in the range of pH 3-11, reaching a maximum (20,506, 14,458, 10,689, 22,854, 20,302, 8494, and 29,547 L/kg for CIP, ENR, LOM, MOX, NOR, OFL, and SAR, respectively) near pH 5, at which the cationic bridging of Ca2+ and Mg2+ bound in EPS played a major role owing to their larger ion radius and higher contents in excess sludge. Due to high surface heterogeneity of sludge, the Freundlich model was more suitable than the Langmuir model for describing the adsorption behavior of quinolone antibiotics. These results provide further insight into the release of quinolone antibiotics adsorbed in excess sludge, with potential implications for the agricultural use of sludge.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are compounds frequently found in municipal wastewater and their degradation by conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is generally incomplete. This study compared the efficiency of two advanced oxidation processes (AOP), namely heterogeneous photocatalysis (HP) and electro-Fenton (EF), in the degradation of a mixture of common NSAID (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) dissolved in either deionized water or effluent from a WWTP. Both processes were effective in degrading the NSAID mixture and the trend of degradation was as follows, diclofenac > naproxen > ibuprofen. EF with a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and 0.3 mmol Fe2+ L-1 was the most efficient process to mineralize the organic compounds, achieving up to 92% TOC removal in deionized water and 90% in the WWTP effluent after 3 h of reaction. HP with 1.4 g TiO2 L-1 at pH 7 under sunlight, produced 85% TOC removal in deionized water and 39% in WWTP effluent also after 3 h treatment. The lower TOC removal efficiency shown by HP with the WWTP effluent was attributed mainly to the scavenging of reactive species by background organic matter in the wastewater. On the contrary, inorganic ions in the wastewater may produce oxidazing species during the EF process, which contributes to a higher degradation efficiency. EF is a promising option for the treatment of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals in municipal WWTP at competitive electrical energy efficiencies.

AB The release of pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) into aquatic ecosystems poses an environmental risk resulting in a chronic exposure of non-target organisms. A great variety of PhACs, of generally low concentrations, and the complicated sample preparation, makes circumstantial the accurate detection and quantification. Additionally, there is little information published about the spatiotemporal variation of the PhAC load in a larger catchment area utilised for touristic purposes. In addition to the natural biotic and abiotic changes, the seasonal variation of tourism also has a dramatic impact on water quality and the natural ecosystem in larger catchment areas. Therefore, our aim was to develop a reliable solid-phase extraction (SPE)-superaitical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous multi-residue analysis of drugs to reveal the spatiotemporal changes in the PhAC contaminations in the waters of an important touristic region, the catchment area of the largest shallow lake in Central Europe, Lake Balaton (Hungary). The environmental application of the developed method revealed 69 out of the traced 134 chemical compounds, including 15 PhACs, which were detected from natural waters for the first time. Wastewater treatment plant (wwrp) loads have a major role in the PhAC contamination of the studied area; at the same time, the mass tourism-induced PhAC contamination was also detectable. Furthermore, the impact of tourism was indicated by elevated concentrations of recreational substances (e.g., caffeine and illicit drugs) in the touristic season affecting the water quality of this important summer holiday destination.

AB Two nitrifying MBBR reactors were operated in parallel, one with PAC dosing and one without, to determine the effects of PAC dosing on nitrification and micropollutant adsorption in municipal wastewater. The removal of micropollutants was evaluated for several doses of PAC and batch experiments were performed to measure adsorption kinetics and nitrification rates. The influence of PAC on the nitrifying microbial community was examined by high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Long-term operation of the pilot reactors showed that nitrification could be maintained while supplying PAC at increasing doses, as confirmed by high nitrification rates and significant abundance of nitrifying bacteria. The adsorption of organic micropollutants could be controlled by the PAC dose, and increased dosing resulted in corresponding improvements in removal efficiency. Biomass, suspended or attached to carriers, did not interfere with the adsorption of organic micropollutants. Freundlich isotherms obtained from the batch experiments were used to predict removal of organic micropollutants in the pilot reactors, suggesting that batch adsorption experiments can be used to predict micropollutant removal on a full scale. Collectively, the results show that nitrification and adsorption of organic micropollutants can be performed simultaneously in an MBBR. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research aimed to further our understanding of how environmental processes control micropollutant dynamics in surface water systems as a means to predict peak concentration events and inform intermittent sampling strategies. We characterized micropollutant concentrations in daily composite samples from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station over 18 months. These data were compiled alongside environmental covariates, including daily measurements of weather, hydrology, and water quality parameters, to generate a novel data set with high temporal resolution. We evaluated the temporal trends of several representative micropollutants, along with cumulative metrics of overall micropollutant contamination, by means of multivariable analyses to determine which combination of covariates best predicts micropollutant dynamics and peak events. Peak events of agriculture-derived micropollutants were best predicted positive associations with turbidity and UV254 absorbance and negative associations with baseflow index. Peak events by of wastewater-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with alkalinity and negative associations with streamflow rate. We demonstrate that these predictors can be used to inform intermittent sampling strategies aimed at capturing peak events, and we generalize the approach so that it could be applied in other watersheds. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to contextualize micropollutant data derived from infrequent grab samples.

AB Background and Objectives: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the major reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Thus, the investigation on ARB and ARGs from WWTPs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In order to uncover the resistome in a WWTP treating effluents from a pharmaceutical industry in China, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli strains were isolated and their whole genome sequences were obtained and analyzed. Moreover, metagenomic sequencing was applied to give a comprehensive view of antibiotic resistance in this WWTP.
   Methods: 18 ESBL-producing E. coli strains were isolated from a WWTP located in Taizhou, China on April, 2017. All strains were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The whole genome sequences were assembled using SPAdes software and annotated with RAST server. Sequence types (STs), plasmids, ARGs and virulence genes were predicted from the genomes using MLST, Plasmid Finder, ResFinder and Virulence Finder, respectively. Metagenomic DNA of the same sample was extracted and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform. Metagenomic sequences were assembled using SOAPdenovo software.
   Results: All 18 ESBL-producing E. coli strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, and ceftriaxone. Analysis of their genomes revealed that all strains carried beta-lactamase encoding genes and the most prevalent type was bla(CTX-M). Various virulence genes and ARGs confronting resistance to other types of antimicrobial agents were also predicted. Further investigation on the metagenomics data indicated 11 ARGs with high amino acid identities to the known ARGs. Five of these ARGs, aadA1, aac(6')-lb-cr, flo(R), sul2 and sul1, were also present in the genomes of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from the same sample.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed the resistome of a pharmaceutical WWTP by both culture-dependent and metegenomic methods. The existence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains, indicating that pharmaceutical WWTP can play a significant role in the emergence of ARB. The occurrence of ARGs annotated from the metagenomic data suggests that pharmaceutical WWTP can play a significant role in the emergence of ARGs. Our findings highlight the need for strengthening the active surveillance of ARB and ARGs from pharmaceutical industry.

AB Methylparaben and triclosan are antimicrobial agents widely used as preservatives in a variety of personal care and pharmaceutical products. Wastewater is considered the main source of these compounds in the environment. Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors are a high rate technology for wastewater treatment based on biological processes and have been shown to be efficient in removing different types of compounds; however, little is known about the effect of contaminants such as methylparaben and triclosan on their behavior and effectiveness. In this study, we evaluate and compare the microbial and physicochemical behavior of EGSB systems during methylparaben and triclosan removal. The presence of different concentrations of pollutants had an influence on the cluster organization of microbial communities, especially bacteria. However, this did not affect the stability and performance of the EGSB systems. The banding patterns of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of archaea demonstrated the constant presence and abundance of Methanosaeta concilii throughout all stages of operation, showing that this microorganism played a fundamental role in the stability of the reactors for the production of methane. The type of compound and its concentration influenced the expression of the mcrA and ACAs genes; however, these changes did not alter the stability and performance of the EGSB systems.

AB Exposure to antibiotics, biocides, chemical preservatives, and heavy metals in different settings such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may apply selective pressure resulting in the enrichment of multiple resistant, co- and cross-resistant strains of bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize potentially pathogenic triclosan (TCS) - and/or, chloroxylenol (PCMX) tolerant bacteria from sewage and river water in the North-West, Potchefstroom, South Africa. Several potential pathogens were identified, with Aeromonas isolates being most abundant. Clonal relationships between Aeromonas isolates found at various sampling points were elucidated using ERIC-PCR. Selected isolates were characterized for their minimum inhibitory concentrations against the biocides, as well as antibiotic resistance profiles, followed by an evaluation of synergistic and antagonistic interactions between various antimicrobials. Isolates were also screened for the presence of extracellular enzymes associated with virulence. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of both biocides in the wastewater, but fingerprinting methods did not reveal whether the WWTP is the source from which these organisms enter the environment. Isolates exhibited various levels of resistance to antimicrobials as well as several occurrences of synergy and antagonisms between the biocides and select antibiotics. Several isolates had a very high potential for virulence but further study is required to identify the specific virulence and resistance genes associated with the isolates in question.

AB This work describes the protocol developed for preparing an artificial digested sludge to be used for the ecotoxicological evaluation and risk assessment of chemical substances that are previewed to attain the soil through sewage sludge applications for fertilization (e.g. pharmaceutical compounds). Such evaluations have been made with standard protocols for ecotoxicological tests with terrestrial species in which the chemical substances are directly spiked to the test soil. This procedure lacks ecological relevance in terms of the role the sludge organic matter plays on the bioavailability and fate of chemical substances. Here we describe the protocol and the composition for obtaining the artificial sludge, prepared with commercial pet food and eggs white to mimic the composition of domestic sewage sludge in terms of proteins, carbon hydrates, fat and fibers content. Further, the conditions ascertained for the anaerobic digestion of the organic mixture are described, and the final properties of the sludge are presented, after repeating the procedure twice.

AB In term of pharmaceutical and their intermediate compounds analysis, UPLC/MS method is a valuable equipment to achieve better confirmation on their biodegradation by fungi. The T47D-KBluc reporter gene assay is an appropriate tool to investigate to removal of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from a synthetic wastewater. A consortium of isolated South African indigenous fungi Aspergillus niger, Mucor circinelloides, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Trametes polyzona and Rhizopus microspores was found to perform a removal of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and to reduce their estrogenic activity below the limit of detection in a sequencing batch reactor. Here are presented data regarding the phenolic compounds list and the method validation for UPLC/MS analysis used for selected pharmaceutical compounds namely carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen and their metabolites, as well as the T47D-KBluc bioassay using as positive control, the agonist E-2 for estrogenic activity and the antagonist ICI 182,780 for antiestrogenic activity.

AB The release of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (Ibu), Naproxen (Nab) and Diclofenac (Dic) to the aquatic system cause serious environmental problems. In this study, green-synthesized copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have been used as nano-adsorbent for the removal of Ibu, Nab, and Dic from wastewater samples. Formation of Cu NPs was confirmed by different analytical techniques. The adsorption parameters such as temperature, pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and contact time were studied. The best removal results were obtained at these conditions: temperature 298 K, pH = 4.5, 10.0 mg Cu NPs, 60 min. At these conditions, the removal percentage of Ibu, Nap, and Dic were found to be 74.4, 86.9 and 91.4% respectively. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities were calculated as 36.0, 33.9 and 33.9 mg/g for Dic, Nap, and Ibu respectively. The kinetic studies conducted that the sorption process obeyed the second order kinetic model, while the thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous, endothermic (+23.8, +40.8 and +38.3 kJ/mol for Ibu, Nap and Dic respectively). The results revealed that green-synthesized copper nano-adsorbent may be used for the removal of the anti-inflammatory drugs from real wastewater efficiently.

AB This study was focused on the generation of sulfate radicals and their applicability as powerful oxidants for degrading complex organic compounds with the final objective of operating in flow systems. To this end, the removal of two compounds from the pharmaceutical industry was assessed, lissamine green and prednisolone. Initially, sulfate radicals were generated by the activation of persulfate with iron as homogenous catalyst, and the key parameters involved in the process, as catalyst concentration and oxidant dosage, were evaluated. Furthermore, with the aim of preventing the secondary contamination due to metal leaching and to be operate in a continuous mode, a heterogeneous catalyst was developed. For it, the iron was fixed on a cationic resin as Amberlite IR120 Na+ form. It was demonstrated that the removal of both pollutants increases with greater catalyst dosages, achieving a decay of 85% within 25 min with 30 gL(-1) of catalyst. Moreover, the reuse capability of the catalyst was tested, illustrating that it is rough enough for its reuse. Conversely, in order to develop a continuous treatment in flow system, a fixed bed reactor was constructed and its feasibility was proven. Different experiments with residence times from 10 min to 60 min were performed, obtaining a removal level of approximate to 95% and 90% for prednisolone and lissamine green, respectively, at residence time of 60 min. In conclusion, the potential of sulfate radicals-based technology for degrading organic contaminants has been demonstrated.

AB Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of floating organic droplet (DLLME-SFO) was applied to isolate budesonide (BUD) and sulfasalazine (SULF) from aqueous samples. The effects of different parameters on the efficiency on the extraction such as type of extrahent and dispersive solvent, ionic strength, pH of sample, and centrifugation time were investigated. Moreover, the influence of foreign substances on a studied process was tested. The calibration curves were recorded. The linearity ranges for BUD and SULF were 0.022-8.611 mu g mL(-1) and 0.020-7.968 mu g mL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) 0.011 mu g mL(-1) and 0.012 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The enrichment factors (EF) for two analytes were high: for BUD it was 145.7 and for SULF, 119.5. The elaborated procedure was applied for HPLC-UV determination of these analytes in water and wastewater samples.

AB Due to large drug consumption, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) can be found as water contaminants. The removal of PhACs is a significant issue, as they can easily overtake traditional purification methods. Because of their surface properties, carbon nanomaterials are among the most efficient materials able to adsorb PhACs. However, their limitation is their recovery after use and their possible leakage into the aquatic system. Consequently, new hybrid supramolecular ionic liquid gels (HILGs) have been designed for the adsorption of some antibiotic drugs (ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid) from water. The chemical-physical properties of gels, such as the temperature of the gel-sol transition, morphology, and rheology, have been studied for their use as sorbents. These properties influence the gel removal efficiency of PhAC, i.e., the best system is the gel that presents weaker colloidal forces. A fast removal (RE = 51%) is obtained in 3 h for ciprofloxacin, while a slower adsorption process is observed for nalidixic acid (RE = 88% in 24 h). HILGs can be recycled up to seven cycles and regenerated. In addition, they can be used with higher concentrations or volumes of PhAC and in a realistic apparatus like dialysis membranes. These peculiarities suggest that HILGs can be competitive with more complex sorbent systems.

AB Emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds were detected worldwide in different environmental compartments. Nowadays, multiple studies are focused on the investigation of their environmental fate, as well as to find new, efficient and sustainable removal technologies. Several studies demonstrated that heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the most promising techniques used for water purification. Thus, the aim of our work was to evaluate the photodegradation efficiency of a refractory emergent compound, named clofibric acid, under UV light in aqueous solution. We report that photodegradation and mineralization efficiency are strongly dependent of the catalyst used. Results showed that the photodegradation was enhanced in the presence of TiO2 Aeroxide. The complete elimination was achieved for an initial pollutant concentration of 1.5 mg/L after 30 min of irradiation, the degradation rate following the pseudo-first order kinetics. It was also observed that the rate constant for the photodegradation process is affected by the concentration of catalyst. Process efficiency is enhanced by increasing the light intensity. The simultaneous reduction of pollutant concentration and dissolved organic carbon demonstrates the mineralization of the target molecule. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the addition of nitrate to the system increases the pollutant degradation rate, while the carbonate reduces its removal, suggesting that this last ion can act as a hydroxyl scavenger. Preliminary phytotoxicity tests were also carried out and showed the capacity of the heterogeneous photocatalysis to reduce the toxicity of reaction intermediates generated during the photocatalytic reaction.

AB Low content of micropollutants in sewage sludge, essential to allow its safe re-use in agriculture, requires effective removals during the digestion phase. To this purpose, we investigated the performance of the anaerobic-aerobic sequential digestion process applied to real waste sludge in the removal of several classes of standard pollutants, i.e. extractable organic halogens (EOXs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and alkylphenolethoxylates. In addition, emerging pollutants were also investigated based on their widespread occurrence and on their physicochemical characteristics and eco-toxicological relevance: quaternary ammonium compounds, a number of pharmaceuticals and selected biocides. The anaerobic step was conducted at mesophilic conditions, while two operating temperatures were tested for the post-aerobic treatment, i.e. 20 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Results showed that the post-aerobic digestion step enhanced the removal of all investigated standard and emerging micropollutants, even in presence of high accumulation in the anaerobic digestate (occurred for some PAHs and PCB congeners). Increased removals (up to 30%) have been generally observed at 37 degrees C aerobic temperature in comparison with tests at T = 20 degrees C for all investigated organic micropollutants, with the only exception of halogenated compounds (i.e. EOXs and PCBs). Low biodegradability and high bioaccumulation of the investigated pollutants were successfully faced by the sequential process, which has been demonstrated as an effective alternative solution to produce digested sludge for safe agricultural re-use.

AB Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogenic agent and can enter the aquatic environment in wastewater. It has been reported that TAM can induce hepatic steatosis in vertebrates, however, the effects of TAM exposure on lipid metabolism of hepatopancreas in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, four TAM concentrations (0, 6.7, 13.4 and 20 mu g g(-1) crab body weight) were injected into the swimming-leg of swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus, as a means of evaluating the effects of TAM on the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes, lipid composition, and hepatopancreas histology. The results showed that the mRNA levels of three lipogenic related genes (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acyl desaturase (FAD)) decreased significantly in the 6.7 mu g g(-1) and 20 mu g g(-1) TAM treatments compare to the control. The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner as TAM concentration increased. The mRNA levels of two lipid catabolism-related genes (acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)) were down-regulated among the three TAM treatments, while the enzyme activity and mRNA level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) was up-regulated by TAM treatments. Compared to the control, the lowest levels of total lipids and phospholipids were detected in the 6.7 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment, while the 20 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment had the lowest free fatty acids concentration. The 6.7 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment had the lowest percentages of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and total monounsaturated fatty acids (Sigma MDFA), whilst simultaneously recording the highest percentages of 18:2n-6 and 20:2n-6 in this treatment. Moreover, histological observations indicated that TAM caused the walls of the hepatopancreatic tubules to become brittle, with a concurrent increase in the number of blister-like cells. These results suggest that TAM damages the hepatopancreas and leads to a reduction in hepatopancreatic lipid deposition in P. trituberculatus.

AB Oxidative degradation and mineralization of the antifungal drug Nystatin (NYS) was investigated using photochemical advanced oxidation processes UV-C irradiation (280-100nm), H2O2 photolysis (UV/H2O2), and photo-Fenton (UV/H2O2/Fe3+). The effect of operating parameters such as [H2O2], [Fe3+], and [NYS] initial concentrations on degradation efficiency and mineralization ability of different processes was comparatively examined in order to optimize the processes. Photo-Fenton was found to be the most efficient process attaining complete degradation of 0.02mM (19.2mgL(-1)) NYS at 2min and a quasi-complete mineralization (97%) of its solution at 5h treatment while UV/H2O2 and UV-C systems require significantly more time for complete degradation and lower mineralization degrees. The degradation and mineralization kinetics were affected by H2O2 and Fe3+ initial concentration, the optimum dosages being 4mM and 0.4mM, respectively. Consumption of H2O2 during photo-Fenton treatment is very fast during the first 30min leading to the appearance of two stages in the mineralization. The evolution of toxicity of treated solutions was assessed and confirmed the effectiveness of photo-Fenton process for the detoxification of NYS solution at the end of treatment. Application to real wastewater from pharmaceutical industry containing the target molecule NYS showed the effectiveness of photo-Fenton process since it achieved 92% TOC removal rate at 6-h treatment time.

AB Antidepressants are widely used in current times; therefore, they pose a potential risk to ecosystems through the disposal of domestic sewage, even after processing in treatment plants. This study proposes a fast method for the simultaneous determination of commonly used antidepressants (citalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and amitriptyline) and caffeine as an anthropic marker, based on microwave-assisted solvent extraction followed by quantification using HPLC-DAD. The analytical method was validated and considered satisfactory for the simultaneous determination of the analytes in sewage sludge and sediments. No interferences were observed in the retention times of the analytes under study, indicating selectivity. Nevertheless, the study of the matrix effect revealed interference of the sludge and sediment matrices in the sensitivity and accuracy of the analytical method; therefore, calibration by standard addition was employed. The linearity was adequate for the concentration range of 50-800 ng mL(-1), with detection and quantification limits of 15-100 ng g(-1) and 100-250 ng g(-1), respectively. Precision was estimated to be less than 8% in terms of the coefficient of variation. Accuracy was assessed by fortification of sediment and sludge samples at three concentration levels and the recovery range varied from 60 to 99%. The developed and validated method was applied to samples of sewage sludge and sediments obtained from the Itaipu Reservoir region. The results confirm the presence of the analytes in the sewage sludge and indicate that treatment plant residue is a route of insertion of micropollutants into the local environment, because the antidepressants were also found in river sediments.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been widely used as a complementary method for estimating consumption of illicit drugs in the population. Temporal drug consumption estimates derived from WBE can provide important information for law enforcement and public health authorities in understanding changes in supply and demand of illicit drugs, but currently lacking in China. In this study, influent wastewater samples from a municipal sewage treatment plant in Guangzhou, China were collected for 8weeks to investigate the temporal change in consumption of six illicit drugs in the catchment. The results indicated that methamphetamine and ketamine were the dominant illicit drugs in Guangzhou with the per capita use of 14.7-470.7mg/day/1000 people and 64.9-673.7mg/day/1000 people, respectively. No distinct weekly patterns were observed for illicit drug consumption in Guangzhou, indicating that drug users are likely to be regular ones. Further assessment about the impact of public holidays on the consumption behavior of drugs showed little impact for ketamine (p=0.689), but higher consumptions of methamphetamine (p=0.003) and cocaine (p=0.027) were observed during public holidays than the control period. The considerable decrease in drug consumption observed in October 2017 compared with January and May 2017 was possibly the consequence of law enforcement action.

AB In this study, the concentrations of nine typical antibiotics, including sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamethazine (SM2), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), ofloxacin (OFX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), trimethoprim (TMP), oxytetracycline (OTC), and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), were detected in the Yitong River by solid-phase extraction high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of the antibiotics were analyzed. Additionally, an improved immobilized substrate enzyme substrate method (DST-enzyme substrate method) was developed and used to evaluate the antibiotic resistance of coliform bacteria to OFX, CIP, enrofloxacin (ENR), TC, sulfisoxazole (SOX), and TMP in the Yitong River. The results showed that the concentrations of the nine antibiotics ranged from nd (not detected) to 1.361 mu g/L. The detection rate and concentration of OFX were the highest, followed by CIP, and the detection rate and concentration of SM2 and OTC were the lowest. The detection rate and concentrations of antibiotics were higher in August and November than those in May. The antibiotics were mainly distributed in the livestock sewage discharge and suburban domestic sewage discharge areas. Moreover, the drug resistance of total coliform bacteria to fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and TMP varied with season.

AB The aim of this work is to synthesize a magnetic magnetite/multi-walled carbon nanotube (Fe3O4/MWCNT) catalyst by a method combining co-precipitation and hydrothermal treatments for the efficient removal of diclofenac (DCF) by catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO). The support (MWCNTs) shows a moderate-large surface area and good adsorption capacity, leading to the improvement of the magnetite (Fe3O4) dispersion on its surface. The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied in order to find out the effect of the reaction parameters on DCF removal, allowing to establish the optimum operating conditions (T=60 degrees C, [H2O2](0)=2.7mM, [catalyst]=1.0gL(-1)). The optimum CWPO experiment showed an outstanding catalytic activity at non-modified pH solution (6.7), obtaining a 95% of DCF removal after 3h reaction time; this high efficiency can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the iron-based catalyst with the high quantity of (OH)-O-center dot radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst. In addition, the Fe3O4/MWCNT material exhibited good reusability along three consecutive reaction cycles, finding a pollutant removal close to 95% in each cycle of 3h reaction time. Additionally, a degradation mechanism pathway was proposed for the removal of DCF by CWPO. The versatility of the material was finally demonstrated in the treatment of different environmentally relevant aqueous matrices (a wastewater treatment plant effluent, surface water, and hospital wastewater), obtaining an effective reduction in the ecotoxicity values.

AB Combinations of biological, oxidative and adsorptive advanced treatment technologies in hybrid systems hold promise to result in an improved mitigation of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) from municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. This study investigated potential process combinations including sequential biofiltration, ozonation and activated carbon adsorption and focused on synergies between these treatment steps. Results proved that pre-treatment of WWTP effluent using biofiltration resulted in a significant decrease in ozone demand for the transformation of TOrCs characterized by moderate reaction rate constants with ozone. At similar ozone doses the transformation of TOrCs was increased up to 25% when WWTP effluent was pre-treated by biofiltration compared to the transformation observed in WWTP effluent without pre-treatment. This was explained by the removal of dissolved organic matter during biofiltration (21 +/- 3% DOC and 11 +/- 3% UVA(254)) reducing the competition for ozone. For 12 out of 14 investigated TOrCs biological and biological-oxidative pre-treatment using sequential biofiltration with intermediate aeration or ozonation resulted in a substantial, up to 3-fold increase in treated filter bed volumes until a 10% breakthrough of granular activated carbon adsorbers was observed. Also here, the improved process efficiency was explained by the removal and structural alteration of dissolved organic matter during biological or biological-oxidative pre-treatment of the WWTP effluent.

AB This article describes a proof-of-concept study designed for the reuse of wastewater using microbial electrochemical cells (MECs) combined with complementary post-treatment technologies. This study mainly focused on how the integrated approach works effectively for wastewater reuse. In this study, microalgae and ultraviolet C (UVC) light were used for advanced wastewater treatment to achieve site-specific treatment goals such as agricultural reuse and aquifer recharge. The bio-electrosynthesis of H2O2 in MECs was carried out based on a novel concept to integrate with UVC, especially for robust removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) resistant to biodegradation, and the algal treatment was configured for nutrient removal from MEC effluent. UVC irradiation has also proven to be an effective disinfectant for bacteria, protozoa, and viruses in water. The average energy consumption rate for MECs fed acetate-based synthetic wastewater was 0.28 +/- 0.01 kWh per kg of H2O2, which was significantly more efficient than are conventional electrochemical processes. MECs achieved 89 +/- 2% removal of carbonaceous organic matter (measured as chemical oxygen demand) in the wastewater (anolyte) and concurrent production of H2O2 up to 222 +/- 11 mg L-1 in the tapwater (catholyte). The nutrients (N and P) remaining after MECs were successfully removed by subsequent phycoremediation with microalgae when aerated (5% CO2, v/v) in the light. This complied with discharge permits that limit N to 20 mg L-1 and P to 0.5 mg L-1 in the effluent. H2O2 produced on site was used to mediate photolytic oxidation with UVC light for degradation of recalcitrant TOrCs in the algal-treated wastewater. Carbamazepine was used as a model compound and was almost completely removed with an added 10 mg L-1 H2O2 at a UVC dose of 1000 mJ cm(-2). These results should not be generalized, but critically discussed, because of the limitations of using synthetic wastewater.

AB Wastewater effluents are teeming with organisms, nutrients and chemical substances which water treatment processes fail to remove. Among these substances, pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants are a frequent occurrence, and have been reported to lead to severe effects in the physiology and behaviour of non-target marine species across taxa. Venlafaxine (VFX) is one of the most consistently prescribed substances for the treatment of human depressive disorders, acting as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In the present study, the potential effects of this antidepressant on the survival and key behaviours (i.e. movement, aggression and foraging) of white seabream (Diplodus sargus) larvae were addressed. Larvae were submitted to an acute exposure of two different VFX treatments (low concentration, 10 mu gL(-1); and high concentration, 100 mu gL(-1)) for a total of 48h. Sampling took place after 24 and 48h of exposure. Overall, results showed a significant effect of a two-day exposure to VFX in larvae of D. sargus. Survival was significantly reduced by exposure to a high concentration, but behavioural effects of antidepressant exposure were subtle: i.e. increased attack frequency and temporary modulation of capture success. Further research efforts should be directed towards evaluating the potential chronic effects of antidepressants in marine species, if we are to anticipate possible pressures on natural populations, and effectively advice policymakers towards the investment in new and more efficient methods of wastewater treatments.

AB Indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics, their discharge into the environment, and the development of resistant genes in a natural ecosystem are ever-increasing global threats. Metronidazole is applied to treat infection diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. In this research, TiO2/Fe+3 was used as a heterogeneous nano-photocatalyst for the degradation of metronidazole with UV-C radiation as the energy source. Parameters tested in the removal process were pH=3, 7, and 11; antibiotic concentration of 80mg/L; contact times of 30, 60, 90, and 120min; and nano-photocatalyst of TiO2/Fe+3 with concentrations of 30, 60, 90, 250, 500, 750, and 1000mg/L. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of metronidazole was studied. Optimal conditions were achieved on synthetic solutions; then, all experiments were performed on wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using an HPLC device. All tests were replicated three times according to the standard methods of water and wastewater experiments, the 20th edition. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 and the statistical test ANOVA. The optimal conditions for removing metronidazole from synthetic solution included, 500 mg/L for nano-photocatalyst concentration, pH=11 and 120min contact time. Removal efficiency of antibiotic under optimal conditions was 97% from synthetic solutions and 69.85% from pharmaceutical wastewater. Finally, Fe+3-TiO2/UV-C were identified as a promising technique for the removal of metronidazole with high efficiency from aqueous solutions.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in coking wastewater are difficult to remove due to their complex composition, poor biodegradability, and toxicity. In this work, the potassium ferrate process and the traditional Fenton process were compared to a combination of the ferrate(VI) and Fenton processes for the purpose of degrading phenanthrene, a typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. A series of laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the chemical reaction kinetics of the ferrate(VI) process and the optimum reaction conditions of ferrate(VI) process and the combined ferrate(VI) and Fenton process. The optimum pH of the ferrate(VI) process was 6, and the apparent activation energy of the reaction was found 29.68kJ/mol. In contrast, the optimum conditions for the combined process was an initial pH of 5 and a molar ratio of PHE:K2FeO4:H2O2 of 1:2:2. Under these conditions, the maximum removal efficiency of the combined process reached 84.01%, increased by 10.35% and 31.4% of the maximum rate achieved in the ferrate(VI) process and the Fenton process, respectively. The combined ferrate(VI) and Fenton process also had the advantage of no additional Fe(II) catalyst being required throughout the whole reaction process, resulting in a relatively low initial cost for the practical application of the combined process.

AB BACKGROUND The pharmaceutical residues in water are considered globally to be typical hazardous pollutants. Many technologies have been reported to eliminate these residues, such as photocatalysis, which has usually been applied in a suspension system with powdery photocatalyst. The disadvantage of this system, hindering its practical application, is its low recyclability. Ferrite-based photocatalysts have been synthesized to resolve this problem. In this work, silver (Ag)-modified zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanoparticles were immobilized onto porous mineral diatomite. The physicochemical properties of this composite were studied systematically, and its photocatalytic efficiency was investigated via the degradation of antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) and disinfection of bacteria Escherichia coli under visible light. RESULTS The degradation rate increased after the catalyst was immobilized onto diatomite, due to the adsorption and degradation synergistic effect. The Ag cluster improved the visible-light-driven photoactivity of ZnFe2O4, and its optimal percentage was determined. The best catalyst dosage during the degradation process also was obtained. The optimal catalyst exhibited its removal rate of OTC (10 mg L-1 aqueous solution) as 90.5% in 2.5 h, and disinfection rate of E. coli as 87.2% in 2 h, under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the photocatalysis mechanism was illustrated. CONCLUSION This composite could be recovered simply from the water body via an external magnet, and indicated no obvious decrease of photoactivity after being recycled five times for photodegradation or photodisinfection tests. This nanocomposite showed good potential for application in wastewater remediation process, thanks to its high photocatalytic efficiency under visible light, as well as its good reusability and stability.

AB BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical industrial wastewater represents a challenge for biological treatment due to its complex composition. This research investigates the bioaugmentation effect of indigenous bacterial strains on the kinetics of the activated sludge process in the treatment of real high-strength pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. RESULTS Two bacterial strains were isolated from pharmaceutical effluent and identified as Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas putida. The highest removal efficiency of dissolved organic matter from pharmaceutical wastewater was 71.43% within 24 h, obtained by bioaugmented activated sludge with P. putida, at the initial concentration of activated sludge 4.39 +/- 0.37 g L-1. The biokinetic parameters of the biodegradation process were calculated using the Endo-Haldane model, where bioaugmented activated sludge showed higher affinity to pharmaceutical wastewater. CONCLUSION The biodegradation process of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater showed enhancement through bioaugmentation of activated sludge with indigenous bacterial isolates. Considering the increasingly demand for pharmaceuticals on a global scale, the bioaugmentation potential of A. hydrophila and P. putida could contribute to enhancement of biodegradation through reduction in process time and environmental impact.

AB The development of technologies capable of eliminating a wide spectrum of micropollutants of diverse nature from waters becomes essential. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) seem to be the most promising technologies but the most appropriate AOP to remove the micropollutants is still under debate. In this study, for the first time, the comparison of the efficiency of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis and iron-impregnated faujasite heterogeneous photo-Fenton process is conducted towards the removal of a mixture of 21 micropollutants from a real river at low concentrations. The sampling area is situated on the Meurthe River, downstream the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Nancy in the northeast of France. To assess the impact of the micropollutants concentration and the matrix composition, two sampling campaigns have been performed at different periods of the year. Among the targeted micropollutants, 14 pharmaceuticals, 1 personal care product, 4 endocrine disruptors and 2 perfluorinated molecules are specifically followed.Their concentrations range from few ng L-1 to hundreds ng L-1. The adsorption of all the micropollutants is higher onto the iron-impregnated faujasite compared to that onto TiO2 due to the larger surface area of the iron-impregnated faujasite. The iron-impregnated faujasite offers superior photo-Fenton oxidation efficiency towards the degradation of the micropollutants over the TiO2 photocatalysis system. For almost all the micropollutants, the contaminants are totally removed after 30 min by photo-Fenton while a longer period is necessary by photocatalysis. A relationship between the removal efficiencies and the octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of each micropollutant has been extracted from the data. A further economic evaluation confirms that the photo-Fenton process is also the better in terms of cost.

AB The occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, and potential risks of 21 glucocorticoids (GCs) and 3 mineralocorticoids (MCs) in four rivers were studied by investigating the surface waters from the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. These environmental corticosteroids (ECs) were commonly present in the river surface waters with average concentrations varying from <0.17 ng/L for fluticasone propionate to 5.6 ng/L for clobetasone butyrate; and cortisone had the highest concentration, 32.9 ng/L. The total ECs ranged in concentration from undetectable to 83.3 ng/L, with a mean and median of 8.1 ng/L and 4.8 ng/L, respectively. Spatially the total EC concentration levels in the Pearl River system occurred in the following order: Zhujiang River (ZR) > Dongjiang River (DR) > Shiziyang waterway (SW) > Beijiang River (BR). These levels generally demonstrated a trend of increasing from upstream to midstream or down-stream then attenuating toward the estuary. Considerable seasonal variations in the ECs differed among rivers. Higher ECs concentrations in winter were mostly found in the ZR, whereas lower levels were found in the DR. Moreover, the temporal variations of the ECs were marginal in the BR and SW. These spatiotemporal distributions of the ECs might have been simultaneously influenced by pollution sources derived from anthropogenic activities and river hydrologic conditions. Correlation analyses indicated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could play a key role in the occurrence and distribution of ECs in an aquatic environment. Risk assessment demonstrated that the occurrence of ECs might have posed medium to high risk to aquatic organisms in the Pearl River. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a magnetic composite was synthesized using chitosan, diphenylurea and formaldehyde with magnetic nanoparticles, (MnFe2O4) via condensation polymerization. The newly synthesized magnetic nanocomposite (CDF@MF) was characterized using several analytical techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and etc. To investigate the applicability of CDF@MF, it was employed as an adsorbent for rapidly removal of an antibiotic, namely, tetracycline (TC), from aqueous solution using several factors such as pH, the adsorbent dose, the initial concentration and the contact time. The adsorption kinetics results exhibited that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-first-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity for TC was calculated to be 168.24 mg/g based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, with fitting correlation coefficient (R-2), 0.9955. The regeneration study advice that no major change in the adsorption capacity was noticed and show 157.97% adsorption performance after seven cycles. These results are standing to indicate that the prepared porous CDF@MF could be used as a low-cost, effective, reusable adsorbent for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) and zeta potential are being increasingly used in water, wastewater, and pharmaceutical applications. In this study, the zeta potential behaviors of eight different 0.01 M salts (NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaCl2, Na2CO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4) for 0.9 nm tubular ceramic titanium dioxide NF membrane were measured for the first time using a filtration potential technique by conducting in-situ two electrodes made from a composite material that consisted of pure silver and 4% gauge 21 gold. The measurements were conducted under pH 3-9 at an applied transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 0.25-1.5 bar. Experimental results showed that the membranes of the salts were negatively charged at neutral pH and had an isoelectric point (IEP) of pH 3.4-3.8. Membrane zeta potential results were compared and justified using the electrophoresis method for the same membrane. The powder dispersions of the pulverized membrane in this measuring technique were a suspension at a certain salt concentration. Experimental results from the electrophoresis method agreed with those of the filtration potential method, whose IEP was at pH 3.3-3.5. The rejection experiments of the reference solutions (0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl) were conducted at a constant applied TMP of 12 bar. Rejections results showed that both NaCl concentrations were a function of pH. The low rejections were 17% and 21% at pH 3.8 for 0.01 and 0.001 M NaCl, respectively, and the high rejections were 34.2% and 38% at pH 9. This work also investigated the effects of the measured membrane zeta potential on the ion rejection of the standard solution of NaCl (0.01 and 0.001 M) using a similar pH range.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of wood-derived biochar for the removal of 18 pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) from untreated municipal wastewater (WW). The WW samples were analyzed by an HPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS method. Two aliquots of WWs were incubated with biochar sorbent for 2 h and 7 d. The highest absolute removal of PCs was achieved for ibuprofen and caffeine (2.6 and 13.2 mg L-1 after 7 d, respectively). The highest removal efficiency after 2 h incubation was detected for erythromycin (72.0% +/- 12.7 %) while lower degree of removal was observed for other compounds with much higher initial concentrations. The results indicated that a 2 h sorption process on biochar may be insufficient and 7 d incubation is preferred for quantitative removal of xylazine, metoprolol, and azithromycin. However, the sorption of ketoprofen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, and simvastatin on biochar was more effective during the first 2 h than during the following 7 d. Regression analysis revealed a strong correlation (R-2 similar to 0.9) between the absolute amounts of the removed PCs and their initial concentrations. In this respect, the removal of the last traces of PCs from WW is expected to present technological challenges.

AB Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) are promising as a post-treatment for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. However, the effect of easily degradable carbon sources on the degradation of pharmaceuticals is unclear. This study shows the influence of acetate on the degradation of 26 pharmaceuticals in an MBBR was dose- and compound-dependent: while the degradation of venlafaxine, tramadol and ciprofloxacin was promoted (increase of reaction rate constant (k) by 133%, 212%, 55%) by acetate, its presence caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen, citalopram and diclofenac (decrease of k by 76%, 57%, 44%). The deconjugation of acetyl-sulfadiazine was clearly slowed down (decrease of k by 75%) by the dosed acetate, probably due to feedback inhibition by abundant acetate. 17 out of 25 tested compounds were found to be independent of the acetate dosage, which suggested dosing acetate induced minor effects on most of pharmaceuticals' removal. Enrichment of S- or first eluted enantiomer of 4 beta-blockers and the metabolite metoprolol acid was observed. Both non-enantioselective (rapid at elevated compound concentration) and enantioselective enzymes (slower and predominant at lower compound concentration) played a part in the biodegradation. High doses of acetate slowed down the enantiomeric enrichment of atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and metoprolol acid, which demonstrated that the acetate is able to up- or down-regulate enzymes involved in the enantioselective degradation of 13-blockers and thus reveals a complex co-metabolism relationship between transformation pathways of pharmaceuticals and carbon source.

AB As increasing attention is paid to surface water protection, there has been demand for improvements of domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This has led to the application of many different advanced treatment processes (ATPs). In this study, the treatability of trace organic pollutants in secondary effluent (SE) and associated biotoxicity reduction by four types of ATPs, including coagulation, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and photocatalysis, and ozonation, were investigated at the bench-scale. The ATPs showed different removal capacity for the 48 chemicals, which were classified into seven categories. EDCs, herbicides, bactericides and pharmaceuticals were readily degraded, and insecticides, flame retardants, and UV filters were relatively resistant to removal. During these processes, the efficiency of the ATPs in reducing four biological effects were investigated. Of the four biological effects, the estrogenic activity from SE was not detected using the yeast estrogen screen. In contrast with genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition, bacterial cytotoxicity posed by SE was the most difficult biological effect to reduce with these ATPs. GAC adsorption and ozonation were the most robust treatment processes for reducing the three detected biotoxicities. UV photolysis and photocatalysis showed comparable efficiencies for the reduction of genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition. However, coagulation only performed well in genotoxicity reduction. The effect-based trigger values for the four bioassays, that were derived from the existing environmental quality standards and from HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of aquatic organisms), were all used to select and optimize these ATPs for ecological safety. Conducting ATPs in more appropriate ways could eliminate the negative effects of WWTP effluent on receiving water bodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and ARGs. Here, we designed a lab-scale simulation reactor, including up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), anoxic-oxic tank (A/O), and four separate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) i.e., UV, Ozonation, Fenton, and Fenton/UV, to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 ARGs from a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d-operation. Among all treatment units, UASB provided the greatest contribution (85.8 +/- 16.1%) for the removal of 18 antibiotics. The mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin (62.5-80.9%), while sorption to sludge (73.9%) was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in UASB. Meanwhile, the substantial decrease of ARG absolute abundance (log reduction by 0.1-3.1 fold) through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment (1.2-3.8 log units) from the influent to the A/O unit. Fenton/UV combination was the most effective AOP for the removal of ARGs. Finally, the optimum operating conditions for the removal of ARGs using Fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high ARG elimination. Overall, this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real PWWTPs for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and ARGs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is a technical barrier to efficiently treat traditional Chinese pharmaceutical (TCP) wastewater, due to its high chemical oxygen demanding (COD) concentration (>5000 mg/L). This study proposed and employed a spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor (SSSAB) to treat TCP wastewater. Results showed that a pilot-scale SSSAB (150 L) could achieve COD removal efficiency of 94.8% and volumetric removal rate (VRR) of 19.7 +/- 0.7 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1) under room temperature, which were much higher than operation performance in internal circulation (IC) anaerobic reactor (COD removal efficiency and VRR were 85% and 113 +/- 0.8 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1), respectively). The maximum COD volume removal rate could attain 43.4 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1). The characteristics of granular sludge in SSSAB were investigated from both temporal and spatial scales. During the operation period, the anaerobic granular sludge in SSSAB was of higher concentration and superior properties compared to the IC anaerobic reactor. The sludge concentration exhibited a spatially decline trend, decreasing from 61 g L-1 in the bottom to 34 g.L-1 at the top of the bed, yet the average biomass concentration was still higher than that in IC reactor. According to shock tests with fluctuated real wastewater, the resistance of SSSAB to hydraulic and loading shock was up to 4.3 m h(-1) and 42 (kg COD.h).(m(3))(-1), respectively. The study demonstrated the proposed SSSAB is a promising reactor to treat high-concentration TCP wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant drug used for epilepsy and other disorders. Prescription of CBZ during pregnancy increases the risk for congenital malformations. CBZ is ubiquitous in effluents and persistent during wastewater treatment. Thus, it is re-introduced into agricultural ecosystems upon irrigation with reclaimed wastewater. People consuming produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater were found to be exposed to CBZ. However, environmental concentrations of CBZ (mu g L-1) are magnitudes lower than its therapeutic levels (mu g ml(-1)), raising the question of whether and how environmental levels of CBZ affect embryonic development.
   The chick embryo is a powerful and highly sensitive amniotic model system that enables to assess environmental contaminants in the living organism. Since the chick embryonic development is highly similar to mammalians, yet, it develops in an egg, toxic effects can be directly analyzed in a well-controlled system without maternal influences. This research utilized the chick embryo to WA whether CBZ is embryo-toxic by using morphological, cellular, molecular and imaging strategies. Three key embryonic stages were monitored: after blastulation (st.1HH), gastrulation/neurulation (st.8HH) and organogenesis (st.15HH).
   Here we demonstrate that environmental relevant concentrations of CBZ impair morphogenesis in a dose- and stage- dependent manner. Effects on gastrulation, neural tube closure, differentiation and proliferation were exhibited in early stages by exposing embryos to CBZ dose as low as 0.1 mu g L-1. Quantification of developmental progression revealed a significant difference in the total score obtained by CBZ-treated embryos compared to controls (up to 5-fold difference, p < 0.05). Yet, defects were unnoticed as embryos passed gastrulation/neurulation.
   This study provides the first evidence for teratogenic effect of environmental-relevant concentrations of CBZ in amniotic embryos that impair early but not late stages of development. These findings call for in-depth risk analysis to ensure that the environmental presence of CBZ and other drugs is not causing irreversible ecological and public-health damages.

AB Duloxetine (DUL), an antidepressant drug, has been detected in surface water and wastewater effluents, however, there is little information on the formation of its transformation products (TPs). In this work, hydrolysis, photodegradation (UV irradiation) and chlorination experiments were performed on spiked distillated water, under controlled experimental conditions to simulate abiotic processes that can occur in the environment andwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Eleven TPs, nine from reaction with UV light and two from chlorine contact, were formed and detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and nine of them had their chemical structures elucidated upon analyses of their fragmentation patterns in MS/MS spectra. The formation and degradation of the TPs were observed. The parent compound was completely degraded after 30 min in photodegradation and after 24 hr in chlorination. Almost all TPs were completely degraded in the experiments. The ecotoxicity and mutagenicity of the TPs were predicted based on several in silico models and it was found that a few of these products presented more ecotoxicity than DUL itself and six TPs showed positive mutagenicity. Finally, wastewater samples were analyzed and DUL and one TP, possibly formed by chlorination process, were detected in the effluent, which showed that WWTP not only did not remove DUL, but also formed a TP.

AB The pharmaceuticals are biologically active compounds used to prevent and treat diseases. These pharmaceutical compounds were not fully metabolized by the human body and thus excreted out in the wastewater stream. Thus, the study on the treatment of synthetic hospital wastewater containing pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, carbamazepine, estradiol and venlafaxine) was conducted to understand the variation of the bacterial community in a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) at varying hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6, 12 and 18 h. The variation in bacterial community dynamics of SMBR was studied using high throughput sequencing. The removal of pharmaceuticals was uniform at varying HRT. The removal of both ibuprofen and estradiol was accounted for 90%, whereas a lower removal of venlafaxine (< 10%) and carbamazepine (> 5%) in SMBR was observed. The addition of pharmaceuticals alters the bacterial community structure and result in increased abundance of bacteria (e.g., Flavobacterium, Pedobacter, and Methylibium) reported to degrade toxic pollutant.

AB The presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the environment is of growing concern and effluents from wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) are one of the major sources. This research combines the outputs of a multimillion pound UK program of work to evaluate the fate of APIs in the wastewater treatment process. A combination of analysis of measured data and modelling has been applied to 18 APIs, representing a wide range of medicinal application and physico-chemical characteristics. Some isomers (for atorvastatin) and metabolites (for sertraline, carbamazepine and erythromycin) were also included. High variability was observed between removal rates for individual APIs between WwTW, which after statistical analysis could not be explained by the nominal WwTW process (e.g. activated sludge or trickling filter). Nor was there a clear relationship between API removal and physicochemical parameters such as pKa, charge or log Kow. A publically available sewage process model. SimpleTreat 4.0 which has been rigorously validated and is now being used for exposure assessment with REACH legislation for organic chemicals and within the Biocidal Products Regulation by the European Medicines Agency for APIs, was used to estimate removal rates with which to compare with measured data. SimpleTreat provided estimates of removal rates within +/- 30%of observed values for the majority of the APIs measured, with the use of readily available WwTW specific parameters such as flow, total suspended solids and BOD data. The data and correlations provided in this study provide support for any future considerations regarding the management of API discharge to the aquatic environment.

AB Diffuse sources of pollution such as sewer leakages, sewer overflows, illicit discharges and stormwater runoff affect the urban surface water quality but often remain unknown. Therefore, the development of chemical markers for identifying and characterizing the origin of diffuse sources of pollution in urban surface waters is a requisite for protecting and managing urban water resources. In this study, the occurrence of 31 emerging contaminants (ECs) in untreated wastewater, treated wastewater, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural stormwater runoff, and freshwater bodies was investigated. Artificial sweeteners (ASs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were more frequently detected in the collected water samples. In raw wastewater, 21 target ECs were detected 100% in the collected samples with median concentrations ranging from 49.6 to 77,721 ng/L, while in freshwater bodies, only 13 compounds were found with detection frequency >50%. The median concentration of the majority of detected ECs in freshwater samples was below 100 ng/L. The suitability of ECs as chemical markers of diffuse sources in an urban watershed was assessed using a suite of criteria, including the detection frequency (DF), detection ratio (DR) (i.e. the ratio between median concentration and method quantification limit of a compound) and attenuation rates (i.e., biodegradation, sorption and abiotic degradation) in wastewater treatment processes. In addition, we propose a new key criterion, the concentration ratio (CR) of labile to conservative compounds, to evaluate the applicability of suitable chemical markers for source tracking. Using this new set of criteria (i.e. CR, DF, DR and attenuation rates), our analysis showed that among the investigated ECs, only acesulfame (ACE), acetaminophen (ACT), cyclamate (CYC), saccharin (SAC) were suitable as chemical markers of diffuse sources in surface waters. For caffeine (CF), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEFT), crotamiton (MIT), triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS), their median concentration ratio to sucralose (SUC) in water bodies was consistently higher than that in raw wastewater, suggesting that these compounds might be unsuitable as chemical markers of sewage leakage in surface waters for this study area.

AB Resin fraction of dissolved organic matters (DOM) was used to investigate the mechanism of catalytic ozonation with a commercial catalyst treating petrochemical secondary effluent (PSE). The results showed hydrophilic substances (HI) and hydrophobic acids (HoA) were the dominated fractions in PSE, accounting for about 47% and 36% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC). HoA could be more easily oxidized by ozone than HI. It may be ascribed to the highly reactive structures of HoA with high SUVA(254). Besides, HoA could be transformed into HI during ozonation. Compared to ozonation, catalytic ozonation could enhance more removal of HI than HoA. Radical scavenger experiment verified that HoA and HI were removed by both ozone molecules and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). The adsorption of DOM by catalyst kept a dynamic balance process between oxidation and re-adsorption during catalytic ozonation, triggering a cyclic reaction between adsorbed DOM and adsorbed ozone as well as decomposed (OH)-O-center dot from the adsorbed ozone. In addition, DOM and ozone adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst simultaneously could protect the quencher of (OH)-O-center dot caused by high concentration of anions (mainly Cl- and SO42-) in the bulk solution and significantly improve the catalytic performance. The fractions reaction and transformation, dynamic process between oxidation and re-adsorption, role of adsorption and (OH)-O-center dot quencher protection were clearly interpreted. For catalytic ozonation, the key point is to achieve an equilibrium for the adsorption of organics and oxidation ability. The proposed mechanism can give the direction for synthesis or modification of catalyst for real wastewater treatment.

AB The presence of diclofenac (DCF) in water has developed into a severe environmental problem due to its pernicious effects on animals and human being. Herein, a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) method using I doped TiO2 (I-TiO2) photoelectrode has been developed, which exhibited excellent visible activity in the degradation of DCF as well as pharmaceutical wastewater. The Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetic model, active species trapping experiments and analysis of intermediate products were employed to analyze the PEC degradation mechanism of DCF. The results revealed that the decomposition of DCF was primarily performed on the photoelectrode (I-TiO2) surface, and the degradation process was accompanied by the dechlorination reaction. The degradation of DCF was caused mainly by holes (66.6%) and hydroxyl radicals (27.6%) when Na2SO4 acted as electrolyte. The degradation rate of DCF could be significantly enhanced under the condition of high Cl(-)concentration (NaCl acted as electrolyte), which was caused by the participation of chloride radicals (Cl-center dot) in the PEC process. The Cl-center dot was the major factor contributing to the decomposition of DCF, and the holes and hydroxyl radicals played a less important role than Cl-center dot under this condition.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of UV-absorbance and fluorescence as monitoring tools for ozone dosages applied to effluents from wastewater treatment plans (WWTPs). Secondary treated effluents from five Swedish WWTPs underwent ozonation (at dosages ranging 0.5-12.0 mg O-3/L) in bench-scale experiments. Correlations between ozone dosages and UV-absorbance at 254 and 272 nm were extrapolated with the first one being preferential for the wastewaters used because of its higher signal. UV-absorbance could detect differences in the applied ozone dosage as low as 1 mg/L, making it suitable to monitor effluent ozone treatment processes. Next, fluorescence was investigated at wavelength transitions that have being associated with humic-like fluorescents (Ex249Em450 and Ex335Em450) and protein-like fluorescents (Ex275Em340 and Ex231Em360 and Ex231Em315 and Ex275Em310). The Ex249Em450 transition was found to have the highest signal in all effluents and the best linear regression fitting with the ozone dosages over a wide range. However, low ozone dosages (0.5-3.0 mg O-3/L), Ex335Em450 wavelength transition showed a more constant slope among the different domestic wastewater samples with slightly better R-2 values than the Ex249Em450 transition. Fluorescence removal via ozonation correlated with the pharmaceutical removal; however, the wellness of fitting was directly dependent on the pharmaceuticals' reactivity with ozone. Pharmaceuticals with moderate reactivity towards ozone appeared to be linearly correlated with the Ex249Em450 transition, while very reactive or recalcitrant pharmaceuticals had an exponential or a parabolic dependency. This means that fluorescence can potentially be used as a qualitative tool for pharmaceutical removal.

AB Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously reintroduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lion fish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.

AB Background The high consumption of acetaminophen leads to high concentrations in surface water causing impacts on aquatic organisms, which is highlighting the need for investigation of alternative water and wastewater treatments. Therefore, the present study objective was to evaluate the adsorption capacity of acetaminophen onto Moringa oleifera Lam. seed husks after chemical and thermal treatment. Results The characterization of the adsorbent revelaed heterogeneous morphology with the presence of micro- and mesopores. Adsorption studies showed that the adsorption did not altered between pH 3 and 9, and that there was no significant effect of the ionic strength, indicating that the mechanism does not involve electrostatic interactions. In fact, Fourier transform infrard spectra showed that acetaminophen was adsorbed by hydrogen bonds and pi-stacking. The kinetic data were adjusted to the pseudo-first-order model, indicating an equilibrium time of 18 h. The equilibrium study showed that adsorption occurred in a monolayer and was favoured by the increase in temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity was 17.48 mg g(-1), at 318 K, higher than some capacities found in the literature. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous, endothermic and physical. Conclusions The characteristics and results found compared to the recent literature verified the possibility of applying this residue as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of acetaminophen.

AB For several years, the scientific community has been concerned about the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wild, since these compounds may have unpredictable deleterious effects on living organisms. Two examples of widely used pharmaceuticals that are present in the environment are paracetamol and ciprofloxacin. Despite their common presence in the aquatic environment due to their poor removal by sewage treatment plants, knowledge concerning their putative toxic effects is still scarce. This work aimed to characterize the effects of paracetamol (0.005, 0.025, 0.125, 0.625, and 3.125 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin (0.005, 0.013, 0.031, 0.078, 0.195, and 0.488 mu g/L) in zebrafish embryos and larvae, exposed to environmentally relevant levels, close to the real concentrations of these pharmaceuticals in surface waters and effluents. The adopted toxic end points were developmental, a behavioral parameter (total swimming time), and a biomarker-based approach (quantification of the activities of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, cholinesterases, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation levels) combined with epigenetic analysis (immunohistochemical detection of 5-methylcytidine). Exposure to paracetamol had effects on all of the adopted toxic end points; however, ciprofloxacin only caused effects on behavioral tests and alterations in biomarkers. It is possible to ascertain the occurrence of oxidative stress following exposure to both drugs, which was more evident regarding paracetamol, an effect that may be related to the observed epigenetic modifications.

AB BACKGROUND Sulfanilic acid (SA) is a highly typical representative sulfonated aromatic amine widely occurring in chemical and pharmaceutical wastewaters. Its release poses potential threats to the environment and human health. Thermally activated persulfate (TAP) is a promising technology for organic matter removal. In this study, TAP is evaluated using the oxidation of SA as a model reaction. RESULTS The oxidation performance of TAP on SA removal was investigated initially under different conditions of temperature, solution pH, persulfate dosage and initial SA concentration. Results showed that SA removal was effectively initiated by the TAP process and fitted well with a pseudo-first-order reaction model under all environmental conditions in water, and the yield of relatively low activation energy was 80.8 kJ mol(-1) under the optimum conditions. The solution pH exerted almost no influence on SA removal. Sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) were identified as major predominant free radicals by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and scavenger tests for removing SA during the TAP process. Non-target natural water constituents can affect the removal rate of SA, such as the chloride ion (Cl-) and the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) promote whereas humic acid (HA) reduces the removal. The total organic carbon (TOC) monitoring results indicated that SA was almost completely mineralized into CO2 and H2O during the 9 h reaction time. CONCLUSION Owing to the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species (SO4 center dot- and HO center dot), TAP oxidation as an environmentally friendly technology is a favorable option for SA-containing wastewater treatment usage.

AB To observe the effect of aeration strategies on the dissipation of fluoroquinolones (FQs) during aerobic composting and explore their dissipation pathways, 60-L composting and 0.5-L incubation experiments were carried out in this study. Three aeration strategies (windrow, static aeration, feedback aeration) were applied to remove two typical FQs (Norfloxacin (NOR) and Ofloxacin (OFL)) during the 60-L composting of sewage sludge with 5 mg kg(-1) of FQs added. Then, three 0.5 L-sample groups were taken during the three phases of the 60-L composting matrixes without FQs under static aeration, and were inoculated separately at 35 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 40 degrees C after being added with 5 mg kg(-1) of FQs. In each group, incubation was carried out for three treatments (sterilization + no aeration, sterilization + aeration, and no sterilization + aeration). The FQs in the sewage sludge were mainly removed in the mesophilic and thermophilic phases in all the aeration strategies. The removal efficiencies were high for the whole process: 89.6-95.4% for NOR and 87.2-95.4% for OFL. The order of removal efficiency of FQs was static aeration > feedback aeration > windrow. The combination of composting phases facilitated to the rapid dissipation of FQs, which reduced the half-life to about 1/6 to 1/5 of the values in each phase. In the mesophilic and thermophilic compost, biodegradation was the main pathway for the dissipation of FQs followed by irreversible adsorption. Irreversible adsorption and biodegradation provided similar removal efficiencies for the curing compost. The volatilization of FQs was non-negligible in all phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recovering nutrients from wastewater as sustainable bio-based products provides a key solution to major environmental problems. Classical technology development approaches for resource recovery largely ignore the real-world variability in raw waste materials, which currently hinders the successful implementation of recovery strategies. A major challenge is to create a consistent and environmentally friendly supply of high-quality end-products that can compete with fossil-derived products currently on the market. This paper suggests the use of a Quality by Design approach as adapted from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure a high standard of quality consistency. Key elements of this approach involve mathematical models and integrated design-control strategies that support the production of high-quality marketable end-products from variable input waste and wastewater streams. Further research in terms of cost evaluation and optimisation of such approach for resource recovery applications is needed. A regulatory framework for Process Analytical Technology implementation in the field is also suggested.

AB This study fabricated a new and multifunctional mixed metal-biochar composites (MMBC) using the mixture of two abundant industrial wastes, red mud (RM) and lignin, via pyrolysis under N(2 )atmosphere, and its ability to treat wastewater containing various contaminants was comprehensively evaluated. A porous structure (BET surface area = 100.8 m(2) g(-1)) was created and metallic Fe was formed in the MMBC owing to reduction of Fe oxides present in RM by lignin decomposition products during pyrolysis at 700 degrees C, which was closely associated with the transformation of liquid to gaseous pyrogenic products. The potential application of the MMBC was investigated for the removal of heavy metals (Pb(II) and Ni(II)), oxyanions (As(V) and Cr(VI)), dye (methylene blue), and pharmaceutical/personal care products (para-nitrophenol and pCBA). The aluminosilicate mineral, metallic Fe, and porous carbon matrix derived from the incorporation of RM and lignin contributed to the multifunctionality (i.e., adsorption, chemical reduction, and catalytic reaction) of the MMBC. Thus, engineered biochar composites synthesized from selected industrial wastes can be a potential candidate for environmental applications.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is considered as a promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) for wastewater reclamation, while a simultaneous low rejection of salts is desirable for the ease of using the reclaimed water. This study was conducted to exploit the potential of polypiperazine-amide NF membranes in achieving selective separation of TrOCs and NaCl by varying the concentration of the diamine monomer, piperazine (PIP), for interfacial polymerization and by modifying the nascent membrane surface with hydrophilic monomers, diethanolamine (DEA) and monoethanolamine (MEA). Results showed that increasing PIP concentration could decrease the membrane pore size and reduce the surface negative charge density, which led to an increased rejection of xylose and a reduced rejection of NaCl. The grafting of DEA or MEA molecules could further decrease the NaCl rejection, substantially improve the water permeability and maintain an effective removal for eight pharmaceuticals (PhACs). The optimal membrane prepared with a PIP concentration of 2.0 wt % and subsequently modified by MEA exhibited a rejection of NaCl at 33.1% and an average rejection of PhACs at 90.8% in a 10 mmol/L NaCl solution under an applied pressure of 6 bar. The membrane could have an even higher selectivity when the NaCl concentration was increased to higher levels. These results demonstrated the feasibility and versatility of the membrane in separating TrOCs from NaCl for wastewater reclamation.

AB Urban wastewater inputs are a relevant pollution source to rivers, contributing a complex mixture of nutrients, organicmatter and organic microcontaminants to these systems. Depending on their composition, WWTP effluents might perform either as enhancers (subsidizers) or inhibitors (stressors) of biological activities. In this study, we evaluated in which manner biofilms were affected by treated urban WWTP effluent, and how much they recovered after exposure was terminated. We used indoor artificial streams in a replicated regression design, which were operated for a total period of 56 days. During the first 33 days, artificial streams were fed with increasing concentration of treated effluents starting with non-contaminated water and ending with undiluted effluent. During the recovery phase, the artificial streams were fed with unpolluted water. Sewage effluents contained high concentrations of personal care products, pharmaceuticals, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter. Changes in community structure, biomass, and biofilm function were most pronounced in those biofilms exposed to 58% to 100% of WWTP effluent, moving from linear to quadratic or cubic response patterns. The return to initial conditions did not allow for complete biofilm recovery, but biofilms from the former medium diluted treatments were the most benefited (enhanced response), while those from the undiluted treatments showed higher stress (inhibited response). Our results indicated that the effects caused by WWTP effluent discharge on biofilm structure and function respond to the chemical pressure only in part, and that the biofilm dynamics (changes in community composition, increase in thickness) imprint particular response pathways over time.

AB In this work, the performances of ozonation, photolytic ozonation (UV-C/O-3), and photocatalytic ozonation (UV-A/TiO2/O-3) in degrading ozone recalcitrant micropollutants in four different real domestic wastewaters were evaluated in semi-continuous operation, together with the influence of water matrices in the ozone mass transfer and pollutant degradation rates. The (OH)-O-center dot exposure per consumed ozone ratio, defined as R-OH,R-O3, was applied for single ozonation and modified for light-assisted ozonation processes to evaluate and compare the contribution of radical pathway on micropollutants abatement for the different wastewaters studied. R-OH,R-O3 plots presented good fitting (R-2 > 0.95) in two stages, corresponding to different ozone mass transfer regimes, for all cases. Light-assisted ozonation attained higher pollutant degradation for all water matrices compared to single ozonation, although the performance of UV-assisted processes was more sensitive to matrix factors like composition and turbidity. Moreover, the improvement brought by both light-based processes on R-OHO3 values mainly took place during the second stage. Thus, photocatalytic ozonation reached R-OHO3 values higher than double for all wastewaters, compared with single ozonation (between 105% and 127% increase). These values represent a saving of almost half of the overall ozone needs (42%) for the same ozone recalcitrant micropollutant depletion, although it would require the adoption of higher ozone doses than the currently employed for ozonation in wastewater treatment plants.

AB N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is the active ingredient in many insect repellants against biting insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. It is one of the few micro-pollutants that are increasingly found in natural waters. The fact that DEET occurs in both influent and effluent of wastewater treatment works is indicative of its refractory nature. This work investigates the reactions of DEET with ozone, an oxidant that is becoming more common in treatments and disinfections of wastewater and drinking water. The transformation pathways were mapped, and a reaction model that accurately predicts the reactions was developed. The ozonation of DEET did not decrease the bioactivity of treated water, but instead resulted in a twofold increase in the microtoxicity. The findings suggest that the products of DEET ozonation has greater toxicity potentials compared to the parent compound posing a real hazard to human health and environment.

AB In this study, the effect of aeration rate in terms of specific aeration demand per membrane area (SADm) on the anti-biofouling properties of cellulose acetate (CA) nanocomposite membranes (CA/ND-NH2) in a membrane bioreactor system was investigated. The amount of EPS and soluble EPS under high aeration rate conditions was observed to be higher than under low aeration rate conditions. The results obtained showed that either lower or higher aeration rates had a negative impact on membrane permeability. The high aeration rate resulted in a severe breakage of sludge flocs, and promoted the release of soluble EPS from the microbial flocs to the bioreactor tank. By increasing the aeration rate, the COD removal increased and decreased respectively for the membranes and the activated sludge. It was finally concluded that higher anti-biofouling properties of neat CA and nanocomposite membranes were obtained under optimal aeration rate conditions (SADm = 1 m(3) m(-2) h(-1)).

AB Background. Guanylurea is the main transformation product of the antidiabetic drug metformin, which is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals worldwide. Due to the high rate of microbial degradation of metformin in sewage treatment plants, guanylurea occurs in higher concentrations in surface waters than its parent compound and could therefore affect aquatic wildlife. In this context, data for fish are scarce up to now which made us investigate the health of brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) in response to guanylurea.
   Methods. In two experiments, eggs plus developing larvae and juvenile brown trout were exposed to three different concentrations of guanylurea (10, 100 and 1,000 m g/L) and, as a negative control, filtered tap water without this compound. Low internal concentrations were determined. The investigated parameters were mortality, length, weight, condition factor, tissue integrity of the liver and kidney, levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides, as well as behavioural and developmental endpoints. It was found that guanylurea did not significantly change any of these parameters in the tested concentration range.
   Results. In conclusion, these results do not give rise to concern that guanylurea could negatively affect the health or the development of brown trout under field conditions. Nevertheless, more studies focusing on further parameters and other species are highly needed for a more profound environmental risk assessment of guanylurea.

AB To compare the performance and antibiotic-resistance character in different process configurations under different levels of antibiotics, anoxic/oxic-membrane bioreactors (MBR) 1#, MBR2# and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were operated with identical operating parameters. MBR1# and SBR were operated under high and increasing levels of antibiotics, MBR2# received constant and low concentration of antibiotics. Microbiological community and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated using 16S rDNA gene high-throughput sequencing and qPCR. More than 90% of penicillin and chlortetracycline were removed due to strong hydrolysis, followed by sulfamethoxazole (69.27%-86.25%) through biodegradation and norfloxacin (28.66%-53.86%) through adsorption. Process configuration affected total nitrogen removal more, while antibiotics concentration affected total phosphorus removal more. MBR1# outperformed SBR in reducing sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and ARGs due to the retention effect of the membrane module. Retention efficiency of ARGs in MBRs increased along the operation. Compared to the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number before antibiotics addition, the OTU number in MBR1# and SBR decreased by 23.7% and 28.7%, while that in MBR2# kept relatively stable. Process configuration contributed to higher dissimilarity of microbial community than antibiotics concentration. The research provides an insight into the influence factors of antibiotics-containing wastewater treatment.

AB Co-crystallization frequently employs forces such as hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and pi-pi stacking to assemble molecules in a multi-component crystal. In an effort to increase the strength of the intermolecular interaction between the anti-cholesterol drug bezafibrate (BEZA), a wastewater contaminant, and hydrogen-bond-acceptor molecules, we modified the pK(a) values of the acceptors. Here, we describe the first series of salts incorporating BEZA and achieve a variety of supramolecular architectures including discrete assemblies, 1D chains, tapes, and 2D sheets. We discuss exceptions to the pK(a) rule, and demonstrate that the presence of hydrogen-bond-donor atoms on the acceptor molecule supports salt formation.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging electrocatalytic ozonation process that is enabled by in situ producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from cathodic oxygen reduction during ozonation. The in situ-generated H2O2 can then promote ozone (O-3) transformation to hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and thus enhance the abatement of ozone-refractory pollutants compared to conventional ozonation. In this study, a chemical kinetic model was employed to simulate micropollutant abatement during the E-peroxone treatment of various water matrices (surface water, secondary wastewater effluent, and groundwater). Results show that by following the O-3 and center dot OH exposures during the E-peroxone process, the abatement kinetics of a variety of model micropollutants could be well predicted using the model. In addition, the effect of specific ozone doses on micropollutant abatement efficiencies could be quantitatively evaluated using the model. Therefore, the chemical kinetic model can be used to reveal important information for the design and optimization of the treatment time and ozone doses of the E-peroxone process for cost-effective micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment.

AB A one-year study on the occurrence and fate of macrolide antibiotics and their metabolites, synthesis byproducts, and transformation products (TPs) was performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb (Croatia). The target compounds were found in all analyzed influent and effluent samples with the total concentrations of azithromycin-, clarithromycin-, and erythromycin-related compounds reaching up to 25, 12, and 0.25 mu g/L, respectively. The most prominent individual constituents were the parent macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin. However, a substantial contribution of their derivatives, formed by deglycolysation and microbial phosphorylation, was also detected. In addition, widespread presence of several linearized nontarget TPs was confirmed for the first time in real wastewater samples by suspect screening analysis. Complex characterization of macrolide-derived compounds enabled decoupling of industrial and therapeutic sources from the in situ transformations. Due to the high inputs and incomplete removal and/or formation of several TPs during the conventional wastewater treatment, the average mass load of azithromycin-related compounds in secondary effluents exceeded 3.0 g/day/1000 inhabitants. This is the first study to reveal the importance of metabolites, byproducts, and TPs for the overall mass balance of macrolide antibiotics in urban wastewater systems.

AB Albendazole is an anthelmintic drug with antiangiogenic properties, which means that inhibits the development of new blood vessels. This causes a serious risk for the growth of fetus during pregnancy as a result. Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been proposed as an alternative for removal of this contaminant In this study, a solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) photocatalytic reactor was modeled and simulated in order to describe the total organic carbon (TOC) degradation of commercial albendazole. The Six Flux Model approach (SFM) was used to estimate the Local Velocity Volumetric Rate of Photon Absorption (LVRPA) coupled with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) kinetic model in order to describe the photocatalytic degradation of the TOC content of the contaminant and its photochemical oxidation products. The parameters of the L-H model were estimated from experimental data obtained with a catalyst loading of 0.6 g/l, initial pH of 5.0 and three different initial TOC concentrations of the commercial albendazole (159.95, 75.58 and 40 ppm). The rate constant (k(T)) and adsorption constant (K-1), estimated from the parameter fitting, were 9.28x10(-4) m(1.5)ppmW(-0.5) s(-1) and 3.02 x 10(-2) ppm(-1), respectively. The model was validated with experimental results, achieving a TOC removal of 40% with the lowest concentration of the contaminant By simulating the process with different catalyst loadings, the maximum TOC removal was achieved with 0.21 g/L of TiO2 .

AB The present paper aimed to evaluate the impact of microaeration on both the removal performance of some emerging micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, hormones, and bisphenol A) and the microbial community structure of an anaerobic reactor treating synthetic wastewater. Under anaerobic conditions, the removal efficiencies of the micropollutants were very low (< 10%). However, the microaeration (1.0 mL air.min(-1) at 27 degrees C and 1 atm, equivalent to a Q(AIR)/Q(INF) ratio of 0.1) expressively improved the removal efficiencies of all compounds (> 50%). Therefore, supplementing anaerobic reactors with low amounts of oxygen seems to be an interesting strategy to enhance the removal of the micropollutants tested. However, further studies should be carried out with other compounds in order to evaluate the wide applicability of microaeration to different classes of micropollutants in lab- and full-scale treatment systems. Concerning the microbiota structure, both bacterial and archaeal communities were not compromised by the different operational conditions and preserved their functional organization with high richness during the whole experiment.

AB A valuable method for the efficient removal of sulphonamides from wastewater using protein powder extracted from the seeds of Moringa stenopetala is presented in this study. The surface morphology, crystallinity and functional groups of protein powder were characterised by SEM, XRD, FTIR and Raman spectrometry. Parameters that affect the removal of sulphonamides, such as concentration, the adsorbent dosage and pH, were optimised. The method was applied to a real wastewater sample collected from the Daspoort Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Pretoria, South Africa. The percentage removal under optimum conditions was observed to be 86.4 to 95.1% for the aqueous solution of a mixture of standards and from 83.0 to 90.5% and 75.2 to 87.7 % for the effluent and influent wastewater samples respectively. Therefore, proteins extracted from Moringa stenopetala seeds demonstrated to be effective and environmentally friendly material for possible application in water treatment in general and wastewater treatment in particular.

AB Over time, the consumption of pharmaceutical drugs has highly augmented, directly contributing for an increase of the discharges of these substances into sewage water due to excretion, and their direct release to the environment, with or without adequate treatment. Considering that part of the sewage water is dumped into rivers and seas, this is the major source of contamination of the aquatic environment. Paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid are among the most worldwide consumed pharmaceutical drugs, frequently found in wastewater discharges and consequently in the aquatic environment in considerable amounts, posing ecotoxicity concerns especially towards aquatic non-target species. Thus, it is important to study the ecotoxicological implications that these drugs might pose to organisms from aquatic environments. The objective of this study was to assess the toxic effects of these two compounds on key biochemical features (antioxidant defenses and damage, metabolism, and cholinergic neurotoxicity) of the marine snail species Gibbula umbilicalis after an acute (96 h) exposure, simulating pulses of contamination. In order to understand the effects that those drugs have on this species, the biochemical biomarkers analyzed were the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), cholinesterases (ChEs), and the levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS). After acute exposure to paracetamol, catalase activity decreased significantly in organisms exposed to both highest concentrations; no significant alterations were observed for glutathione-S-transferases activity; TBARS concentration decreased significantly in organisms exposed to the intermediate and both highest concentrations, and cholinesterase activity increased significantly in animals exposed to the lowest concentration. However, after acute exposure to acetylsalicylic acid, catalase activity increased significantly; no significant alterations were observed for glutathione-S-transferases activity, and TBARS concentrations and cholinesterase activity increased. This set of data shows that G. umbilicalis is highly responsive to the presence of the tested drugs, and may thus be a promising species to serve as test organism in future marine ecotoxicological testing. The adoption of this species may broaden the offer of highly ecologically representative test organisms to be included in biomonitoring projects of the coastal and marine environment. Furthermore, it is possible to suggest that both drugs may pose significant deleterious effects of pro-oxidative origin to the physiology of the selected species, with potential adverse ecological consequences, even after short periods of exposure. The absence of neurotoxicity showed that despite being able to trigger antioxidant mechanisms, both drugs did not affect neurotransmission.

AB This research provides a baseline tool to detect, predict and scientifically evaluate the toxic environmental impact generated by chemical substances that are categorized as emerging contaminants (ECs) with endocrine disruptive action. The present study was carried out in five effluents of wastewater produced by urban and rural settlements of the coastal zone of Cihuatlan, Jalisco. Five compounds, considered ECs and that act as endocrine disruptors, were analyzed: Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, Pentachlorophenol (PCP), and Estradiol. The toxicity level (TEQ) of the ECs is estimated by a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis, evaluating their concentration and assessing the risk involved in the incorporation of each one into the environment. The presence of the ECs was confirmed in all the studied sites. It was attested that the concentrations of pollutants Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, and Pentachlorophenol were within the toxic range, whereas the compound Estradiol was found in concentrations that represent a high toxicity in the same effluents. This research recognizes that the analysis of the physicochemical properties of substances allows for predicting whether a contaminant is likely to act and persist in the environment and, in turn, bioaccumulate in organisms.

AB Endocrine active contaminants (EACs) in environmental samples can pose a range of toxicological threats to ecosystems, especially through their impacts on reproductive pathways mediated by the estrogen receptor. The physicochemical properties of known organic EACs vary greatly and typically require different sample preparation techniques to identify different classes of compounds. EAC sources are similarly diverse, including both endogenous compounds and anthropogenic chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and their transformation products, which are often disposed of to sewers at their end of use. Looking for EACs in sewage sludge proposes a bottom-up, or end-of-use and treatment approach to discover environmentally relevant EACs, since many EACs accumulate in sludges even after application of robust wastewater treatment processes. This study demonstrates an extraction and analytical method capable of detecting a broad spectrum of known and suspected EACs via High Resolution Liquid Chromatography Quadropole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) suspect screening of fourteen California sewage sludge samples. Spike-recovery experiments were performed using twelve carefully selected surrogates to assess different extraction solvents, sample weights, extraction pH values, procedures for combining extracts with different extraction pH's, and solid phase extraction cartridges. Using LC-QTOF-MS, identifications of several other organic compounds in the samples were made, a goal unachievable with unit resolution mass spectrometry. Suspect screening of California sludge samples discovered 118 compounds including hormones, pharmaceuticals, phosphate flame retardants, recreational drugs, antimicrobials, and pesticides. Additionally, 22 of these identified compounds are predicted to interfere with estrogen receptors or other reproductive/developmental pathways based on the VEGA QSAR toxicity prediction model.

AB The direct discharge of improperly treated effluent from sago industry poses a great threat to water bodies due to the high amount of organic matter. This work investigated ZnO photocatalytic degradation under aerated and non-aerated conditions, and photo-Fenton aiming to reduce the chemical oxygen demand in sago effluent. Photolysis of sago effluent in the presence of ultraviolet irradiation and aeration resulted in 68% of the chemical oxygen demand removal. The results indicate high chemical oxygen demand reductions for different concentrations of sago effluent at 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 diluted with distilled water following the ZnO photocatalytic treatment under the aerated conditions. The chemical oxygen demand reductions of 90-95% and 85% were obtained using 3 g/L of ZnO, after 2 h of aerated and non-aerated photocatalytic treatments, respectively, for the sago effluent ratio of 1:1000. On the other hand, the combination of the most concentrated sago effluent at 1:10 and non-aerated ZnO photocatalytic treatment resulted in no appreciable chemical oxygen demand reduction at only 8%. The concentrations of Fe2+ (10-60 mM) and H2O2 (50-150 mM) greatly influenced the degradation rates of chemical oxygen demand. The optimum parameters of 10 mM of Fe2+ and 50 mM of H2O2 were able to reduce 97% of the chemical oxygen demand of the 1:1000 sago effluent under the photo-Fenton treatment with 2 h of ultraviolet irradiation. Thus, both ZnO photocatalysis and photo-Fenton can be applied as the possible treatment methods to reduce the chemical oxygen demand in effluent from sago processing.

AB This study applied a laboratory-scaled, staged anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (SAF-MBR) added with granular activated carbon (GAC) as fluidized media to treat a synthetic wastewater containing 0.1 mg/L of three different pharmaceutical micropollutants. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole were selected as target micropollutants to investigate their removal efficiency during SAF-MBR operation. More than 96% of overall COD removal efficiency was achieved at 8.7 h of total HRT with 288 mg/L of bulk VSS concentration. Transmembrane pressure (TMP) from membrane remained less than 0.3 bar during operational period. After the SAF-MBR was introduced with the micropollutants at 5 Lm(-2) h(-1) of permeate flux, they were removed completely within 3 days of operation. Our batch experiments supported that the removal of micropollutants in reactor bulk was immensely pronounced by adsorption to GACs, sorption and biodegradation due to the biofilm formed on GACs fluidized in SAF-MBR system.

AB Pharmaceutical consumption continues to grow constantly. Unused/expired pharmaceuticals are disposed of to the municipal sewage system or waste disposal. Consequently, many countries have implemented a system of collecting pharmaceutical waste, with pharmacies playing an important role. It is important to educate consumers on rational consumption and the appropriate disposal of unused/expired pharmaceuticals and to identify the level of public awareness. Two studies were conducted in Poland to estimate the problem of collection and disposal of expired/unused pharmaceuticals. The purpose of the Survey I was to identify the scale of pharmaceutical consumption and the way pharmaceuticals are disposed of by various social groups. The Survey II was aimed to identify patients' attitudes regarding expired/unused pharmaceuticals at home. Of the respondents who participated in in Survey I, almost 74% indicated that analgesics were among the over-the-counter drugs they purchased. Group of pharmaceuticals 65% of the respondents purchased were medicines for treating flu symptoms. Almost 68% of the respondents said they usually disposed of expired pharmaceuticals in their household waste or by flushing them down the toilet. In Survey II more than 35% reported that they disposed of pharmaceuticals in the same ways. Of all respondents, similar to 30% returned their expired pharmaceuticals to pharmacies. Most respondents (over 65%) who participated Survey I indicated that they were aware that pharmaceutical waste can be returned to pharmacies. It should be noted that local governments are currently not obliged by law to work with or compensate pharmacies in the collection and proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.

AB Chlorpheniramine is a pharmaceutical pollutant and a precursor of carcinogenic nitrosamines during disinfection/oxidation. In our previous study, graphene oxide coated with magnetite (GO-Fe3O4) was capable of removing chlorpheniramine in deionized water by adsorption. This study investigated the removal of chlorpheniramine and its nitrosamine formation potentials (FPs) by adsorption onto magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influence by using real municipal wastewaters as the background. In the results, the adsorption performances of chlorpheniramine in wastewaters decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 suspension>GO-Fe3O4 particles>activated carbon. Chlorpheniramine adsorptions on GO-Fe3O4 particles and activated carbon were reduced by using real wastewaters as the background, whereas chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 suspension was enhanced due to the effects of surface charge on GO-Fe3O4 and ionic strength variation in water. The fittings of adsorption isotherms indicated that the wastewater background reduced the surface heterogeneity of GO-Fe3O4 suspension and improved the adsorption performance. Appreciable removal efficiencies of NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs were observed when GO-Fe3O4 particles were added in real wastewaters. However, when chlorpheniramine was present in wastewaters, chlorpheniramine adsorption and degradation reaction simultaneously occurred on the surface of GO-Fe3O4, increasing NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs in wastewaters after GO-Fe3O4 addition for chlorpheniramine adsorption. The assumption was further demonstrated by observing the NDMA-FP increase during chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 in deionized water. GO-Fe3O4 is a potential adsorbent for chlorpheniramine removal. Nevertheless, the low treatment efficiencies at high doses limit its application for nitrosamine FP adsorptions in real wastewaters.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a concern due to its potential adverse effect on human health and ecology. In this research study, the occurrence of three selected pharmaceuticals-erythromycin (ERY), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), trimethoprim (TMP), and an antimicrobial/antifungal agent triclosan (TRL) was monitored at two Southern California wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Between April and October of 2017, 77 composite samples were analyzed. Results from the study revealed the presence of all four pharmaceuticals in the influent at both WWTPs. Of the four pharmaceuticals, SMZ had the highest concentration (WWTP1, 1860 ng L-1, and WWTP2, 2146 ng L-1). In WWTP1, the concentrations of ERY, TRL, and TMP ranged from 33 to 278 ng L-1, 146 to 410 ng L-1, and 410 to 1021 ng L-1, respectively, while in WWTP2, their concentrations ranged from 16.7 to 209 ng L-1, 0 to 160 ng L-1, and 407 to 672 ng L-1, respectively. Even though both plants employed secondary biological treatment protocols, their removal efficiencies are remarkably different. WWTP1 is relatively more effective in the removal of ERY, TRL, and TMP with a removal efficiency of 46%, 63%, and 61%, respectively, while at WWTP2 only 4% TMP was removed, and no removal of ERY and TRL was observed. Both plants were unable to remove SMZ. Pharmaceuticals are bioactive compounds, and as such, even at low concentration levels, they may adversely affect the environment and will require additional treatment to ensure that treated wastewater meets the specific water quality criteria for reuse.

AB A tertiary treatment of effluent from a biological domestic wastewater treatment plant was tested by combining filtration and solar photocatalysis. Adsorption was carried out by a sequence of two column filters, the first one filled with granular activated carbon (GAC) and the second one with granulated nano-composite of micelle-montmorillonite mixed with sand (20:100, w/w). The applied solar advanced oxidation process was homogeneous photo-Fenton photocatalysis using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as oxidant agent. This combination of simple, robust, and low-cost technologies aimed to ensure water disinfection and emerging contaminants (ECs, mainly pharmaceuticals) removal. The filtration step showed good performances in removing dissolved organic matter and practically removing all bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis from the secondary treated water. Solar advanced oxidation processes were efficient in elimination of trace levels of ECs. The final effluent presented an improved sanitary level with acceptable chemical and biological characteristics for irrigation.

AB This study investigated the effect of chlorine disinfection on the following commonly prescribed antibiotics typically present in treated wastewater: ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin and ofloxacin. Antibacterially active transformation products formed from all of the fluoroquinolone class antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole did not form products with detectable antibacterial activity. Experiments were performed in both ultrapure water and wastewater effluent. HPLC/MS was used to propose the structures of the transformation products in samples where antibacterially active products formed. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated products were observed. The results indicate that antibiotic transformation products with antibacterial properties form in the wastewater chlorination treatment process. These products may be a source of antibiotic resistance in the environment and warrant a further investigation of their role.

AB Widely consumed benzodiazepine drugs are emerging contaminants, some of them being endocrine disruptors. Although many of these drugs remain in wastewater even after conventional treatment, innovative treatability studies are still sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis using synthesized composites based on TiO2 and activated carbon (TiO2/AC) as catalysts under sunlight-simulated irradiation. Different ratios and calcination temperatures were tested for the synthesis, and the composite with the best photocatalytic efficiency (based on methylene blue dye removal from water solution) was the one formed by 10% AC calcined at 400 degrees C (TiO2/AC10%). This composite was applied in heterogeneous photocatalysis to remove bromazepam, clonazepam, and diazepam at environmentally relevant concentrations (100g/L). Such treatment approach has not been reported in the literature to date. Independent variables such as catalyst concentration, pH, and sunlight-simulated irradiation were studied using design of experiments (DoE) to find conditions that provide maximum removal efficiency. TiO2/AC10% powder was characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, and diffuse reflectance. Under feasible optimized conditions, the efficiency of TiO2/AC10% to remove benzodiazepine drugs from water was >97.5%, which is much higher than the removal obtained with commercial catalyst and all controls.

AB beta-Blockers (BB) are one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals used for treating cardio-vascular and acute anxiety-related disorders. This class of drugs inhibit beta-adrenoceptor signalling and given their growing, widespread use, BB are routinely detected in surface waters at nM concentrations. This is concerning as trace levels of BB impart developmental and reproductive dysfunction in non-target aquatic organisms, with potential for ecological risks. To date, environmental pharmaceutical risks to non-target animals are not part of the monitoring framework due to the lack of bioassays for assessing their biological effects. Behavioral endpoints have the advantage of a systems-level integration of multiple sensory signals and motor responses for toxicity screening; however, they are not currently used for risk assessment of environmental contaminants. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo photomotor response (zfPMR) has been used in high-throughput behavioral screenings for neuroactive drug effects at high, therapeutic concentrations. Our objective here was to examine if we could utilize the zfPMR for screening environmental levels of BB. Embryos were placed into 96-well plates, exposed to chemicals and/or municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE), and their zfPMRs were measured with video-analysis. To specifically target BB, embryos were co-treated with isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist that stimulates the zfPMR, and the inhibition of isoproterenol-induced response was used as a biomarker of BB exposure. Our results reveal that the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated zfPMRs can be used as a biosensor capable of detecting BB in the parts-per-billion to parts-per-trillion in water samples, including diluted MWWE. The method developed detects BB in spite of the presence of other neuroactive compounds in water samples. This systems level approach of rapid screening for BB effects provides the most promising evidence to date that behavioral neuromodulation can be potentially applied for environmental effects monitoring of pharmaceuticals.

AB One of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds commonly found in treated wastewater is lamotrigine (LTG). It has also been detected in soils and crops irrigated with treated wastewater. Here we focused on the ability of the white-rot edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus to remove and transform LTG in liquid cultures. At concentrations of environmental relevance (1 and 10 mu g L-1) LTG was almost completely removed from the culture medium within 20 days. To elucidate the mechanism of LTG removal and transformation, we applied a physiological-based approach using inhibitors and a competing agent. These experiments were conducted at a higher concentration for metabolites detection. Based on identification of sulfur-containing metabolites and LTG N2-oxide and the effect of specific inhibitors, cytochrome P450 oxidation is suggested as one of the reaction mechanisms leading to LTG transformation. The variety and number of transformation products (i.e., conjugates) found in the current study were larger than reported in mammals. Moreover, known conjugates with glucuronide, glutathione, or cysteine/glycine, were not found in our system. Since the majority of the identified transformation products were conjugates of LTG, this study highlights the persistence of LTG as an organic pollutant in ecosystems exposed to wastewater.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments has become a major issue of concern for scientific community, since there is a lack of information about risks and impacts to the environment and public health. In the context of Brazil, many cities do not have Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) and domestic sewage is dumped directly into the water bodies, aggravating the problem. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the presence of 28 prescribed pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic classes in six full-scale Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTPs) in Minas Gerais state. Samples were collected in twelve field campaigns from August 2016 to August 2017 and water quality were monitored. Analytical methodology was based on solid phase extraction (C18 cartridge) followed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Prominence DGU/20A3 - Shimadzu) coupled to Mass Spectrometry (micrOTOF-QJI - Bruker). Considering the 28 pharmaceuticals analyzed, 18 were detected in the surface water source at concentrations ranging from Method Quantification Limit (MQL) to 11,960 ng/L. In drinking water, the concentration of the 11 pharmaceuticals detected ranged from <MQL to 6323 ng/L. Betamethasone, Fluconazole, Atorvastatin and Prednisone were the most detected pharmaceuticals. The drinking water monitoring showed a decrease in the concentration of all detected pharmaceuticals, indicating some removal of these compounds by the water treatment processes. The removal efficiency assessed shows a great variation among different compounds, DWTPs and over the year, ranging from an average of 32% +/- 6% (Prednisone -DWTP3) to 100% +/- 0% for some pharmaceuticals. The highest total concentrations and the maximum concentration values for the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were related to the winter due, presumably, to lower dilution and temperature.
   Trace levels of pharmaceuticals were detected in surface and drinking water in Brazil and conventional DWTPs were not able to remove the pharmaceuticals completely. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing concern about phenolic environmental estrogens (PEEs) in river systems, especially in economically developed regions, because of their potential to impact ecological systems. We studied the distribution of, ecological risks from, and factors that influenced PEEs in the sediments from the Duliujian River in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration and the Pearl River in Guangdong Province in China. The three target PEEs, nonyl phenol (4-NP), octyl phenol (4-t-OP), and bisphenol A (BPA), were detected in the sediments at concentrations ranging from 204.4 to 12604.3, 32.6 to 297.3, and from 12.8 to 298.4 ng g(-1) in the Pearl River, and from 153.5 to 3614.9, 90.7 to 990.0, and 83.5 -913.3 ng g(-1) in the Duliujian River, respectively. The PEE concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with total organic carbon in the river sediments (p <0.1). Urbanization influenced the distribution of PEEs and applications and discharges of PEEs were associated with large populations and industries. Rainfall and wastewater discharge patterns also influenced how PEEs were distributed in river sediments. The potential ecological risks from 4-NP, 4-t-OP, and BPA in these two rivers were high. Measures should be put in place to control the transport and storage of these compounds in river systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural water withdrawals account for the largest proportion of global freshwater use. Increasing municipal water demands and droughts are straining agricultural water supplies. Therefore, alternative solutions to agricultural water crises are urgently needed, including the use of nontraditional water sources such as advanced treated wastewater or reclaimed water, brackish water, return flows, and effluent from produce processing facilities. However, it is critical to ensure that such usage does not compromise soil, crop, and public health. Here, we characterized five different nontraditional water types (n = 357 samples) for the presence of pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and disinfectants using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry based method (UPLC-MS/MS). We then evaluated whether the levels of these contaminants were influenced by season. The highest level of herbicides (atrazine) was detected in untreated pond water (median concentration 135.9 ng/L). Reclaimed water had the highest levels of antibiotics and stimulants including azithromycin (215 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (232.1 ng/L), and caffeine (89.4 ng/L). Produce processing plant water also tended to have high levels of atrazine (102.7 ng/L) and ciprofloxacin (80.1 ng/L). In addition, we observed seasonal variability across water types, with the highest atrazine concentrations observed during summer months, while the highest median azithromycin concentrations were observed in reclaimed water during the winter season. Further studies are needed to evaluate if economically feasible on-farm water treatment technologies can effectively remove such contaminants from nontraditional irrigation water sources.

AB N, S-doped TiO2 (NST), N, S-doped ZnO (NSZ) and their composite with chitosan (NST/CS, NSZ/CS) were synthesized by sol gel-hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were characterized using XRD, FTIR, TEM and BET techniques. These photocatalysts were used for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline under visible light irradiation. At screening test, NST/CS had the highest tetracycline degradation efficiency of 91% for duration of 20 min under visible light. The blending of chitosan with NST increases the rate of photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline about 2 times. A detail characterization including HRTEM, SEM, EDS and DRS were conducted for NST/CS, the most active photocatalyst in this study. Photocatalytic activity test was conducted by varying tetracycline concentration, irradiation time, catalyst's concentration and pH using response surface methodology to find out the optimum condition for photocatalytic activity. The reusability of as-synthesized NST/CS was assessed which due to its high recoverability can be applied as an effective catalyst for degradation of organic substances in water and wastewater especially for degradation of emerging pollutants such pharmaceutical pollutants. The results from this work show a promising material for local authorities and pharmaceutical facilities to use for the treatment of pharmaceutical pollutants and tetracycline removal in water resource.

AB Phenolic compounds are chemicals that appear quite frequently across a broad spectrum of industrial process streams and wastewaters such as those from the pharmaceutical, petrochemical and refineries, plastics, wood, paint, and paper industries. As phenol is both toxic and harmful to the environment, the discharge and disposal of wastewater containing phenol is strictly regulated across the world, leading to the universal need of treating phenolic wastewaters for their discharge and reuse. The aim of this paper was the study of phenol removal by adsorption with polymer resin DOWEX OPTIPORE (TM) L493 Adsorbent, focusing on the typical stumbling blocks of adsorption technologies: removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and resin recovery. The potential of this resin for phenol removal was evaluated under different conditions at laboratory scale in packed-bed glass columns. Findings show that phenol removal was highly efficient, reaching values of 99.9% removal in single/solute studies and at least 95% in natural samples with high concentrations of additional total organic carbon. Equilibrium studies were carried out in order to build isotherm curves at 30 degrees C and 60 degrees C. The adsorption isotherm parameters were determined for various isotherm models through linear and nonlinear regression. Regeneration through temperature desorption has been tested on this resin, showing that quantitative desorption of phenol is possible at moderate temperature and pressure (100 degrees C, 1 bar). In conclusion, the results have identified DOWEX OPTIPORE (TM) L493 as an appropriate adsorbent for phenol, which shows great potential as an alternative to less environmentally friendly materials.

Of the 61 emerging organic pollutants (EOPs), 49 EOPs were detected, and the detection frequencies of 18 compounds were over 90%. PPCPs were the predominant species and contributed to approximately half of the total EOP concentrations in the most of the investigated WWTPs. The four EOPs with the highest mean concentrations of the 49 were metoprolol (798.0 ng L-1), carbamazepine (597.5 ng L-1), sulpiride (543.5 ng L-1) and dimethyl phthalate (502.6 ng L-1). The levels of some detected EOPs showed positive correlations with the total nitrogen level. In the ecological risk evaluation, roxithromycin, diclofenac acid, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, clindamycin, sulpiride, ibuprofen, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and dimethyl phthalate exhibited high or medium risks in the effluents. Four representative compounds, diclofenac acid, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and dimethyl phthalate, could be selected as indicators for predicting overall EOP levels.

AB Oxygen in air is an eco-friendly and economical oxidant, and catalytic air oxidation technology have a great potential to sustain effective wastewater treatment. Here we report a novel cathodic air oxidation process under the catalysis of a nickel@nickel oxide composite loaded on a porous graphite felt. Such a process demonstrates extensive and stable effectiveness in oxidizing a variety of dyes, pharmaceuticals and personal care products at high mineralization efficiencies under room condition. Mechanistic study indicates organic pollutants are oxidized by oxygen at cathodic nickel@nickel oxide/graphite felt through a non-free radical pathway, in which oxygen atom is transferred from oxygen molecule to organic molecules via lattice oxygen species in nickel oxide. The nickel oxide is reduced in the cathodic electric field, liberating and activating lattice oxygen species as the oxidizer of organic pollutants. Then, oxygen re-oxidizes nickel into nickel oxide to replenish lattice oxygen species. Such an oxygen activation pattern through nickel/nickel oxide redox cycle enables pollutant degradation at low energy cost, thus endowing the cathodic air oxidation process with a great potential in practical wastewater treatment.

AB Many glucocorticoids occur in the aquatic environments but their adverse effects to fish are poorly known. Here we investigate effects of the natural glucocorticoid corticosterone and the synthetic glucocorticoids betamethasone and flumethasone in zebrafish embryos. Besides studying the effects of each steroid, we compared effects of natural with synthetic glucocorticoids, used as drugs. Exposure at concentrations of 1 mu g/Land higher led to concentration-related decrease in spontaneous muscle contractions at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and increase in heart rate at 48 hpf. Betamethasone showed a significant increase at 0.11 mu g/L in heart rate. Corticosterone also accelerated hatching at 60 hpf at 0.085 mu g/L. Transcription of up to 24 genes associated with different pathways showed alterations at 96 and 120 hpf for all glucocorticoids, although with low potency. Corticosterone caused transcriptional induction of interleukin - 17, while betamethasone caused transcriptional down-regulation of the androgen receptor, aromatase and hsd11b2, indicating an effect on the sex hormone system. Furthermore, transcripts encoding proteins related to immune system regulation (irg1l, gilz) and fkbp5 were differentially expressed by corticosterone and betamethasone, while flumethasone caused only little effects, mainly alteration of the irg1l transcript. Our study shows that these glucocorticoids caused more potent physiological effects in early embryos than transcriptional alterations in hatched embryos, likely due to increased metabolism in later developmental stages. Thus, these glucocorticoids may be of concern for early stages of fish embryos in contaminated aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethazine (SMZ), a kind of sulfonamide antibiotics, can exist for a long periods of time and has been widely detected in the environment, which could pose a potential health threat to human beings. In this study, sludge-derived carbon (SC) catalyst was modified and applied to degrade SMZ during catalytic oxidation process. Degradation products and possible transformation pathways were investigated based on data of GC-MS. The toxicity evolution of SMZ degradation after catalytic oxidation process was tested with zebrafish and microbial degradation respirometer. As a consequence, SC modified with nitric acid (SC-HNO3) exhibited highly catalytic efficiency reached 92.2% SMZ conversion and 75.2% total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate after 480 min. Ten kinds of possible products were identified by GC-MS during degradation process of SMZ, indicating two possible pathways. No pronounced malformation was observed in the toxicity experiments with zebrafish until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). However, further analysis showed that zebrafish incubated with SMZ solution had higher mortality, lower hatching rate, slower spontaneous movement and shorter body length, compared with the group used normal nutrient solution, while the water after treatment had lower toxicity effects on zebrafish. The toxicity experiments with microbial degradation respirometer showed that SMZ solution had lower value of oxygen uptake, which indicated that SMZ solution had higher values of toxicity and inhibition of pharmaceutical compounds. This study provides a catalyst with low cost and high catalytic efficiency for degradation process of SMZ and gives a deeper insight into the ecotoxicity of treated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of PPCPs (Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products) in water sources and drinking water has concerned researchers in recent times. This study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of 6 PPCPs (namely paracetamol, diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, benzophenone-3 and methylparaben) in the Lobo reservoir, their degradation products, and how efficiently they were removed by 22 ecological filters, considering individual and mixture of compounds. There were 3 spiking events of PPCPs (2 mu g L-1) in the ecological filter influents conducted with a lag period of 15 days between spikes. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the filters at 3, 6 and 24 h after each spiking event. All target PPCPs were identified in the Lobo reservoir water in the range of mu g L-1. The personal care products were detected with 100% frequency in the samples, and in higher concentrations compared to the pharmaceuticals. Degradation products of diclofenac and benzophenone-3 were identified in the water samples. Results of this investigation show that ecological filtration was an effective process (70-99%) to remove 2 mu g L-1 of the selected PPCPs, and demonstrated that the filters were resilient to individual compounds and to their mixtures.

AB This work is aimed at assessing the effects of pretreated aqueous wastes stream-fed to a biological nutrient removal (BNR)-activated sludge plant. Aqueous wastes (mainly landfill leachate and liquid residues from chemical and pharmaceutical factories) are pretreated by means of a traditional coagulation-flocculation stage and subsequently sent to the BNR stage together with municipal wastewater. Pretreated aqueous wastes contribute up to about 75% of the influent load, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD; average concentration 23,000 mg/L). The resilience of the system, that is, the capacity to maintain high and stable performances despite sudden perturbations of the input conditions, was evaluated by interrupting the aqueous waste dosage and then progressively restoring the initial condition. The consequent variation of the influent load and composition caused a reduction of the biomass activity, which led to a decrease of the nitrogen removal efficiency (from 89% down to 73%). More than 30 days were required for restoring typical working conditions (in terms of influent load, process performance, and biomass activity), the sludge retention time (SRT) being 23 days.

AB In this paper, one pot-economical approach for in-situ modification of enoxacin (EXC) imprinted nanocomposite membrane was developed by employing carbon nanosphere sol (CNS) as coagulation bath during phase inversion process for increasingly antifouling property. Using polydopamine (pDA) as hydrophilic coating layer and second-reaction platform, the CNS based biomimetic molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (CBMIMs) were then obtained which used EXC as the target molecule for specific adsorption and separation EXC from the sewage. The imprinting polymer layer was highly hydrophilic, which advanced antifouling performance to avoid the adsorption of contaminant protein. Using EXC as template, the optimal fabrication conditions on performances and properties of CBMIMs were studied. Isothermal adsorption curves, adsorption kinetics and rebinding selectivity were investigated to well explain the selectivity adsorption mechanism of imprinted membranes on EXC. The CBMIMs presented highly selective specificity, short kinetic equilibrium time and preferable rebinding capacity for EXC. The rebinding ability and imprinted factor (beta) of CBMIMs could reach 32.10 mg g(-1) and 3.15, respectively, which presented various highly favorable features, including high rebinding strength and excellent selective performance. Furthermore, the adsorption of actual environmental sewage by CBMIMs was investigated, which highlighted the advantage of CBMIMs. Several favorable performances of CBMIMs also provided further application for sewage treatment in the future.

AB Hybrid CO2-activated system, which consists of precipitation and adsorption was utilized for removal of diclofenac (DCF) from aqueous solution. Diclofenac in CO2-activated system was precipitated by the solubility reduction in water. The effects of temperature, initial DCF concentration and CO2 flow rate on the precipitation efficiencies are investigated. The precipitation of DCF in CO2-activated system results in the reduction of DCF concentration in the aqueous solution less than 5 mg L-1. High initial DCF concentration and high CO2 flow rate achieve a rapid precipitation of DCF in the aqueous solution. Three kinds of adsorbents, chitosan, carbon nanotube and carbon nanofiber were used for the DCF adsorption in CO2-activated system. The carbon-based materials as adsorbents lead to the high adsorption efficiencies of DCF by the protonation of DCF and pi-electron on the aromatic rings of the carbon-based absorbents. Carbon nanofiber in CO2-activated system results in the adsorption efficiency 97.6% and the reduction of DCF concentration less than 0.115 mg L-1. Characterizations of the adsorbents with the zeta-potential, Fourier Transform Infrared spectra and thermogravimetric analysis were also conducted to discuss the DCF adsorption mechanism in CO2-activated system.

AB To comprehensively understand how antibiotics affect anaerobic digestion, their stimulating effects on methane production cannot be ignored; however, few studies have evaluated these effects. This study investigated the stimulating effects of three typical antibiotics (oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine, and norfloxacin) on high solid anaerobic digestion. The results showed that 100 mg/L antibiotics exhibited a strong stimulating effect on CH4 yield; while other external carbon sources had no obvious effects. The stimulating effect was more obvious under low inoculation ratios, which could improve the system processing capacity of feed sludge. Lower lag phases were given by the modified Gompertz model when stimulating effects occurred. The variations of physicochemical parameters and microbial Venn maps both showed that day 5 was a critical point for digestion time. The relative abundance of Methanosarcina was enhanced when the stimulating effect occurred, whereas Methanoculleus decreased. Different microbial characteristics were obtained for different samples from the heat maps.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the aquatic environment represents a worldwide threat. NSAIDs are considered "emerging contaminants" of water since the traditional methods are not designed to efficiently remove them. Aiming to overcome the limits of the conventional wastewater treatment plants, we propose molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as valid tools for selective adsorption and removal of these drugs from water. In particular, in this work, we have prepared diclofenac-selective MIP by a simple bulk polymerization process. After the characterization of the synthetized polymers, the binding abilities were evaluated in detail through the adsorption of diclofenac in aqueous solution and compared with the abilities of a corresponding non-imprinted polymer used as a reference. Thanks to the imprinting effect, the prepared MIP adsorbs with extreme selectivity its template molecule, i.e. the diclofenac. This effect was evaluated by testing the adsorption abilities towards different drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid and trimethoprim. In addition, MIP reusability was demonstrated after a simple regeneration step. The strength of this work is due to the low cost synthesis of MIP and to its optimal performance of molecular recognition in water, differentially from many of the traditional MIPs, usually used with organic solvent. Such peculiarities make the material potentially applicable for water treatment on a large scale.

AB Secondary urban wastewater samples were spiked with azithromycin (AZT), trimethoprim (TMP), ofloxacin (OFL) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) at 100 mu g L-1 to investigate the efficiency of a TiO2-photocatalytic treatment using UVA-LEDs. Different operating parameters were studied, such as the irradiation conditions, catalyst load and the use of methanol as carrier solvent and radical scavenger. The most efficient conditions to treat spiked urban wastewater (4 LEDs symmetrically distributed and 1.00 g L-1 of catalyst) were also assessed on the removal of the antibiotics at real concentrations, as well as on the inactivation and regrowth of bacteria after 3-day storage (total and resistant heterotrophs, Escherichia coli and enterococci). Clindamycin (CLI) was targeted when SMX was not detected. One-hour treatment was enough to reduce the analysed antibiotics to values below the detection limits and to decrease the bacterial load by 2 log-units. Bacterial regrowth was observed for total heterotrophs, after the storage of photocatalytic treated wastewater, to values close to pre-treatment. However, the antibiotic resistance percentage of such stored wastewater was always similar or lower than that of secondary urban wastewater. Thus, the potential of this process as part of the tertiary treatment is demonstrated, but conditions must be adjusted to minimize microbial regrowth.

AB A vortex assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector technique for separation, preconcentration and determination of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater was developed. Optimum conditions for the extraction, separation and preconcentration of the antibiotics were obtained using surface response methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD). Under optimum conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.63-1.2 ng L-1 and 2.1-4 ng L-1, respectively with the enhancement factors ranging from 48-83. The linear dynamic ranges were 2-800 for ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), and, 3-900 ng L-1 for danofloxacin (DANO) and 4-1000 ng L-1 for enrofloxacin (ENRO). Correlation coefficients were ranging from 0.9978 to 0.9989. The intraday (n = 15) and inter-day (n = 5) precisions (expressed in terms of % relative standard deviation (RSD) for 50 mu g L-1 of CIPRO, DANO and ENRO were in the range of 3.3-6% respectively. The developed method was used for the extraction, preconcentration and quantification of CIPRO, DANO and ENRO antibiotics in influent and effluent wastewater samples. In overall, vortex assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector (VA-DLLME/HPLC-DAD) demonstrated great potential for extraction, preconcentration and quantification of antibiotics in environmental water.

AB Chloroxylenol (CHL) is an antimicrobial ingredient that is frequently used in antiseptics/disinfectants for skin (e.g. hand soap) and non-living surfaces. CHL is an alternative to triclosan and triclocarban, the use of which has recently been banned in some countries. Accordingly, the more widespread use of CHL may significantly increase its occurrence and level in aquatic environments in the near future, eventually resulting in potential ecological risks. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may be a point source of CHL in natural environments due to extensive discharge through urban waste stream disposal. While the satisfactory removal of CHL in WWTPs is critical for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems, the extent of CHL removal and whether CHL causes system upset/failure in WWTPs currently remain unknown. In the present study, we conducted bio reactor operation and batch experiments to investigate the fate and effects of CHL and elucidate the mechanisms underlying degradation at various levels from environmentally relevant to high levels (0.5-5 mg L-1). Biorcactors partially removed CHL (44-87%) via a largely biological route. Microbial association networks constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data revealed selective enrichment and a correlation between Sphingobium and CHL, implying its involvement in the biological breakdown of CHL through dehalogenation and ring hydroxylation pathways. The present results provide insights into the behavior and effects of CHL in activated sludge communities and important information for the sustainable management of CHL that may be an emerging issue in the urban water cycle.

AB Several micropollutants, including caffeine, artificial sweeteners, pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones and a current-use pesticide were analyzed in water samples collected from five groundwater pumping stations in Barbados. The presence of caffeine and three artificial sweeteners (i.e. acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin) in groundwater samples indicated that groundwater was being contaminated by infiltration of wastewater into the karst aquifer. An estrogen (i.e. estrone), three pharmaceuticals (i.e. carbamazepine, trimethoprim, ibuprofen) and a transformation product of the fungicide, chlorothalonil (i.e. 4-hydroxychlorothalonil) were also detected at ng/L concentrations in groundwater collected from two or more pumping sites. The concentrations of carbamazepine and trimethoprim were correlated with the concentrations of caffeine (R-2 values of 0.70 to 0.80), indicating pharmaceutical contamination of groundwater by infiltration from domestic wastewater. The concentrations of caffeine were generally higher in groundwater samples collected in June during the wet season relative to the concentrations in samples collected in February during the dry season, indicating that infiltration of contaminants is higher during periods of heavy rainfall. Rapid rates of degradation and relatively slow rates of infiltration may explain why several target analytes were not detected in groundwater. Elevated concentrations of 4-hydroxychlorothalonil > 0.1 mu g/L in samples collected at two of the monitoring sites warrant further studies on the sources and the distribution of this compound and other pesticides used in agriculture and for turf-treatment (e.g. golf courses). Overall, more data are needed in order to implement mitigation strategies that are effective in reducing chemical contamination in groundwater in Barbados. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are widely used as preservatives in different commercial items including food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and their wide use has resulted in accumulation in the environment. Parabens have been shown to have negative effects on animals as well as human health. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive study to determine the adverse effects associated with propylparaben (PP) and methylparaben (MP) on early developmental stages of zebrafish. Mortality, hatching, developmental abnormalities and gene expression profiles were investigated in embryos exposed to both compounds. The semi-static exposure conditions showed that both MP (>= 100 mu M) and PP (>= 10 mu M) are toxic to the embryos in a concentration-dependent manner and lead to developmental abnormality. Malformations such as spinal defects, pericardial edema, and pigmentation defects were observed following both MP and PP treatments. Hatching delay, mortality and developmental abnormality data indicate that PP is more toxic than MP. For gene expression analysis, 1 and 10 mu M doses of MP and PP were analyzed. Genes from physiological pathways including stress response, cell cycle and DNA damage, inflammation, fatty acid metabolism and endocrine functions were affected by MP and PP. The gene expression profiles show that parabens cause toxicity by inducing oxidative stress, DNA double-strand breaks, apoptosis as well as by altering fatty acid metabolism. Altered expression of androgen receptor (ar) and estrogen receptor 2 alpha (esr2a) indicates an antiandrogenic and estrogenic activity of parabens in zebrafish. Overall, the present study provides considerable information on the negative effects of MP and PP using physiological endpoints and motivates further studies to explore the molecular mechanism of the toxicity associated with parabens.

AB The presence of sewage-borne Organic Micro-Pollutants (OMP) in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) effluents represents an increasing concern when water is reclaimed for irrigation or even indirect potable reuse. During eighteen months, an innovative hybrid water reclamation scheme based on a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) enhanced with Powder Activated Carbon (PAC) was operated at pilot-scale (70 m(3)/d) in order to compare it with state-of-the art Wastewater Reclamation System (WWRS) also revamped with a final step of ozonation-UV. Removal of persistent OMP, water quality and treatment costs were evaluated and compared for the different treatment schemes. OMP removal efficiency results for the different schemes concluded that established technologies, such as physico-chemical and filtration systems as well as MBR, do not remove significantly (>15%) the most recalcitrant compounds. The upgrading of these two systems through the addition of ozonation-UV step and PAC dosing allowed improving average recalcitrant OMP removal to 85 +/- 2 and 75 +/- 5%, respectively. In term of costs, PAC-MBR represents an increase of 37% of costs regarding conventional systems but presents improvements of 50% reduction in space and water quality. On the other hand, ozonation requires up to a 15% increase of foot-print; nevertheless, represents lower costs and lower carbon footprint. Ozonation-UV seems to be the best option for upgrading existing facilities, while PAC-MBR should be considered when space represents a critical limitation and produced water is reused for high water quality purposes.

AB Sludge treatment wetlands (STWs) have recently been used to treat surplus sludge. However, the distribution of antibiotics involved in the process has not been comprehensively investigated.
   This study aimed to evaluate the fate of two antibiotics, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZM) in STWs during the treatment of surplus sludge. Three pilot-scale STWs units-S1 with aeration tubes, S2 with aeration tubes and reed planting, and S3 with reed planting-were constructed and operated under feeding followed by resting periods. The results showed that antibiotic content in residual sludge decreased over time and unit S2 performed the best in terms of antibiotic removal. Planting reed considerably improved the antibiotic removal performance of the STWs. Biodegradation and absorption resulted in removal of most of the antibiotics in the test units. Less than 2% of the antibiotics was taken up by plants, whereas <5% of the influent antibiotics left the STW units through the drainage discharge. Overall, STW units contributed to effectively decrease CIP and AZM to 41-72% and 49-84%, respectively. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and environment estrogens, as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), have been widely detected in aquatic environments around the world. However, surveys of seasonal freeze-thaw rivers with special hydrological features are limited. To address this, in this study the occurrence, distribution, ecological risk, and mass flux of 22 CECs in the Jilin Songhua River in northeast China, a famously seasonal freeze thaw river at mid - and high-latitude regions, were investigated during its spring flood period. The results indicate that estriol had a maximum concentration of 27.4 ng.L(-1)in the mainstream river water. Doxy-cycline had a maximum concentration of 204.4 ng.L-1 in the tributary river water and 103.0 ng.L-1 in the riverine wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The mean concentrations of the targeted CECs in the spring flood were 1.4 times higher than those found in our previous investigation during the summer flood. A risk assessment showed that estrone posed a high risk in the mainstream, doxycycine posed a high risk in the tributaries, and ofloxadn posed a high risk in the riverine WWTP effluents. In addition, erythromycin and lincomycin posed a medium to high risk in the river water and WWTP effluents. The major contribution of the CECs in the mainstream came from its tributaries, which contributed a total of >50% in the spring flood period. The results suggest that some appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the contribution of the CECs from the tributaries to the seasonal freeze-thaw river in its spring flood period.

AB This work presents the treatment of selected emerging concern pharmaceuticals in real hospital wastewater (HWW) from Tumaco-Colombia by combination of a biological system with a sonochemical process. Fifteen compounds, commonly present in HWW, were considered: acetaminophen, didofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, loratadine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, darithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Initially, HWW was characterized in terms of global parameters and the pharmaceuticals content. HWW contained a moderate amount of organic matter (i.e., total organic carbon: 131.56 mg L-1 (C)) mainly associated to biodegradable components. However, the most of pharmaceuticals were found at levels upper than their predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Then, a conventional biological treatment was applied to the HWW. After 36 h, such process mainly removed biodegradable substances, but had a limited action on the pharmaceuticals. The resultant biotreated water was submitted to the sonochemical process (375 kHz and 88 W L (-1), 1.5 h), which due to its chemical (i.e., radical attacks) and physical (i.e., suspended solids disaggegation) effects induced a considerable pharmaceuticals degradation (pondered removal: 58.82%), demonstrating the complementarity of the proposed combination. Afterwards, Fe2+ (5 ppm) and WC light (4 W) were added to the sonochemical system (generating sons-photo-Fenton process), which significantly increased up to 82.86% the pondered pharmaceuticals removal. Subsequently, to understand fundamental aspects of the pharmaceuticals degradations, a model compound (norfloxacin) in distilled water was treated by sonochemical system. sono-photo-Fenton process and their sub-systems (i.e., sono-Fenton and UVC alone). This allowed proving the hydroxyl radical action in sonochemical treatment, plus the contribution of Fenton reaction and direct photodegradation in the pharmaceuticals removal by sono-photoFenton. Finally, it was found that 91.13% of the initial pharmaceuticals load in HWW was removed by the biological/sono-photo-Fenton combination. The high pollutants abatement evidenced that this combination is a powerful alternative for removing pharmaceuticals from complex-matrix waters, such as raw HWW. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The adsorption of entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer (AG-AC) was investigated by measuring the removal of organic compounds. The general concept is that the entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer could be used as a low-cost adsorbent for ascorbic acid and lactose removal from industrial wastewater. Ascorbic acid and lactose are the most pharmaceutical wastes that can introduce throughout the industrial process and lead to an increase in the amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater. Different ascorbic acid and lactose concentrations were prepared in the laboratory. The efficient removal is affected by external variables (eg, pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, concentrations, and stirring rate). Percent removal for ascorbic acid and lactose at pH 3 using dose 30 g for 60 minutes with a fixed stirring rate at 100 rpm was about 70% and 50%, respectively. Ascorbic acid and lactose adsorption onto entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer obey well with Freundlich adsorption isotherm.

AB The main objective of this work was the development and characterization of sustainable electro-responsive ionic liquid-based cationic copolymers. For this purpose degradable semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (s-IPNs) based on starch and on ion-conducting cationic copolymers of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazohum chloride (BVImCI), cross-linked with N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA), were synthesized by following principles of green chemistry. Cross-linked poly(HEMA-co-BVImCl) copolymers were also prepared for comparison. The resulting cationic hydrogels (copolymer and s-IPNs) were characterized in terms of their physicochemical, thermomechanical, morphological, and electrochemical properties, as well as in terms of cell viability and proliferation against fibroblast cells. Furthermore, the electro- assisted sorption/release capacity of the prepared hydrogels toward i-tryptophan (used as a model biomolecule) was also studied at different applied DC voltages (0, 2, 5, and 100 V). Results demonstrated that the properties of the synthesized hydrogels can be tuned, depending on their relative chemical composition, presenting electronic conductivity and ionic conductivity values in the 0.1 to 5.2 S cm(-1) range, and complex shear modulus in the 0.6 to 6.4 MPa range. The sorption/ release capacity of the s-IPNs after 3 h at 25 degrees C can also be modulated between 2.5 and 70% and 4.5 and 40%, depending on the applied DC voltage and/or sorption/release medium. Finally, none of the synthesized cationic hydrogels induced fibroblast cells lysis, although s-IPNs had a lower impact on cell proliferation than poly(HEMA-co-BVImCl) copolymers, indicating a favorable effect of starch on the biocompatibility of the synthesized s-IPNs. The designed cationic hydrogels could be useful for the development of efficient, stable, degradable and cheaper soft and multiresponsive platforms with potential applications in bioseparation processes, wastewater treatment systems (e.g., pharmaceutical), biomedical devices (e.g., sustained delivery of specific charged-biomolecules), and nonleaching electrochemical devices.

AB In view of the increasing concerns for environmental problems caused by the widespread use of antibiotics, there is an urgent demand to develop effective technologies for antibiotics removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. For this purpose, photocatalysis has been developed as an important advanced oxidation technology possessing remarkable prospective, and thus, the semiconductor photocatalysts are currently attracting unprecedented research attention. Herein, we report the fabrication of composite materials based on nitrogen-doped carbons and cadmium sulfide semiconductors (CdS/NC-T) derived solely from cadmium metal-organic frameworks (Cd-MOF) through a facile in situ carbonization method, as well as their application as viable photocatalysts toward tetracycline degradation under visible irradiation. It was revealed that cadmium and sulfur species in Cd-MOF precursors assembled to form CdS nanoparticles (NPs), which were deposited simultaneously on nitrogen-doped carbon scaffolds to afford CdS/NC-T composites during carbonization processes. PXRD and TEM studies on as-prepared CdS/NC-T materials indicated the formation of crystalline hexagonal (Wurtzite) CdS NPs on carbonaceous supports. These CdS/NC-T composites were further studied for photocatalytic tetracycline degradation in aqueous solutions under visible irradiation, among which CdS/NC-500 exhibited the highest TC degradation efficiency of ca. 83% within 1 h. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CdS/NC-T depended largely on carbonization temperature, which suggested great potentials of the proposed synthetic pathway in engineering of new visible-light-driven photocatalysts.

AB The frequent detection of antibiotics in water bodies gives rise to concerns about their removal technology. In this study, the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of norfloxacin (NOR), a typical fluoroquinolone pharmaceutical, by the UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) was investigated. NOR could be degraded effectively using this process, and the degradation rate increased with the increasing dosage of PDS but decreased with the increasing concentration of NOR. In real water, the degradation of NOR was slower than that in ultrapure water, which indicated that laboratory results cannot be directly used to predict the natural fate of antibiotics. Further experiments suggested that the degradation of NOR was the most fast under neutral condition, the existence of HA or FA inhibited the degradation of NOR, and the presence of inorganic ions (NO3-, Cl-, CO32- and HCO3-) had no significant effect on degradation of NOR. Total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate (40%) indicated NOR was not completely mineralized, and six transformation products were identified, and possible degradation pathways of NOR had been proposed. It can be prospected that UV/PDS technology could be used for advanced treatment of wastewater containing fluoroquinolones.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs), such as pharmaceuticals, sterols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are frequently detected in the environment. ECs are refractory, toxic, tend to bioaccumulate and have a potential to disrupt the endocrine system of living organisms. These compounds are only partially eliminated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Due to their hydrophobic nature, they tend to accumulate in sludge. However, the fate of the majority of ECs in sludge treatment processes is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of a sequential anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic (AN/AERO/ANOX) digestion and a conventional single-stage AN digestion (as control) was investigated on mixed primary and secondary sludge. Digesters were operated at an overall solid retention time (SRT) of 18 days. The steady-state results have shown that sequential AN/AERO/ANOX digestion configurations improved the removal of three classes of ECs (e.g., sterols, PAHs and pharmaceuticals) by either reducing their accumulation or enhancing their removal. Moreover, sequential AN/AERO/ANOX digestion also achieved 45% less ammonia generation, 20% faster digestate dewaterability and 4% enhanced volatile solids removal compared to single-stage AN digestion.

AB This study explores the enhancement of UV-C tertiary treatment by sulfate radical based Advanced Oxidation Processes (SR-AOPs), including photolytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) and their photocatalytic activation using Fe(II). Their efficiency was assessed both for the inactivation of microorganisms and the removal or micropollutants (MPs) in real wastewater treatment plant effluents. Under the studied experimental range (UV-C dose 5.7-57 J/L; UV-C contact time 3 to 28 s), the photolysis of PMS and PS (0.01 mM) increased up to 25% the bacterial removal regarding to UV-C system. The photolytic activation of PMS led to the total inactivation of bacteria (approximate to 5.70 log) with the highest UV-C dose (57 J/L). However, these conditions were insufficient to remove the MPs, being required oxidant's dosages of 5 mM to remove above 90% of carbamazepine, diclofenac, atenolol and triclosan. The best efficiencies were achieved by the combination of PMS or PS with Fe(II), leading to the total removal of the MPs using a low UV-C dosage (19 J/L), UV-C contact time (9 s) and reagent's dosages (0.5 mM). Finally, high mineralization was reached ( > 50%) with photocatalytic activation of PMS and PS even with low reagent's dosages.

AB Reducing pathogenic risks in surface waters impacted by leaking or overflowing sewage requires the ability to detect human excreta in raw sewage, discriminate human excreta from other types of animal excreta, and differentiate between treated wastewater and raw sewage. We used the relative concentrations of a degradable, human-specific pharmaceutical and a persistent artificial sweetener to indicate the presence of human excreta, its degree of environmental degradation, and the amount of dilution by freshwater sources. Samples were collected and analyzed for acetaminophen and sucralose between 2016 and 2018 from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and streams in metropolitan Lexington, Kentucky (USA). Both co-analytes were consistently present in raw sewage, with acetaminophen in higher concentrations than sucralose. The presence of acetaminophen was related primarily to untreated human excreta, with concentrations rapidly decreasing upon treatment to nearly undetectable levels in WWTP effluents and streams. Sucralose in surface waters was related to inputs of both raw sewage and WWTP effluents. The ratio of acetaminophen to sucralose concentrations in raw sewage and spiked river waters exhibited linear decay kinetics with respect to time, with larger decay constants observed at higher temperatures. This co-analyte indicator approach was evaluated at a local site previously suspected of receiving raw sewage. The presence and ratios of the co-analytes indicated the presence of domestic sewage that was not fully treated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Various water treatment processes may be ineffective to remove pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) and their by-products, leading to endocrine-disruptive activity that might be detrimental to wildlife and human health. This study investigated the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and their intermediates, as well as estrogenic activity that is not effectively removed by conventional methods. A consortium of isolated South African indigenous fungi A. niger, M. circinelloides, T. polyzona, T. longibrachiatum and R. microsporus, was used in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to remove PhCs, their intermediates and strongly reduce their estrogenic activity. The fungal ligninolytic enzymatic activity was determined for laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) using a spectrophotometric method. The biodegradation of PhCs and their intermediates was monitored by SPE-UPLC/MS. The in vitro estrogenic activity was assessed in the T47D-KBluc reporter gene assay. Lac, MnP and LiP production appeared to be biomass growth dependent. During a lag phase of growth, a constant biomass of about 122.04 mg/100 mL was recorded with average enzymatic activity around 63.62 U/L for Lac, 151.91 U/L for MnP and 42.12 U/L for LiP. The exponential growth phase from day 7 to day 17, was characterised by a biomass increase of 124.46 units, and an increase in enzymatic activity of 9.91 units for Lac, 99.03 units for MnP and 44.24 units for LiP. These enzymes played an important synergistic role in PhCs degradation in the cytochrome P450 system. A decrease of 13.89%, 29.7% and 16.15% in PhC concentrations was observed for CBZ, DCF and IBP, respectively, and their intermediates were identified within 4 h of incubation. The removal efficiency achieved after 24 h in the SBR was about 89.77%, 95.8% and 91.41% for CBZ, DCF and IBP, respectively. The estradiol equivalent (EEq) values of 1.71 +/- 0.30 ng/L and 2.69 +/- 0.17 ng/L were recorded at the start-up time and after 4 h, respectively. The presence of intermediates was found to induce estrogenic activity. The EEq values after 24 h incubation was found to be below the LoQ and below the LoD of the assay. None of the samples exhibited any anti-estrogenic activity. The fungal consortium inoculum was found to induce toxicity at a 0.4 x concentration, as observed under a microscope. This study revealed that the use of the fungal consortium can remove the estrogenic activity of pharmaceutical metabolites, which appeared to be the most significant contributors to the endocrine-disrupting activity of the wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB Conventional photocatalytic nanomaterials are not environmentally sustainable since these are usually produced from scarce mineral and metal precursors. Moreover, high pollutant removal efficiencies by conventional photocatalysts are only attained after several hours of reaction with light. In this study, novel visible light-active photocatalysts were synthesized from environment-friendly carbon precursors and applied for the rapid degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in aqueous solutions. The photocatalysts were prepared via the co-pyrolysis of urea with varying doping temperature and dopant amount. These variations played a vital role in improving the performance of the photocatalysts and resulted in up to >99% SMX removal within 45 min of visible light irradiation. Characterization of the photocatalysts showed that potassium and iodine dopants were responsible in the red shift and broadening of the light absorption spectrum to the visible region. In addition, the band gap energy narrowed by 0.23 eV resulting in faster charge transfer but slower recombination of the photo-generated electron and hole pairs. Effects of varying concentrations of inorganic salts (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, PO43-) on SMX removal were also examined. Lastly, the mechanism of SMX photodegradation was elucidated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents for the first time the treatment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in a systematic study in different municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) of the Mediterranean area, more than 1000 km away. Solar photo-Fenton process at neutral pH with Fe3+-EDDS has been demonstrated to be very efficient under controlled conditions and must be validated in realistic and variable conditions such as real MWWTP effluents of different composition. To this end, CEC removal was studied in effluents from 5 treatment plants in the Mediterranean area of Spain, the inorganic and organic composition varying in the range 161-641 mg L-1 (sulfate), 133-538 mg L-1 (chloride) and 10-20 mg L-1 (dissolved organic carbon). More than 45 CECs were quantified in MWW and results showed that the effect on CEC elimination of the concentration of anions and organic matter was interfered by the nature of the organic matter. However, origin and composition of MWW was not critic for attaining > 80% degradation of CECs after 15 min of reaction. Moreover, conventional anions (sulfate, chloride) had a positive effect on CEC degradation rate. This paper demonstrates the consistency and predictability of the solar photo-Fenton process at circumneutral pH for treating CECs in simple and cheap photoreactors.

AB A comparative study of the photocatalytic efficiency obtained in water disinfection and the simultaneous removal of micropollutants was carried out by using three different TiO2 photocatalytic materials. The three photocatalysts were immobilized in macroporous reticulated ZrO2 3D foams and their efficiency was compared with that obtained in suspensions for the treatment of synthetic and real wastewater. The results obtained show similar photocatalytic efficiencies for the three photocatalysts used, showing the catalysts WTT-P and AQ1 to be an alternative to the common use of P25 catalyst. The use of supported photocatalysts in the treatment of synthetic water showed lower efficiencies compared to the suspended photocatalysts due to the existence of diffusive limitations caused by the low concentration of the micropollutants. However, these differences were not observed when treating a wastewater treatment effluent. In this case, the non-selective action of the hydroxyl radicals causes the loss of a significant part of the available radicals for the oxidation of non-target compounds present in the water. Consequently, diffusion was not identified as the limiting stage of the removal rate, but the availability of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction medium, which allows the 3D foams to be as effective as the processes in suspension.

AB The widespread occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in aquatic environment has become a worldwide concern. This work investigated the removal of four representative emerging PhACs, including carbamazepine (CBZ), crotamiton (CTMT), N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and ibuprofen (IBP) in two internal circulation biological aerated filters (IcBAFs). Results showed that DEET (> 95%) and IBP (> 80%) were removed efficiently in the IcBAFs, whereas CTMT (< 30%) and CBZ (< 5%) were poorly removed due to their recalcitrant characteristics. The mechanism for DEET and IBP removal in the IcBAFs was biodegradation and autotrophic microbes were responsible for their degradation. The major biotransformation products of IBP included hydroxy-IBP and 1-(4-isobutylphenyl) ethanol, while one major biodegradation product of DEET was identified as N, N-diethylbenzamide. In addition, the removal of residual PhACs in IcBAF effluents by various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were evaluated in either batch or continuous-flow mode. The results showed that the low-pressure UVA/Fe-III-EDDS/H2O2 process was very effective for the treatment of residual PhACs in IcBAF effluents under neutral pH conditions, e. g., resulting in more than 90% degradation of the PhACs in continuous-flow mode. The impacts of photo-Fenton reagents doses (i. e., Fe-III-EDDS dose, H2O2 dose and the EDDS:Fe-III molar ratio), as well as the UV light sources (UVA/UVC) and intensities on the residual PhACs removal were evaluated in detail. The LC-QTOF-MS analysis revealed that not only the target PhACs but also their biodegradation byproducts were efficiently degraded by the low-pressure UVA/Fe-III-EDDS/H2O2 process, suggesting that this process had great potential for the treatment of residual PhACs in wastewater after biotreatment.

AB In many aquatic environments, municipal wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) effluent discharges influence local hydrologic and chemical connectivity between the surface-water and adjacent alluvial shallow-groundwater systems. Fourmile Creek located in Polk County, Iowa received effluent from the Ankeny WWTF for nearly forty years before it was shut down in November 2013. The decommissioning of the municipal WWTF provided a unique opportunity to characterize the recovery from impacts of treated wastewater discharge on water quality at the surface-water/groundwater interface in a shallow, unconfined alluvial aquifer.
   Dissolved major element and trace element concentrations in Fourmile Creek surface water, hyporheic-zone water, and shallow, unconfined groundwater were monitored upstream and downstream from the WWTF discharge before and after the shutdown. Multivariate statistical techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) were used to differentiate source-water contributions, characterize elemental components, and describe surface-water/groundwater interaction dynamics. During the post-closure assessment, there was subsurface attenuation of wastewater constituents including Al. B, Cu, Gd, K, Mo. Na, P, Pb, Sb, and Zn. During the same time, groundwater concentrations increased for As, Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, SiO2, Sr, and U and represented a profile characteristic of the shallow alluvial aquifer. Hydrologic conditions transitioned from predominantly wastewater infiltration and hyporheic exchange before the WWTF shutdown, to predominantly discharge of native groundwater. Precipitation-driven streamflow events created fluctuations in the groundwater water-table elevations, resulting in variable contact between the saturated and unsaturated zones within the unconfined, alluvial aquifer and intermittent exposure to constituents stored in the sediments. The inorganic fingerprint of municipal wastewater was flushed relatively quickly (519 weeks) from the hyporheic zone indicating that processes like diffusion or sorption/desorption that might extend recovery may not be important for many trace elements in this system.

AB Progestagens discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have increasingly gained attention due to their potential risks to the aquatic organisms. However, limited information is available on the occurrence and removal of various progestagens in WWTPs in different cities of China. This work investigated the occurrence and removal of 11 progestagens in 21 WWTPs from 19 Chinese cities. Results showed that progestagens are widely distributed in the investigated WWTPs, with higher influent concentrations of total progestagens in northern WWTPs. The concentration of progestagens in WWTP influent were closely correlated with influent quality, service population and daily service volume of the WWTPs. Additionally, progesterone (PGT) and dydrogesterone (DDT) were two predominant progestagens in influent, effluent and excess sludge. Up to 5 of 11 progestagens showed high aqueous removal efficiencies (median removal efficiency >90%), whereas megestrol acetate (MTA), chlormadinone acetate (CMA), drospirenone (DSP) and levonorgestrel (LNG) had a removal efficiency of below 50%. Specially, the behaviors of progestagens along the anaerobicanoxic-oxic of a WWTP were further explored and the aerobic tank is the main contributor to the removal of progestagens. Finally, in the effluent of these 21 WWTPs, daily mass loadings of the total progestagens ranged from 0.51 to 10.4 g d(-1) Notably, LNG exhibited high potential risk to the fish base on risk quotient.

AB In this study, the efficacy of membrane-photocatalytic reactor (MPR) in sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal was explored at a fixed initial SMX concentration, i.e. 100 mg/L. A supported catalyst, i.e. TiO2 on granular activated carbon (GAC-TiO2), was used for MPR experiments. The SMX removal efficiency of the MPR was investigated under a range of hydraulic retention time (i.e. HRT from 51 to 152.5 min) and TiO2 catalyst dosage (55-50 mg/L). A maximum SMX removal efficiency of 83.6% was observed under 220 mg/L catalyst dosage and 80 min HRT. The increase in catalyst dosage from 55 to 550 mg/L has increased the transmembrane pressure of the reactor from 9.8 to 22.2 kPa. A multiple non-linear regression model was developed based on the experimental data and its significance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Based on the model, the optimal HRT and catalyst dosage for complete SMX removal (100%) were found out. The comparison of photocatalytic degradation experiments with sorption experiments conducted earlier revealed that SMX removal in the MPR was mainly by photocatalytic degradation and not by adsorption onto GAC-TiO2 catalyst. However, the performance of MPR in removing other emerging pollutants from real-time wastewaters could be explored before its field-scale application.

AB Since 1970, the detection of pharmaceutical substances, in the various aquatic systems, became a global health problem. In this study, separation by the adsorption process in the presence of activated carbon cocoa shells (ACCS) as adsorbant was applied for the treatment of effluents containing antibiotic drugs (rifampicin). The influence of process variables such as the adsorption time, initial rifampicin concentration, pH, temperature, and ACCS dose on adsorption performance has been investigated. The general order kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm model provided the best fit to the experimental data. The negative enthalpy indicates an exothermic process that occurs via physisorption. From the experimental results, the values of isosteric heat decreased with increasing the surface coverage, indicating the presence of strong interactions.

AB This study examined the impact of tetracycline at two environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L) and one synthetically high concentration (500 mu g/L) on the structure and function of the microbial community from the secondary treatment process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Specifically, this study examined whether the introduction of tetracycline into bench scale reactors at two different replacement volume rates would cause a shift in the composition profile of the bacterial community. Furthermore concentrations of ammonia, nitrate/nitrite and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were monitored to examine the effect of the antibiotic on ammonia and nitrogen removal. At the low volume replacement rate, tetracycline was observed to have a positive impact on nitrogen removal. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations were also observed to decrease suggesting a role for tetracycline as a carbon source. However, at the higher volume replacement rate, the removal of ammonia and nitrogen were not significantly different from reactors that did not contain tetracycline. Over time, the bacterial composition profiles changed under all the conditions studied, however, the bacterial composition profiles appeared to be more influenced by the replacement volume rate than the presence of tetracycline even at concentrations many times higher than environmentally relevant amounts.

AB The discharge of wastewater effluents to a stream that is subsequently used for drinking water abstraction has been previously referred to as de facto water reuse. Where the abstraction of surface water for drinking water production occurs via induced bank filtration or aquifer recharge, additional site specific factors should be considered to assess the impact of wastewater effluents on bank-filtered water. This study represents the first national reconnaissance to quantify wastewater effluent contributions in streams across Germany and consequences for indirect drinking water abstraction from these streams. An automated assessment using ArcGIS was conducted for river basins considering minimum and mean average discharge conditions of streams as well as discharge from more than 7500 wastewater facilities. In urban areas, where the natural base discharge is low, wastewater effluent contributions greater than 30-50% were determined under mean minimum discharge conditions, which commonly prevail from May to September. A conceptual model was proposed to estimate critical bank filtrate shares resulting in monitoring trigger levels for health-relevant chemicals as a universal qualitative assessment regarding the relevance of de facto reuse conditions in surface waters used for drinking water abstraction. This approach was validated using chemical monitoring data for three case study locations.

AB Ferric (Fe3+) salt dosing is an efficient sulfide control strategy in the sewer network, with potential for multiple benefits including phosphorus removal in the biological reactors and sulfide emission control in the anaerobic digesters of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This paper extends the knowledge on the benefit of iron dosing by exploring its impact on the fate of organic micropollutants (MPs) in the wastewater using sewer reactors simulating a rising main sewer pipe. The sulfide produced by the sewer biofilms reacted with Fe3+ forming black colored iron sulfide (FeS). Among the selected MPs, morphine, methadone, and atenolol had >90% initial rapid removal within 5 min of ferric dosing in the sewer reactor. The ultimate removal after 6 h of retention time in the reactor reached 93-97%. Other compounds, ketamine, codeine, carbamazepine, and acesulfame had 30-70% concentration decrease. The ultimate removal varied between 35 and 70% depending on the biodegradability of those MPs. In contrast, paracetamol had no initial removal. The rapid removal of MPs was likely due to adsorption to the FeS surface, which is further confirmed by batch tests with different FeS concentrations. The results showed a direct relationship between the removal of MPs and FeS concentration. The transformation kinetics of these compounds in the reactor without Fe3+ dosing is in good agreement with biodegradation associated with the sewer biofilms in the reactor. This study revealed a significant additional benefit of dosing ferric salts in sewers, that is, the removal of MPs before the sewage enters the WWTP.

   Environmental management for the use of sewage sludge in rice paddy fields.
   Abstract One of the concerns against the use of sewage sludge for agricultural purposes is emerging contaminants contained in sewage sludge. Most of the studies on biological degradation of pharmaceutically active compounds in agricultural land were carried out with water-unsaturated soils under relatively aerobic conditions. In this study, the degradation of pharmaceuticals mainly including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was investigated in Asian rice paddy soils that are flooded in anaerobic condition. The experimental results showed that the concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals excluding the exception of naproxen were poorly decreased in anaerobic condition. On the other hand, the microbial communities of the soils contained the aerobic degraders of clofibric acid and diclofenac, which are generally persistent in biological wastewater treatment. The higher degradation rates in aerobic condition suggest the possibility of enhanced degradation of pharmaceuticals by supplying oxygen with plowing anaerobic rice fields or with drying the field in off-season for farming.

AB Background: Due to the complexities involved in the extraction of micropollutants, the information regarding micropollutants like paraben in wastewater and sludge is scarce. The aim of this study was to adopt a microwave-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (MADLLME) method for the extraction of parabens in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
   Methods: A mixed stock solution of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butyl-parabens with concentration of 10 mg/mL were prepared in methanol. To validate this method, the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, and m/z were measured. To adopt this method in different condition, the effect of pH (3, 7, 9, and 12), microwave power (180, 300, 450, and 600 W), solvent type (methanol, acetone, methanol/water, acetone/water), and 1 g folorisil were assessed. After adopting MADLLME method, the paraben fate of this WWTP was evaluated through mass loading and emission.
   Results: The optimum performance of MADLLME method was observed at pH = 7, microwave power - 450 W, reaction time - 30 s, and methanol as the solvent. The total concentrations of four paraben metabolites in the WWTP ranged between 2505 ng/L in influent, 1953 ng./L in effluent, and 8.03 ng/g at wet weight sludge samples. The total mass loading and emission of four parabens in this WWTP was 0.672 mg/d/1000 people and 0.186 mg/d/1000 people, respectively.
   Conclusion: MADLLIVIE method seems to be an excellent alternative, as a given extraction technique, for determining various groups of emerging micropollutants in different matrices.

AB The monoterpene alcohol alpha-terpineol is extensively used as the foaming agent in mineral processing and can be released to environment along with the wastewater. This study evaluated the feasibility of eliminating alpha-terpineol in water by ultraviolet irradiation (UV) in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Within an H2O2 dose of 10 mg/L and an UV fluence of 64.8 J/cm(2), more than 95% of the alpha-terpineol can be removed. The reactions fitted well to pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the apparent rate constant was 0.0678 min(-1). The effects of matrix species including various anions and humic acid (HA), were evaluated. The degradation rate decreased significantly with the addition of bicarbonate and HA. Further verification was carried out with three types of real water samples. In the ground water and the surface water, the degradation rate decreased likely due to the presence of natural organic matter. Finally, possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the identification of transformation products, and the occurrence of two main transformation products were monitored. This study demonstrated that the UV/H2O2 is an effective technology for the degradation of alpha-terpineol in water.

AB The monitoring of micropollutants in water compartments, in particular pharmaceuticals and personal care products, has become an issue of increasing concern over the last decade. Their occurrence in surface and groundwater, raw wastewater and treated effluents, along with the removal efficiency achieved by different technologies, have been the subjects of many studies published recently. The concentrations of these contaminants may vary widely over a given time period (day, week, month, or year). In this context, this paper investigates the average concentration and removal efficiency obtained by adopting four different sampling modes: grab sampling, 24-h time proportional, flow proportional and volume proportional composite sampling. This analysis is carried out by considering three ideal micropollutants presenting different concentration curves versus time (day). It compares the percentage deviations between the ideal concentration (and removal efficiencies) and the differently measured concentrations (removal efficiencies) and provides hints as to the best sampling mode to adopt when planning a monitoring campaign depending on the substances under study. It concludes that the flow proportional composite sampling mode is, in general, the approach which leads to the most reliable measurement of concentrations and removal efficiencies even though, in specific cases, the other modes can also be correctly adopted.

AB A novel carbon quantum dots modified potassium titanate nanotubes (CQDs/K2Ti6O13) composite photocatalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment combined with calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated formation of potassium titanate nanotubes and successful deposition of CQDs onto K2Ti6O13. The photocatalytic performance of CQDs/K2Ti6O13 composite was evaluated by degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) under the irradiation of visible light and lights with the wavelengths of 365, 385, 420, 450, 485, 520, 595 and 630 nm. The results showed that the photocatalytic activity of CQDs/K2Ti6O13 hybrid material was greatly enhanced compared with the neat K2Ti6O13 calcined at 300 degrees C. The narrowed band gap energy (E-g) and transfer of photo-excited electron by CQDs inhibited the immediate combination of electron-hole pairs, thus promoting photocatalytic activity. Moreover, CQDs/K2Ti6O13 exhibited a broad spectrum of photocatalytic ability and it was interesting that the photocatalytic activity decreased with the increase of the irradiation wavelength. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching tests suggested the hole (h(+)) and hydroxyl radical (OH) played the primary roles in photocatalytic degradation of AMX. Moreover, CQDs/K2Ti6O13 showed good reusability for AMX photocatalytic degradation after five successive runs. This study proposed an available method for titanate nanomaterials modification, and the developed novel CQDs/K2Ti6O13 hybrid material is promising for potential application on antibiotics removal from water and wastewater.

AB The article presents results regarding the ibuprofen reduction rate at three various temperature values (8, 18 and 28 degrees C) which were conducted using a static test in accordance with the PN-C-04645 'Water and wastewater. Evaluation of partial biodegradation of anionic and non-ionic surface active substances. Initial test' standard. A single study cycle including the analysis of ibuprofen degradation rate in specific temperature variants lasted 24 h. The activated sludge for tests was obtained from the aeration zone of a bioreactor localized in the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant in Poznan City (Poland), which was used for inoculation (1 g/dm(3)) of sterile samples with the medium and ibuprofen (10 mg/dm(3)) after appropriate pre-treatment (intense aeration for 5 h). The analysis procedure included the separation and concentration of analytes from biodegradation samples by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent determination with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC liquid chromatogram (Dionex, USA) with a tandem API 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Biosystem, MDS Sciex, USA). Both literature review as well as the conducted initial studies confirmed that the removal of ibuprofen proceeds more rapidly at higher temperature values. A higher retention rate also enhanced the reduction of ibuprofen concentration. A decrease of its concentration was observed after 24 h, which reached 40 and 50 % for temperature values of 8 and 18 degrees C, accordingly, whereas the highest reduction by approx. 65 % was noted at 28 degrees C.

AB Synthesis and characterization of energy-efficient visible-light-responsive carbon-doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (C-TiO2NP) is reported. The characterization results of C-TiO2NP using BET, TEM, DLS, and XRD indicate the following: (1) the C-TiO2NP have high surface area (77.02 m(2)/g), (2) size range of 5.00-10.00 nm and (3) zeta potential of 19 (pH 4.0), 4 (pH 7.0) and -21 (pH 10.0) while (4) the XRD results shows a peak pattern indicating that C-TiO2NP is mostly in the anatase phase. The photocatalytic properties of C-TiO2NP is investigated in this study using gemifloxacin antibiotic under LED in the visible region (lambda(max) similar to 450 nm). Results shows that C-TiO2NP have significant catalytic properties under LED visible light (up to similar to 74% within 60 min). On the other hand, no degradation is observed for control TiO2NP using LED visible light under equivalent experimental conditions. Using control TiO2NP with H2O2 under LED visible light results in a percentage degradation of similar to 33.0%. Upon using C-TiO2NP with H2O2, the % degradation increases from similar to 33.0 to 64.0%. Although H2O2 generally enhances the activity of bare TiO2NP under UV irradiation, the % degradation under LED in the presence of C-TiO2NP and H2O2 (similar to 64%) is smaller than that in the presence of C-TiO2NP only (similar to 74%). Results demonstrates the applicability of C-TiO2NP as an energy-efficient and cost-effective photocatalyst under LED visible light for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from the aqueous environment is a great environmental concern, mainly due to their diversity, high consumption, and sustainability. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the ability of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified by sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ultrasonic treatment in refining wastewaters contaminated with Atenolol -blocker drug (ATN). The physical and structural characteristics of the raw MWCNTs and modified MWCNTs (M-MWCNTs) were analyzed using SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, and FT-IR techniques. The effects of different parameters, including pH, initial concentration, contact time, and temperature were studied and optimized. Subsequently, the adsorption data were analyzed by several kinetic and equilibrium isotherm equations and modeled by artificial neural network (ANN). Highest ATN removal (87.89%) ((q(e,exp)=46.03mgg(-1))) occurred on the adsorbent activated within 10s of ultrasonication time and NaOCl 30%. Moreover, adsorbent modification significantly improved the ATN removal, so that the removal rate on the raw MWCNTs was about 58%, but in the same conditions, M-MWCNTs removed more than 92% of the adsorbate. The adsorption process reached equilibrium after 90min under the optimized pH of 6. According to ANN modeling, approximately the whole values dispersed around the 45 degrees line, indicating a good compatibility between the trial results and ANN-predicted data. The modification of MWCNTs in proper ultrasonic power via appropriate concentration of NaOCl solution removed many of the impurities and significantly improved the adsorption performance of MWCNTs.

AB The anti-diabetic agent metformin (MF) is one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical compound worldwide. It is not completely metabolized after administration where 52% is excreted in urine. Accordingly, it highly contributes in generating wastewater containing MF. This pollutant is not effectively removed by the conventional wastewater treatment methods. Therefore, an effective advanced treatment technique should be implemented for the removal of MF from wastewater. In this study, silica-alumina (SA) is used as an environmentally-safe and effective adsorbent for removing MF from aqueous solution by adsorption. Adsorption experiments were employed studying the effect of pH, contact time, and MF initial concentration to investigate both the removal efficiency of MF and the interaction mechanism. A set of characterization techniques, such as SEM, BET, FTIR, TPD-MS, and zeta potential were performed before and after adsorption experiments to confirm the role of structural morphology, surface area, porosity, surface acidity and charge in adsorption. The characterization analysis showed that SA has BET surface area of 470 m(2)/g. From the total BET surface area, the microporous surface area was around 31% (147 m(2)/g), while the rest corresponds to the mesoporous surface area (323 m(2)/g). The batch adsorption results showed that high concentrations of MF were efficiently removed from water samples with a maximum uptake of 46 mg/L at optimal pH 9.0 (optimal pH). The mechanism responsible for adsorption was observed to be carried out via an electrostatic interaction between a negatively charged SA and a positively charged MF. TGA/DT analysis was conducted to assess the reusability of the spent SA by thermal regeneration at 673 K. The adsorbent was completely regenerated and maintained a 95% removal after 3 cycles without impacting the surface characteristics.

AB Sub and supercritical water oxidation (Sub- CWO & SCWO) technology has gained attention over the past few years due to near complete conversions at shorter residences times. A pharmaceutical sample containing variety of analgesics, antibiotics, antipyretics, antifungal, beta-blockers and drug intermediates contributing to overall total organic carbon (TOC) of 2017 +/- 49 mg/L was collected from a nearby pharmaceutical industry for this research. The sample was subjected to sub and supercritical water oxidation both in batch and continuous processes. A maximum removal efficiency of 80.1% was achieved with excess oxidant (oxidation coefficient (OC 3)) at 400 degrees C for 60 min residence time in batch reactor. The pharmaceutical sample was also processed in continuous supercritical water reactor by varying both temperature (400-550 degrees C) and oxidant coefficient (0-2) at 23 MPa for 60 s residence time. With the operating temperature of 550 degrees C and OC 2 resulted in maximum removal of the pharmaceutics with efficiency of 97.8%.

AB The degradation of pharmaceuticals and toxicity changes in different aqueous matrixes treated by UV-C and UVC/H2O2 were evaluated. No pH influence (4.0, 6.0 and 7.0) on the degradation of the target compounds was obtained in deionised water for any target compound. Hydrochlorothiazide was the most easily photodegraded followed by naproxen and gemfibrozil. The matrix composition strongly decreased the rates and degradation efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals according to the following sequence: sewage treatment plant effluent > surface water > deionised water. In contrast, the addition of H2O2 improved the rates and degradation efficiencies when compared to the isolated use of UV-C. Better degradation efficiencies in deionised and surface water were obtained using 4 mg L-1 H2O2, and a 16-fold higher concentration of H2O2 (64 mg L-1) was required for sewage treatment plant effluent. Additionally, the sewage treatment plant matrix was the most strongly influenced by the addition of H2O2, which increased the degradation rates of gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen by 7.7-, 2.5- and 4.4-fold, respectively, when compared to UV-C. The acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri increased in the real matrixes due to the formation of toxic transformation products from natural organic matter as confirmed by control experiments using the matrixes in the absence of the target compounds. Overall, UV-C/H2O2 is useful for degrading target compounds in all aqueous matrixes, but an initial treatment step is recommended for the removal of the natural organic matter from real matrixes.

AB Naproxen (NPX), one of the best-selling nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is found in surface and drinking water at concentrations up to 1 mu g dm(-3). It has been emerging as a water contaminant during the last two decades. Conventional removal techniques, i. e. sewage treatment, membrane separation, filtration, and adsorption have been found to be inefficient for complete removal of NPX. Intensification of the wastewater treatment processes is important in order to achieve higher degradation efficiencies. Advanced oxidation processes (i. e. ozonation, photolysis, and photo-Fenton) have the greater capability of NPX removal. In the present study, a combination of ozonated microbubbles and H2O2 was used for effective removal of NPX. The use of microbubbles increased the mass transfer into the aqueous phase. Use of H2O2 with ozone increased the degradation process significantly, which confirms the-the hydroxyl radicals generated in situ under the alkaline conditions. The ozone supply rates were 0.39, 0.41, 0.44, and 0.48 mg s(-1) and the corresponding reaction times were 10000, 2400, 840, and 240 s, respectively for 98-99% conversion for pH 9. The pseudo first-order reaction constants or O-3 alone and H2O2 + O-3 were in the range of 2.89x10(-3)-6.44x10(-3) and 3.39x10(-3) 13.6x10(-3) min(-1), respectively. The effects of ozone supply rate and pH of the reaction system were also studied. The by-products were identified and a mechanism of ozonation of NPX was proposed. The main intermediates were 2-methoxy-6-ethyl naphthalene, (2-methoxy-6-methyl naphthalene, and 1-(6-methoxynaphtalen- 2-yl) ethyl-hydroperoxide.

AB The present study compares the ultraviolet (UV)-based AOPs for the disinfection and the post-treatment of the biologically-treated hospital wastewater (BHW). It was found that the vacuum UV (VUV) photoreactor was much more efficient than the UVC photoreactor in inactivation of E. coli. A 6.4 and 3.7 log E. coli inactivation (from an initial concentration of 1.09 x 10(10 )CFU/mL) was achieved in the VUV and UVC photoreactors, respectively, operated under similar conditions at the neutral pH of water. In the case of continuous-flow operation, the complete inactivation of E. coli was achieved in the VUV photoreactor in hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 min. However, the UVC photoreactor could not attain the same performance even at the longer HRT of 10 min. Adding H2O2 to the VUV photoreactor improved the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) from the BHW. The TOC removal in the recirculated VUV photoreactor improved from 10.8%-61.7% in the reaction time of 10 min at the presence of the optimum H2O2 amount of 3 mM whereas the TOC removal in the UVC/H2O2 operated at the similar conditions was only 13.1%. When operated under flow-through condition, 93.6% of TOC could be removed from the BHW in the VUV/H2O2 process at the HRT of 10 min where the complete bacterial inactivation and detergent removal was also achieved. The electrical energy consumption was 52.9, 12.2, and 6.5 kW h/m(3) in the UVC/H2O2, VUV and VUV/H2O2 processes, respectively, when operated at the HRT of 10 min under identical conditions for TOC removal. The VUV/H2O2 process could also degrade most of the residual substances in the BHW thus efficiently detoxified the BHW to the level sufficient for discharging into the water environment. Accordingly, the VUV/H2O2 process is an efficient, energy-effective, and thus emerging method for the disinfection and the post-treatment of the hospital wastewater.

AB The removal of three over-the-counter pharmaceuticals from aqueous solution using four different adsorbents was analyzed. To study the effect of infused pharmaceutical and adsorbent on the adsorption system, both the concentration of drug and adsorbent dosage were varied, with constant temperature and pressure at different contact time. Adsorption kinetics, isotherm models, and ANOVA allegorized a generic trend for pharmaceutical removal efficiency of the adsorbents that varied as follows: activated carbon>fly ash>bentonite>sugar cane bagasse ash. The Tempkin model appears to fit the isotherm data better than Freundlich and Langmuir. Correspondingly, the kinetic studies implied a pseudo-second-order fit, to understand the mechanism by which the solute accumulates on the surface of a solid and gets adsorbed to the surface via intra-particle diffusion. Furthermore, some special cases of removal tendencies were noted based on sorbate-sorbent interaction. Effectively, it was observed that at an adsorbent loading of 2g and initial concentration of 0.2mmolL(-1), bentonite, fly ash, and activated carbon were able to strip more than 80% of all pharmaceuticals from urine. A framework for the highest significance of the experiments was obtained using response surface methodology by the combination of ciprofloxacin-bentonite followed by paracetamol-activated carbon and ibuprofen-activated carbon. Quasi-Newton and Bayesian regression methods were implemented on Langmuir isotherm by designing the neural network for the batch adsorption experiments. Based on the numerical calculations and graphical representations, the proposed model leads to the result that error is minimized and the values are optimized for different pharmaceuticals such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin that can be removed from wastewater streams by locally available adsorbents.

AB There is a growing interest in the occurrence and sources of pharmaceutical substances in the environment. This paper reports the first detailed transect of pharmaceutical occurrence along the River Thames, UK, from source to sea, undertaken during a period of high flow in 2016. In 37 samples a total of 41 pharmaceuticals and 2 lifestyle compounds (cocaine and sucralose) were detected. Total concentration of pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.0012 mu g/l to 10.24 mu g/l with a median of 2.6 mu g/l. Sucralose concentrations varied from <0.01 to 5.9 mu g/l with a median concentration of 1.93 mu g/l and was detected in every sample except the groundwater-dominated sources of the Thames. Antimicrobials, including those on the surface water watch list (erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin) were detected in every site downstream of the Thames source. Diclofenac, recently on the surface water watch list, was detected in 97% of Thames samples and above the proposed EQS of 0.1 mu g/l in 12 samples. Distinct increases in concentration and number of pharmaceuticals were found downstream of the Oxford, Mogdon and Hogsmill wastewater treatment works (WWTW) but were more subdued downstream of the Crossness and Beckton WWTW due to the tidal nature of the Thames and combined sewer outflows. Sucralose was found to be an excellent tracer of wastewaters (treated and untreated) and can be used as a proxy for many pharmaceuticals. Paracetamol and ibuprofen were tracers of untreated wastewater inputs to the Thames due to their high biodegradation within WWTWs. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Hooghly River (HR) estuary is the first deltaic off-shoot of the perennial and transboundary river, Ganga, India. HR receives industrial and domestic waste along with storm-water run-off from Kolkata city and the adjoining districts. Organic micropollutants (OMPs) have been collectively termed for plasticizers, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are extensively consumed and disposed in the waste streams. Hence emerging OMPs were investigated to obtain the first baseline data from the Hooghly riverine sediment (HRS) along urban and suburban transects using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentration range of OMPs in the HRS varied between 3 and 519 ng/g for carbamazepine, 5-407 ng/g for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2-26 ng/g for musk ketone, 2-84 ng/g for triclosan, 2-199 ng/g for bisphenol A (BPA), 2-422 ng/g for plasticizers (phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA)) and 87-593 ng/g for parabens. Carbamazepine concentration in sediment was an useful marker for untreated wastewater in urban waterways. High concentrations of BPA and PAEs in the suburban industrial corridor together with significant correlation between these two type of OMPs (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.01) likely reflect a common source, possibly associated with the plastic and electronic scrap recycling industries. Among all the categories of OMPs, plasticizers seems to exhibit maximum screening level ecological risk through out the study area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage sludge in the wastewater treatment plants contains considerable amount of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). A few studies have reported that anaerobic digestion (AD) could successfully remove some ARGs from sewage sludge, but information on the fate of ARGs in sludge pretreatment-AD process is still very limited. In this study, three sludge pretreatment methods, including alkaline, thermal hydrolysis and ultrasonic pretreatments, were compared to investigate the distribution and removal of ARGs in the sludge pretreatment-AD process. Results showed that the ARGs removal efficiency of AD itself was approximately 50.77%, and if these three sludge pretreatments were applied, the total ARGs removal efficiency of the whole pretreatment-AD process could be improved up to 52.50%-75.07%. The ultrasonic pretreatment was more efficient than alkaline and thermal hydrolysis pretreatments. Although thermal hydrolysis reduced ARGs obviously, the total ARGs rebounded considerably after inoculation and were only removed slightly in the subsequent AD process. Furthermore, it was found that the total ARGs concentration significantly correlated with the amount of 16S rRNA gene during the pretreatment and AD processes, and the bacteria carrying ARGs could be mainly affiliated with Proteobacteria.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are widely used in home and personal care products as antimicrobial agents. After these products are used, TCS and TCC enter the terrestrial environment and pose a great risk to humans and animals. In this research, the biodegradation of TCS and TCC was investigated during sewage sludge composting with ventilation rates of 108, 92, and 79 m(3)/min. TCS and TCC were mainly biodegraded in the mesophilic and thermophilic phases, and the biodegradation rates improved with an increase in ventilation. After sewage sludge was composted for 16 days with forced ventilation (108 m(3)/min), the concentration of TCS decreased from 497.4 to 214.5 mu g/kg, and the concentration of TCC decreased from 823.2 to 172.7 mu g/kg. The biodegradation rates of TCS and TCC were 65.2% and 83.1%, respectively. However, after the sewage sludge was stacked for 16 days, the biodegradation rates of TCS and TCC were only 17.0% and 18.2%, respectively. The environmental risks of TCS and TCC in the sewage sludge piles significantly decreased after composting. In the sludge pile with a ventilation rate of 108 m(3)/min, the RQ values of TCS and TCC decreased from 8.29 and 20.58 to 3.58 and 4.32 after composting for 16 days, respectively. There is still a high risk if the sludge compost is directly used as a culture substrate. Nevertheless, the environmental risk could be decreased distinctly if a reasonable quantity of sludge compost is applied to land to ensure an RQ of < 1 for TCS and TCC

AB Flurbiprofen is a fluorinated, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical with potential application in a wide range of maladies. Currently, there is no information regarding its environmental fate. To address this, flurbiprofen is spiked at 500 and 50 ppm into activated sewage sludge taken from the municipal treatment plant of Ankara, Turkey. Flurbiprofen is partially degraded after 80 days, with removal proportion varying from 33% to 48%. Isolation of organisms able to use flurbiprofen as a sole carbon and energy source is unsuccessful. A transient, acid-labile yellow coloration appears in supernatants after addition of flurbiprofen. During disappearance, a novel potential metabolite is detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, a chemical that does not appear in killed controls or in nonflurbiprofen-amended controls. Mass spectra of the novel chemical obtained at low and high collision energies are consistent with 4-(1-carboxyethyl)-2-fluorobenzoic acid, suggesting the application of a canonical metabolic paradigm for halogenated biphenyl metabolism by bacteria in which the nonhalogenated ring is metabolized by dioxygenation and metacleavage, leaving the halogenated aromatic ring behind. This metabolite shows no signs of disappearance after the 80-day monitoring period, implying that the environmental release of flurbiprofen might be of concern.

AB The presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue. The problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle. The removal of these contaminants, so that the water may be reused, is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment. Within this context, the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin, and penicillin G). The chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes, which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), carrying out sampling in the feed, reject and permeate streams over a period of 72 h. DOW-FILMTEC BW30-2540 membranes were used for this purpose, operating at a pressure of 15 bar. The emerging contaminants were analysed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The applied treatments allowed a contaminant-free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse. This technique achieved 100% removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72 h test.

AB The presence of pesticides in municipal wastewater and aquatic environments is showing an increasing trend and leading to adverse environmental and health effects. The present study investigated the occurrence of pyrethroids in the municipal wastewater of Tabriz, a city in northwestern Iran. The performance of a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of pyrethroids was also investigated. For this purpose, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant in summer and fall seasons were measured. The toxicity of target pesticides on rainbow trout and Daphnia Magna was also investigated by a new modified index of environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants. The results show that permethrin was the dominant pesticide in the samples in both seasons with the highest detected concentration in the influent wastewater of 1838 ng/L. Furthermore, cypermethrin was among the highly-detected pesticides with concentration as high as 1742 ng/L. It was also found that 77% and 85% of permethrin, as the dominant pesticide, was removed in summer and fall seasons, respectively. Investigation of the risk of pesticides presence in the effluent presents a very high risk to the aquatic environment which was obtained by calculating the proposed index. Although there is a high removal efficiency of pesticides in wastewater treatment plant, higher toxicity and detection frequency of permethrin in the collected samples is the main reason of high risk to the aquatic environment.

AB As a result of the widespread use of antibiotics, a large amount of excretions from human and animals, containing antibiotic residues, is discharged into aquatic environments, leading to potential adverse effects on the ecosystems' health. These residues' impact on seasonally ice-covered rivers remains under investigated. To understand the environmental fate of antibiotics with high-detection frequencies and concentration levels, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, and florfenicol were used as models in the present study. A Level IV fugacity model was established and applied to a seasonally ice-covered river receiving municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, the Songhua River in Northeast China. Model validation and sensitivity analysis suggested that the fugacity model could successfully simulate the monitoring concentration within an average difference of one logarithmic unit. The advection process played a major role in the transport and attenuation of the antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. The scenario simulation indicated that increasing the targeted antibiotic concentrations in WWTP effluents to gL(-1) could keep the targeted antibiotic concentrations higher than 10ngL(-1) in the receiving river from the WWTP discharge source to 25km downstream. This finding also demonstrates that the depth of water and ice, as well as flow velocity, play key roles in the fate of antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. To our best knowledge, this is the first major study to combine experimental investigation with modeling to explore the environmental behaviors and fate of antibiotics in such a river.

AB The pharmaceuticals acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine, and herbicide atrazine are among the most highly manufactured compounds in the world and are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Much uncertainty exists regarding the impacts of the pharmaceuticals on non-target aquatic resources, while more is known about atrazine. Reduction of residues of each chemical in surface water will reduce the exposures that organisms experience in the surface water environment, thus reducing unknown risks. This project evaluated the potential use of two aquatic plant species (Acorus gramineus and Canna hybrida Orange Punch') for reducing concentrations of the chemicals in water. Concentrations of each contaminant in solution were reduced in the presence of the plants after 14days of exposure, in (acetaminophen 64-100%, atrazine 32-51%, carbamazepine 26-49%, sulfamethoxazole 41-60%). Results indicate that these plants have potential for reducing concentrations of these chemicals in surface water, but that plant- and chemical-specific properties prevent making generalizations regarding the extent and pathways for dissipation.

AB Averaged 7-day composite effluent wastewater samples from twelve wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in nine countries (Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Czechia, Austria, Germany) in the Danube River Basin were collected. WWTPs' selection was based on countries' dominant technology and a number of served population with the aim to get a representative holistic view of the pollution status. Samples were analyzed for 2248 chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) by wide-scope target screening employing LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. 280 compounds were detected at least in one sample and quantified. Spatial differences in the concentrations and distribution of the compounds classes were discussed. Additionally, samples were analyzed for the possible agonistic/antagonistic potencies using a panel of in vitro transactivation reporter gene CALUX (R) bioassays including ER alpha (estrogenics), anti-AR (anti-androgens), GR (glucocorticoids), anti-PR (anti-progestins), PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferators) and PAH assays. The potency of the wastewater samples to cause oxidative stress and induce xenobiotic metabolism was determined using the Nrf2 and PXR CALUX (R) bioassays, respectively. The signals from each of the bioassays were compared with the recently developed effect-based trigger values (EBTs) and thus allowed for allocating the wastewater effluents into four categories based on their measured toxicity, proposing a putative action plan for wastewater operators. Moreover, samples were analyzed for antibiotics and 13 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile genetic element (intl1) with the aim to assess the potential for antibiotic resistance. All data collected from these various types of analysis were stored in an on-line database and can be viewed via interactive map at https://norman-data.eu/EWW_DANUBE.

AB Chiral pharmaceutically active compounds (cPACs) are not currently governed by environmental regulation yet are expected to be in the future. As cPACs can exert stereospecific toxicity in the aquatic environment, it is essential to better understand their stereoselective behaviour here. Therefore, this study aims to provide a new perspective towards comprehensive evaluation of cPACs at a river catchment level, including their stereochemistry as a chemical phenomenon driving fate of chiral molecules in the environment. A large spatial and temporal monitoring program was performed in Southwest England. It included 5 sewage treatment works and the receiving waters of the largest river catchment in Southwest England. Simultaneously, lab-scale microcosm studies in simulated activated sludge bioreactors and river water microcosm were performed to evaluate stereoselective degradation of cPACs. A multi-residue enantioselective method allowed the analysis of a total of 18 pairs of enantiomers and 3 single enantiomers in wastewater and river water samples.
   Our monitoring program revealed: (1) spatial and temporal variations of cPACs in influent wastewaters resulting from different patterns of usage as well as an (2) enantiomeric enrichment of cPACs, likely due to human metabolism, despite their commercialization as racemic mixtures. A similar chiral signature was observed in effluent and receiving waters. Stereoselective degradation was observed in trickling filters (TF) for naproxen, ketoprofen, cetirizine and 10,11-dihydroxy-10-hydroxycarbamazepine, in sequencing batch reactors (SBR) for ifosfamide and in activated sludge (AS) for cetirizine. The extent of enantiomer-specific fate was wastewater treatment dependent in the case of naproxen (TF showed higher stereoselectivity than AS and SBR) and cetirizine (TF and AS showed higher stereoselectivity than SBR) due to differing microbial population. Furthermore, stereoselective degradation of naproxen was highly variable among STWs using similar treatments (TF) and operating in the same region. Microbial stereoselective degradation was also confirmed by both activated and river water simulated microcosm for chloramphenicol, ketoprofen, indoprofen, naproxen and 10,11-dihydroxy-10-hydroxycarbamazepine. Results from our large scale river catchment monitoring study and lab simulated microcosm show wide-ranging implications of enantiomerism of cPACs on environmental risk assessment (ERA). As two enantiomers of the same compound show different biological effects (e.g. toxicity), their non-racemic presence in the environment might lead to inaccurate ERA. This is because current ERA approaches do not require analysis at enantiomeric level.

AB The use of phosphate rock (PR), porcelanite (PC) and granite (GR) as natural locally abundant adsorbents compared with adsorption by granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing pharmaceuticals including sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfapyridine (SP) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from simulated wastewater was examined. The removal efficiency of the three pharmaceuticals was found to follow the consequences as: PC?GAC?PR?GR. The uptake efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was 91.51, 86.69, 69.51 and 53.97% onto PC, GAC, PR and GR, respectively, at initial concentration, pH, dosage and temperature of 50mg/L, 4, 0.5g/100mL and 30 degrees C, respectively. The removal efficiency of sulfapyridine was 84.71, 81.97, 63.25 and 49.71%, respectively. However, for carbamazepine it was 80.46, 79.61, 54.10 and 43.44%, respectively. Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) was carried out for PC before and after adsorption to determine the type of functional groups. Carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of PC were the major groups responsible for adsorption process. The effect of pH (5, 7 and 9), agitation speed (50-300rpm), dosage (0.1-1.4g/100mL), contact time (30-360min), temperature (10-60 degrees C) and initial concentration (25-100mg/L) are studied to find out the optimum conditions for removing the selected pharmaceuticals using PC. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic models had been used to fit the experimental data. From which Langmuir and pseudo-second order models were found to be more represented to the experiments with high correlation coefficient for the three pharmaceuticals. Article HighlightsThe demand for pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has nearly paralleled the escalating population.The prolonged use of PPCPs has led to evident emergence in the environment, creating the potential for adverse consequences to ecosystems and human health.Current water and wastewater treatment processes, such as advanced oxidation, photolysis, and adsorption have shown some success in the removal of SMX, SP, and CBZ.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are polluting the surface water environments worldwide. Sewage and wastewater treatment, therefore, needs to be improved in order to remove pharmaceutical residues from the effluent. One such treatment improvement is effluent ozonation. Even though ozonation has proven to be very efficient in reducing pharmaceutical parent compound concentrations in wastewater effluents, much remains unclear regarding potentially toxic ozonation by-product (OBP) formation. In this study, we sought to elucidate the aquatic toxicity of ozonated pharmaceuticals in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in a static 144 h post fertilization (hpf) fish embryotoxicity (ZFET) assay. Three pharmaceuticals commonly detected in wastewater effluents, i.e. carbamazepine, diclofenac, and oxazepam, were selected for testing. Toxicity was assessed before and after 1 min ozonation (0.053 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration) and 10 min ozonation (0.147 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration). Chemical analysis showed that carbamazepine and diclofenac were largely removed by ozone (90 +/- 11% and 97 +/- 3.8%), whereas oxazepam was removed to a lesser extent (19 +/- 5.7%). The ZFET assay revealed diverging toxicities. Diclofenac embryotoxicity decreased with increasing ozonation. Oxazepam did not cause embryotoxicity in the ZFET assay either pre- or post ozonation, but larvae swimming activity was affected at 144 hpf. Carbamazepine embryotoxicity, on the other hand, increased with increasing ozonation. Chemical analysis showed the formation of two OBPs (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide and 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine), possibly explaining the increased embryotoxicity. The results of this study highlight the importance of new chemical and toxicological knowledge regarding the formation of OBPs in post-ozonated effluents. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB In this study, a total of 52 pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in the receiving waters were quantified with an analytical method using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry. 36 out of the 52 pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent and effluent of the STPs at quantifiable levels; influent and effluent concentrations ranged 1 ng L-1 to 30 mu g L-1 and 3 ng (L-1) to 3 mu g L-1, respectively. They were also detected from the receiving waters (both tributaries and main river); their concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng L-1. A simple mass balance model was applied for the pharmaceutical data measured for the STPs, tributaries, and the main river to demonstrate the contribution of the STP5 to the pollution of the streams and the main river. The average ratio of the model estimations and the measured concentrations was calculated 97% for the downstream of the STPs, while that for the main river was 89%. This modeling result clearly demonstrates that many pharmaceuticals flowing into an STP are not degraded and discharged to a nearby river, affecting the whole water body, and that the SIP is the only source of the pollutants. While their discharge into STPs should be avoided. In addition, development of new technologies capable of completely degrading them is desirable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tetracycline (TC), a major pollutant in water, has an adverse effect on ecosystem and human health. Thus, it is urgent to remove but still remains a challenging. In this work, a new adsorbent of MnO2 decorated on sodium hypochlorite treated expanded graphite (MnO2/TEG) was developed by an in situ hydrothermal method, which exhibited a highly removal rate of 99.2% to pharmaceutical wastewater treated by flocculation. The structure and morphology of the adsorbent was studied by detailed physical characterization. Meanwhile, the main influencing factors on the adsorption behavior such as pH value, concentration, temperature of the solution, adsorption time, metal oxide species and MnO2 loading amount were also investigated in detail. It was found that the electrostatic adsorption between Mn4+ in MnO2/TEG and dimethylamino groups in TC molecules played an important role during the adsorption process. These excellent properties proved that the novel composite could be applied to remove TC residues in pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the ability and efficiency of biological treatment to decontaminate pharmaceutical wastewater using indigenous and/or exogenous bacteria. One indigenous bacterium isolated from final effluent of the pharmaceuticals processing wastewater and five exogenous bacteria were molecularly identified and used as individual or mixed free-living cultures in a batch mode remediation process. Raw pharmaceutical effluents had high levels of all the tested parameters makes it one of the strongest industrial effluents. Treatment of pharmaceutical effluent for 6 d was time and bacterial species-dependent. Pseudomonas fluorescens (PF) was the most efficient in removing all the tested parameters except NO3 which increased due to oxidation of NH3 while Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (S1) and Bacillus cereus (L1) characterized by the lowest efficiency for contaminants removal. There was a general trend of increasing the removal efficiency (RE) of all parameters by all the tested bacteria with increasing the exposure time. However, bulk changes in all parameters were achieved within the first 24 h. The highest removals recorded were 94.63%, 79.44%, 75.07%, 81.03%, 90%, 93.75%, 55.2%, 94.29%, and 15.6% for total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, fat, oil and grease (FOG), nitrate (NO3), ammonia (NH3), phenol, and total viable count of bacteria (TVC), respectively. Despite the highly efficient removals achieved for the tested parameters, their residual levels of all the parameters still above the maximum permissible limits for the safe discharge except FOG. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use the most promising bacteria in a fixed form to bring the effluent to the safe limits for the environment.

AB Many rivers in urbanised catchments in South Africa are polluted by raw sewage and effluent to an extent that their ecological function has been severely impaired. The Hennops and Jukskei Rivers lying in the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment are two of the worst impacted rivers in South Africa and are in need of rehabilitation. Passive sampling (Chemcatcher (R) with a HLB receiving phase) together with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry-targeted screening was used to provide high sensitivity and selectivity for the identification of a wide range of emerging pollutants in these urban waters. Over 200 compounds, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, drugs of abuse and their metabolites were identified. Many substances (similar to 180) being detected for the first time in surface water in South Africa. General medicines and psychotropic drugs were the two most frequently detected groups in the catchment. These accounted for 49% of the emerging pollutants found. Of the general medicines, antihypertensive agents, beta-blocking and cardiac drugs were the most abundant (28%) classes detected. The Hennops site, downstream of a dysfunctional wastewater treatment plant, was the most polluted with 123 substances detected. From the compounds detected, peak intensity-based prioritisation was used to identify the five most abundant pollutants, being in the order caffeine > lopinavir > sulfamethoxazole > cotinine > trimethoprim. This work provides the largest available high-quality dataset of emerging pollutants detected in South African urban waters. The data generated in this study provides a solid foundation for subsequent work to further characterise (suspect screening) and quantify (target analysis) these substances.

AB BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that the pharmaceuticals detected in the influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can cause endocrine disruption and bacterial resistance on different species, in an aquatic environment. Metformin (antidiabetic drug) and ciprofloxacin (antibiotic quinolones) are compounds found at higher concentrations than many other pharmaceuticals, and thus have a disproportionately large environmental impact. This study is focused on the assessment of an aerated biofilter packed with Ficus benjamina wood chips for the simultaneous removal of metformin, ciprofloxacin, organic matter expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) during domestic wastewater treatment, under different superficial hydraulic loading. RESULTS The maximum removals of metformin, ciprofloxacin, COD and NH3-N from the wastewater treated in an aerated biofilter were 94, 81, 91 and 38%, respectively, by applying a superficial hydraulic loading of 0.18 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) [hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 h]. The adsorption capacity of F. benjamina wood chips on the metformin and ciprofloxacin was 0.1 and 2.03 mu g g(support material)(-1), respectively. CONCLUSION The maximum removal rates for metformin, ciprofloxacin, COD and NH3-N were obtained when the aerated biofilter was operated at HRT = 7 h. The F. benjamina wood chips showed sorption properties of pharmaceuticals. According to a scanning electron microscopy image, the F. benjamina wood chips showed available pores in their entire surface, thus indicating that this organic support medium has a high potential for carrying out the sorption processes. Likewise, the surface of the wood chips showed the development of a homogeneous biofilm. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB BACKGROUND In this study, a naturally magnetic semiconductor mineral (NM-SCM) was used as a highly active, easily separable and green catalyst to activate persulfate (SPS) for the degradation of methylparaben (MeP) in aqueous solution by a heterogeneous catalyst system (SPS/NM-SCM). NM-SCM properties were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses. The effects of contributing factors such as solution pH, NM-SCM loading, SPS dosage and initial MeP concentration on MeP degradation were analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken design (BBD). RESULTS The RSM model obtained from the present study (R-2 > 0.99) showed a suitable correlation between the predicted values and experimental results of MeP degradation. Under optimized conditions (pH 6.5, SPS 5 mmol L-1, NM-SCM 0.3 g L-1 and MeP 10 mu mol L-1), a removal efficiency of 99.5% and a mineralization degree of 37% were achieved. The removal efficiency of MeP was reduced in the presence of inorganic ions as follows: chloride > nitrate > carbonate > phosphate. After five successive catalyst reuses, the degradation efficiency was >90%, indicating the excellent potential reusability of NM-SCM catalyst. CONCLUSION Owing to the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species (SO4 center dot-) and easy separation of the catalyst, the integration of NM-SCM and SPS has great potential for the degradation of MeP from water and wastewater matrices.

AB Solids retention time (SRT) is one of the most important factors in designing and operating activated sludge systems for biological wastewater treatment. Longer SRTs have been shown to alter the structure and function of microbial communities, thereby leading to improved treatment efficacy with respect to bulk and trace organics, nutrient removal, and membrane fouling. Research has also shown that longer SRTs and/or higher influent antibiotic concentrations may lead to increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance. However, it is unclear whether elevated, yet subclinical, concentrations of antibiotics also impact the overall microbial community. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in microbial community structure in a laboratory-scale activated sludge system as a function of SRT (2-20 days) and influent concentrations (1x-100x ambient) of ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Changes in microbial community structure were evaluated based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial community function was evaluated based on changes in effluent water quality, including attenuation of bulk and trace organics. The results confirmed that longer SRTs-but not antibiotic loadings-had a significant impact on microbial community structure and effluent water quality. Therefore, moderate spikes in influent antibiotic concentrations are not expected to adversely impact biological wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Water Environment Federation

AB Very recently, several studies have found that homogeneous reducing agents (e.g., sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3)) can activate ferrate to enhance the degradation of selected contaminants. In this work, it was found that heterogeneous carbon nanotube (CNT) could accelerate ferrate (Fe(VI)) for the degradation of bromophenols (BrPs) of environmental concerns and alleviate the appearance of undesired by-products in effluent. Fe(V1) could react with BrPs over a wide pH range of 6 10 with apparent second -order rate constants of 1.8-1850 M-1 s(-1). Electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-QqQMS) analysis showed that dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls and dibrominated phenoxyphenols were possibly formed via coupling reaction of BrPs radicals generated from Fe(VI) oxidation through one-electron transfer. The presence of CNT could remarkably accelerate the degradation rates of BrPs by Fe(VI) in a wide pH range from 7 to 10. Moreover, the formed undesired polybrominated products during Fe(VI)/CNT oxidation were absorbed on CNT surface and thus removed from treated water. The Fe(VI)/CNT system was capable of selectively oxidizing electron-rich pollutants (e.g., BrPs, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)), but reluctant to iopamidol (IPM) and nitrobenzene (NB). High-valent metal-oxo intermediates Fe(V)/Fe(IV) formed in situ from the reaction of CNT with Fe(VI) were likely responsible for this activation effect of CNT, which was further confirmed via using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe compound. Comparatively, homogeneous reducing agent Na2S2O3 could enhance Fe(VI) degradation of BrPs at pH 7 and 8, while undesired polybrominated products were detected in effluent from Fe(VI)/Na2S2O3 system. These findings have crucial implications for the development of a promising oxidation process by combination of Fe(VI) and CNT for water and wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal, especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics. In this study, an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol (CAP) wastewater treatment was developed. The system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages. With the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 V, the CAP removal efficiencies increased from 53.3% to 89.7%, while the methane production increased more than three times. The microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria, both of which enhanced CAP removal and methane production. The improved CAP removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination-related bacteria (Acidovorax, Sedimentibacter, Thauera, and Flavobacterium) and potential electroactive bacteria (Shewanella and Comamonas), both of which carried ARGs and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of CAP. The enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative-related bacteria (Paludibacter, Proteiniclasticum, and Macellibacteroides) in the anaerobic bioreactor. The increased abundances of methanogenic genes (mcrA and ACAS genes) under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system. The fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present study shows the results of solar photo-Fenton oxidation of paracetamol (PCT) and amoxicillin (AMX). Fe-2(SO4)(3) was used as the source of iron and EDDS as the iron complexing agent, employing different doses of hydrogen peroxide. Two aqueous matrices, a synthetic wastewater and real wastewater from El Ejido WWTP effluent (Almeria) were used. In all cases, the process was operated under conditions of natural sunlight.
   Results showed that the degradation of both drugs is favoured when the aqueous matrix presents low concentration of carbonates. Under the conditions studied here, degradation percentages above 90% were obtained in the synthetic wastewater and 80% in the actual effluent. The degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight analyser. The intermediates detected throughout the oxidative process for both micro-contaminants were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions.
   The toxicity of the samples was determined using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. In the acute toxicity test, it was observed that the bacteria did not undergo inhibition in any of the cases. However, chronic toxicity studies showed that the higher the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) employed in the assays, the higher the bacterial inhibition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of dispersed catalysts in aqueous medium inside reactors in advanced oxidative processes is common among researchers. However, due to the difficult separation of these species after treatment, in many cases, the treatment process is unfeasible. In this context, the main target of the work was the evaluation of degradation of the phenolic solution by ozonation titanium dioxide (TiO2/P25), supported on zeolite spheres. The process was investigated through the response surface methodology (RSM) and optimized by the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm. The effects of various operating parameters including pH, power ozone (O-3) generation, flow rate, and treatment time were investigated, using as a response to removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). It was made in optimum conditions the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand to check the increasing biodegradability, aiming ozonation as preliminary treatment, with the possibility of subsequent biological treatments. There was an increase in this ratio from 0.17 to 0.50 in 48min, which would facilitate the use of the subsequent biological process. The proposed model showed good fit to the experimental data with R-2 andR(adj)(2) correlation coefficients of 0.9964 and 0.9932, respectively.

AB As a new pollutant, antibiotics in the environment and their removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have gained considerable attention. However, few studies investigated antibiotics in the north-eastern areas of China. By employing high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the concentration distribution and removal of 12 antibiotics belonging to four types (cephalosporins, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides) were investigated in influents and effluents as well as the removal efficiencies of four typical treatment processes in 18 wastewater treatment plants of Harbin City, north-eastern China. Macrolides and fluoroquinolones presented relatively higher detection concentrations and rates both in the water and in the sludge phases. Sulfonamides and cephalosporins displayed higher detection concentrations in the water phase. The representative antibiotics in influents and effluents included ROX, NOR, OFL, SMX, AZI, and CLA, with detection rates above 95%. The detection rates of the other six antibiotics exceeded 30%. In the sludge, the other five antibiotics, except SMX, presented relatively higher detection concentrations and rates, with detection rates greater than 95%. For cephalosporin, the detection rates of CTX and CFM in the sludge were 0. The removal efficiencies for the 12 antibiotics differed greatly, with average values ranging from 30% to 80% and the highest values for cephalosporin. The removal of antibiotics did not differ significantly among the four different treatment processes. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019

AB Herein, a method for the simultaneous determination of the currently prescribed sartan drugs (eprosartan, EPR; olmesartan, OLM; losartan, LOS; candesartan, CAN; telmisartan, TEL; irbesartan, IRB; and valsartan, VAL), and the biodegradation product valsartan acid (VALA), in water samples (raw and treated wastewater, river and tap water) was developed. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed as concentration and determination techniques, respectively. Different sorbents and elution solvents were tested for sample preparation. Under optimized conditions, samples at neutral pH (6-8 units) were concentrated using mixed-mode (reversed-phase and anionic exchange) cartridges. Thereafter, the sorbent was washed with 5 mL of a methanol: water (1:1) solution, dried under a nitrogen stream and compounds were eluted with 2 mL of methanol: NH3 (98:2). The accuracy of the method (accounting for SPE efficiency and matrix effects during electrospray ionization) was investigated using solvent-based calibration standards. Global recoveries, obtained for different water matrices (tap, river, treated and raw wastewater), ranged from 82% to 134%, with standard deviations between 2 and 18%. LOQs varied from 2 to 50 ng L-1. Analysis of un-spiked samples confirmed: (1) the incomplete removal of sartans at sewage treatment plants (STPs), (2) the formation of VALA during municipal water treatment, and (3) the presence of VALA in the processed tap water samples. Additional findings of the current study are the detection of hydroxylated derivatives of the sartan drugs IRB and LOS in wastewater, and the E-Z isomerization of EPR in environmental water samples.

AB In this study, biochar was produced from three differently treated sewage sludge biomasses, in three pyrolytic temperatures, 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C, under continuous N-2 supply. The produced samples were physicochemically characterized and their initial metal concentration, along with metal leaching potential, were investigated. Moreover, the application of the biochar samples as adsorbents for the removal of seven emerging organic micro-pollutants from table water and treated wastewater matrices was investigated. The results showed that even though the biochar samples were not especially enriched in terms of physicochemical characterization, they were effective as adsorptive materials in the respective experiments. Pollutant removal was in the range of 67-99% for the table water experiments, while the removal for the wastewater experiments was 35-97%. The results of this study indicate that sewage sludge biochar has the potential to be an effective, low-cost adsorbent, providing, at the same time, a viable and environmentally friendly solution concerning the difficult task of sludge management.

AB Freshwater bivalve populations are stressed by watershed development at the global scale. Though pharmaceuticals released from wastewater treatment plant effluent discharges are increasingly reported to bioaccumulate in fish, an understanding of bioaccumulation in bivalves is less defined. In the present study, we examined accumulation of 12 target pharmaceuticals in C. fluminea during a 42 day in situ study in Pecan Creek, an effluent dependent wadeable stream in north central Texas, USA. Caged clams were placed at increasing distances (5 m, 643 m, 1762 m) downstream from a municipal effluent discharge and then subsampled on study days 7,14, 28 and 42. Acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, desmethylsertraline, and methylphenidate were identified in C. fluminea whole body tissue homogenates via isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Tissue concentrations ranged from low mu g/kg (methylphenidate) to 341 mu g/kg (sertraline). By study day 7, rapid and apparent pseudo-steady state accumulation of study compounds was observed in clams; this observation continued throughout the 42 d study. Notably, elevated bioaccumulation factors (L/kg) for sertraline were observed between 3361 and 6845, which highlights the importance of developing predictive bioaccumulation models for ionizable contaminants with bivalves. Future research is also necessary to understand different routes of exposure and elimination kinetics for pharmaceutical accumulation in bivalves. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
