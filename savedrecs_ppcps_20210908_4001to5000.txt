AB Micro-filtered, biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSE) generally has high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) concentrations. Therefore it cannot be directly used for irrigating sensitive crops. A study was conducted on a micro-filtered BTSE from a Sydney water treatment plant to determine whether the BTSE can be treated using nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) to bring these risk parameters within safety limits. The study showed that using NF and RO alone could not produce the required ratio of SAR. Furthermore, NF alone did not remove the necessary levels of Na and Cl ions while RO did. However, blending equal proportions of NF permeate and RO permeate obtained from a two stages hybrid treatment system consisting of NF followed by RO resulted in a product quality suitable for irrigation in terms of the above mentioned risk factors. Utilizing NF prior to RO reduced the RO membrane fouling as well. Both NF and RD removed most of the pharmaceutical and personal care products from the feed water and this may subsequently protect soil and ground water from potential hazards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In an engineering context the precautionary principle is often perceived as an excuse to do nothing or a substantial barrier to technical progress. The precautionary principle requires that remedial measures be taken in situations of scientific uncertainty where evidence of harm cannot be proven but potential damage to human or environmental health is significant. In this paper the scope of the precautionary principle in water recycling is discussed. It is clear that uncertainties and risks exist in many areas of water recycling. These risks are closely linked to the risks of sewage discharge. Hence, water recycling has two main areas of concern: (1) the dilemma that minimising potential environmental harm by reducing effluent discharge may increase potential harm through reducing the water flow in receiving waters and (2) the consequences of using recycled water of varying quality for a number of applications. The precautionary principle can be regarded as an opportunity to improve water recycling practice and in fact increase the scope of ecologically sustainable water recycling. The precautionary principle has an important role to play as a guide in decision making and in dealing with the vast number of risks and uncertainties in water recycling.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the sea area surrounding a densely populated tourist city in southeastern China were investigated. In total, 32 PPCP pollutants classified into 23 categories were detected. Different spatial distribution patterns of PPCPs indicated possible contamination from runoff and multiple local sources. The labile-to-conservative ratios of PPCPs showed the influence of untreated domestic sewage. In addition, increased concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and erythromycin around aquaculture farms imply that aquaculture cannot be neglected as a source. The concentrations of oxytetracycline, ranitidine, ciprofloxacin, miconazole, and sulfamethizole were higher in the wet season than those in the dry season, and the difference in pharmaceutical consumption was suspected to be the main driving factor of this seasonal variation. The risk quotients calculated with the maximum concentrations of miconazole, triclosan, dehydronifedipine, and triclocarban exceeded 0.1, indicating potential moderate or high risks. Antibacterial agents in daily chemicals and azole broad-spectrum antifungals were associated with the highest risks in this study; this might be another significant pollution characteristic in the sea area around this subtropical tourist city.

AB Recently scientific community has turned its attention to the organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and hormones, because the ecotoxicological effects of chronic exposure are uncertain. These substances are neither completely degraded nor monitored in sewage treatment, which makes the aquatic environment the main disseminant, due to the usual discharge of domestic and industrial sewage. Therefore, the current work aims to develop quantitative method using HPLC-UV-DAD-FLD detection in order to determine the psychoactive drugs fluoxetine and haloperidol, potential environmental contaminants in surface water. The solid phase extraction was performed to preconcentrate of the analytes of interest in aqueous matrices, in which it was evaluated univariate for reconstitution volume and pH, and via factorial planning 2(3) for the other variables. The best conditions were obtained by conditioning with 5 mL of acetonitrile and 5 mL of water pH 4.0, 100 mL of sample (pH 4.0), eluting with 5 mL of acetonitrile and reconstitution with 1 mL of water. The recovery rate was 73.7% and 87.2% for haloperidol and fluoxetine, respectively. The method was developed in real samples fortified with standards and real samples from three different points of the Belem river in Curitiba-PR.

AB Some pharmaceuticals such as antineoplastics are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and fetotoxic. Antineoplastics and their metabolites are excreted by patients into waste water. In laboratory testing the frequently used isomeric anti-tumour agents cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) were shown to be not biodegradable. They are not eliminated in municipal sewage treatment plants and therefore detected in their effluents. Structural related compounds are beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramidmustard (beta-D-Glc-IPM; INN = glufosfamide) and beta-L-glucosylisophosphoramidmustard (beta-L-Glc-IPM). beta-L-Glc-IPM has no antineoplastic effects whereas beta-D-Glc-IPM is active against tumours. In contrast to IF and CP and almost all other investigated antineoplastics beta-D-Glc-IPM is inherently biodegradable, Improved biodegradability of beta-D-Glc-IPM compared to IF shows that reducing the impact of pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment is feasible by changing the chemical structure of a given compound exerting a similar mode of action and therapeutic activity. Stereochemistry may be crucial for pharmaceutical activity of the compounds as well as for its biodegradability in the environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acetyl Sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) and acetaminophen (ACM) can be found in municipal sewage sludge, and their content and availability may be influenced by sludge treatments, such as drying and liming. A sludge similarly centrifuged with/without a flocculant was spiked with It-labelled AC-SMX or ACM. Then, it was either limed (20% CaO) or/and dried under different laboratory conditions (1 week at ambient temperature; and 48 h at 40 or 80 degrees C). The total amount and distribution of the C-14-compounds among several chemical fractions, based on the sludge floc definition, were assessed at the end of the treatments.
   All the C-14-activity brought initially was recovered in the limed and/or dried sludges for AC-SMX but only between 44.4 and 84.9% for ACM, with the highest rate obtained for the limed sludge. Drying at 80 degrees C or liming increased the percentage of the sludge total organic carbon recovered in the extracts containing soluble extracellular polymeric substances (S-EPS) and the percentage of the total C-14-activity extracted simultaneously. The non-extractable residues represented only 3.9-11.6% of the total C-14-activity measured in the treated sludges for AC-SMX and 16.9-21.8% for ACM.
   The presence of AC-SMX and ACM residues in the treated sludges, after liming and drying under different conditions, was shown using some C-14-labelled molecules. At this time scale and according to the extraction method selected, most of the C-14-residues remained soluble and easily extractable for both compounds. This result implies that certain precautions should be taken when storing sludges before being spread on the field. Sludge piles, particularly the limed sludge, should be protected from rain to limit the production of lixiviates, which may contain residues of AC-SMX and ACM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A primary pathway for emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroids, and hormones) to enter aquatic ecosystems is effluent from sewage treatment plants (STP), and identifying technologies to minimize the amount of these contaminants released is important. Quantifying the flux of these contaminants through STPs is difficult. This study evaluates the behavior of gadolinium, a rare earth element (REE) utilized as a contrasting agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), through four full-scale metropolitan STPs that utilize several biosolids thickening, conditioning, stabilization, and dewatering processing technologies. The organically complexed Gd from MRIs has been shown to be stable in aquatic systems and has the potential to be utilized as a conservative tracer in STP operations to compare to an emerging contaminant of interest Influent and effluent waters display large enrichments in Gd compared to other REEs. In contrast, most sludge samples from the STPs do not display Gd enrichments, including primary sludges and end-product sludges. The excess Gd appears to remain in the liquid phase throughout the SIP operations, but detailed quantification of the input Gd load and residence times of various SIP operations is needed to utilize Gd as a conservative tracer.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are consumed in large amounts as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs worldwide. Based on what has been learnt from studies of other human pharmaceuticals, they are likely to be present in the aquatic environment. However, to date, information on the environmental concentrations of GCs is very limited. The situation is complicated by the fact that a considerable number of GCs are in everyday use in most developed countries. Hence, obtaining a full picture of GC concentrations in the aquatic environment using the traditional analytical chemistry approach would be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we took a modelling approach to predict the total environmental concentration of all synthetic GCs (consisting of 28 individual GCs) in the River Thames, as a first step in risk assessment of these drugs. Using reliable data on consumption, the LF2000-WQX model predicts mean concentrations up to 30 ng/L of total GCs in surface water as a best case scenario when the lowest excretion and highest removal rates in sewage treatment works were used, whereas mean concentrations up to 850 ng/L were predicted when the highest excretion and lowest removal rates are considered. We also present the 10th and 90th percentile concentrations (which indicate the likely range of concentrations seen from high flow to low flow conditions in the river) of the highest and lowest consumed GCs, to show the spatial and temporal variations of the concentrations of individual GCs, These data probably provide reliable estimates of the likely range of concentrations of GCs in a typical river impacted by effluent from many sewage treatment plants. Results also identify the hot spots where field studies on fish could be focused. To determine if aquatic organisms face any threat from GCs, laboratory toxicity studies should be conducted using concentrations similar to those reported here. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Greece was used as case study and the environmental risk associated with the existence of 99 emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in sludge-amended soil was estimated using risk quotient (RQ) approach. Data on the concentration levels of EOCs in sewage sludge was collected after literature review. Chemical analyses were also conducted for 50 pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in sludge samples from Athens Sewage Treatment Plant. Risk assessment was based on both terrestrial and aquatic acute toxicity data, using both the maximum and the average measured concentrations of the target compounds. EC50/LC50 values were collected through literature review or using the ECOSAR program in cases that experimental values were not available. Triclosan seems to pose an environmental risk on the soil environment, as its RQ values exceeded 1, both in terrestrial and aquatic toxicity data based risk assessment. Calculations based on aquatic toxicity data showed that another eleven compounds had RQs higher than 1, most of them belonging to the classes of synthetic phenolic compounds and siloxanes. Tetradecamethylhexasiloxane presented the highest RQ, while high RQs were also calculated for decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and caffeine. No environmental risk for the terrestrial environment is expected due to the individual action of illicit drugs, perfluorinated compounds and benzotriazoles. The sludge source and the day of sampling affected the estimated threat due to nonylphenolic compounds; however these factors did not affect the estimated risk for siloxanes, caffeine and ofloxacin. Calculation of RQ values for the mixture of EOCs, using either the maximum or the average concentrations, far exceeded 1 (253 and 209, respectively), indicating a presumable threat for the terrestrial environment due to the baseline toxicity of these compounds. Countries that reuse sludge for agricultural purposes should include specific EOCs in national monitoring campaigns and study more thoroughly on their effects to the terrestrial environment.

AB This study reports an investigation of omeprazole and venlafaxine parent substances and metabolites in Italian municipal influent wastewaters (IWWs). These pharmaceuticals were selected because they are widely consumed in Italy, but are poorly detected in waste and surface water. The aim of the study was to identify the most relevant pharmaceuticals metabolites in wastewater in order to improve the prioritization step and choose priority pollutants for environmental monitoring campaigns. This was done by investigating omeprazole, venlafaxine and their main metabolites in 30 IWWs from ten Italian cities and by comparing results with information from pharmacokinetic studies. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We searched for 23 omeprazole and four venlafaxine metabolites using data-dependent and MS/MS methods. Parent omeprazole was never present in the samples. Six omeprazole metabolites were found in IWWs. Venlafaxine and two metabolites were present in all the samples. The metabolic profiles in Italian IWW agreed with results in IWW from Spain and with urinary excretion profiles from pharmacokinetic studies. Comparing results from different sources was useful to improve the identification of pharmaceuticals metabolites in environmental samples and to focus the attention of future studies on the most relevant compounds.

AB The performance of ozonation in wastewater depends on water quality and the ability to form hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) to meet disinfection or contaminant transformation objectives. Since there are no on-line methods to assess ozone and center dot OH exposure in wastewater, many agencies are now embracing indicator frameworks and surrogate monitoring for regulatory compliance. Two of the most promising surrogate parameters for ozone-based treatment of secondary and tertiary wastewater effluents are differential UV254 absorbance (Delta UV254) and total fluorescence (Delta TF). In the current study, empirical correlations for Delta UV254 and Delta TF were developed for the oxidation of 18 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), including 1,4-dioxane, atenolol, atrazine, bisphenol A, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), phenytoin, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, trimethoprim, and tris-(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) (R-2 = 0.50-0.83) and the inactivation of three microbial surrogates, including Escherichia coli, MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores (R-2 = 0.46-0.78). Nine wastewaters were tested in laboratory systems, and eight wastewaters were evaluated at pilot- and full-scale. A predictive model for center dot OH exposure based on Delta UV254 or Delta TF was also proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is an important environmental pollution problem, especially in the Mediterranean, which is the main olive oil production region worldwide. Environmental impact of OMW is related to its high organic load and particularly to the phytotoxic and antibacterial action of its phenolic content. In fact, polyphenols are known as powerful antioxidants with interesting nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. In the present work, the efficiency of OMIV Micellar Enhanced Ultrafiltration (MEUF) treatment for removal and concentration of polyphenols was investigated, using an anionic surfactant (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate salt, SDS) and a hydrophobic poly(vinyldene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. The effects of the process experimental conditions on the permeate flux were investigated, and the secondary membrane resistance created by SDS molecules was evaluated. The initial fluxes of OMW processing by MEUF using SDS were 25.7 and 44.5 l/m(2) h under transmembrane pressures of 3.5 and 4.5 bar, respectively. The rejection rate of polyphenols without using any surfactant ranged from 5 to 28%, whereas, it reached 74% when SDS was used under optimum pH (pH 2). The MEUF provides a slightly colored permeate (about 88% less dark), which requires clearly less chemical oxygen demand (COD) for its oxidation (4.33% of the initial COD). These results showed that MEUF process can efficiently be applied to the treatment of OMW and for the concentration and recovery of polyphenols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An aerobic granular sludge-sequencing batch reactor (AGS-SBR) was fed for 28-days with a simulated wastewater containing a mixture of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) (alprenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, venlafaxine, salbutamol, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine), each at 1.3 mu g L-1. AGS-SBR exhibited the highest removal efficiency for norfluoxetine, with preferential removal of the (R)-enantiomer indicating that biological-mediated processes occurred. For all other CPs, removal was non-enantioselective, occurring through biosorption onto AGS. A gradual decline of CPs removal was observed, probably related to the decrease of AGS adsorption capacity. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD) content in the bulk liquid after anaerobic feeding increased, and P-release dropped, probably because the polyphosphate-accumulating organism's activity was affected. Nitrification was also affected as indicated by the ammonium effluent concentration increase. Moreover, CPs exposure promoted AGS disintegration, with decreasing granule size. After stopping CPs feeding, the AGS started to recover its compact structure, and the system returned its normal performance concerning COD- and P-removal. N-removal seemed to be a more sensitive process, as while the ammonium levels were fully restored at the end of operation, nitrite reduction was only partially restored. Results provide useful information on AGS performance during the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals, a frequent scenario in WWTP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study evaluated the efficiency of a semi-closed horizontal tubular photobioreactor (PBR) at demonstrative scale to remove a total of 35 target compounds, including benzotriazoles, benzophenones, antibiotics and different pharmaceuticals present in irrigation water in a peri-urban rural area. This water run through an open channel and was a mixture of reclaimed wastewater from a nearby wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and run-off from the different agricultural fields in the area. Most of the compounds studied are usually not fully eliminated during conventional wastewater treatment, which justifies the need to investigate alternative treatment strategies. A total of 21 of these compounds were detected in the irrigation water. Benzotriazoles were only partially removed after the micmalgae treatment, with elimination rates similar to those of conventional WWTPs. The UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP3) showed variable removals, ranging from no elimination to 51%, whereas 4-methylbenzilidenecamphor (4MBC) was completely eliminated. Regarding pharmaceuticals, average removals were higher, in the range of 60-100%, with the exception of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (46%) and sulfapyridine, which was not removed. Despite the low biomass productivity of the PBR, parameters such as the size of the reactors, the specific mixed cultures developed and the high temperatures and pH in the closed system may account for the overall good results, The efficiency and sustainability of these systems make them a solid, feasible treatment choice.

AB A simple biogenic approach for synthesis of Fe3O4/Au nanocomposite with 31 nm size using aqueous extract of Carum carvi L. seeds has been reported. Phytochemicals of Carum carvi L. seeds extract play three roles, including reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents during the nanocomposite fabrication process. Resulting nano composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential reflectance spectroscopy, vibrating-sample magnetometer, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray elemental mapping. Differential reflectance spectroscopy investigated optical property and absorption spectra display a sharp absorption agreeing to a bandgap of 1.6 eV. Photocatalytic activity of biogenic Fe3O4/Au nanocomposite has been investigated for degradation of imatinib and imipenem drugs under UV and visible light irradiation, due to pharmaceuticals have shown to be recalcitrant in wastewater and conventional wastewater treatments do not remove them, often. Degradation efficiency of imatinib, and imipenem are about 92% and 96% after 1200 s exposure UV light and about 82% and 84% after 3600s exposure visible light in the concentration of 10 ppm drugs. Also, antimicrobial activity of biogenic Fe3O4/Au nanocomposite was investigated on three human pathogens and best result can see in 25 mg/mL of nanocomposite versuse Bacillus subtilis that inhibition zone is about 27 mm. Design of nanocomposites capable of simultaneously removing pharmaceutical and microbial contaminations is important in environments such as hospitals wastewater treatment.

AB Presence of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical products in aquatic environments has received high concern due to their undesirable effect on wildlife and human health. Current work deals with developing a treatment model based on the electro- Fenton (EF) process for efficient removal of metformin (MET) from an aqueous medium. The obtained experimental results revealed that over the reaction time of 10 min and solution pH of 3, the maximum removal efficiency of 98.57% is achieved where the value of MET initial concentration, current density, and H2O2 dosage is set at 10 mg.L-1, 6 mA.cm(-2), and 250 mu L.L-1, respectively, which is in satisfactory agreement with the predicted removal efficiency of 98.6% with the desirability of 0.99. The presence of radical scavengers throughout the mineralization of MET under the EF process revealed that the generation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals, as the main oxidative species, controlled the degradation mechanism. The obtained kinetics data best fitted to the first order kinetic model with the rate constant of 0.4224 min(-1) (R-2 = 0.9940). The developed treatment process under response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for modeling the obtained experimental data and successfully applied for efficient removal of the MET contaminant from pharmaceutical wastewater as an adequate and cost-effective approach.

AB Interpreting the fate of wastewater contaminants in streams is difficult because their inputs vary in time and several processes synchronously affect reactive transport. We present a method to disentangle the various influences by performing a conservative-tracer test while sampling a stream section at various locations for chemical analysis of micropollutants. By comparing the outflow concentrations of contaminants with the tracer signal convoluted by the inflow time series, we estimated reaction rate coefficients and calculated the contaminant removal along a river section. The method was tested at River Steinlach, Germany, where 38 contaminants were monitored. Comparing day-time and night-time experiments allowed distinguishing photo-dependent degradation from other elimination processes. While photo-dependent degradation showed to be highly efficient for the removal of metroprolol, bisoprolol, and venlafaxine, its impact on contaminant removal was on a similar scale to the photo-independent processes when averaged over 24 h. For a selection of compounds analyzed in the present study, bio- and photodegradation were higher than in previous field studies. In the Steinlach study, we observed extraordinarily effective removal processes that may be due to the higher proportion of treated wastewater, temperature, DOC and nitrate concentrations, but also a higher surface to volume ratio from low flow conditions that favorizes photodegradation through the shallow water column and a larger transient storage than observed in comparable studies.

AB Pharmaceuticals and Personal care products (PPCPs) are often found in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to insufficient removal during wastewater treatment processes. To understand the factors affecting the removal of PPCPs in classical activated sludge WWTPs, the present study was performed to assess the removal of frequently occurring pharmaceuticals (Naproxen, Fenoprofen, Ketoprofen, Dichlofenac, Carbamazepine) and the biocide Triclosan in activated sludge from four different Danish WWTPs. The respective degradation constants were compared to operational parameters previous shown to be of importance for degradation of micropollutants such as biomass concentration, and sludge retention time (SRT). The most rapid degradation, was observed for NSAID pharmaceuticals (55-90 % for Fenoprofen, 77-94 % for Ketoprofen and 46-90 % for Naproxen), followed by Triclosan (61-91 %), while Dichlofenac and Carbamazepine were found to be persistent in the systems. Degradation rate constants were calculated as 0.0026-0.0407 for NSAID pharmaceuticals and 0.0022-0.0065 for triclosan. No relationships were observed between degradation rates and biomass concentrations in the diverse sludges. However, for the investigated PPCPs, the optimal SRT was within 14-20 days (for these values degradation of these PPCPs was the most efficient). Though all of these parameters influence the degradation rate, none of them seems to be overall decisive. These observations indicate that the biological composition of the sludge is more important than the design parameters of the respective treatment plant.

AB There is increasing concern about chemical pollutants that have the ability to mimic hormones, the so-called endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). One of the main reasons for concern is the possible effect of EDCs on human health. EDCs may be released into the environment in different ways, and one of the most significant sources is industrial wastewater. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the treatment performance of different wastewater treatment procedures (biological treatment, filtration, advanced oxidation processes) for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand and seven selected EDCs (dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from wastewaters from a mill producing 100% recycled paper. Two pilot plants were running in parallel and the following treatments were compared: (i) anaerobic biological treatment followed by aerobic biological treatment, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO), and (ii) anaerobic biological treatment followed by membrane bioreactor and RO. Moreover, at lab-scale, four different advanced oxidation processes (Fenton reaction, photo-Fenton reaction, photocatalysis with TiO2, and ozonation) were applied. The results indicated that the concentrations of selected EDCs from paper mill wastewaters were effectively reduced (100 %) by both combinations of pilot plants and photo-Fenton oxidation (98 %), while Fenton process, photocatalysis with TiO2 and ozonation were less effective (70 % to 90 %, respectively).

AB Diminishing freshwater (FW) supplies necessitate the reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for various purposes, like irrigation of agricultural lands. However, there is a growing concern that irrigation with TWW may transfer antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to the soil and crops. We hypothesized that TWW irrigation would increase the prevalence of antibiotic residues together with the corresponding ARGs in the irrigated soil. We further predicted that soil texture, especially pH, clay content, and organic matter variabilities, would change the antibiotic residues concentrations and thus ARGs dissemination. To test our predictions, three soils types (loamy-sand, loam, and clay) were irrigated with two water types (FW and TWW), over two consecutive seasons. We monitored physico-chemical parameters, the abundance of seven antibiotic residues, and their corresponding ARGs together with class 1 integron (intI1) in 54 water and soil samples collected at the end of the field experiments. The results revealed increase in antibiotics concentrations and ARGs relative abundance in TWW than FW. Yet, in the soil ARGs relative abundances were independent of the irrigation water quality, but dependent on the soil type, especially the clay content. Further, there were no clear associations between the targeted antibiotics or the presence of heavy metals and ARGs' relative abundance in the water or soil samples. Therefore, our results question the link between the discharge of antibiotics and heavy metals, and the dissemination of ARGs in soil environments.

AB Background Unregulated use of veterinary pharmaceuticals has caused environmental concerns such as ecotoxicity and development of genetic resistance in the microbial biosphere. Photocatalytic treatments, e.g. photo-Fenton reaction, have been considered for their removal. In this work, substitution of the use of a chemical oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide (Fenton reaction) by organic molecules from sonicated microalgae biomass Chlorella sp, combined with Fe2+ and UV light, was used to evaluate the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) and hormone 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in synthetic wastewater. Results Removal of CIP was improved using only UV (71%), by adding Fe2+ at 0.54 mmol L-1 (90.17%) and combining these with sonicated microalgae biomass (0.4 g L-1), achieving >99% CIP removal and 75% E2 removal after 120 min of treatment. When the conditions were optimized, aiming to decrease the Fe2+ concentration and improve the removal of CIP, the optimal conditions were pH 7, sonicated microalgae biomass concentration 0.5 g L-1 and 0.39 mmol L-1 Fe2+, reaching 97 and 70% removal efficiency for CIP and E2 respectively; when microalgae biomass was not added, removal decreased to 90 and 57% respectively. Conclusion Photodegradation with sonicated microalgae biomass has demonstrated to be an effective option to improve the removal of selected antibiotics and hormones from wastewater, considering that no acidification or costly reagents are needed for its optimization.

AB Supplementing nano zero valent iron (nZVI) is an attractive technology for wastewater treatment due to its advantages in accelerating the hydrolysis, fermentation and anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In this present study, nZVI was added to investigate its effects on enhancing tetracycline (TC) wastewater anaerobic treatment and the changes of microbial community, especially for underestimated syntrophic-methanogenic associations. The TC concentrations were 1, 10, 30, 50, 80, 100 and 150 mg/L with 0.38 g nZVI (with iron g/g VS of 0.50) complemented into reactors. Results revealed that nZVI could enhance AD process in both control and TC dosed systems, and the promoting effect on methanogenesis was more significant in systems of high concentration TC, with 100 and 150 mg/L. In addition, cumulative CH4 production for all TC added systems without nZVI were higher than the control indicating TC had positive effect instead of expected negative effect on AD process, high TC concentration of 100 and 150 mg/L only affecting the increase factor rather than causing inhibitory effect. After digestion, TC was largely removed in with/without nZVI systems. And also, nZVI evidently altered the bacterial and methanogenic community structure, with an increase abundance of syntrophic-methanogenic associations (Syntrophobacterales and Methanosarcinales) and resulting in the enhancement of methane generation. This research provides an efficient method for TC wastewater anaerobic treatment.

AB Venlafaxine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, irbesartan and ofloxacin are highly-consumed pharmaceuticals that show considerable removal efficiencies (between 40 and 98%) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Consequently, they are expected to generate transformation products (TPs) during wastewater treatment and in surface water (SW) receiving WWTP effluent. In this work, degradation experiments for these five pharmaceuticals have been carried out with SW and WWTP activated sludge under laboratory-controlled aerobic conditions to identify their transformation products by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS). Initially, 22 pharmaceutical TPs were tentatively identified. A retrospective analysis was performed in effluent wastewater (EWW) and SW samples. All parent compounds as well as several TPs were found in some of the selected EWW and SW samples. Additionally, valsartan and 3 TPs were also detected by searching for common fragments in these waters. It is important to highlight that some TPs, such as O-desmethyl-venlafaxine and an oxidized gemfibrozil TP, were more frequently found than their corresponding parent compounds. On the basis of these results, it would be recommendable to include these TPs (at least those found in EWW and SW samples analyzed) in monitoring programs in order to gain a more realistic understanding of the impact of pharmaceuticals on water quality.

AB Triclosan is a commonly used bactericide that survives several degradation steps in WWTP (wastewater treatment plants) and potentially reaches fluvial ecosystems. In Mediterranean areas, where water scarcity results in low dilution capacity, the potential environmental risk of triclosan is high. A set of experimental channels was used to examine the short-term effects of triclosan (from 0.05 to 500 mu g L-1) on biofilm algae and bacteria. Environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan caused an increase of bacterial mortality with a no effect concentration (NEC) of 0.21 mu g L-1. Dead bacteria accounted for up to 85% of the total bacterial population at the highest concentration tested. The toxicity of triclosan was higher for bacteria than algae. Photosynthetic efficiency was inhibited with increasing triclosan concentrations (NEC = 0.42 mu g L-1), and non-photochemical quenching mechanisms decreased. Diatom cell viability was also affected with increasing concentrations of triclosan. Algal toxicity may be a result of indirect effects on the biofilm toxicity, but the clear and progressive reduction observed in all the algal-related endpoints suggest the existence of direct effects of the bactericide. The toxicity detected on the co-occurring non-target components of the biofilm community, the capacity of triclosan to survive through WWTP processes and the low dilution capacity that characterizes Mediterranean systems extend the relevance of triclosan toxicity beyond bacteria in aquatic habitats.

AB The valorisation of food wastes is a challenging opportunity for the green, sustainable, and competitive development of industry. The recovery of phenols contributes to the sustainability of olive waste sector, reducing its environmental impact and promoting the development of innovative formulations of interest for pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical applications. In this work, olive mill wastewater was treated through a combination of microfiltration (MF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO) in a sequential design to produce polyphenol-enriched fractions that have been investigated for their chemical profile using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), and their potential antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycaemic activities. RO retentate exhibited the highest content of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleuropein, verbascoside, vanillic acid, and luteolin. In particular, a content of hydroxytyrosol of 1522.2 mg/L, about five times higher than the MF feed, was found. RO retentate was the most active extract in all in vitro tests. Interestingly, this fraction showed a 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid (ABTS) radicals scavenging activity with an IC(50)value of 6.9 mu g/mL and a potential inhibition of lipid peroxidation evaluated by the beta-carotene bleaching test with IC(50)values of 25.1 mu g/mL after 30 min of incubation. Moreover, RO retentate inhibited alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase with IC(50)values of 65.3 and 66.2 mu g/mL, respectively.

AB In this study, the effect of magnetic adsorbent prepared from Olive kernel (MA-OK) was studied in the Amoxicillin (AMX) removal. The synthesized adsorbent, under a sonochemical method, were characterized using Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorption functions in the batch experiments were studied using the expected parameters for the maximum absorption capacities (q(m),) such as pH, contact time, the dosage adsorbent, and the initial concentration of AMX. The residual amount of AMX were recorded after injection into the HPLC. The proportion of the mobile phase was methanol to water (40:60) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Adsorption experimental results indicated that the removal efficiency reaches its maximum using 0.5 g/L of the adsorbent, concentration of AMX (200 mg/L) at contact time of 90 min and pH of 6. The kinetics of the reaction and the adsorption isotherm could be well described by the pseudo-second order equation and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a regression coefficient of 0.9981 and 0.9979, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model was to be 238.1 mg/g. The ionic strength of the solution has no significant effect on increasing the AMX removal efficiency. Eventually, application of this adsorbent was successfully performed for removing AMX from aqueous and hospital wastewater solutions.

AB Point sources such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), combined sewer overflows (CSO) and separate sewer outlets (SSO) are acknowledged to be major pathways for pollutants to enter surface water. As response, retention soil filters (RSF) have been installed among others in the Erft river catchment area over the past two decades to treat outflows of combined sewer systems and rainwater from separate sewer systems. Studies conducted on several of these RSFs have shown that besides reducing solids by filtration, RSFs have good chemical and biological cleaning capacities for a variety of parameters. Concentrations of both nutrients and heavy metals are reduced. Numerous micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial compounds as well as faecal bacteria are eliminated at high rates. With this background a new type of RSF (RSFplus) has been designed for the flexible treatment of WWTP effluent and CSO. The RSFplus treats CSO during rain events. During dry weather periods, the RSFplus is used for polishing WWTP effluent. The RSFplus is divided into three segments which are fed alternately to guarantee aerobic conditions and is equipped with innovative distribution channels to ensure homogeneous feeding. Granulated activated carbon is used as an additive for the filter medium for advanced treatment. The effectiveness of WWTP effluent polishing and reliability of operational parameters have already been tested for 2.5 years on a pilot scale. The first full-scale demonstration site will be built in 2017 at the WWTP Rheinbach in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany).

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been considered as hotspots for pharmaceutical residues, such as antidepressants, antimicrobials and active ingredients of over-the-counter drugs. Despite evidence of ecotoxicological effects of these microcontaminants on exposed fish in the aquatic systems, there is currently no regulation in terms of the levels of pharmaceutical residues allowable for release into the environment. Depending on the extent of treatment employed in WWTPs removal of pharmaceutical residues are highly variable. This study compares the removal efficiencies for several antimicrobials, antidepressants, and other pharmaceuticals at different stages of the wastewater treatment process of seven WWTPs that employ varying treatment technologies including biological, physical, advanced chemical oxidation, and a combination of two or more of these technologies. The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry at multiple points during the course of treatment. Additionally, the ecotoxicological effects of the WWTP effluents were also evaluated based on the behavioral effects in larval zebrafish. It was found that biological treatment process provided negative to low removal (<50%), while activated carbon and ozonation provided high removal (>95% overall removal) for 14 out of 15, and 9 out of 11 compounds detected in WWTP influents, respectively. Notably, the final effluents of the seven WWTPs in this study did not show any significant behavioral alterations in zebrafish, indicating that despite differences in removal efficiencies all the treatment processes investigated are sufficient in preventing short-term biological effects.

AB Through then release of effluents, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a major pollution point sources for pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in water bodies. The combination of a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter coupled with an ultrafiltration (LW unit was evaluated as an advanced treatment for PhACs removal at pilot scale. The BAC-UF pilot plant was monitored for one year. The biological activity of the biofilm that developed on the granular activated carbon (GAC) particles and the contribution of this biofilm to the overall removal of PhACs were evaluated. Two different phases were observed during the long-term monitoring of PhACs removal. During the first 9200 bed volumes (BV; i.e., before GAC saturation), 89, 78, 83 and 79% of beta-blockers, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics and a mix of other therapeutic groups were removed, respectively. The second phase was characterized by deterioration of the overall performances during the period between 9200 and 13,800 BV. To quantify the respective contribution of adsorption and biodegradation, a lab scale setup was operated for four months and highlighted the essential role played by GAC in biofiltration units. Physical adsorption was indeed the main removal mechanism. Nevertheless, a significant contribution due to biological activity was detected for some PhACs. The biofilm contributed to the removal of 22, 25, 30, 32 and 35% of ciprofloxacin, bezafibrate, ofloxacin, azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB This paper provides a first review of the contamination level of emerging contaminants (ECs) in aquatic sources of India. Contaminants reported so far belong to pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs), surfactants, and phthalates. A total of 41 publications are reported with a maximum share of pesticides (57%) followed by pharmaceuticals (17%), surfactants (15%), PCPs (7%), and phthalates (5%). The concentration of detected contaminants in all aquatic sources range as not detected (ND) to 10,000 ng/L (pesticides), ND to 14 x 10(6) ng/L (pharmaceuticals), ND to 5,160 ng/L (PCPs), 1.3 x 10(6) to 6.2 x 10(6) ng/L (surfactants), and ND to 0.2 x 10(6) ng/L (phthalates). In surface water and treated wastewater, the maximum concentration of pesticides exceed their prescribed environmental quality standards. Pharmaceuticals such as cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, and citalopram are present up to 2.1 x 10(6) ng/L, 14 x 10(6) ng/L, and 0.4 x 10(6) ng/L, respectively, in treated wastewater, which is the highest measured concentration. A higher risk (hazards quotient >1) to aquatic organisms in surface water has been reported for PCPs, surfactants, and phthalates. The review can act as a framework to nurture future research and regulatory initiatives for monitoring of ECs in remaining aquatic sources. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB A three-dimensional electrochemical system was employed as an advanced treatment technology for treatment of tetracycline-containing wastewater. An initial tetracycline concentration of 20.17-100.23 mg/L, pH range of 2.43-9.18, and current density of 1.03-15.72 mA/cm(2) were implemented for the optimization and modeling of the process within the framework of a three-factor, five-level Box-Wilson central composite design-based response surface methodology and least squares support vector machine. The results of statistics corroborated that three main effective factors and reactor performance were very well described by the second-order polynomial equation (coefficient of determination = 0.94, mean square error = 0.0042, root mean square error = 0.065, average absolute deviation = 2.51, and mean absolute error = 0.037). Under the optimal conditions introduced by the desirability function approach, 90.42 (+/- 2.3)%, 49.91 +/- (8.4)% and 28.80 +/- (16.70)% of tetracycline, chemical oxygen demand, and total organic carbon could be removed using the three-dimensional electrochemical process from wastewater. The findings of this study demonstrated that the three-dimensional electrochemical system was as an effective, simple, and economic process compared to other electrochemical systems that have been recently used for antibiotics removal and could be considered as a promising technology for further investigations.

AB Antibiotic contamination is a relevant environmental problem, since these compounds are discharged in conventionally treated wastewaters, and can favor antibiotic resistance. In this work, the mineralization of solutions containing 50 mg/L of erythromycin, part of the European Union wide watch-list, was studied using electro-oxidation and the UV-based processes direct photolysis, heterogeneous photocatalysis and photo-electrocatalysis. For the UV-based processes, a higher photonic flux favored mineralization and lowered energy consumption, since it increases both molecule absorbance and hydroxyl radical production. For the high photonic flux experiments, direct photolysis presented higher mineralization (42%) than photocatalysis (16%), which might be explained by the reactor configuration, the electronic recombination and the erythromycin concentration. Electro-oxidation presented low overall mineralization (< 10%), but had synergistic effects when combined to photocatalysis, resulting in 38% mineralization for photo-electrocatalysis. Matrix effects on mineralization were evaluated by performing photo-electrocatalysis and direct photolysis experiments with a spiked real wastewater. While direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization due to photochemically active light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions, photo-electrocatalysis with the spiked wastewater did not differ significantly from photo-electrocatalysis with the working solution and would be a more viable alternative. The use of a supporting electrolyte for the photo-electrocatalysis experiments with spiked wastewater resulted in no significant difference in mineralization, but probably led to different reaction pathways, as suggested by chloride and nitrogen species concentration analysis.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants, which are ubiquitous and pose the potential risk to ecosystem and human health. It is necessary to remove PPCPs from water and wastewater. In this study, sulfamethoxazole, a widely used antibiotic, was chosen as targeted pollutant. Fenton process and persulfate process were employed to remove sulfamethoxazole from aqueous solution. The results showed that Fenton process required less amount of Fe(II) and oxidant than persulfate process to achieve 100% removal of sulfamethoxazole in the water sample prepared with deionized water. The maximal mineralization reached 83% when hydrogen peroxide concentration was 1 mM and Fe(II) was 0.05 mM for Fenton process. The maximal mineralization for persulfate process was 60% with 4 mM of persulfate and 4 mM of Fe(II). The increase of Fe(II) concentration could increase the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate, but did not increase the mineralization of sulfamethoxazole, indicating that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate was not positive correlation with the removal and mineralization of sulfamethoxazole. Five intermediate compounds were detected in Fenton process while eight intermediate compounds in persulfate process, suggesting that different degradation pathway occurred in the two processes. The wastewater components had negative effect on the degradation of sulfamethoxazole for both Fenton and persulfate processes. The removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was 52.5% and 52.3%, respectively, for Fenton and persulfate processes. Persulfate process could be an alternative for treating the real wastewater containing PPCPs.

AB Nonsteroidal human pharmaceuticals are prevalent in domestic wastewater and may find their way into the environment at low concentrations. Since most pharmaceuticals are designed to be biologically active at low concentrations, there is a risk that these compounds may affect aquatic wildlife. Of particular concern is the occurrence of pharmaceutical mixtures, which may lead to increased adverse effects compared to individual compounds. Interactive effects were previously demonstrated for amphibians exposed to pesticide mixtures, but no such studies investigating responses of amphibians to pharmaceutical mixtures are apparently available. Results demonstrated increased toxicity (loss of tactile response) of striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) tadpoles exposed to a mixture of naproxen, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole, compared to exposures to the individual compounds. Significant time x treatment interactions were observed for tadpole development following chronic exposures to 10 or 100 mu g/L of each compound and the mixture; however, responses were weak and main treatment effects were not significant. Despite minor effects at low exposure concentrations, results demonstrated a potential for mixtures of nonsteroidal pharmaceuticals commonly occurring in wastewater to influence amphibian development. With the vast numbers of pharmaceuticals that exist and are found in the environment, this work highlights a need for further research into mixtures of pharmaceutically active wastewater contaminants. Further, since pharmaceuticals exert extremely varied biological actions, it is suggested that future investigations would benefit from inclusion of endpoints that are indicative of physiological or metabolic performance, as well as assessment of sensitive behavioral responses.

AB To examine effects of municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) on sentinel organisms, the authors deployed caged freshwater mussels (Lasmigona costata) in the Grand River (ON, Canada) upstream and downstream of an MWWE outfall. Passive sampling devices were deployed alongside caged mussels to confirm exposure. Biomarkers of xenobiotic biotransformation, oxidative stress, estrogenicity, and immunomodulation were investigated. Elevated concentrations of selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and a natural estrogen (estrone) were found at the downstream sites. Mussels caged downstream of the effluent for 2 wk showed minimal evidence of exposure, while those deployed for 4 wk exhibited significantly higher levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, demonstrating that MWWE-exposed mussels exhibit increased activity in xenobiotic conjugation and oxidative stress. With respect to immune responses, a significant increase in plasma lysozyme activity and hemocyte viability was observed in MWWE-exposed mussels. Vitellogenin (vtg)-like protein in male mussels showed a trend toward induction after 4 wk of deployment at the first downstream site, but mean levels were not significantly different. Discriminant function analysis indicated that mussels deployed for 4 wk upstream and downstream of the MWWE discharge could be discriminated on the basis of LPO, GST, plasma lysozyme, and vtg responses. The physiological stress observed in caged mussels indicates that wild mussels chronically exposed to MWWE in this ecosystem would also be negatively impacted. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:134-143.

AB Ethidium bromide (EtBr)-containing wastewater can be hazardous to biodiversity when released into the soil and water bodies without treatment. EtBr can mutate living microbial cells and pose toxicity to even higher organisms. This work investigated the removal of EtBr from aqueous solutions by a naturally occurring palygorskite (PFl-1) clay mineral via systematic batch adsorption experiments under different physicochemical conditions. EtBr existed in an undissociated form at pH similar to 7, and was adsorbed on PFl-1 obeying the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum EtBr adsorption capacity was 285 mmol/kg. The best fitted kinetic model for EtBr adsorption was the pseudo-second order model. The amounts of exchangeable cations desorbed from PFl-1 during EtBr adsorption was linearly correlated to the amounts of EtBr adsorbed, with a slope of 0.97, implying that a cation exchange-based adsorption mechanism was dominating. Additionally, dimerization of EtBr molecules via bromide release assisted an increased EtBr removal by PFl-1 at high adsorbate concentrations. Detailed x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron imaging and energy dispersive x-ray analyses confirmed that EtBr adsorption occurred dominantly on the surface of palygorskite which mineralogically constituted 80% of the bulk PFl-1 adsorbent. A small portion of EtBr was also adsorbed by PFl-1 through intercalation onto the smectite impurity (10%) in PFl-1. This study suggested that PFl-1 could be an excellent natural material for removing EtBr from pharmaceutical and laboratory wastewater.

AB With increasing demand for aquaculture products, water reuse is likely to increase for aquaculture operations around the world. Herein, wastewater stabilization ponds (WSP) represents low cost and sustainable treatment technologies to reduce nutrients and various contaminants of emerging concern from effluent. In the present study, we examined bioaccumulation of selected pharmaceuticals from several therapeutic classes by two important fish species in aquaculture with different feeding preferences (Cyprinus carpio and Sander lucioperca) and their common prey to test whether species specific accumulation occurs. Forty and nineteen from 66 selected pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were positively found in water and sediment samples, respectively from the representative WSP. After a sixmonth study, which corresponds to aquaculture operations, fourteen pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were detected (at a frequency of higher than 50% of samples) in at least one fish tissue collected from the WSP. We observed striking differences for species and organ specific BAFs among study compounds. Though muscle tissues consistently accumulated lower levels of the target analytes, several substances were elevated in brain, liver and kidney tissues (e.g., sertraline) of both species. Low residual concentrations of these target analytes in aquaculture products (fish fillets) suggest WSPs are promising to support the water-food nexus in aquaculture. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB The secondary effluent from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant was treated by biological aerated filter (BAF) before and after ozonation, namely BAF1 and BAF2, respectively. The results showed that BAF2 fed with the ozonized secondary effluent exhibited a high efficiency in degrading organic pollutants. The removal efficiency of COD and NH4-N was 6.0 +/- 3.2 and 48.2 similar to 18.6% for BAF1 and 12.5 +/- 5.8 and 62.1 similar to 40.9% for BAF2, respectively, during the whole operation. The integration system of ozonation and BAF could tolerate a higher organic loading rate. When HRT decreased from 4 to 1 h, COD removal efficiency decreased from 12 to 4% for the BAF1 system, but it kept almost unchanged at high levels of 27-32% for the ozonation-BAF2 system, with around 20% removal by ozonation. The biomass in BAF2 exhibited a higher activity of protease, DHA, and SOUR than that in BAF1. The organic pollutants in influent and effluent of BAF were mainly ester compounds, which were difficult to biodegrade by BAF. The predominant genera in BAF1 were Gemmatimonadaceae uncultured, Thauera, and Thiobacillus, while the dominant genera in BAF2 were Nitrospira, Gemmatimonadaceae uncultured, and Flexibacter, respectively. Overall, BAF2 performed better than BAF1 in organic pollutant removal and microbial activity. The ozonation process was vital for BAF to treat petrochemical secondary effluent.

AB The biocides irgarol and terbutryn enter the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) via combined sewer systems after leaching from coatings and paints of materials. In this study, the biotransformation of irgarol and terbutryn was examined in aerobic batch experiments with activated sludge taken from the nitrification zone of a conventional VVWTP, since currently there is no information about the fate of irgarol and terbutryn in biological wastewater treatment. Both, irgarol and terbutryn were transformed into one main transformation product (TP) following pseudo first-order kinetics. The TPs were tentatively identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) to be irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide. The final confirmation of the proposed chemical structures of the TPs was achieved by a comparison of mass spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with those of authentic reference standards (e.g., synthesized). An analytical method for the sensitive quantification of irgarol, terbutryn and their TPs in environmental samples was developed based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and LC tandem MS detection. Irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide were detected in the effluents (average concentrations up to 22 ng L-1 and 65 ng L-1) of all four investigated WWTPs as well as in streams and small rivers (up to 14 ng L-1 and 34 ng L-1). Luminescent bacteria inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri exhibited that the TPs irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide feature a similar bacterial toxicity than the parent compounds.

AB Water and wastewater treatment and conveyance account for approximately 4% of US electric consumption, with 80% used for conveyance. Net zero water (NZW) buildings would alleviate demands for a portion of this energy, for water, and for the treatment of drinking water for pesticides and toxic chemical releases in source water. However, domestic wastewater contains nitrogen loads much greater than urban/suburban ecosystems can typically absorb. The purpose of this work was to identify a first design of a denitrifying urban NZW treatment process, operating at ambient temperature and pressure and circum-neutral pH, and providing mineralization of pharmaceuticals (not easily regulated in terms of environmental half-life), based on laboratory tests and mass balance and kinetic modeling. The proposed treatment process is comprised of membrane bioreactor, iron-mediated aeration (IMA, reported previously), vacuum ultrafiltration, and peroxone advanced oxidation, with minor rainwater make-up and H2O2 disinfection residual. Similar to biological systems, minerals accumulate subject to precipitative removal by IMA, salt-free treatment, and minor dilution. Based on laboratory and modeling results, the system can produce potable water with moderate mineral content from commingled domestic wastewater and 10-20% rainwater make-up, under ambient conditions at individual buildings, while denitrifying and reducing chemical oxygen demand to below detection (<3 mg/L). While economics appear competitive, further development and study of steady-state concentrations and sludge management options are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot-scale hospital wastewater treatment plant consisting of a primary clarifier, membrane bioreactor, and five post-treatment technologies including ozone (O-3), O-3/H2O2, powdered activated carbon (PAC), and low pressure UV light with and without TiO2 was operated to test the elimination efficiencies for 56 micropollutants. The extent of the elimination of the selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, metabolites and industrial chemicals) was successfully correlated to physical-chemical properties or molecular structure. By mass loading, 95% of all measured micropollutants in the biologically treated hospital wastewater feeding the post-treatments consisted of iodinated contrast media (ICM). The elimination of ICM by the tested post-treatment technologies was 50-65% when using 1.08 g O-3/gDOC, 23 mg/L PAC, or a UV dose of 2400 J/m(2) (254 nm). For the total load of analyzed pharmaceuticals and metabolites excluding ICM the elimination by zonation, PAC, and UV at the same conditions was 90%, 86%, and 33%, respectively. Thus, the majority of analyzed substances can be efficiently eliminated by zonation (which also provides disinfection) or PAC (which provides micropollutants removal, not only transformation). Some micropollutants recalcitrant to those two post-treatments, such as the ICM diatrizoate, can be substantially removed only by high doses of UV (96% at 7200 J/m(2)). The tested combined treatments (O-3/H2O2 and UV/TiO2) did not improve the elimination compared to the single treatments (O-3 and UV).

AB The use of granular activated carbon (GAC) in fixed bed filters is a promising option for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant effluents. Frequent bacicwashing of the filter bed is inevitable, but its effect on potential filter stratification is not well understood yet and thus has been evaluated in the present study for two commercial GAC products. Bacicwashing of GAC filters was simulated with 10 or 100 filter bed expansions of 20 or 100% at backwash velocities of 12 and 40 m/h, respectively. Five vertical fractions were extracted and revealed a vertical stratification according to grain sizes and material densities. Sieve analyses indicated increasing grain sizes towards the bottom for one GAC while grain sizes of the other GAC were more homogeneously distributed throughout the filter bed. The apparent densities of the top sections were significantly lower than that of the bottom sections of both products. Comparative long term fixed bed adsorption experiments with the top and bottom sections of the stratified GAC showed remarkable differences in breakthrough curves of dissolved organic carbon, UV light absorption at 254 nm wavelength (UVA(254)) and OMP. GAC from the upper section showed constantly better removal efficiencies than GAC from the bottom section, especially for weakly adsorbing OMP such as sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore correlations between UVA(254) reductions and OMP removals were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play a crucial role in claforan bio-adsorption using activated sludge, but the interaction mechanism between claforan and EPS remains unclear. Fluorescence spectroscopy technology was employed to illuminate the mechanism in this study. Two protein-like fluorescence peaks (peak A with Ex/Em = 225 nm/337 nm and peak B with Ex/Em = 280/335 nm) and humic acid-like (peak C with Ex/Em = 350/434) were identified in loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS). Fluorescence of the peaks A and B for LB-EPS were markedly quenched by claforan at all temperatures whereas fluorescence of peak C for LB-EPS was quenched only at 288 K. Peak A and Peak B interaction with Claforan fits Stern-Volmer equation and Hill model. log K-b was 7.17 and 5.05, respectively, and the number of binding sites (n) was 1.56 and 1.19. log K-b and n for peak C were not able to fit the equation at 298 K. The fluorescence quenching of interaction between peak A and peak B and Claforan was governed a static process, whereas the interaction between peak C and Claforan may be both static and dynamic quenching. The molecular binding mechanisms obtained in this study will add fundamental knowledge of understanding the roles of EPS from activated sludge in claforan bio-adsorption in domestic wastewater.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are commonly found in biosolids and effluents from wastewater treatment plants Land application of these biosolids and the reclamation of treated wastewater can transfer those PPCPs into the terrestrial and aquatic environments, giving rise to potential accumulation in plants. In this work, a greenhouse experiment was used to study the uptake of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and fluoxetine) and two personal care products (triclosan and triclocarban) by an agriculturally important species, soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr) Two treatments simulating biosolids application and wastewater irrigation were investigated After growing for 60 and 110 days, plant tissues and soils were analyzed for target compounds. Carbamazepine, triclosan, and triclocarban were found to be concentrated in root tissues and translocated into above ground parts including beans, whereas accumulation and translocation for diphenhydramine and fluoxetine was limited. The uptake of selected compounds differed by treatment, with biosolids application resulting in higher plant concentrations, likely due to higher loading However, compounds introduced by irrigation appeared to be more available for uptake and translocation Degradation is the main mechanism for the dissipation of selected compounds in biosolids applied soils, and the presence of soybean plants had no significant effect on sorption. Data from two different harvests suggest that the uptake from soil to root and translocation from root to leaf may be rate limited for triclosan and triclocarban and metabolism may occur within the plant for carbamazepine.

AB The scope of this study was directed to examine different wastewater treatment technologies (activated sludge, trickling filter, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis) at full-scale facilities in Arizona and California leading to indirect potable reuse and their capability to remove pharmaceuticals Additionally, the fate of selected pharmaceuticals was studied during soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) at sites where secondary and tertiary treated effluents are used for subsequent groundwater recharge Facilities employing longer detention times during treatment (nitrifying and denitrifying plants) showed significant lower effluent concentration for analgesic drugs as compared to trickling filter or activated sludge facilities applying shorter detention times A similar trend was observed for the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, which was significantly removed in denitrified effluents, whereas a trickling filter treated effluent exhibited concentration of 1,235 ng/L Antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine and primidone, showed no dependency on the wastewater treatment applied None of the investigated drugs was detected in tertiary treated effluents after nanofiltration or reverse osmosis After SAT, analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs were efficiently removed after retention times of less than 6 months and remaining concentrations were near or below the detection limit of the analytical method A high potential for biodegradation was also observed for anti-inflammatory drugs in groundwater recharge systems The antiepileptics carbamazepine and primidone represented the most dominant of all investigated drugs in well treated domestic effluents (nitrifying/denitrifying plants) Removal of carbamazepine and primidone did not seem to occur during travel times of more than 6 years in the subsurface.

AB Among the emerging environmental contaminants, pharmaceutically active compounds have become a growing public concern because of their potential to cause undesirable ecological and human health effects. Donana Park (South of Spain) includes a mosaic of unique ecosystems known around the world which is particularly affected by the quality of the incoming flowing water. This study reports the presence of a number of priority pharmaceuticals in wastewater and surface water samples from Donana watersheds. In general, ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, propranolol, caffeine and gemfibrozil were the compounds most frequently found in all locations, in the range of ng/L to mu g/L. Carbamazepine, with high potential risk to the environment, was also detected, although only in a few water samples. The main results are: (i) pharmaceuticals, as water pollutants, are continually discharged into Donana water bodies and, owing to their biological activity, could lead to adverse effects in this outstanding aquatic ecosystem; (ii) wastewater treatments implemented in the area are insufficient to remove pharmaceuticals; and (iii) therefore, there is a requirement for better wastewater treatments in this natural area to reduce or avoid the presence of organic pollutants in general and pharmaceutical active compounds in particular. To the best of our knowledge, these data constitute the first measurements of pharmaceutical compounds in water not only from the protected area of Donana Park but also from other Natural or National Parks in the world.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims at evaluating the degradation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in urban wastewater effluents using a UV-C-driven oxidation processes in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the phytotoxicity and ecotoxicity of the treated samples were investigated against one plant species (Sinapis alba) and a crustacean (Daphnia magna), respectively. The efficiency of the process to remove E. coli and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli was also assessed.
   RESULTS: Complete degradation of CIP was achieved within 15 min of treatment under the optimum concentration of the oxidant ([H2O2]= 10 mg L-1). The degradation rate of the antibiotic fitted pseudo-first-order kinetics. An increase in both shoot inhibition and root inhibition was observed, until 60 min of treatment, beyond which, the phytotoxic effect was eliminated. The results demonstrated the ability of the UV-C process to reduce the toxicity towards D. magna by 40%, comparatively, to the untreated wastewater. The inactivation of E. coli and CIP-resistant E. coli was achieved within 2 min of treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The UV-C/H2O2 process was successfully applied for the removal of CIP at low environmental concentration level. The treatment process was able to achieve a significant reduction of phyto-and eco-toxic effects, as well as E. coli harbouring resistance to CIP. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB pilot study was conducted to assess the performance of a municipal wastewater reclamation plant consisting of a combined coagulation-disk filtration (CC-DF) process, microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, in terms of the removal of water contaminants and changes in characteristics of effluent organic matter (EfOM). The CC-DF and MF membranes were not effective for the removal of dissolved water contaminants. However, they could partially reduce the turbidity associated with the cake layer formation by particulate materials on the membrane surfaces. Furthermore, most of water contaminants were completely removed by the RO membranes. Although the CC-DF process could remove approximately 20% of turbidity, the aluminium concentrations considerably increased after the CC-DF process due to the residual coagulants complexed with both carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups of EfOM. Those aluminium-EfOM complexes had a lower negative charge and higher molecular weight (>0.1 mu m pore size of the MF membranes) compared to non-complexed EfOM. These results indicate that the control of the formation of the aluminium-EfOM complexes should be considered as a key step to use the CC-DF process as a pre-treatment of the MF and RO membranes for mitigation of membrane fouling in the tested pilot plant.

AB The effluent from the pharmaceutical industries is a serious threat to the environment because of the existence of high chemical oxygen demand, ionic Chloride and Sulphate concentrations. To bring down the pollutant level as per environmental safe discharge regulations, a nanofiltration based semi pilot based system is proposed to recover clean water in continuous mode from pharmaceutical effluent. The experimental results were validated by the newly developed mathematical model, used for the transportation of molecules through nanofiltration membrane. Such mathematical approach was constructed on the basis of Extended Nernst-Planck equation which was further linearized and applied for the simulation. Effects of governing parameters like operating pressure, feed flow rates across membrane surface, constituents of feed solutions, solution pH and operational time on membrane solute rejection and solvent flux were analysed. It was found that the model predicted results corroborated extremely well with the experimental results with less relative error ( < 0.09), high regression (R-2 > 99 %) and Willmott-d-index ( > 98 %), generating a steady state clean water flux of 110 L/m(2)h at 12 bar operating pressure and at a cross flow rate of 750 L/h with more than 98 % rejection to active pharmaceutical ingredients, chemical oxygen demand and other toxic molecules. Economic assessment with Scale-up shows that the proposed system is promising in producing clean water at a low cost (US 0.89 $/m(3)) by purifying pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Recently the synthesis and application of bio-based composite materials, which contain polymeric and inorganic units such as TiO2, has gained much attention in the field of water/wastewater treatment, due to their better (and more practical) performance parameters. In the present study, recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been used and evaluated as supporting polymer for Aeroxide P25 TiO2 immobilization. PET-TiO2 composite films were synthesized at different TiO2 content (10%, 30% and 47% TiO2) and characterized with different techniques such as X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), etc. The photocatalytic activity of the new (synthesized) bio-based TiO2 composite films was investigated under simulated solar irradiation for the degradation of a mixture of antibiotic pharmaceuticals (Isoniazid, Metronizadole, Sulfadiazine, Sulfamethoxazole, Trimethoprim, Norfioxacin, Moxifloxacin and Lincomycin). The immobilization of TiO2 was successful in all cases and by increasing the photocatalyst concentration results in higher photocatalytic efficiencies. The new composite films were tested two times to assess their reusability, which found to be better for PET-10%-TiO2 composite films; therefore the latter has been used for further investigation thus exhibiting good stability even after five cycles. The results showed that PET-10%-TiO2 was efficient in degrading the antibiotic mixture in water and in wastewater matrix. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this research was to study the feasibility of using algal and algal-activated sludge systems in treating laundry wastewater. Three different types of systems-green microalgae (system A), diatoms + activated sludge (system B), and green microalgae + activated sludge (system C)-were studied at six different solid retention times (SRT)-6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days-to evaluate their performance in removal of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), anionic surfactants, and micropollutants with added trace elements. System B showed relatively better performance in removal of TOC (79%) and TN (90%). A total of 64 compounds were detected in influent when analyzed by LC-MS, of which 19 were grouped under herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides, 25 under pharmaceuticals, and 20 under others. Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) was detected only in the effluent of system A and was not detected in both system B and system C. Grotan OX, an anti-microbial, was the compound with least removal in all the systems. The bacterial LAS degrader/tolerant plate count in system B at 16-day SRT was 2000 CFU/mL, 50 times more than the plate count of system C (40 CFU/mL). The LAS degrader/tolerant bacterial species identified were Aeromonas caviae and Klebsiella pneumonia in both systems B and C. The LAS degrader/tolerant green microalgae plate count at 16-day SRT was 130 CFU/mL, whereas no LAS degrader/tolerant diatom colonies were observed. Graphical Abstract

AB Water pollution is a global health and environmental issue affecting all life forms. The treatment of water polluted by dyes, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals is a major challenge to operators of wastewater treatment facilities. Adsorption technology functions effectively in removing these pollutants using specific adsorbents. Graphene oxide (GO) and its three dimensional (3D) configurations are new carbon-based adsorbents. With superiorly large surface area, high porosity and large variety of functional groups, these materials have been tested for their potential application in wastewater treatment. This review focuses on the synthesis methods of 3D graphene-based structures and their adsorption performance of dyes, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals. Various synthesis methods have been successfully developed demonstrating the feasibility of configuring graphene into porous 3D networks. These methods can be categorised into direct synthesis and solution-based methods. The 3D graphene structures portrayed relatively high adsorption capacities for the three pollutant groups. Their adsorptive properties were influenced by characteristics of pollutant, adsorbent surface and process parameters. The major adsorption mechanisms of the 3D graphene-based structures were identified to be hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, pi-pi and hydrophobic interactions. This review indicated that 3D graphene configurations are promising solutions for practical application of carbon nanomaterials in wastewater treatment. 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB In the event of a foot and mouth disease outbreak, further spread of the virus is generally prevented by culling of infected animals in burial pits. This practice may eventually lead to groundwater contamination through leaching of wastewater from the animal carcasses. Wastewater from carcass leachate often contains antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes as well as traces of pharmaceuticals, and a high nutrient content. The role of operational parameters used in activated sludge treatment of this wastewater in the spread of antibiotic resistance has not been fully understood. This study investigated the fate of tetracycline-resistant bacteria and genes in sequencing batch reactors with synthetic carcass leachate at different solid retention times. Escherichia coli DH5 alpha was used as the representative tetracycline-resistant bacteria with multiple antibiotic-resistant genes encoded in plasmid pB10. Solids retention time contributed to an increase in antibiotic resistance in SBRC (SRT = 25 days) with TRB values up to 1.25 x 107 CFU/mL which is one log higher than the influent. Microbial community analysis of the DNA samples from effluent of SBRC showed four major phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria under which are ecologically-important microbial species. It was shown that antibiotic resistance genes cannot be eliminated during treatment of synthetic carcass leachate in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work evaluates the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, with special emphasis on their metabolites, in raw hospital wastewater (HWW) using wide-scope screening based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. The applied strategy uses an extended purpose-built database, containing >1000 pharmaceuticals and 250 metabolites. Raw HWW samples from a hospital located in south Brazil were collected over six months, with a monthly sampling frequency. Accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by quadrupole-time of flight MS allowed the identification of 43 pharmaceuticals and up to 31 metabolites in the samples under study. Additionally, other four metabolites not included in the initial database could be identified using a complementary strategy based on the common fragmentation pathway between the parent compound and its metabolites. Nine metabolites derived from four pharmaceuticals were identified in the raw HWW samples, whereas their parent compounds were not found in these samples. The results of this work illustrate the importance of including not only parent pharmaceuticals but also their main metabolites in screening analysis. Besides, the inclusion of in silico QSAR predictions allowed assessing the environmental fate and effect of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in terms of biodegradability, as possible Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) compounds, and their potential hazard to the aquatic environment.

AB The paper expresses an attempt to tackle the problem due to the presence of micropollutants in wastewater which may be able to disrupt the endocrine system of some organisms. These kinds of compounds are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The aim of this paper is to compare the fate of the alkylphenols-APs (4-(tert-octyl)) phenol, t-nonylphenol and 4-p-nonylphenol and the hormones (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) pilot plant and in a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (CTP). The obtained results are also compared with the results obtained in a previous study carried out in an aerobic MBR pilot plant. The results showed that the APs soluble concentrations in the SAMBR effluent were always significantly higher than the CTP ones. Moreover, the analyses of the suspended fraction revealed that the AP concentrations in the SAMBR reactor were usually higher than in the CTP reactor, indicating that under anaerobic conditions the APs were accumulated in the digested sludge. The aerobic conditions maintained both in the CTP system and in the aerobic MBR favoured the APs and hormones degradation, and gave rise to lower concentrations in the effluent and in the reactor of these systems. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the degradation of APs under aerobic conditions was enhanced working at high solid retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) values.

AB Reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) generated as a waste stream during reverse osmosis treatment of reclaimed wastewater, presents significant disposal challenges. This is because it causes environmental pollution when it is disposed to lands and natural water bodies. A long-term dynamic adsorption experiment was conducted by passing ROC from a wastewater reclamation plant, firstly through a granular activated carbon (GAC) column, and subsequently through an anion exchange resin (Purolite) column, for the removal of two major ROC pollutants, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microorganic pollutants (MOP). GAC removed most of the smaller-sized low molecular weight neutrals and building block fractions as well as the hydrophobic fraction of DOC with much less removal by the subsequent Purolite column. In contrast, the humics fraction was less well removed by the GAC column; however, Purolite column removed all that was remaining of this fraction. This study demonstrated that combining adsorbents having different affinities towards a variety of DOC fractions constitute an effective method of taking advantage of their different properties and achieving larger DOC removals. Almost 100% of all 17 MOPs were removed by the GAC column, even after 2880 bed volumes of continuous use. This contrasted with the DOC fractions' removal which was much lower. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to investigate the organics removal and microbial community dynamics in accordance with variable amoxicillin (AMX) concentrations, a 1.47 L expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor was designed and operated for 241 days treating with artificial antibiotic wastewater. Furthermore, microbiological community dynamics with increasing AMX concentrations were also investigated using clone libraries and the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene. AMX concentration in the reactor was controlled at 19.2 mg L-1 at first and then gradually increased to around 241.7 mg L-1 from the day 146 to 241. COD and AMX removal efficiencies reached to 85% and 80%, respectively. And T-RFLP results showed that the microbial community structure in the reactor changed with the increased AMX concentrations. Especially for bacteria, T-RFs of 486, 482, 166, 160 and 88 bp were dominant at all stages, whereas abundance of T-RFs 91,163 and 170 bp showed remarkable changes. Besides, clone results combined with T-RFLP showed Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae and Thermotogae were most dominant bacterial groups in the system and some geneses were also expected to be responsible for the degradation of AMX. For achaea, its community structure (T-RFs of 96, 122 bp) kept stable in all the stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article discusses a combined treatment system comprising electrocoagulation (EC) as a pre-treatment followed by anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor (AFFBR) for treatment of high strength pharmaceutical wastewater. The effect of various operating parameters such as pH, current density and electrolysis duration on COD, BOD and colour removal was studied. The maximum removals for COD, BOD and colour under optimal operating conditions i.e. pH 7.2, current density (CD) of 80 A/m(2) and electrolysis time of 25 minutes were 24%, 35% and 70.25% respectively. Increase in current density has resulted in decrease in electrolysis duration with marginal improvement in treatment efficiency. The efficiency of removal is discussed in terms of kgCOD(r)A(-1) m(-2) h(-1) and energy consumption as Wh kg(-1) COD(r). The effluents obtained after EC were treated by AFFBR at various organic loading rates (OLRs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results indicated removals in the range of 80-90% for COD and 86-94% for BOD respectively, at OLRs between 0.6 to 4.0 Kg COD/m(3) d at an HRT of 2 days. The total gas quantity increased with increase in both HRT and OLR up to a loading of 6 Kg COD/m(3)/d but it did not commensurate with organic load. The results indicated that the combined treatment option is competitive and can be used effectively for high strength wastewaters.

AB Using two samples of a pharmaceutical wastewater, the efficiency of three advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (H2O2/UV, O-3/UV and H2O2/Fe(II)) for the removal of adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were compared on a laboratory scale. The AOX contents of these samples ranged from 3 to 5 mg/L. Generally the results showed that all three methods are suitable for the degradation of AOX and COD. UV irradiation involved a high selectivity for the degradation of AOX compared to COD. On the other hand, processes based on hydroxyl radicals were less selective but considerably more effective in COD degradation. This explains why the combined methods H2O2/UV and O-3/UV lead both to a complete destruction of AOX and a large removal of COD. During ozone treatment - without UV radiation a decrease of AOX was also observed, although to a lower degree. Using Fenton's reagent both AOX and COD could be removed almost completely. The reaction time needed for this kind of treatment was very low compared to the other two AOPs. O-3/UV treatment showed the largest consumption of ''activated'' oxygen (AO) during COD degradation. H2O2/Fe(II) treatment required almost the same amount of AO as H2O2/UV. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A vortex assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector technique for separation, preconcentration and determination of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater was developed. Optimum conditions for the extraction, separation and preconcentration of the antibiotics were obtained using surface response methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD). Under optimum conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.63-1.2 ng L-1 and 2.1-4 ng L-1, respectively with the enhancement factors ranging from 48-83. The linear dynamic ranges were 2-800 for ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), and, 3-900 ng L-1 for danofloxacin (DANO) and 4-1000 ng L-1 for enrofloxacin (ENRO). Correlation coefficients were ranging from 0.9978 to 0.9989. The intraday (n = 15) and inter-day (n = 5) precisions (expressed in terms of % relative standard deviation (RSD) for 50 mu g L-1 of CIPRO, DANO and ENRO were in the range of 3.3-6% respectively. The developed method was used for the extraction, preconcentration and quantification of CIPRO, DANO and ENRO antibiotics in influent and effluent wastewater samples. In overall, vortex assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector (VA-DLLME/HPLC-DAD) demonstrated great potential for extraction, preconcentration and quantification of antibiotics in environmental water.

AB Herein, we introduced simple, cheap, cost-effective and sustainable kitchen waste tea residue as an adsorbent. As per the literature survey, all the adsorbents have been used for wastewater treatment only as activated form. The first time, we have used similar material without any complicated activation process for the removal of pharmaceutical pollutant and it shows superior results than the existing materials which are the most attractive part of this work. It has shown an effective, low cost bio-sorbent to remove Hydralazine hydrochloride pharmaceutical pollutant from wastewater in aqueous media. The adsorbent waste tea residue was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effect of pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial concentration on Hydralazine hydrochloride removal were also systematically studied. The adsorption process was studied using experimental data were fitted in both isotherms models. The maximum adsorption capacity of waste tea residue was found to be q(e) = 131.63 mg g(-1) which is higher than the reported value. Furthermore, developed adsorbent was practically used to remove pharmaceutical pollutants from real samples (hospital and river wastewater) spiked with Hydralazine hydrochloride. Therefore, the waste tea residue displays the great potential to improve the quality of water contaminated with different type's pharmaceuticals in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the current study, the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing penicillin G treatment using a hollow fibre membrane contactor was investigated. A mathematical model based on the finite element method was developed. The extraction was performed using Shellsol TK as organic solvent containing 5% Aliquat 336. The effect of feed pH, flow rate and temperature were examined for the extraction of penicillin G from aqueous solution. The results showed that there is reasonable good agreement between experimental data and modelling values. It was found that increasing temperature from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C increases the penicillin G extraction from 33% to 54%. Also, penicillin G extraction was decreased from 34.7% to 25.1% with increasing pH from 5.5 to 6.5 while it grew to 45.8% when the pH of feed solution was 7. Furthermore, the results showed the diffusive flux is favourable for the system and penicillin G extraction but the convective flux has negative impact on the system in terms of penicillin G extraction. It was concluded that a hollow fibre membrane contactor has the potential for use in wastewater treatment through it is important to improve diffusive flux in the system to enhance penicillin G extraction.

AB Phenol is a toxic organic compound that detectable in the pharmaceutical wastewater, and therefore it should be eliminated. This study aims to degrade phenol in the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) include the photocatalytic process applying Titanium Oxide (TiO2) that immobilized on pumice stone (PS), as well as ozone process with O-3 and O-3/granulated activated carbon (GAC). Degradation system used two configuration reactors that worked alternately at pH 3 and 9. Photocatalysis was conducted for 4 hours in the photoreactor that equipped with mercury lamp as a photon source, while ozonation was performed for 1 hour in the cylinder glass reactor contained an ozone generator. Phenol degradations were done by photocatalysis, ozonation, photocatalysis followed by ozonation and vice versa. The FESEM-EDS and XRD results depicted that TiO2 has impregnated on pumice stone and FESEM characterization also indicated that the photocatalyst spread across the surface of the pumice stone. BET analysis results in an increased surface area of the PS-TiO2 by 3.7 times, whereas bandgap energy down to 3 eV. It can be concluded that ozone process (with O-3/GAC) that followed by photocatalysis at pH 9 could treat the liquid waste with phenol concentration 11.2 down to 1.2 ppm that nearly according to the discharge standards quality (1 ppm).

AB In the present work, the influence of the water matrix on the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria during the electro-disinfection with diamond anodes was studied, paying special attention to the disinfection efficiency and the prevention of the formation of hazardous disinfection by-products. This will allow to evaluate if electrolysis is more suitable as pretreatment of the main pollution source or as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater. To do this, electrolysis of synthetic wastewater rich in ammonium (simulating the effluent of an oxidation pond) and hospital urine intensified with three different bacteria (E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli) were carried out. Results show that the disinfection efficiency is higher in the synthetic wastewater for all the bacteria tested, but chlorate is formed as disinfection by-product. Electrogenerated hypochlorite and chloramines are the main responsible species for bacteria depletion. Presence of organics (urea, creatinine and uric acid) as additional ammonia precursors in hospital urine leads to the well-known breakpoint reaction with electrogenerated active chlorine, yielding an increasing concentration of chloramines. This helps to prevent the formation of chlorate in hospital urine because hypochlorite is mainly wasted in the oxidation of organics and the formation of chloramines. These results are of a great significance because they indicate that antibiotic resistant bacteria can be efficiently removed in complex matrixes without the formation of hazardous chlorine by-products if it is carried out as a pretreatment before discharge to WWTP.

AB Disposed pharmaceuticals constitute a significant threat to the environment due to the high consumption of drugs and inefficient treatment of wastewater. In this paper, we first described the efficient removal of a series of antidepressants and immunosuppressant from a cultivation medium carried out by white-rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus. We determined the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals and the activity of fungal ligninolytic enzymes over time, as well as the toxicity of pre- and post-cultivation medium to Spirostomum ambiguum. We showed that P. ostreatus can remove from the model medium most of the pharmaceuticals studied, including clomipramine, mianserin, paroxetine, sertraline, and mycophenolic acid. Pharmaceuticals containing phenolic or benzene moieties, likewise in the natural monolignols, were removed in a high efficiency within a short time. The activity of the fungal ligninolytic enzymes, laccase, and lignin peroxidase, in the cultivation medium, was three times higher in the presence of the pharmaceuticals, which justifies their contribution to the degradation. The post-cultivation medium showed lower toxicity than pre-cultivation medium and toxic units were 7- and 2-fold lower for the sublethal and lethal response, respectively. Over twenty metabolites we detected resulted mostly from oxygenation or demethylation of parent pharmaceuticals. The biological treatment we developed using P. ostreatus-based system should be convenient and effective in mycoremediation of environmental wastewater polluted with emerging contaminants including monolignol-like antidepressants and immunosuppressant.

AB This work did a systematic investigation on removal of trace antibiotics from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent through nanofiltration (NF), and disposal of the NE concentrate by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Four antibiotics, namely, norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), roxithromycin (ROX) and azithromycin (AZI), which had high detection frequencies in effluents from WWTPs in Dalian (China), were selected as the target micropollutants. High rejections of antibiotics (>98%) were obtained in all sets of NF experiments. UV254 photolysis, ozonation and UV/O-3 process were employed to treat NF concentrate. Results demonstrated that UV254 photolysis was not effective in degrading the four antibiotics, while ozone-based processes exhibited high removal efficiencies in 30 min. A synergetic effect between O-3 and UV was observed in degradation of the selected antibiotics during UV/O-3 treatment. Generation of hydroxyl radicals in the process was testified using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping technology. In treatment of NF concentrate from real secondary effluent, UV/O-3 process achieved excellent removal efficiencies of antibiotics (>87%), a partial removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (40%), an increase of BOD5/COD ratio (4.6 times), and a reduction of acute toxicity (58%). The study revealed that nanofiltration could efficiently remove antibiotics from WWTP effluent, and meanwhile, UV/O-3 process was able to further eliminate the antibiotics in the NF concentrate effectively.

AB Nontarget analysis using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is a valuable approach in characterizing for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the environment. In this study, wastewater and surface water samples from three locations in Manila, Philippines were analyzed for CECs using a nontarget analysis approach with an LC-Orbitrap. A previously optimized semiautomated workflow was used for data processing with Compound Discoverer. A total of 157 compounds were identified, with 21 confirmed with reference standards, 83 confirmed with evidence from a mass spectral library (mzCloud), and 53 tentatively identified using in silico fragmentation (MetFrag). These compounds include pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, antifungal, and antihypertensive compounds, human metabolites, natural products, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Compounds confirmed with reference standards include antibiotics ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim (2 to 19 ng/L), and antifungal compounds carbendazim and climbazole (3-47 ng/L). The pesticides diethyltoluamide (DEET) and diuron were also detected (37 ng/L). The utility of a preliminary multivariable linear regression quality structure-retention relationship (QSRR) model based on quantum chemical molecular descriptors is demonstrated. This study demonstrates the importance of using tools and software that are helpful for annotating HRMS data and reporting detections according to a standardized classification system. The detection of several CECs in wastewater and surface water samples show the importance of performing nontarget analysis in determining occurrence of CECs in the environment.

AB 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (DClNB) as a typical refractory pollutant, exists in multifarious industrial wastewater widely and poses a serious threat to the environment. An ion exchange membrane (IEM)-free microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) with pre-acclimated bioanode was built and evaluated systematically for treatment of DClNB containing wastewater. Results showed that compared with the non-acclimated or IEM-equipped MECs, the pre-acclimated IEM-free MECs had the best DClNB removal efficiency of 91.3% under COD and DClNB loading rates of nearly 1000 kg m(-3) d(-1) and 100 g m(-3) d(-1). Both of anode pre-acclimation and IEM removal reduced the electron transfer resistance by 71.1 and 194.5 Omega, respectively. Compared to the pre-acclimated IEM-equipped MEC, the cathode current efficiency of pre-acclimated IEM-free MEC increased by 13.7%. Analysis of live/dead cell staining indicated that a higher proportion of live cells was observed in the acclimated anode biofilm (66.1% vs. 47.3%), and the detoxification of DClNB in the pre-acclimated IEM-free MECs was significantly better (p < 0.05) than those of non-acclimated or IEM-equipped MECs. This study contributes to the performance improvement of the MEC process for treatment of toxic industrial wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suburban neighborhoods are a dominant type of human land use. Many housing regions globally rely on septic systems, rather than sanitary sewers, for wastewater management. There is evidence that septic systems may contaminate waterbodies more than sewer lines. There is also mounting evidence that human activities contaminate waterways with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which alter wildlife sexual development. While endocrine disruption is often associated with intense activities such as agriculture or wastewater treatment plant discharges, recent evidence indicates that endocrine disruption is pervasive in frogs from suburban neighborhoods. In conjunction with other putative EDC sources, one hypothesis is that wastewater is contaminating suburban waterways with EDCs derived from pharmaceuticals or personal care products. Here, we measure estradiol (E2) in metamorphosing green frogs (Rana clamitans) from forested ponds and suburban ponds adjacent to either septic tanks or sanitary sewers. We show that E2 is highest in male frogs from septic neighborhoods and that E2 concentrations are significantly lower in male frogs from forested ponds and from ponds near sewers. These results indicate that septic tanks may be contaminating aquatic ecosystems differently than sewer lines. This pattern contrasts prior work showing no difference in EDC contamination or morphological endocrine disruption between septic and sewer neighborhoods, implying that suburbanization may have varying effects at multiple biological scales like physiology and anatomy.

AB The biotechnological production of pharmaceutical active substances needs ancillary substances. Surfactants are used at the end of the cell culture as a protection against potential viral or bacterial contamination and to lyse the producing cells for isolation and purification of the products. To find a replacement for a surfactant that had raised environmental concern, environmentally relevant data for potential alternatives were searched for in the literature. Significant data gaps were filled with additional tests: biodegradability, algal growth inhibition, acute daphnid immobilization and chronic daphnid reproduction toxicity, acute fish toxicity, and activated sludge respiration inhibition. The results were used to model removal in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving 3 biotechnological production sites in the Roche Group. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated using realistic amounts of surfactants and site-specific wastewater fluxes, modeled removals for the WWTPs and dilution factors by the respective receiving waters. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived for WWTPs and for both fresh and marine receiving waters as the treated wastewater of 1 production site is discharged into a coastal water. This resulted in a spreadsheet showing PECs, PNECs, and PEC divided by PNEC risk characterization ratios for the WWTPs and receiving waters for all investigated surfactants and all 3 sites. This spreadsheet now serves as a selection support for the biotechnological developers. This risk-based prioritization of surfactants is a step toward green biotechnological production.

AB Wheat grains are natural products which grow in the north of Algeria. In this study, they were used as adsorbent to remove amoxicillin antibiotic from wastewater. Adsorption isotherm of amoxicillin on both crude and modified wheat grains with 20% tartaric acid was investigated in batch tests. A model was developed regarding both the kinetic partitioning and the mechanism governing the forward transfer of amoxicillin. Results were interpreted in terms of a two-film theory for flat interface. The percentage of maximum adsorption capacity of amoxicillin was found to be 84% for the following optimal conditions: amoxicillin concentration of 4mg/L, 5min contact time, pH 7, temperature 25 degrees C, and 0.24g/L initial amoxicillin concentration and 150g particle size. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the intraparticle diffusion model were used to describe the kinetic data, and the rate constants were evaluated. It was found that the pseudo-second-order model provides the most adequate correlation of experimental data. The rate parameters of the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption were also evaluated and to identify the adsorption mechanisms. The adsorption constants were evaluated by using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherm models. The results showed that Temkin isotherm agrees with experimental data better than other adsorption models for the adsorption of amoxicillin. The thermodynamic parameters (G, H, and S) showed that the process was feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic.

AB An innovative photoreactor, FluHelik, was used to promote the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) by a photochemical UVC/H2O2 process. First, the system was optimized for the oxidation of a model antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC), using both ultrapure water (UPW) and a real urban wastewater (UWW) (collected after secondary treatment) as solution matrices. Following, the process was evaluated for the treatment of a UWW spiked with a mixture of OTC and 10 different pharmaceuticals established by the Swiss legislation at residual concentrations (Sigma CECs <660 mu g L-1). The performance of the FluHelik reactor was analyzed both at lab and pre-pilot scale in multiple and single pass flow modes.
   The efficiency of the FluHelik photoreactor, at lab-scale, was evaluated at different operational conditions (H2O2 concentration, UVC lamp power (4, 6 and 11 W) and flow rate) and further compared with a conventional Jets photoreactor. Both photoreactors exhibited similar OTC removal efficiencies at the best conditions; however, the FluHelik reactor showed to be more efficient (1.3 times) in terms of mineralization when compared with the Jets reactor. Additionally, the efficiency of the UVC/H2O2 photochemical system using the FluHelik photoreactor in reducing the toxicity of the real effluent containing 11 pharmaceuticals was evaluated through zebrafish (Banjo rerio) embryo toxicity bioassays. FluHelik scale-up from laboratory to pre-pilot to promote UVC/ H2O2 photochemical process proved to be feasible. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A promising membrane configuration based on immobilized TiO2 on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) dual layer hollow fibre membranes was prepared and successfully employed for the photocatalytic degradation of eight pharmaceuticals. Experiments were carried out in a flow reactor of 0.5 L equipped with a lamp emitting at 254 nm, treating groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent. The efficiency of the new catalyst to phototransform target micropollutants was demonstrated, being dependent on the selected compound. Only the application of photocatalysis using the supported catalyst allowed to increase the phototransformation rate of trimethoprim, metoprolol and carbamazepine treating secondary wastewater effluent (1.4-2.2 times faster than photolysis). The determination of electrical energy per order of magnitude of transformation (EEO) confirmed the lowest energy requirements to transform selected pharmaceuticals in secondary effluent employing the supported catalyst (33-58 kW h m(-3) compared to 49-79 kW h m(-3) applying only photolysis). The detection and identification of transformation products formed during the investigated treatments was performed by UPLCQTOF/MS/MS. 156 transformation products were detected showing two different types of time profiles, namely a bell-shape trend or a constant increase along reaction time thus accumulating in the reaction mixture. The chemical structure for 19 out of 156 detected compounds was proposed as derived from parent compounds spiked in the secondary effluent.

AB The efficiency of sequential advanced membrane technology wastewater treatment plant towards removal of a widely used non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) mefenamic acid was investigated. The sequential system included activated sludge, ultrafiltration by hollow fibre membranes with 100kDa cutoff, and spiral wound membranes with 20kDa cutoff, activated carbon and a reverse osmosis (RO) unit. The performance of the integrated plant showed complete removal of mefenamic acid from spiked wastewater samples. The activated carbon column was the most effective component in removing mefenamic acid with a removal efficiency of 97.2%. Stability study of mefenamic acid in pure water and Al-Quds activated sludge revealed that the anti-inflammatory drug was resistant to degradation in both environments. Batch adsorption of mefenamic acid by activated charcoal and a composite micelle (otadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA)-clay (montmorillonite) was determined at 25.0 degrees C. Langmuir isotherm was found to fit the data with Q(max) of 90.9mg g(-1) and 100.0mg g(-1) for activated carbon and micelle-clay complex, respectively. Filtration experiment by micelle-clay columns mixed with sand in the mg L-1 range revealed complete removal of the drug with much larger capacity than activated carbon column. The combined results demonstrated that an integration of a micelle-clay column in the plant system has a good potential to improve the removal efficiency of the plant towards NSAID drugs such as mefenamic acid.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) that pose a serious peril to both aquatic biota and mankind's health. The development of novel adsorbent materials for the effectual treatment of PPCPs-included wastewater has become one of the foremost research issues in the environmental research area. In this work, a hierarchical carbon material (GHPC), produced through the simple and effective molten salt route adopting glucose and the eutectic mixture (KCl/ZnCl2 ) as the carbon precursor and the pore generator, respectively, was applied in adsorption of sodium diclofenac, as a representative of organic contaminants of emerging concern, from aqueous solution. GHPC manifested superior adsorption performance towards DFC, which was believed to stem from its high surface area and total pore volume, hierarchically porous texture, and the presence of plentiful available functional groups. Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the pseudo-second-order kinetics were found to be appropriate to represent the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics, respectively. Hydrogen bonding interaction was thought to be the main mechanism underlying DFC (as H-bond donor) adsorption onto GHPC (as H-bond acceptor). The impacts of the co-existing cations and anions on the adsorptive removal of DFC were additionally scrutinized. Finally, GHPC demonstrated good reusability properties that qualify it for the practical remediation of PPCPs-included wastewater. (C) 2020 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Cytostatic drugs have become one of the greatest environmental hazards. They exhibit toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on flora and fauna, including people. They are poorly eliminated in conventional wastewater treatment plants and their mixtures could possess higher ecotoxicity than individual drugs. Fungi are organisms with enormous potential for biodegradation of a variety of toxic chemical pollutants. The aim of this work was to estimate tolerance of five fungal strains to selected anticancer drugs, which will be useful to determine the potential for their possible use in cytostatics removal and may be significant in the context of wastewater treatment application. Test was conducted on Forces fomentarius (CB13), Hypholoma fasciculare (CB15), Phyllotopsis nidulans (CB14), Pleurotus ostreatus (BWPH) and Trametes versicolor (CB8) and the chosen drugs were bleomycin and vincristine. Their ability to grow in the presence of selected cytostatics was evaluated in cultures conducted on two solid media which differed in the richness of nutrient compounds. Fungal strains tolerance was expressed as a half maximal effective concentration.
   Results showed that fungi display better tolerance to high cytostatics' concentrations in the medium rich in carbon source. Regardless of the medium used, the differences in growth ability were lower for bleomycin (the tolerance was higher). The greatest tolerance for bleomycin was shown by Pleurotus ostreatus. Results suggest that more efficient elimination of bleomycin would be possible to obtain, strain BWPH seems to be the best fungal candidate for this drug degradation assay and, probably, in wastewater treatment application tests in a longer perspective.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is considered as a promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) for wastewater reclamation, while a simultaneous low rejection of salts is desirable for the ease of using the reclaimed water. This study was conducted to exploit the potential of polypiperazine-amide NF membranes in achieving selective separation of TrOCs and NaCl by varying the concentration of the diamine monomer, piperazine (PIP), for interfacial polymerization and by modifying the nascent membrane surface with hydrophilic monomers, diethanolamine (DEA) and monoethanolamine (MEA). Results showed that increasing PIP concentration could decrease the membrane pore size and reduce the surface negative charge density, which led to an increased rejection of xylose and a reduced rejection of NaCl. The grafting of DEA or MEA molecules could further decrease the NaCl rejection, substantially improve the water permeability and maintain an effective removal for eight pharmaceuticals (PhACs). The optimal membrane prepared with a PIP concentration of 2.0 wt % and subsequently modified by MEA exhibited a rejection of NaCl at 33.1% and an average rejection of PhACs at 90.8% in a 10 mmol/L NaCl solution under an applied pressure of 6 bar. The membrane could have an even higher selectivity when the NaCl concentration was increased to higher levels. These results demonstrated the feasibility and versatility of the membrane in separating TrOCs from NaCl for wastewater reclamation.

AB Use of silver nanoparticles is increasing in different packaging material as disinfectant to protect food and pharmaceutical products. Its use has raised the contamination risk of fresh water and human exposure can cause serious problems. The coagulation/flocculation process can be an attractive option for silver nanoparticles removal at small-scale treatment just after its use. Four coagulants, aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, Ocimum basilicum, and Hibiscus esculentus (synthetic and natural) were applied. For coagulation/flocculation activity, a series of jar test experiments were conducted to treat silver nanoparticles at concentration of 1mgL(-1) from wastewater. H. esculentus efficiently removed silver nanoparticles (98.7%) from aqueous solution at a dose of 150mgL(-1), whereas at same coagulant dose, ferric chloride, O. basilicum, and aluminum sulfate successfully removed silver nanoparticles at 96, 69, and 50%, respectively. No broad change in pH was observed and it remained between 6.5 and 7.5 during all the experiments at room temperature.

AB Water scarcity driven by population growth, lack of conventional supplies, and climate change impacts have resulted in increasing interest worldwide in drinking water augmentation using treated wastewater effluents. Potable reuse can occur indirect or direct, but is also practiced in many places as 'de facto reuse', where upstream wastewater discharge occurs to drinking water supplies. With this increasing recognition of potable reuse, there is very limited guidance and standardization for proper design and operation of potable reuse schemes that is protective of public health. This study provided guidance on contemporary approaches for the design, operation, and monitoring of potable reuse schemes, including source water characterization and source control approaches; linking water quality treatment performance goals to health risks; risk mitigation strategies including the design principles of multiple barriers for microbial and chemical contaminants; assessing system reliability and fail-safe design approaches; and, finally, monitoring strategies for process performance and compliance.

AB Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to optimize the process parameters for the extraction of chromium from aqueous solution of waste sodium dichromate recovered from the pharmaceutical industry wastewater using emulsion liquid membrane technique. The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, Span-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent and Aliquat-336 as carrier. The process parameters, namely feed concentration, pH, internal reagent concentration and surfactant concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium(VI) were: feed concentration (223.55 ppm), pH (2.73), internal reagent concentration (0.72 N) and surfactant concentration (1.91%, w/w). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 97.57%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The biodegradation of various wastewater-derived organic trace pollutants occurring in different aquatic compartments of the environment was previously reported to be influenced by the prevailing redox conditions. However, comparative studies on the redox-dependent degradation behavior of organic trace pollutants are scarce. The objective of the study presented herein, was to compile and evaluate data from several comparable previous tank experiments, thus, providing an overview on the redox-dependent removal of a total of 27 wastewater-derived trace compounds, including phenazone type compounds, antimicrobials, -blockers, psychoactive drugs and sulfonamides. Removal rate constants were fitted assuming first-order degradation kinetics. Six compounds were identified to be removed solely under oxic, three compounds solely under anoxic conditions. Others persisted under all experimental conditions, while some were removed under both oxic and anoxic conditions.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) hybrid system was investigated to demonstrate the performance of treating nitrogen, phosphorus and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. With the MBR and NF (molecular weight cut off (MWCO): 210 Da), the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) was effectively reduced by nitrification by MBR and negatively charged surface of NF (TN: 8.67 mgN/L and TP: 0.46 mgP/L). Biosorption and microbial decomposition in MBR seem to be major removal mechanisms for the removal of PPCPs. Among various parameters affecting the removal of PPCPs by NF, namely, physicochemical properties of the PPCPs (charge characteristics, hydrophobicity and M-W) and membranes (MWCO and surface charge), the MWCO effect was found to be the most critical aspect.

AB Isolation, identification and toxicological monitoring of new microbial consortia to degrade PPCP's (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) have direct applications to improve the quality of effluents in WWTP (wastewater treatment plants). In this work, we present isolation and molecular identification of a microbial strain degrading frequently detected compounds in effluent water such as naproxen (analgesic) and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), as well as detoxification evaluation by a zebrafish embryos biomodel. Naproxen was completely removed from real contaminated water samples within 7 days of culture by Serratia sp. However, the microbial strain was unable to remove carbamazepine remaining constant until the analysis finished. Toxicity test showed that naproxen elimination reduces mortality zebrafish embryos at 28%. As conclusion, Serratia sp. and possible other Enterobacteriaceae could be used in bioreactors and purifying plant biodiscs in order to achieve naproxen and probably others PPCPs total elimination from effluent prior being poured into rivers or lakes.

AB Denatonium is one of the bitterest substances known to man and therefore applied in numerous consumer products to prevent an accidental or intentional consumption. So far no information was available on the occurrence of this compound in the environment. A sensitive targeted method was developed and applied to water samples taken in the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. Denatonium was detected in 100% of the investigated 22 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents with a maximum concentration of 341 ng L-1. Additionally, water samples were taken from the Ammer river over a period of one week and all wastewater impacted samples showed denatonium at concentrations up to 195 ng L-1. Retrospective analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometric measurements of WWTP effluents from Italy and Switzerland confirmed and therefore point to an international occurrence of denatonium as anthropogenic contaminant.

The most common pharmaceuticals were caffeine and acetaminophen, 0.57-20.62 ng/mL and "not detected"-1.45 ng/mL. Water samples were clustered based on pharmaceutical concentrations. Source apportionment analysis showed that treated wastewater discharged from treatment plants contributed 18.43% of pharmaceuticals in Klang River. An environmental risk assessment by means of the risk quotient (RQ) was done whereby the latter was more than one for salicylic acid and diclofenac in surface water posing threats to the aquatic environment. Salicylic acid showed high risk for acute toxicity, while diclofenac showed high risk for chronic toxicity. The results indicated a need for regular monitoring on pharmaceutical levels in Klang River and increasing the efficiency of wastewater treatment here.

AB In this study, nickel sulfide-reduced graphene oxide-titanium dioxide (NiS/RGO/TiO2) nanocomposite was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Different tools such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the prepared nanocomposite. The application of NiS/RGO/TiO2 nanocomposite was investigated for the degradation of trichlorophenol (TCP) under solar light irradiation. Results showed that the coupling of nickel sulfide and reduced graphene oxide with titanium dioxide has significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity where the degradation of TCP reached 95% after 6 h under sunlight radiations. The total organic carbon was reduced to 4 mg L-1 from its initial concentration (11 mg L-1), which showed that up to 55% of organic carbon mineralization was successfully achieved. In general, the study revealed an efficient photocatalytic capability of NiS/RGO/TiO2 nanocomposite under visible light.

AB An industrial wastewater effluent coming from a pharmaceutical laboratory has been treated in a semi industrial autonomous solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) plant. A photo-Fenton process assisted with ferrioxalate has been used. Up to 79% of TOC can be removed in 2 h depending on initial conditions when treating an aqueous effluent containing up to 400 ppm of initial organic carbon concentration (TOC). An initial ratio of Fe(II)/TOC higher than 0.5 guarantees a high removal.
   It can be seen that most of TOC removal occurs early in the first hour of reaction. After this time, mineralization was very slow, although H2O2 was still present in solution. Indeed it decomposed to form oxygen in inefficient reactions. It is clear that remaining TOC was mainly due to the presence of acetates which are difficult to degrade. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of bisphenol AP (BPAP) by a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) was investigated. BPAP, representing typical scenarios for the BPAP-MWCNT interactions, was employed as a probe molecule. It was found that BPAP exhibited great adsorptive affinity to MWCNT, and the adsorption kinetics equilibrium was arrived within 4.0 min following the pseudo-second-order model. The overall rate process was mainly controlled by the external mass transfer. The hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, and pi-pi stacking interactions were dominant factors for the strong adsorption of BPAP, instead of the pH ionic strength and other ionic species in contaminated water. The MWCNT has higher stability within 8 removal-regeneration recycles, and up to 95% of recovery could be obtained by eluting the adsorbed BPAP on MWCNT adsorbent using ethanol/sodium hydrate solution. The results of the experiment on real samples verified the effectiveness for the recovery and removal of BPAP from wastewater samples.

AB Alarming growth of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environment has elevated concerns about their potential impact on human health. Taking cognizance of this, the present study is focussed on the coating of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with different functionalities and to use them as adsorbents for pharmaceutical waste. The thickness of the coating was analysed using Small angle X-ray scattering technique. Thorough study of the isotherms and kinetics were performed suggesting monolayer adsorption and pseudo kinetic order model, respectively. To get an insight of the interactions liable for adsorption of fluoroquinolones over the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles computational studies were undertaken. The results demonstrated substantial evidence proposing remarkable potential of these nanostructures as adsorbents for different pollutants with an additional advantage of stability and facile recoverability with a view to treat wastewater.

AB Contamination of water bodies by pharmaceuticals has recently received much attention. Even at low concentration, pharmaceuticals can disrupt the natural hormonal responses (endocrine disruptors) leading to a multitude of toxicological effects in aquatic life. In the current study, the estrogenic effect of selected pharmaceuticals was evaluated using the E-Screen assay, which quantifies the cell proliferation of estrogen responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells with respect to 17 beta-estradiol. In this assay, 17-alpha ethinylestradiol and acetaminophen were found to yield a strong and weak estrogenic response, respectively, while diclofenac and carbamazepine caused antagonistic effect. Validity of the in vitro assay was confirmed when these pharmaceuticals did not generate any response in the estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Based on the level of residual pharmaceuticals reported in wastewater effluents in Mumbai, the results of this study indicate that estrogenic effects may be expected in wastewater effluents.

AB Resin adsorption is a promising technology for pharmaceutical removal from wastewater. In this study, polymeric adsorption resin H103 was studied for the removal of berberine from pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of adsorption temperature, initial pH and equilibrium time on adsorption were investigated. It was found that the optimal temperature, pH and equilibrium time were 343 K, 7.0, and 8 h, respectively, for berberine removal by H103 adsorption. The adsorption kinetics of berberine by H103 could be simulated by first-order kinetic model. The results show that adsorption rate was dependent on both film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion, which limited the adsorption rate when the H103 dosage was less than 2.0 g. When H103 dosage was more than 2.0 g, the film diffusion became the only control factor of adsorption rate. The adsorption isotherms could be expressed by Freundlich model very well indicating that the adsorption of berberine by H103 was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

AB Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are compounds which interfere with the hormone system and may adversely affect the health and reproduction of man and animals. These compounds comprise heavy metals and organic chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, plasticizers, surfactants, pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic estrogens as well as phyto- and mycoestrogens. In this review, an overview of most frequently asked questions is presented. These questions are: What are the sources of endocrine disruptors we find in the environment? What concentrations do we have in our wastewater? What happens in the wastewater treatment plant? Do we have EDs in other water bodies also? Is drinking water at risk? Why is it so difficult to prove whether EDs are harmful? Could sperm decline and fertility disturbance in man be due to EDs? Could breast cancer be due to exposure to EDs? What are alterations in wildlife and fish? What can be done?.

AB This paper describes the presence of 33 pharmaceuticals and hormones in waters from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) situated in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain. The target compounds were one psychoactive stimulant, one antiepileptic, four analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, one lipid regulators, two anti-ulcer agents, nine antibiotics (sulfonamides and macrolides), two beta-blockers, two metabolites, and 11 hormones (free and conjugates). The determination was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry after enrichment by solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB sorbent. Most of the pharmaceuticals were found in both influent and effluent samples from the two STPs. The most frequently detected were caffeine, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, ranitidine, omeprazole, estrone 3-sulfate, and estradiol 17-glucuronide. Specifically, the highest concentrations found in influents were 19,850 ng/L (acetaminophen), 9,945 ng/L (caffeine), 4,215 ng/L (ibuprofen), 5,695 ng/L (sulfamethoxazole), and 5,140 ng/L (sulfathiazole). Most of the pharmaceuticals present in influent waters were found in effluents at lower concentrations. The highest concentrations in effluents were 970 ng/L (caffeine), 670 ng/L (sulfamethoxazole), 510 ng/L (bezafibrate), and 1,032 ng/L (diclofenac).

AB A SPE-UHPLC-UV method for the determination of 13 pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups in surface water and wastewater samples was proposed. The following three solid-phase-extraction (SPE) columns with polymeric sorbents were used as a pre-concentration step: the Oasis HLB (average recoveries 93.8 %), the Nexus (84.0 %) and the Bond Elut ENV (88.3 %). A reverse-phase UHPLC with a C-18e monolithic column and gradient elution program was used to obtain the best separations for all 13 drugs in short analysis time (3.4 min). The LOD range for determined drugs was 0.02-0.18 mu g L-1, and the concentration range for drugs found in water samples was 0.06-0.90 mu g L-1. The proposed method was used to analyze different water samples, mostly from rivers, and can be used as a monitoring tool for environmental pollution.

AB Enrofloxacin is a synthetic second-generation fluoroquinolone used as an antimicrobial agent exclusively in veterinary medicine. To simulate the treatment of wastewater contaminated by enrofloxacin, four-day long fed-batch runs were carried out according to the Fenton process with an enrofloxacin solution as model, to which hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion were added twice a day. The residual enrofloxacin concentration was practically coincident to that detected at the end of the batch tests. Hydrogen peroxide was almost completely consumed after each feeding period, while the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration decreased gradually within three days, corresponding to a reduction >58%. From the third day on, the TOC falling rate was quite low. A yellow sludge settled due to the precipitation of both Fe(OH)(3) and a complex formed by ferric ion with adsorbed enrofloxacin and/or its oxidation products.

   Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC)
AB In India a large number of pharmaceutical industries are manufacturing drugs of complex type subsequently producing huge quantities of wastewaters. The herbal pharmaceutical industries are one of them which manufacture various herbal medicines from natural products and certain chemicals and metal combinations. During their manufacturing process a large number of toxicants enter the watercourse harming the biota of the receiving water bodies. Zooplankton organisms being at the base of the food chain if affected, will subsequently affect the fisheries potential at large, harming the interest of man. Keeping this point in view a herbal pharmaceutical manufacturing industry based at Nagpur was selected for investigation with respect to assessing its toxic effect on the freshwater crustacean Cypris spp. during short duration toxicity tests. This research paper discusses in detail the bioassay evaluation of raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated herbal pharmaceutical effluent for arriving at a concentration safe for the Cypris spp.

AB Focusing on the photocatalytic degradation of phenol under visible light, the synthesized lanthanum orthoferrites (LaFeO3) by gel combustion method using citric acid as sacrificial agent were investigated. With the highest reaction temperature of 200 degrees C, the physicochemical properties of synthesized samples were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS). On the other hand, UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis was carried out to determine the phenol photodegradation activities and mechanism. The results suggested the well-defined LaFeO3 nanocrystals with specific area of 28 m(2) g(-1) were successfully synthesized. Besides that, variations in operating parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol in synthetic wastewater were also examined. In conclusion, LaFeO3 nanocrystalline exhibited an exceptional photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation, thus providing a perfect alternative for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Wastewater treatment plant effluents are important point sources of micropollutants. To assess how the discharge of treated wastewater affects the ecotoxicity of small to medium-sized streams we collected water samples up- and downstream of 24 wastewater treatment plants across the Swiss Plateau and the Jura regions of Switzerland. We investigated estrogenicity, inhibition of algal photosynthetic activity (photosystem II, PSII) and growth, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. At four sites, we measured feeding activity of amphipods (Gammarus fossarum) in situ as well as water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) reproduction in water samples. Ecotoxicological endpoints were compared with results from analyses of general water quality parameters as well as a target screening of a wide range of organic micropollutants with a focus on pesticides and pharmaceuticals using liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Measured ecotoxicological effects in stream water varied substantially among sites: 17 beta-estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQ(bio), indicating the degree of estrogenicity) were relatively low and ranged from 0.04 to 0.85 ng/L, never exceeding a proposed effect-based trigger (EBT) value of 0.88 ng/L. Diuron equivalent (DEQ(bio)) concentrations (indicating the degree of photosystem II inhibition in algae) ranged from 2.4 to 1576 ng/L and exceeded the EBT value (70 ng/L) in one third of the rivers studied, sometimes even upstream of the WWTP. Parathion equivalent (PtEQ(bio)) concentrations (indicating the degree of AChE inhibition) reached relatively high values (37 to 1278 ng/L) mostly exceeding the corresponding EBT (196 ng/L PtEQ(bio)). Decreased feeding activity by amphipods or decreased water flea reproduction downstream compared to the upstream site was observed at one of four investigated sites only. Results of the combined algae assay (PSII inhibition) correlated best with results of chemical analysis for PSII inhibiting herbicides. Estrogenicity was partly and AChE inhibition strongly underestimated based on measured steroidal estrogens respectively organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. An impact of dissolved organic carbon on results of the AChE inhibition assay was obvious. For this assay more work is required to further explore the missing correlation of bioassay data with chemical analytical data. Overall, the discharge of WWTP effluent led to increased estrogenicity, PSII and AChE inhibition downstream, irrespective of upstream land use.

AB An attempt was made to cohesively assess the aerobic nitrification treatment (ANT) and bioelectrochemical denitrification treatment (DNT) of real-field pharmaceutical wastewater. The ANT resulted in the removal of 73% ammonium and 78.5% organic carbon content. Subsequently, the outlet of ANT reactor was fed to DNT reactor and the relative influence of external circuitry was investigated. The DNT reactor operated with closed circuit mode (CCM) resulted in similar to 83% of nitrates and % similar to 61% of organic content removal even at low C/N ratio of 2.18. The other pollutant concentrations viz., phosphates, sulfates and total dissolved salts were also significantly removed by both ANT and DNT processes. In this study, a sequential integration of both ANT and DNT processes exhibited high potential for self-sustained energy-positive nutrient removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The feasibility of using titanium dioxide (TiO2) and ultraviolet-light-emitting diode in a batch reactor to remove metformin from synthetic wastewater was studied. The primary tests were using TiO2 and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, and complimentary steps continued using modified (m-TiO2, FeFNS-TiO2). Variation of different factors such as pH, the concentration of TiO2, radiation intensity, the concentration of metformin in a solution and duration of experiments were tested. Results indicated that in the normal pH range, removal of metformin by m-TiO2 increased up to 60% in comparison with using an unmodified catalyst. Although the highest efficiency was represented in basic (alkaline) pH range, contaminated waters usually are in a range of neutral pH. Therefore, changing pH before or after the process is not justified economically. The concentration of catalyst was another factor that was studied in the range of 0.1 to 1 g L-1. Results indicated that the increasing catalyst concentration up to 0.8 leads in augmentation of removal efficiency of metformin and in higher concentrations, the efficiency, reduced, which may be as a result of preventing crossing radioactive radiation due to solution turbidity. Furthermore, an increase in metformin concentration, reduced efficiency. Removal of metformin in the concentration of 2mg L-1 was equal to 98% and in a concentration of 10 mg L-1 was equal to 72% using modified TiO2. Also, the increase of reaction process time increased the removal efficiency, but the optimum process time was selected 30 min according to the results and economic interests. Adding anions and scavengers to the synthetic wastewater in the batch reactor also reduced the efficiency. The reason for this reduction may be decreasing free active spaces on the catalyst surface by sulfate, ultraviolet ray absorption by nitrate and using hydroxyl radicals by carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, methanol and salicylic acid scavengers. Similar results were also observed while using tap water instead of distilled water in producing synthetic wastewater and the efficiency of metformin removal decreased in comparison with using distilled water. Evaluation of the results similarly indicated conformity of the results to a Lagergren's first-order model semi first-order kinetics.

AB Sites of wastewater discharge are hotspots for pollution of freshwaters with organic micropollutants and are often associated with adverse effects to aquatic organisms. The assessment, monitoring and managment of these hotspots is challenged by variations in the pollutant mixture composition due to season, weather conditions and random spills. In this study, we unraveled temporal exposure patterns in organic micropollutant mixtures from wastewater discharge and analyzed respective acute and sublethal risks for aquatic organisms. Samples were taken from two components of a separate sewer system i) a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and ii) a rain sewer of a medium size town as well as from the receiving river in different seasons. Rain sewer samples were separately collected for rain and dry-weather conditions. We analyzed 149 compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By considering the pollution dynamics in the point sources, we reduced the complexity of pollutant mixtures by k-means clustering to a few emission groups representing temporal and weather-related pollution patterns. From these groups, we derived biological quality element (BQE) - specific risk patterns. In most cases, one main risk driving emission group and a few individual risk driving compounds were identified for each BQE. While acute risk for fish was quite low, algae were exposed to seasonally emitted herbicides (terbuthylazine, spiroxamine) and crustaceans to randomly spilled insecticides (diazinon, dimethoate). Sublethal risks for all BQE were strongly influenced by constantly emitted pollutants, above all, pharmaceuticals. Variability of risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events. Overall, the studied WWTP represented the major pollution source with a specific emission of agricultural compounds. However, the investigated rain sewer showed to be a constant pollution source due to illicit connections and was an important entry route for high loads of insecticides and biocides due to spills or incorrect disposal. By considering these pollution and risk dynamics, monitoring strategies may be optimized with a special focus on times of low flow conditions in the river, rain events and seasonally emitted risk drivers.

AB Three tertiary-treated wastewater effluents were evaluated to determine the impact of wastewater quality (i.e. effluent organic matter (EfOM), nitrite, and alkalinity) on ozone (O-3) decomposition and subsequent removal of 31 organic contaminants including endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. The O-3 dose was normalized based upon total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrite to allow comparison between the different wastewaters with respect to O-3 decomposition. EfOM with higher molecular weight components underwent greater transformation, which corresponded to increased O-3 decomposition when compared on a TOC basis. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) exposure, measured by parachlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), showed that limited (OH)-O-center dot was available for contaminant destruction during the initial stage of O-3 decomposition (t < 30 s) due to the effect of the scavenging by the water quality. Advanced oxidation using O-3 and hydrogen peroxide did not increase the net production of (OH)-O-center dot compared to O-3 under the conditions studied. EfOM reactivity impacted the removal of trace contaminants when evaluated based on the O-3:TOC ratio. Trace contaminants with second order reaction rate constants with O-3 (k(O3)) > 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and (OH)-O-center dot (k(OH)) > 10(9) M-1 s(-1), including carbamazepine, diclofenac, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan, were >95% removed independent of water quality when the O-3 exposure (integral O-3 dt) was measurable (0-0.8 mg min/L). O-3 exposure would be a conservative surrogate to assess the removal of trace contaminants that re fast-reacting with O-3. Removal of contaminants with k(O3) < 10 M-1 s(-1) and k(OH) > 10(9) M-1 s(-1), including atrazine, iopromide, diazepam, and ibuprofen, varied when O-3 exposure could not be measured, and appeared to be dependent upon the compound specific k(OH center dot) Atrazine, diazepam, ibuprofen and iopromide provided excellent linear correlation with pCBA (R-2 > 0.86) making them good indicators of (OH)-O-center dot availability.

AB The oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles (BioMnOx) has been studied with respect to possible implementation of BioMnOx in wastewater treatment. For this it would be prerequisite that microbial Mn2+ oxidation and BioMnOx-driven pollutant removal can occur in situ, i.e. in the same reactor as the removal. Here we present the in situ reactivity of BioMnOx produced by Pseudomonas putida towards a range of micro-pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations (10 mu g L-1). We found that in situ formed BioMnOx completely removed the steroid hormones estrone and 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, while only 26% removal of diclofenac was achieved. Ibuprofen, tebuconazole, carbamazepine, carbendazim, and terbutryn were not removed under in situ conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic contaminants have become one of the most serious environmental problems, and the removal of organic contaminants (e.g., dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals/drugs) and common industrial organic wastes (e.g., phenols and aromatic amines) from aqueous solutions is of special concern because they are recalcitrant and persistent in the environment. In recent years, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been gradually applied to the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater through adsorption processes. This paper reviews recent progress (145 studies published from 2010 to 2013) in the application of CNTs and their composites for the removal of toxic organic pollutants from contaminated water. The paper discusses removal efficiencies and adsorption mechanisms as well as thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. CNTs are predicted to have considerable prospects for wider application to wastewater treatment in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this work was to explore the application of microwaves for the regeneration of activated carbons spent with salicylic acid, a metabolite of a common analgesic frequently found in wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry. The exhausted carbon was treated in a quartz reactor by microwave irradiation at 2450 MHz at different temperatures and atmospheres, the regeneration efficiency being highly dependent on the operating conditions. Quantitative desorption of the pollutant was achieved at high temperature and oxidizing atmosphere, with regeneration efficiencies as high as 99% after six cycles. The stripping efficiency was superior to 95% at high temperatures and decreased at 450 degrees C. The incomplete desorption of the adsorbate at low temperature was further confirmed by the changes in the porosity observed by N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms. Hence, micropores remain blocked which results in a reduction in loading capacities in successive cycles. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The applicability of a polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) for detection and determination of perfluorinated acids and sulfonates in water was studied under field conditions. Standard POCIS configurations (i.e., pharmaceutical and pesticide) were deployed in effluent from a wastewater treatment plant for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Ten of 15 target compounds were found in POCIS, five of which were quantified in wastewater. Pest-POCIS appeared more effective for the sampling, while Pharm-POCIS had a more rapid uptake kinetic, which leads to faster saturation or equilibrium. The results showed that the pesticide configuration is probably more suitable for the sampling of this class of compounds. Based on average concentration in water over the sampling period and amount of compound adsorbed in the POCIS, we calculated sampling rates for five studied compounds and obtained values of 0.034 to 0.222 L day(-1).

AB This research investigated the biological transformation of trimethoprim (TMP). Partial TMP removal was observed in the presence of ammonia and toluene, and increasing the solids retention time from 20 days to 60 days improved TMP removal in both the nitrifying and heterotrophic bioreactors. Two TMP-related metabolites were identified, the first (5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, 5-hydroxyl) showing that a hydroxylation reaction took place, and the second (5-(1-carboxyl, 1-methoxy, 5-methoxy 1-,4-pentene) pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, 5-hydroxyl) showing that the trimethoxybenzyl ring was cleaved. This research is the first that we are aware of to report these two TMP-related byproducts. TMP metabolites show that initiating reactions take place where the electron density is highest, and that these initiating reactions shift the electron density of TMP, likely affecting the course of transformation.

AB At a pilot scale wastewater treatment plant ozonation and powdered activated carbon filtration were assessed for their efficacy to remove trace organic contaminants from secondary treated effluents. A chemical analysis of 16 organic compounds was accompanied by a comprehensive suite of in vitro and in vivo bioassays with the focus on genotoxicity to account for the potential formation of reactive oxidation products. In vitro experiments were performed with solid phase extracted water samples, in vivo experiments with native wastewater in a flow through test system on site at the treatment plant. The chemical evaluation revealed an efficient oxidation of about half of the selected compounds by more than 90% at an ozone dose of 0.7 g/g DOC. A lower oxidizing efficiency was observed for the iodinated X-ray contrast media (49-55%). Activated carbon treatment (20 mg/L) was less effective for the removal of most pharmaceuticals monitored. The urnuC assay on genotoxicity delivered results with about 90% decrease of the effects by ozonation and slightly lower efficiency for PAC treatment. However, the Ames test on mutagenicity with the strain YG7108 revealed a consistent and ozone-dose dependent increase of mutagenicity after wastewater ozonation compared to secondary treatment. Sand filtration as post treatment step reduced the ozone induced mutagenicity only partly. Also the fish early life stage toxicity test revealed an increase in mortality after ozonation and a reduced effect after sand filtration. Only activated carbon treatment reduced the fish mortality compared to conventional treatment on control level. Likewise the in vivo genotoxicity detected with the comet assay using fish erythrocytes confirmed an increased (geno-)toxicity after ozonation, an effect decrease after sand-filtration and no toxic effects after activated carbon treatment.
   This study demonstrates the need for a cautious selection of methods for the evaluation of advanced (oxidative) treatment technologies and of the effectiveness of post-treatments for elimination of adverse effects caused by oxidative treatments case by case.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) have become one of the antibiotic families most frequently found in all kind of environmental waters. In the present work, the presence of 16 SAs and one of their acetylated metabolites in different water matrices of the Ebro River basin has been evaluated during two different sampling campaigns carried out in 2007 and 2008. Influent and effluent samples from seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), together with a total of 28 river water samples were analyzed by on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromathography-tandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS). Sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine were the SAs most frequently detected in WWTPs (96-100%), showing also the highest concentrations, ranging from 27.2 ng L-1 to 596 ng L-1 for sulfamethoxazole and from 3.7 ng L-1 to 227 ng L-1 for sulfapyridine. Sulfamethoxazole was also the SA most frequently detected in surface waters (85% of the samples) at concentrations between 11 ng L-1 and 112 ng L-1 In order to assess the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment in degrading SAs, removal efficiencies in the seven WWTPs were calculated for each individual SA (ranging from 4% to 100%) and correlated to the corresponding hydraulic retention times or residence times of the SAs in the plants. SAs half-lives were also estimated, ranging from to 2.5 hours (sulfadimethoxine) to 128 h (sulfamethazine). The contribution of the WWTPs to the presence of SAs depends on both the load of SAs discharging on the surface water from the WWTP effluent but also on the flow of the receiving waters in the discharge sites and the dilution exerted; WWTP4 exerts the highest pressure on the receiving water course. Finally, the potential environmental risk posed by SAs was evaluated calculating the hazard quotients (HQ) to different non-target organisms in effluent and river water. The degree of susceptibility resulted in algae>daphnia>fish. Sulfamethoxazole was the only SA posing a risk to algae in effluent water, with an HQ>7. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of studying the biodegradability of pharmaceutical compounds is to evaluate their behaviors in relation to the treatment processes generally used in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants. The antibiotic norfloxacin was found to be a recalcitrant compound. The studies conducted showed norfloxacin removal rates of 12% and 18% when biomasses from treatments with activated sludge and anaerobic biodigesters, respectively, were used without acclimatization. This suggests that anaerobic digestion shows better performance for norfloxacin removal. Ecotoxicological tests, using the luminescent marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri as the test organism, show that anaerobic digestion could eliminate the toxicity of the antibiotic norfloxacin, even though total degradation of the drug was not observed. The release of norfloxacin during cell lysis suggests the importance of controlling this phenomenon in biological treatment systems that handle wastewater contaminated with norfloxacin, thus preventing the return of this drug to the environment.

AB Processes for the removal of organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) from wastewater treatment plant's (WWTPs) effluents have been tested over decades, and have recently found their way into practice. Operators of WWTPs are confronted with the question of efficiency and the choice of economical process (combination). So far, a systematic approach regarding the selection of the appropriate process (combinations) is missing. There is no information available which technology is best suited for removal of OMPs and other conventional pollutants for good conditions in waterbodies. This study evaluates 52 pilot and full-scale studies regarding their removal efficiencies of various OMPs by advanced processes (adsorption and ozonation) in combination with/without filtration. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the complex state of knowledge and show that technical synergy effects enable the reduction of a wide range of OMP in combination with other conventional parameters, e.g. solids and phosphorous.

AB The combination of systems containing biopolymers surfactants is found in diverse formulated products such as wastewater treatment, food, drugs (pharmaceuticals), cosmetics, paints, detergents, pesticides and also in processes such as polymer synthesis, wastewater treatment and enhanced oil recovery. In this work, we examine the effect of surfactant: sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on solutions containing biopolymer: xanthan gum, alkali and oil by interfacial tension (IFT), conductometric and rheological measurements. To this end, the method of experiments planning was adopted. Previous study on the conductivity profiles of SDS/Xanthan gum and salt systems had shown the existence of interaction and the curves presented linearity as expected. The results show an important effect on surface tension, IFT, conductometric and rheological properties on the studied systems; also, they indicate an important action of surfactant SDS, oil and biopolymer greatly influences IFT.

AB Recovering nutrients from wastewater as sustainable bio-based products provides a key solution to major environmental problems. Classical technology development approaches for resource recovery largely ignore the real-world variability in raw waste materials, which currently hinders the successful implementation of recovery strategies. A major challenge is to create a consistent and environmentally friendly supply of high-quality end-products that can compete with fossil-derived products currently on the market. This paper suggests the use of a Quality by Design approach as adapted from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure a high standard of quality consistency. Key elements of this approach involve mathematical models and integrated design-control strategies that support the production of high-quality marketable end-products from variable input waste and wastewater streams. Further research in terms of cost evaluation and optimisation of such approach for resource recovery applications is needed. A regulatory framework for Process Analytical Technology implementation in the field is also suggested.

AB In this study, the viability of using electrocoagulation process as a method for pharmaceuticals removal from real municipal wastewater was demonstrated. Batch experimental runs were performed using a simple laboratory scale electrochemical reactor with aluminium and stainless steel as anode and cathode, respectively. Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and amoxicillin (AMX) were selected as representative of pharmaceuticals frequently detected in the aquatic environment. The effects of varying experimental parameters namely current density (0.3, 0.5 1.15 and 1.8 mA cm(-2)), initial pharmaceutical concentration (0.01, 4 and 10 mg L-1), electrolysis duration (3, 6 and 19 h) and application mode (continuous vs. intermittent) on pharmaceutical removal efficiencies were evaluated. High pharmaceutical abatement was recorded at elevated current density and prolonged electrolysis duration due to additional electro-generated coagulant species in solution.

AB This study presents the treatment of a high strength pharmaceutical wastewater by sono-Fenton-sorption (SFS). Better results were observed with SFS compared to individual processes and the maximum chemical oxygen demand reduction observed after 180min of treatment with SFS, sono-Fenton, and sono-sorption was 71.9, 48.4, and 43.75%, respectively. The effect of parameters such as initial concentration, dosage of Fenton's reagent, sorbent dosage, and pattern of addition of iron on the performance of SFS was analyzed. The sonosorption and SFS were found to fit well with Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. Fourier transformed IR studies of effluent and sorbent before and after treatment confirmed the oxidative degradation of pharmaceutical effluent. Toxicity of the effluent was considerably reduced after the treatment and the electrical energy consumption was significantly reduced, when sonolysis was coupled with sorption and Fenton's process (SFS).

AB In the present research, removal of a common pharmaceutical contaminant from wastewater was studied using micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) process with applying a laboratory-scale system. Sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant was used in this process. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied for evaluating the MEUF process performance. The results obtained from the experiments showed that sotalol hydrochloride drug rejection using ultrafiltration membrane was maximum 32.41%, while by adding the surfactant and forming the micelle this amount increased to 96.82%. By using the RSM and investigating the interaction of surfactant concentration, transmembrane pressure (TMP), and pH, it was found that the surfactant concentration had the most impact on the rejection. Moreover, among the studied parameters, TMP and surfactant concentration played an important role in variations of the permeate flux.

AB According to European Union Council directive 2001/83, an application for the marketing authorization of a medicinal product shall be accompanied by an environmental risk assessment, including an exposure assessment. Computerized exposure models constitute an important tool in predicting environmental exposure to substances yet to be introduced on the market. This paper reports the process of identifying appropriate exposure models for estimating PECs (Predicted Environmental Concentrations) for pharmaceuticals and veterinary products, focusing on emissions to Swedish aquatic and terrestrial environments via water and sludge from sewage treatment plants. From a large number of information sources, a set of 181 potentially relevant exposure models was identified. A process of scrutinizing and testing these models resulted in a final selection of two models, namely SimpleTreat 3.1 that is used to estimate distribution and elimination of chemicals in sewage treatment plants (resulting in a PEC), and VetPec, suited for veterinary products, that estimates PEC in soil (including pore water), groundwater, and surface water. It is concluded that there is still potential for further development of exposure model(s) specifically designed for pharmaceutical emissions to the Nordic environment and climate. Furthermore, increased regulatory data requirements would facilitate the use of existing models, and improve the quality of the output data from these models.

AB Treating effluents - industrial as well as domestic - is an area which needs concerted effort and serious attention. We need to deepen our understanding of what membranes can do taking into consideration the extremes of operation and complex effluent characteristics. Nanofiltration has proved effective in color removal of textile effluents and in pharmaceuticals, where 90% removal is reported and widely practiced. Successful case studies are presented along with revamp projects. In the case of RO, which is the tightest of separation techniques for water and non-water streams, use of fouling resistant (FR) and high surface area elements is emphasized. Technological limitations on case by case basis vis-a-vis RO/NF/UF/MF/ED is widely discussed. Modularization technology leading to reduction in running and installation costs is strongly advocated. Newer membrane materials are touched upon driven more by application rather than system specific. Industrial effluents and sewage constitute a major chunk of recycle operations to the extent of 65% in some countries. In one such city sewage RO plant, the operational cost has been reduced to 31% by retrofitting the pre-treatment section. Some of the Mega SWRO plants in the Middle East have gone into demo-UF plants. The arsenic contamination in major available resources of third world countries has reached alarming proportions. Technoeconomic viable solutions vis-a-vis available membrane operations are suggested.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate the occurrence and fate of the antidiabetic metformin (MF) and its transformation products (TPs) in wastewater and surface water samples. New TPs of MF were approached by electrochemical degradation with a boron-doped-diamond electrode (at 15 V for 10 min). 2,4-Diamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-DAT), methylbiguanide (MBG), 2-amino-4-methylamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-AMT) and 4-amino-2-iminol-methyl-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine (4,2,1-AIMT) were identified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) and accurate mass fragmentation. However, the well-known transformation product guanyl urea (GU) could not be formed electrochemically. In samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), 2,4-AMT and 2,4-DAT showed an increasing trend from influents to effluents, which implies formation of the TPs during WWT. MBG is also formed by hydrolysis of MF and therefore didn't show this trend in WWTPs. Compared to GU, the concentrations of other TPs are generally three orders of magnitude lower. MBG and 2,4-DAT were also detected in surface water which was impacted by waste water, while 4,2,1-AIMT could not be detected in any sample. The concentrations of MF were in an expected range for influent (14 to 95 mu g/l), effluent (0.7 to 6.5 mu g/l), surface water (up to 234 ng/l) and tap water (34 ng/l). GU concentrations, however, were in one of the two investigated WWTP much higher in the influent (between 158 mu g/l and 2100 mu g/l) than in the effluent (between 26 and 810 mu g/l). This is a rather unexpected result which has not been reported yet. Obviously, GU has been already formed in parts of the sewer system from MF or from other biguanide compounds like antidiabetics or disinfection chemicals. Furthermore, lower concentrations of GU in the effluents than in the influents indicate degradation processes of guanyl urea in the waste water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was investigated with the aim of evaluating its potential for cytostatic drug and cytotoxicity bioremoval. The toxicity removal was assessed from biomarker test. CP removal of up to 80% was achieved under the operating conditions studied (HRT of 48 h and a SRT of 50 days). The increase of TMP was associated with an increase of supernatant toxicity as if fouling led to retention of the toxicity. Peaks of supernatant cytotoxicity were correlated with peaks in supernatant humic acid contents. It may suggest that molecules with a toxic effect may be adsorbed or entrapped in humic acids substances. Our study then points out that advances in wastewater treatment using an MBR can provide a suitable process for lowering CP concentrations before discharge into the aqueous environment. However, a tertiary treatment is necessary if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent surveys of aquatic habitats suggest that organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) may be common in aquatic ecosystems. However, relatively little is known about the impacts of OWCs on amphibians. We studied the lethal and sublethal effects of three OWCs (acetaminophen, caffeine, and triclosan) on American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles. High concentrations of triclosan increased activity, whereas acetaminophen had a significant effect on activity but there was no discernable pattern or trend with concentration. Caffeine did not affect activity in B. americanus tadpoles. None of the OWCs we studied had a significant effect on growth. Caffeine had no effect on survivorship. Higher concentrations of acetaminophen increased mortality. Intermediate concentrations of triclosan had a negative effect on survivorship, but the highest concentration apparently had a positive effect on survivorship. Our results suggest that there is variation in the toxicity of the three OWCs we studied.

AB In the cases in which the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data available in the literature only include pretreatment information, there is a need to use a model for waste treatment to estimate the post-treatment data. In other cases, it is desirable to back calculate pretreatment information from final environmental emissions. This paper presents treatment modules for Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Solvent Incinerator, and Solvent Recovery. The modules were developed based on design equations and average Literature data. The methodology and basis for the models are presented and results are shown for the three modules. The modules developed present an easy and scientifically-based method to obtain post-treatment LCI data. The modules are expected to be particularly useful in the instances when process design techniques are employed for the estimation of LCI data, especially in chemical, biochemical and pharmaceutical industries.

   Petrochemical waste; Transformation products; Risk assessment
AB Pharmaceuticals, such as dipyrone (DIP), paracetamol (PCT), and propranolol (PPN), are widely used analgesics and beta-blockers with the greatest presence in wastewaters and, consequently, in natural waters. The present work evaluated solar light-driven photocatalyst from petrochemical industrial waste (PW) as a strategy for the degradation of three pharmaceuticals in different water matrices (distilled water-DW, simulated wastewater-SWW, and real hospital wastewater-RHWW). All experiments were carried out in a solar photo-reactor with a capacity of 1 L and the experimental condition employed was a catalyst concentration of 350 mg L-1 at pH 5.0; these conditions were selected considering the Doehlert design validation spreadsheet and the desirability function. All materials prepared were conveniently characterized by zeta potential, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DRUV), and infrared spectroscopy. According to the results of the characterization, significant differences have been observed between the PW and the photocatalyst such as vibrational modes, optical absorption gap, and acid-basic characteristics on the surface, which suggests the potential use of the photocatalyst in the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern. Based on pharmaceutical degradation, DIP showed the highest photosensitivity (87.5%), and therefore the highest photocatalytic degradation followed by PPN; both compounds achieved final concentrations below the limit of quantification of the chromatographic method in DW. However, PCT was the most recalcitrant pharmaceutical in all matrices. Radicals from chromophoric natural organic matter (NOM) could improve PCT degradation in the SWW matrix (56%). Nevertheless, the results in RHWW showed a matrix effect with decreased the oxidation percentages (DIP-99%; PPN-71%; PCT-17%); hence, the addition of an oxidant such as H2O2 was studied as a pharmaceutical oxidation boost in RHWW. PPN was the molecule most sensitive to this strategy of oxidation (98%). Furthermore, 20 transformation products (TPs) generated throughout the treatment were identified by LC-QTOF MS using a customized TPs database. According to quantitative structure activity relationship (Q)SAR analysis, more than 75% of the TPs identified were not biodegradable. About 35% of them have oral toxicity characteristics indicated by Cramer's rules, and the DIP TPs represent high toxicity for different trophic levels.

AB Societal Impact Statement Rapidly growing global populations mandate greater crop productivity despite increasingly scarce natural resources, including freshwater. The adoption of sustainable agricultural practices seek to address such issues, but an unintended consequence is the exposure of agricultural soils and associated biota to emerging contaminants including azole pharmaceutical antifungals. We show that environmentally relevant exposure to three commonly prescribed azole antifungals can reduce mycorrhizal P-33 transfer from the soil into the host plant. This suggests that exposure to azoles may have a significant impact on mycorrhizal-mediated transfer of nutrients in soil-plant systems. Understanding the unintended consequences of sustainable agricultural practices is needed to ensure the security and safety of future food production systems. Sustainable farming practices are increasingly necessary to meet the demands of a growing population under constraints imposed by climate change. These practices, in particular the reuse of wastewater and amending soil with wastewater derived biosolids, provide a pathway for man-made chemicals to enter the agricultural environment. Among the chemicals commonly detected in wastewater and biosolids are pharmaceutical azole antifungals. Fungi, in particular mycorrhiza-forming fungal symbionts of plant roots, are key drivers of nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system. As such, greater understanding of the impacts of azole antifungal exposure in agricultural systems is urgently needed. We exposed wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. 'Skyfall') and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to environmentally relevant concentrations of three azole antifungals (clotrimazole, miconazole nitrate and fluconazole). We traced the mycorrhizal-acquired P-33 from the soil into the host plant in contaminated versus non-contaminated soils and found P-33 transfer from mycorrhizal fungi to host plants was reduced in soils containing antifungals. This represents a potentially major disruption to soil nutrient flows as a result of soil contamination. Our work raises the major issue of exposure of soil biota to pharmaceuticals such as azole antifungals, introduced via sustainable agricultural practices, as a potentially globally important disruptive influence on soil nutrient cycles. The impacts of these compounds on non-target organisms, beneficial mycorrhizal fungi in particular, could have major implications on security and sustainability of future food systems.

AB In the present work we compared the biological activity of DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF as molecules of most biodegradation pathways of DCF and selected transformation products (2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 2,6-dichloroaniline) which are produced during AOPs, such as ozonation and UV/H2O2. We also examined the interaction of DCF with chlorogenic acid (CGA). CGA is commonly used in human diet and entering the environment along with waste mainly from the processing and brewing of coffee and it can be toxic for microorganisms included in activated sludge. In the present experiment the evaluation of following parameters was performed: E. coli K-12 cells viability, growth inhibition of E. coli K-12 culture, LC50 and mortality of Chironomus aprilinus, genotoxicity, sodA promoter induction and ROS generation. In addition the reactivity of E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strain in wastewater matrices was measured. The results showed the influence of DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF on E. coli K-12 cells viability and bacteria growth, comparable to AOPs by-products. The highest toxicity was observed for selected, tested AOPs by-products, in comparison to the DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF. Genotoxicity assay indicated that 2,6-dichloroaniline (AOPs by-product) had the highest toxic effect. The oxidative stress assays revealed that the highest level of ROS generation and sodA promoter induction were obtained for DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF, compared to other tested compounds. We have also found that there is an interaction between chlorogenic acid and DCF, which resulted in increased toxicity of the mixture of the both compounds to E. coli K-12, comparable to parent chemicals. The strongest response of E. coli SM biosensor strain with recA:luxCDABE genetic construct in filtered treated wastewaters, comparable to control sample was noticed. It indicates, that E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strains is a good tool for bacteria monitoring in wastewater environment. Due to toxicity and biological activity of tested DCF transformation products, there is a need to use additional wastewater treatment systems for wastewater contaminated with pharmaceutical residues.

AB The goal of this paper was to develop a modified photo-Fenton treatment able to degrade micro pollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents at a neutral pH with minimal iron and H2O2 concentrations. Complexation of Fe by ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) leads to stabilization and solubilization of Fe at natural pH. Photo-Fenton experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant. Samples were treated with solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by HPLC-Qsrap-MS. The rapid degradation of contaminants within the first minutes of illumination and the low detrimental impact on degradation of bicarbonates present in the water suggested that radical species other than HO center dot are responsible for the efficiency of such photo-Fenton process. Disinfection of MWTP effluents by the same process showed promising results, although disinfection was not complete.

AB There is a growing concern about pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic environment. Many of these compounds cannot be removed completely in sewage treatment plants. To remove these unwanted medicines from water, oxidative degradation techniques may complement the current purification steps. In this paper we studied the effect of advanced oxidation on the cytostatic drug cyclophosphamide (CP) by comparing thermal plasma activation with UV/H2O2 treatment. Plasma activated water (PAW) contains highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as a result of electric gas discharges in air over water. CP solutions in tap water were oxidized over a period of 120 min and subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS to measure the compound degradation. Plasma activation was applied at 50, 100, or 150 W electric power input and UV/H2O2 treatment was carried out by the addition of H(2)O(2 )and placing an UV-C source above the test solution for immediate irradiation. The oxidative degradation of CP in PAW resulted in a complete degradation within 80 min at 150 W. CP was also completely degraded within 60 min applying UV/H2O2 oxidation. Both treatment techniques do induce different structural changes, demonstrating that CP is completely degraded in tap water.

AB This study reported significant suppressive matrix effects in analyses of six pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in activated sludge, sterilized activated sludge and untreated sewage by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative matrix evaluation on selected PPCPs supplemented the limited quantification data of matrix effects on mass spectrometric determination of PPCPs in complex environment samples. The observed matrix effects were chemical-specific and matrix-dependent, with the most pronounced average effect (-55%) was found on sulfadiazine in sterilized activated sludge. After correcting the matrix effects by post-spiking known amount of PPCPs, the removal mechanisms and biotransformation kinetics of selected PPCPs in activated sludge system were revealed by batch experiment. Experimental data elucidated that the removal of target PPCPs in the activated sludge process was mainly by biotransformation while contributions of adsorption, hydrolysis and volatilization could be neglected. High biotransformation efficiency (52%) was observed on diclofenac while other three compounds (sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and roxithromycin) were partially biotransformed by similar to 40%. The other two compounds, trimethoprim and carbamazepine, showed recalcitrant to biotransformation of the activated sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of 4 typical pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), i.e. clofibric acid (CFA), triclosan (TCS), carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) in sewage sludge was investigated during anaerobic digestions (ADs) under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The performances of ADs were enhanced with ultrasonic, mechanical rotary disc or enzymatic treatments. Ultrasonic pre-treatment could enhance the performances on the removal of PhACs better than ultrasonic post-treatment. CFA, TCS, CBZ, and DCF were finally reduced by 73%, 76%, 73%, and 64%, respectively, during thermophilic AD (TAD) combined with ultrasonic pre-treatment for 30 min at sound energy density 0.05 W/mL at SRT 15 d. For ADs combined with rotary disc pre-treatment or post-treatment, the removal of PhACs would be improved by less than 10%. Three selected enzymes, papain, cellulose and lysozyme showed different effects on the removal of PhACs during ADs. TCS could obtain the best removal, which was up to 82% and 81% in mesophilic AD (MAD) and TAD processes enhanced with lysozyme at SRT 15 d. On the whole, the increases on SRTs would improve the removal of PhACs during ADs and also the enhancement with enzymolyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spiramycin removal from wastewater using four nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NF270, NF90, ESNA1-K1 and ESNA1-LF2-LD) was studied. The effects of operating pressure, feed temperature, feed concentration, cation and anion ions on the permeate flux rate and spiramycin rejection were investigated. The results show that increasing operating pressure resulted in the increase of both permeate flux and spiramycin rejection. The flux rate increased almost linearly with temperature, while the spiramycin rejection decreased. The permeate flux rate declined relatively with increasing feed concentration of spiramycin for NF270 and ESNA1-LF2-LD membranes compared with NF90 and ESNA1-K membranes. The presence of cations reduced spiramycin rejection, with the strength of influence for the NF270 NF membrane following the order Mg2+>Ca2+>K+. The presence of anions also resulted in decreased spiramycin rejection, the strength of the effect following the order NO3- > Cl- > SO42- for the NF270 membrane.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant medication with highly persistent properties in the aquatic environment, where it has the potential to affect nontarget biota. Because CBZ and many other pharmaceuticals are not readily removed in conventional sewage treatment plants (STP), additional STP effluent treatment technologies are being evaluated and implemented. Whole effluent ozonation is a prospective method to remove pharmaceuticals such as CBZ, yet knowledge on the toxicity of CBZ ozonation byproducts (OBPs) is lacking. This study presents, for the first time, in vivo individual and mixture toxicity of four putative OBPs, that is, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide, 10,11-Dihydrocarbamazepine, 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM), and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. BQM and BQD were isolated from the ozonated solution as they were not commercially available. The study confirmed that the OBP mixture caused embryotoxic responses comparable to that of ozonated CBZ. Individual compound embryotoxicity assessment further revealed that BQM and BQD were the drivers of embryotoxicity. OBP chemical stability in ozonated CBZ water solution during 2 week dark storage at 22 degrees C was also assessed. The OBP concentrations remained over time, except for BQD which decreased by 94%. Meanwhile, ozonated CBZ persistently induced embryotoxicity over 2 week storage, potentially illustrating environmental concern.

AB Due to many folds increase in application of human and veterinary medicines, pharmaceuticals, a new category of pollutants, have emerged in our environment. They exist as residues in rivers, sewage effluents, streams, surface, ground, and potable water. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one such drug that is used as an antipyretic and analgesic medicine. It is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and is easily available in the market because no medical prescription is necessary for its purchase and use. Paracetamol remains physiologically active even after their expiry period. Their detection in the environment in bioactive form has resulted in adverse effects on nontarget species. To determine the effect of paracetamol on aquatic photosynthetic organic (Cyanobacteria-Nostoc muscorum), present study was performed. Paracetamol (25 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 75 mg/L, 100, 125, and 150 mg/L) exposure showed toxic responses on the test organism by generating oxidative stress (MDA, H2O2,O2.-). Paracetamol caused a significant decrease in growth of cyanobacteria and showed EC(50)113.68 mg/L after the 6th day of treatment. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll, carotenoid, and phycobiliprotein) decreased with paracetamol increase. Antioxidant enzymatic (SOD, CAT, APX, GST, and GR) and osmolyte (Proline) also increased with increase in paracetamol to counteract the oxidative stress.

AB A long-term investigation, which covered 10 sampling campaigns over 3 years, was performed to evaluate the occurrence, removal and risk of 10 pharmaceuticals in 2 full-scale sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Guangdong, South China. Target pharmaceuticals except for clofibrate and ibuprofen were detected in every sample, with mean concentrations of 12.5-685.6 and 7.9-130.3ng/L in the influent and effluent, respectively. Salicylic acid was the most abundant compound in both the influents and effluents in the two STPs. For most pharmaceuticals, the seasonal variation in the influent showed the highest concentrations in January and lowest concentrations in July due to their consumption and rainfall. Ibuprofen and fenoprofen presented high removal rates (>90%) and some of the targets such as gemfibrozil, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid and diclofenac were detectable with significantly higher mass loads in effluents than in influents. Studies of the five efficiently eliminated pharmaceuticals show that the primary treatment and secondary treatment contributed to most pharmaceutical removal, the anoxic tank made a negligible contribution to their elimination. According to the results produced from the calculation of the risk quotient, only diclofenac might pose a risk to the aquatic environment.

AB The fate of pharmaceutical residues in treatment of WWTP sludge was evaluated during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) and six sanitization technologies (pasteurization, thermal hydrolysis, advanced oxidation processes using Fenton's reaction, ammonia treatment, thermophilic dry digestion, and thermophilic anaerobic digestion). Sludge spiked with a selection of 13 substances was used and in total 23 substances were detected. A correlation between substance lipophilicity and sludge partitioning was found after sample centrifugation, with e.g., SSRI drugs (90-99%) and estrogens (96-98%) mainly found in the solid phase. A correlation between lipophilicity and persistence of pharmaceutical residues during AD was also detected, indicating that hydrophobic substances are less available to degrading microorganisms. Overall, AD was found to be the most effective technology in reducing a wide spectrum of organic substances (in average ca 30% reduction). Similar effects were obtained for both AD treatments, suggesting that temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic) is less important for micropollutant reduction. Advanced oxidation processes using Fenton's reaction also affected several compounds, including substances showing general stability over the range of treatments such as carbamazepine, propranolol, and sertraline. Pasteurization, ammonia treatment, and thermophilic dry digestion exhibited relatively modest reductions. Interestingly, only thermal hydrolysis efficiently removed the ecotoxicologically potent estrogenic compounds from the sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution and seasonal variation of fifteen antibiotics belonging to three classes (sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines) were investigated in Lake Chaohu, China. The concentrations of the selected antibiotics in the surface water, eight major inflowing rivers and sewage treatment plant (STP) samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin were the predominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 95.6 and 383.4 ng L-1, respectively, in the river samples. In Lake Chaohu, the western inflowing rivers (the Nanfei and Shiwuli Rivers) were the primary import routes for the antibiotics, and the domestic effluent from four STPs were considered the primary source of the antibiotics. The level of antibiotics in Lake Chaohu clearly varied with seasonal changes, and the highest detectable frequencies and mean concentrations were found during the winter. The quality of water downstream of Lake Chaohu was influenced by the lake, and the results of risk assessment of the antibiotics on aquatic organisms suggested that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in the surface water of Lake Chaohu and inflowing rivers might pose a high risk to algae and plants.

AB Tissue-specific bioconcentration of selected antidepressants was studied in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to undiluted effluent from a Swedish municipal sewage treatment plant for 13 days. Citalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine were found in the brains and livers of most fish, but not in blood plasma or muscle. Venlafaxine was the only drug found in plasma (3/20 fish). Fluoxetine was not detected in any fish tissue, in accordance with a low concentration in the effluent and a comparably high limit of quantification in tissues. Concentrations of citalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine in fish brain were up to 1/12, 1/8 and 1/26, respectively, of the lowest concentrations found in the brains of mammals treated with therapeutic doses. Thus, given coexposure to several antidepressants and an assumed similar potency in fish, the margin of safety for targetrelated effects in fish residing in effluent-dominated streams is relatively low. Furthermore, the non-detectable levels of these drugs in blood plasma suggest that analyses of concentrations in target tissues (brain) would be more informative in field studies and other studies with environmentally realistic exposure concentrations.

AB Many human pharmaceuticals, with many modes of action, are present in the aquatic environment. It is very difficult to know which of these might pose a threat to aquatic organisms, and which are of no environmental concern. Hence, it is difficult to design a research strategy that most effectively maximizes the possibility of identifying those pharmaceuticals that do pose the greatest risk. We consider that steroidal pharmaceuticals, and drugs that inhibit the actions of endogenous steroids, merit more research than they have yet received so far. We analyzed a comprehensive U.K. database covering all prescriptions of pharmaceuticals to determine the annual usage of all steroid and anti-steroid pharmaceuticals. We found that both progestogens and glucocorticoids are used in much greater amounts than estrogens, whereas androgens are used in similar amounts to estrogens. There is also very significant use of anti-estrogens, anti-androgens, and anti-mineralocorticoids. All these pharmaceuticals are likely to be constantly entering the aquatic environment in effluents from sewage treatment works. River concentrations of these pharmaceuticals will be very low; probably in the ng or sub-ng/l range. However, such low concentrations mat still pose a threat to aquatic organisms, especially fish.

AB Little is known about the fate of cytostatics after their elimination from humans into the environment. Being often very toxic compounds, their quantification in hospital effluents may be necessary to individualise the putative magnitude of pollution problems. We therefore developed a method for the determination of the very important group of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin, and daunorubicin) in hospital effluents. Waste water samples were enriched by solid phase extraction (concentration factor 100), analysed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and monitored by fluorescence detection. This method is reproducible and accurate within a range of 0.1-5 mu g l(-1) for all compounds (limits of quantification: 0.26-0.29 mu g l(-1); recoveries > 80%). The applicability of the method was proven by chemical analysis of hospital sewage samples (range: 0.1-1.4 mu g l(-1) epirubicin and 0.1-0.5 mu g l(-1) doxorubicin). Obtained over a time period of one month, the results were in line with those calculated by an input-output model. These investigations show that the examined cytostatics are easily detectable and that the presented method is suitable to estimate the dimension of pharmaceutical contamination originating from hospital effluents.

AB The production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have grownominously over the last 3-4 decades. PPCPs, often considered as emerging contaminants, are being perceived as a serious risk to receiving environments, especially water bodies, due to their ecotoxicological effects. Further, many of the PPCPs are generally persistent, leading to their environmental accumulation, which is evident from the several PPCPs detected in rivers, lakes, groundwater, and soils at variable concentration levels. Although high-end and energy intensive systems like membrane processes are fairly effective in the removal of PPCPs from water orwastewater, conventional treatment technologies often fail to remove PPCPs, and hence treated effluents from various sewage treatment plants have been reported to contain PPCPs from parts per million (ppm) to parts per trillion (ppt) levels. This chapter will discuss the cost effective technologies, especially adsorptive removal methods, being developed for the remediation, recovery, and treatment of PPCPs. A series of low-cost natural and synthetic adsorbents are being investigated, and have shown variable effectiveness and potential for the removal of PPCPs. The chapter will include a state-of-art literature summary on various low-cost adsorbents tested for the removal of selective PPCPs.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used in human and veterinary medicine, representing potential aquatic environmental contamination. This study aimed to perform an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of NSAIDs diclofenac (Dic) and ibuprofen (Ibu) in cities of the state of Parana, Brazil, over the course of three years, by using available data from the Brazilian Public Health System. The environmental risk (ER) was assessed by employing the European Medicines Agency (EMeA) approach, and predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated. The refined PECs considered the drug metabolism and the excretion data, and also the sewage treatment plant removal rates of biological filters and activated sludge processes to define environmental scenarios. References to the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for these pharmaceuticals were considered, and the PEC/PNEC ratio was calculated; ratio values >= 1 suggested an ER. Environmental risk was conducted on several cities, and the lack of an adequate sanitation system in the majority of Parana cities forecasts a significant concern with the exposure to possible environmental damages in those cities. The high PEC/PNEC ratios in several cities showed that current usage patterns of these drugs constitute an environmental issue in need of resolution by health and environmental authorities.

AB Hospital effluents have been usually known by the microbiological pollution they cause, but only recently they have been considered a significant source of aquatic environmental pollution due to the presence of medicines in these effluents. In this context, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is presented for the most used intravenous antibiotics in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a hospital in Curitiba (Brazil). The amount of antibiotics used in the ICU was evaluated during 18 months (June 2006 until November 2007), in order to calculate the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC1). Antibiotic excretion data (on its original form) and the removal of the selected drugs in the sewage treatment plants based on the activated sludge system were used to calculate. respectively, PEC2 and PEC2r. The Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) of pharmaceuticals was also considered to assess the environmental risk by calculating the PEC/PNEC ratios. All PECs were >= 1 ng L-1. The worst-case PEC estimations (PEC1 and PEC2) were observed for sodic ceftriaxone, sodic cefazolin, meropenem, ampicillin, cefepime and sodic piperacillin. PEC/PNEC ratios showed that, given the present pattern of usage, high aquatic environmental risk is expected for these antibiotics. Further studies should be carried out to elucidate their contribution to increasing antimicrobial multi-drug-resistant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, the electrocoagulation (EC) performance of a Mg-Mg system was applied for the industrial wastewater treatment, from an industrial park that covers different activities such as: food, automotive, pharmaceutical, chemistry and cosmetics, after primary clarification. The effects of major operating parameters such as pH, reaction time, and current density were investigated for chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, and turbidity removal efficiency. The batch system was found convenient, achieving 63.52% COD, 96% color, and 99.32% turbidity removal at optimized operating conditions of pH 7.12, reaction time of 75 min, and current density of 201.5 A/m(2). On the other hand, for continuous EC, the process removed approximately 46.58%, 95.96%, and 87.19% of the COD, color, and turbidity respectively, at 90 min of retention time, current density 440 A/m(2), and a rate of 20 mL/min. Additionally, concerning nutrient removal (N and P), the EC system with Mg electrodes was highly efficient; batch treatment removed 97% of total phosphorus and 67% of ammoniacal nitrogen, whereas the continuous treatment removed 98.5% of total phosphorus and 83% of ammoniacal nitrogen. The sludge characterization before and after EC treatment was made by SEM, EDS, Fluorescence spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy. Minerals such as chlorite, crossite, richterite, pyroaurite, langbeinite as weel as aliphatic and polysubstituted aromatics compounds, sulfates and phosphates inorganic ions, and organic phosphorus were reduced. The energy cost in the batch EC is US$0.05/m(3). A numerical CFD model was used to estimate the velocity fields and guarantee the presence of turbulent kinetic energy within a continuous flow reactor.

AB This work reports on the variation in wastewater treatment works (WwTW) influent concentrations of a wide variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), their removal efficiency, effluent concentrations and potential risks to the aquatic environment. The research is based on data generated from two large UK-wide WwTW monitoring programmes. Taking account of removal of parent compound from the aqueous phase during treatment in combination with estimates of dilution available it is possible to prioritise the APIs of greatest risk of exceeding estimates of predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) in receiving waters for all WwTW in the UK. The majority of substances studied were removed to a high degree, although with significant variation, both within and between WwTW. Poorer removal (between influent and effluent) was observed for ethinyloestradiol, diclofenac, propranolol, the macrolide antibiotics, fluoxetine, tamoxifen and carbamazepine. All except the last two of these substances were present in effluents at concentrations higher than their respective estimated PNEC (based on measurement of effluents from 45 WwTW on 20 occasions). Based on available dilution data as many as 890 WwTW in the UK (approximately 13% of all WwTW) may cause exceedances of estimated riverine PNECs after mixing of their effluents with receiving waters. The overall degree of risk is driven by the toxicity value selected, which in itself is controlled by the availability of reliable and relevant ecotoxicological data and consequently the safety factors applied. The dataset and discussion, provides information to assist in the future management of these types of chemicals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study the enzymatic degradation of hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) was investigated in artificial mixtures and in real wastewater by fungal laccases (Trametes versicolor, Myceliophthora thermophila). Several studies have already reported the successful enzymatic degradation of EDCs. However, with regards to a large-scale application, the influence of some factors such as enzyme immobilization and costs are often lacking. Furthermore, the majority of studies investigated the removal of EDCs by chemical analysis only, while our main interest was to use bioassays to study the decrease in the endocrine activity. The removal of estrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic activity was assessed by yeast-based reporter gene assays and the degradation of industrial chemicals by an additional chemical analysis. It was demonstrated that the degradation of hormones and EDCs by laccases is feasible even at very low enzyme concentrations (2.8 ABTS U/L). In the artificial mixtures the main removal mechanism was adsorption onto immobilization supports. In binary mixtures, immobilized lactase was best in removing EDCs within the first 6 h of exposure (83% for T. versicolor and 87% for M. thermophila), but in the course of the experiment adsorption superimposed this removal after 24 h (99% after 24 h). A similar pattern was seen in wastewater, but with less carrier material (lower adsorption) and a constant enzyme activity, immobilized lactase showed the best removal rates of estrogenic (82% removal after 24 h) and androgenic activity (99% removal after 6 h). With this in mind, this enzymatic technology can be a valuable addition to other treatment technologies.

AB The reaction of the common pain reliever acetaminophen (paracetamol, 4-acetamidophenol) with hypochlorite was investigated over time under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. Initially, the reaction was studied in pure water at neutral pH (7.0), a range of reaction times (2-90 min), and a molar excess of hypochlorite (2-57 times) relative to the acetaminophen concentration. The reaction was monitored using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) with ultraviolet absorbance, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric detection. At 1 mu mol/L (150 ppb) and 10 mu mol/L (1.5 ppm) levels, acetaminophen readily reacted to form at least 11 discernible products, all of which exhibited greater LC retention than the parent. Two of the products were unequivocally identified as the toxic compounds 1,4-benzoquinone and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI, which is the toxicant associated with lethality in acetaminophen overdoses. With a hypochlorite dose of 57 mu mol/L (4 ppm as Cl-2) 88% of the acetaminophen (10,mu mol/L initial) was transformed in I h. The two quinoidal oxidation products 1,4-benzoquinone and NAPQI accounted for 25% and 1.5% of the initial acetaminophen concentration, respectively, at a I h reaction time. Other products that were identified included two ring chlorination products, chloro-4-acetamidophenol and dichloro-4-acetamidophenol, which combined were approximately 7% of the initial acetaminophen concentration at 1 h. The reaction was also studied in wastewater, where similar reactivity was noted. These results demonstrate that acetaminophen is likely to be transformed significantly during wastewater chlorination. The reactivity of the chlorine-transformation products was also studied with sulfite to simulate dechlorination, and 1,4-benzoquinone and NAPQI were completely reduced.

AB Nanotechnology has become one of the most promising fields of research due to the possibility to develop new advanced materials for many applications. Nevertheless, the development of an efficient and stable nanostructured photocatalyst, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), remains a challenge. In this paper, a review is presented on titania-containing nanofibers for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Nanofibers are commonly obtained by electrospinning, which is a relatively simple and versatile method for the manufacturing of fibers with a large range of diameters 10-1000 nm. The advantage of the photocatalyst in the form of fibers is the ease of recycling. Nano-TiO2 fibers are envisaged for application in wastewater treatment. The nanofibers have been tested mostly for degradation of dyes such as CR, MB, MO, RB5, and RhB in concentration from 10 to 20 mg L-1. The photocatalysis has been carried out under UV light (50-800 W) in variable times (60-240 min). Other parameters that affect photocatalysis activity - as doping and calcination temperature - have been reported. In general, the nanofibers showed good stability and could be reused in at least three cyclical experiments. In the degradation of pharmaceuticals, the removal reached 80 % and was dependent on the thickness of TiO2 nanofibers immobilized on the support. The degradation of other organic contaminants reached up to 70 % for phenol, 50 % for 4-Nitrophenol and 50 % for the herbicide paraquat. A critical view of materials and process limitations, research challenges, and future trends is included.

AB The emerging contaminants, in particular pharmaceuticals and personal care products and environmental estrogens, have been received global concerns in recent years. Nanofiltration (NF) as an advanced tertiary treatment technology can be a reliable and potential tool for micropollutants removal. However, the influence of operation conditions of NF system to micropollutants rejections in an engineering application, is still lacking. Here, a pilotscale NF system was set up to investigate its removal efficiencies to 49 micropollutants under different operation conditions by treating actual municipal wastewater. The results showed that the rejections of positively and neutrally charged micropollutants with molecular weight higher than 250 g mol(-1) were both higher than 80%. Besides, most negatively charged micropollutants were also rejected higher than 80% under different operation conditions. The rejections of most micropollutants increased with temperature decreased from 25 degrees C to 13 degrees C, which was primarily ascribed to decrease of pore size of NF membrane at low temperature. Compared with the water recovery rate of 80%, lower rejections of micropollutants were observed with lower water recovery rate of 60%. Except for sulfamethoxazole, the risk quotients of other detected 20 micropollutants in NF effluent were all lower than 1.0, showing medium or no risks to aquatic organisms. This study might aid understanding the performance of micropollutants rejections by NF in actual engineering application and could give guideline to the implementation of NF technology in future advanced treatment processes.

AB This study considers the removal of diclofenac (an important representative of pharmaceuticals and personal care products - PPCPs) from the secondary effluents of Iasi municipal wastewater treatment plant by means of different advanced oxidation processes (homogeneous Fenton, photo-Fenton and photolysis), carried out in a laboratory scale reaction system. The influence of three qualitative or quantitative factors (Fe3+ concentration, the absence/presence of UV-A radiation and H2O2) was studied in 4 h oxidation tests, at both acidic and neutral pH conditions. A 23 full factorial plan was designed to check the influence of the main parameters affecting the process. The removal efficiencies of several process variants were determined by measuring the DCF concentration in the influent and effluent, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Total organic carbon, specific UV absorption at 254 nm and the hydrogen peroxide concentration were determined for each experiment. At acidic pH, the main effects plots showed that both use UV-A radiation and H2O2 addition improve the DCF removal efficiency, Fe concentration having a much smaller effect. DCF removal efficiencies of up to 98% were obtained depending on the operational conditions. At neutral pH, UV-A radiation is the most important factor that contributes to the removal of DCF and the interaction plots demonstrated this fact. The Pareto chart shows that all factors, with the exception of Fe concentration and H2O2 interactions, are influential. DCF removal efficiencies of up to 70% were obtained depending on the operational conditions.

AB This study investigates the influence of feed solution pH and fouling on the rejection of ten selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) with different physicochemical characteristics (molecular weight, water solubility, log Kow, pKa, dipole moment, etc.) by three multichannel ceramic ultrafiltration membranes, ranging from 1 to 8 kDa, in order to improve their removal from water. For this purpose, the comparison between filtration of PhACs in deionised water (Feed I) and in real wastewater effluent (Feed II) was performed, demonstrating that the variation of pH and the formation of a foulant layer altered the separation mechanism and hence the rejection values of each PhAC varied. Higher rejections of most of the PhACs were higher at slightly alkaline pH, especially for anionic compounds in the filtration with real wastewater. In these conditions, flux decline was more severe. The formed fouling layer onto the hydrophilic membrane surface acted as a secondary barrier for separation with different properties like hydrophobicity and charge. Electrostatic interactions were the main separation mechanism in the filtration of PhACs in deionised water, while the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions played a crucial role in the filtration experiments with real wastewater effluent. Thus, the reported results indicated that the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds was strongly pH-dependent, except for hydrophilic neutral compounds (acetaminophen and caffeine), which showed a pH-independent behaviour with low rejection values.

AB During olive oil production a great amount of olive mill wastewater (OMW) is produced that is potentially a rich source of bio-phenols with wide array of biological activity. The purpose of the present work is to recover and concentrate the valuable polyphenols from the OMW using integrated membrane systems. Further study was conducted by employing enzymatic hydrolysis using -glucosidase followed by acid hydrolysis in order to release higher concentration of pure hydroxytyrosol (HT). Meanwhile, efficient treatment of OMW could be achieved for water reuse as well as protecting the environment. The OMW was directly subjected to a microfiltration (MF) where 77.6 and 34.8% reduction of total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively, were achieved. The Permeate of MF was further subjected to ultra-filtration (UF), where the removal was 44.9% and 100% for the COD and TSS, respectively. Another portion of the MF permeate was also subjected to nano-filtration (NF), where COD was reduced from 33 to 6.9g/l and 100% TSS removal was achieved. The polyphenols in raw OMW was 2.5g/l, it was recovered and concentrated in the Retentate of MF, UF and NF to 2.3, 2.0 and 2.4g/l, respectively. Almost all polyphenols were recovered and concentrated in the NF Retentate solution. By employing the enzymatic hydrolysis using -glucosidase on NF Retentate followed by acid hydrolysis an amount of 1.3g/l of pure HT could be released. Based on these results OMW can be used as alternative source of valuable phenolic compound that are useful for industrial and pharmaceutical applications.

AB The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and seasonality on the removal efficiency of 26 organic microcontaminants from urban wastewater was studied in two pilot high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs). The targeted compounds included pharmaceuticals and personal care products, fire retardants, surfactants, anticorrosive agents, pesticides and plasticizers, among others. The pilot plant, which was fed at a surface loading rate of 7-29 g of COD m(-2) d(-1), consisted of a homogenisation tank and two parallel lines, each one with a primary settler and an HRAP with a surface area of 1.5 m(2) and a volume of 0.5 m(3). The two HRAPs were operated with different HRTs (4 and 8 d). The removal efficiency ranged from negligible removal to more than 90% depending on the compound. Microcontaminant removal efficiencies were enhanced during the warm season, while the HRT effect on microcontaminant removal was only noticeable in the cold season. Our results suggest that biodegradation and photodegradation are the most important removal pathways, whereas volatilization and sorption were solely achieved for hydrophobic compounds (log Row >4) with a moderately high Henry's law constant values (11-12 Pa m(-3) mol(-1)) such as musk fragrances. Whereas acetaminophen, ibuprofen and oxybenzone presented ecotoxicological hazard quotients (HQs) higher than 1 in the influent wastewater samples, the HQs for the effluent water samples were always below 1.

AB In this study we characterised the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in biofilm and sediments from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge point and its receiving river. We also examined the prevalence of qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in these isolates and determined whether they harbour plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases such as TEM, SHV and CTX-M. Moreover, antibiotic concentrations were also measured to evaluate the level of contamination of these pharmaceuticals in the sampling area.
   Antibiotics were found in the range of ng L-1 in WWTP effluents, but most of them were no longer found in downstream river. However, some fluoroquinolones were detected in sediment downstream demonstrating their high persistence and their capacity to be retained in the river sediments. Most of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria class and 17 of them, 8 (7.6%) from the first sampling and 9 (6.1%) from the second sampling, carried a qnr gene. In particular, 15 isolates carried the qnrS gene and 2 carried the qnrB gene. Among the qnr-positive isolates, 12 harboured the aac(6')-lb-cr gene and 2 of them also carried a beta-lactamase on the same plasmid, indicating that they may be transferred simultaneously. It is also noteworthy that all qnr-positive isolates identified as Aeromonas species harboured the same qnrS allele, namely the qnrS2.

AB The objective of this study was to compare fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli [EC], and enterococci [ENT]) concentrations with a wide array of typical organic wastewater chemicals and selected bacterial genes as indicators of fecal pollution in water samples collected at or near 18 surface water drinking water intakes. Genes tested included esp (indicating human-pathogenic ENT) and nine genes associated with various animal sources of shiga-toxin-producing EC (STEC). Fecal pollution was indicated by genes and/or chemicals for 14 of the IS tested samples, with little relation to FIB standards. Of 13 samples with <50 EC 100 mL(-1) human pharmaceuticals or chemical indicators of wastewater treatment plant effluent occurred in six, veterinary antibiotics were detected in three, and stx1 or stx2 genes (indicating varying animal sources of STEC) were detected in eight. Only the EC eaeA gene was positively correlated with FIB concentrations. Human-source fecal pollution was indicated by the esp gene and the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine in one of the nine samples that met all FIB recreational water quality standards. Escherichia coli rfb(O157), and stx2c genes, which are typically associated with cattle sources and are of potential human health significance, were detected in one sample in the absence of tested chemicals. Chemical and gene-based indicators of fecal contamination may be present even when FIB standards are met, and some may, unlike FIB, indicate potential sources. Application of multiple water quality indicators with variable environmental persistence and fare may yield greater confidence in fecal pollution assessment and may inform remediation decisions.

AB As an integral part of our continuing research in environmental quality assessment approaches, we have developed a variety of passive integrative sampling devices widely applicable for use in defining the presence and potential impacts of a broad array of contaminants. The semipermeable membrane device has gained widespread use for sampling hydrophobic chemicals from water and air, the polar organic chemical integrative sampler is applicable for sequestering waterborne hydrophilic organic chemicals, the stabilized liquid membrane device is used to integratively sample waterborne ionic metals, and the passive integrative mercury sampler is applicable for sampling vapor phase or dissolved neutral mercury species. This suite of integrative samplers forms the basis for a new passive sampling approach for assessing the presence and potential toxicological significance of a broad spectrum of environmental contaminants. In a proof-of-concept study, three of our four passive integrative samplers were used to assess the presence of a wide variety of contaminants in the waters of a constructed wetland, and to determine the effectiveness of the constructed wetland in removing contaminants. The wetland is used for final polishing of secondary-treatment municipal wastewater and the effluent is used as a source of water for a state wildlife area. Numerous contaminants, including organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organophosphate pesticides, and pharmaceutical chemicals (e.g., ibuprofen, oxindole, etc.) were detected in the wastewater. Herein we summarize the results of the analysis of the field-deployed samplers and demonstrate the utility of this holistic approach. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Analyses were conducted on four pharmaceutical compounds, representing different therapeutic classes, to evaluate the presence and potential adverse human health effects of trace levels of these substances in aqueous environmental media. Acetylsalicylic acid, clofibrate, cyclophosphamide, and indomethacin have been detected in aqueous environmental media including sewage treatment plant effluent, surface water, drinking water, and groundwater. An extensive literature search and chemical-specific risk assessments were performed to assess the potential human health significance of each compound's individual presence in environmental media. Safe water quality limits were estimated for each pharmaceutical by following the USEPA Methodology for Deriving Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health and were compared to the concentrations found in the environment. The calculation of the provisional ambient water quality criteria involved estimation of human exposure to contaminated water, including intake via bioaccumulation in fish, and calculation of cancer risk and non-cancer hazard indices. Parameters detailing the toxicological and pharmacological nature, exposure assessment, and environmental fate and transport of each pharmaceutical were also considered. The overall conclusion was that based on available data, no,appreciable risk to humans exists, as the detected concentrations of each of these pharmaceutical compounds found in aqueous media were far below the derived safe limits.

AB Psychological disorders due to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the consumption of psychiatric pharmaceuticals on a global scale in last year. These compounds reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) through sewerage system and are not sufficiently removed by using conventional treatment process. Psychiatric drugs released with WWTP effluent may cause possible risks to the receiving aquatic environment. Also, two antidepressants have been included in the "watch list" in 2020. Therefore, simple and relatively cost effective removal of psychiatric drugs from wastewaters becomes important. Magnetite red mud nanoparticles (RM-NPs) synthesized was applied for the removal of psychiatric drugs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, diazepam, and lorazepam) in WWTP effluent first time in this study. The adsorption of carbamazepine as a model compound was fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich isotherm model better represented the sorption data than the Langmuir model. High adsorption capacity (90.5 mg/g) was reached at 30 min contact time at pH 6.5-7.0 at 25 degrees C. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo second order model and its rate control mechanism was controlled by film diffusion. The magnetite RM-NPs were efficiently used for the removal of carbamazepine from real WWTP effluents. The adsorption capacity and the magnetic separability of the regenerated magnetite RM-NPs were unaffected five cycles. Due to its simple application, low cost and high adsorption capacity, magnetite RM-NPs can be recommended as a better adsorbent comparing to commercial adsorbents to remove psychiatric drugs from WWTP effluents.

AB Many types of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), have been found in leachate of operating municipal landfills. However, there is only limited information on CECs presence in leachate of historic landfills (>= 3 decades since closure, often lacking engineered liners or leachate collection systems) at concentrations that may pose a risk to nearby wells and surface water ecosystems. In this study, 48 samples of leachate-impacted groundwater were collected from 20 historic landfills in Ontario, Canada. The CECs measured included artificial sweeteners (ASs), PFAS, organophosphate esters (OPE), pharmaceuticals, bisphenols, sulfamic acid, perchlorate, and substituted phenols. The common presence of the AS saccharin, a known indicator of old landfill leachate, combined with mostly negligible levels of the AS acesulfame, an indicator of modern wastewater, revealed that most samples were strongly influenced by leachate and not cross-contaminated by wastewater (which can contain these same CECs). Several landfills, including ones closed in the 1960s, had total PFAS concentrations similar to those previously measured at modern landfills, with a maximum observed here of 12.7 mu g/L. Notably elevated concentrations of several OPE, sulfamic acid, cotinine, and bisphenols A and S were found at many 30-60 year-old landfills. There was little indication of declining concentrations with landfill age, suggesting historic landfills can be long-term sources of CECs to groundwater and that certain CECs may be useful tracers for historic landfill leachate. These findings provide guidance on which CECs may require monitoring at historic landfill sites and wastewater treatment plants receiving their effluent.

AB This study investigated the performance of five different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in some rural areas in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, through an assessment of the physicochemical qualities of the effluents and their removal capacity for selected phenolic compounds. Water samples were collected on a monthly basis (February-July 2016), and temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), electrical conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured on-site using standard methods. Phenolic compounds were determined using the solid-phase extraction technique followed by derivatization and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Recorded temperatures for all the WWTPs effluents were 29-30 degrees C in summer, 20-27 degrees C in autumn and 12-17 degrees C in winter, and the pH was between 6.8 and 9.1. The treatment processes increased only the DO of the final effluents, while TDS, EC, turbidity and TSS were considerably reduced. Out of the nine phenolic compounds investigated, 2,4-dimethylphenol (2,4-DMP), 4-chloro-3-methylphenol (4-C-3MP), 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were prominent in the influent (17.3-42.1 mu g/L) and concentrations of phenolic compounds in the effluents and receiving water bodies were mostly below the tolerable limits allowed internationally for a safe aquatic environment. Generally, the WWTPs removal capacities range between 33 and 96%, however, South Africa standard limits for discharged effluents were occasionally exceeded especially with some WWTPs. This poses health challenges to rural communities that rely heavily on surface water for domestic use.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceutical products (PPs) from various therapeutic classes was studied in urban sediments collected upstream a small dam in Orleans, France. Since PPs are globally distributed contaminants since the 1950s, their spatial and historical distribution was documented in order to better understand the impact of recent urban management on the chemical quality of sediments. Concentrations of the PPs mainly ranged between 1 and 10 ng g(1) within the two cores. The chronology of core LOI13-2, based on radionuclide analysis (Cs-137 and Pb-210), enabled the characterization of the changes or shift in PPs over the last 50 years, impacted by the effluent deflections i) of a large wastewater treatment plant in 1989, and ii) of 3 smaller wastewater treatment plants between 2003 and 2009. In most cases the deepest occurrence of each PP in the core matched the market authorization date of different pharmaceuticals, indicating that some PPs can be used as chronomarkers. The study reveals that recent management of effluent discharges within the watershed improved the chemical quality of these sediments. In view of the persistence of PP pollution in trapped sediments, a total stock of 763 +/- 565 g for the selected PPs was estimated at the millstream scale. Superficial sediments therefore represent a potential source of downstream pollution in the event of the removal of a small existing dam. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal wastewaters are major sources of pollution for the aquatic biota. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of some pharmaceutical products and the immunotoxic potential of a municipal wastewater aeration lagoon for the treatment of the domestic wastewaters of a small town with wastewater inputs from a 400-bed hospital complex. Endemic mussels were collected, caged and placed in the final aeration lagoon and at sites 1 km upstream and 1 km downstream of the effluent outfall in the receiving river for a period of 14 days. The results showed that the final aeration lagoon contained high levels of total coliforms, conductivity and low dissolved oxygen (2.9 mg/L) as well as detectable amounts of trimethoprim, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and norfloxacin at concentrations exceeding 50 ng/L. The lagoon effluent was indeed toxic to the mussel specimens, as evidenced by the appearance of mortality after 14 days (10% mortality), decreased mussel weight-to-shell-length ratio and loss of hemocyte viability. The number of adhering hemocytes, phagocytic activity, total nitrite levels and arachidonic cyclooxygenase activity were significantly higher in mussels placed in the final aeration lagoon. A multivariate analysis also revealed that water pH, conductivity, total coliforms and dissolved oxygen were the endpoints most closely linked with phagocytic activity, the amount of adhering hemocytes and loss of hemocyte viability. In conclusion, exposure of mussels to treated aerated lagoon wastewater is deleterious to freshwater mussels where the immune system is compromised.

AB A new methodology previously used to study partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4.2 > log Kow > 6.6) in complex heterogeneous systems such as mixed liquor in bioreactors was applied to the synthetic hormone 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), that is an organic micropollutant commonly present in sewage. This model considers the mixed liquor as a three-compartment matrix, in which the pollutant coexists in three states: freely dissolved, sorbed to particles, and sorbed to dissolved and colloidal matter (DCM). In this way, it is possible to gain a better knowledge about the affinity of the pollutant for all these phases, through the determination of equilibrium constants Kpart and KDCM. According to the results, the measured partition coefficients related to EE2 are in the range of 315439 L/kg (log Kd 2.52.64). The values of Kpart and KDCM determined by this model were 384 L/kg and 45 L/kg, respectively, which indicate that EE2 tends to sorb mainly on particles, while the affinity for DCM is poor.

AB Phosphorus (P) is a crucial and non-renewable resource, while it is excessively discharged via sewage, significant amounts originating from human urine. Recovery of P from source-separated urine presents an opportunity not only to recover this precious resource but also to improve downstream sewage treatment works. This paper proposes a simple and economic method to recover urine derived P by using seawater as a low-cost precipitant to form struvite, as Hong Kong has practised seawater toilet flushing as an alternative water resource since 1958. Chemical reactions, process conditions and precipitate composition for P precipitation in urine have been investigated to develop this new urine P recovery approach. This study concluded that ureolysis extent in a urine-seawater mixture determines the reaction pH that in turn influences the P recovery efficiency significantly; 98% of urine P can precipitate with seawater within 10 min when 40-75% of the urea in urine is ureolysed; the urine to seawater ratio alters the composition of the precipitates. The P content in the precipitates was found to be more than 9% when the urine fraction was 40% or higher. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) was confirmed to be the predominant component of the precipitates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effluent from sewage treatment plants has been associated with a range of pollutant effects. Depending on the influent composition and treatment processes the effluent may contain a myriad of different chemicals which makes monitoring very complex. In this study we aimed to monitor relatively polar organic pollutant mixtures using a combination of passive sampling techniques and a set of biochemistry based assays covering acute bacterial toxicity (Microtox (TM)), phytotoxicity (Max-I-PAM assay) and genotoxicity (umuC assay). The study showed that all of the assays were able to detect effects in the samples and allowed a comparison of the two plants as well as a comparison between the two sampling periods. Distinct improvements in water quality were observed in one of the plants as result of an upgrade to a UV disinfection system, which improved from 24x sample enrichment required to induce a 50% response in the Microtox (TM) assay to 84x, from 30x sample enrichment to induce a 50% reduction in photosynthetic yield to 125x, and the genotoxicity observed in the first sampling period was eliminated. Thus we propose that biochemical assay techniques in combination with time integrated passive sampling can substantially contribute to the monitoring of polar organic toxicants in STP effluents.

AB The present study focused on the occurrence, distribution and risk assessment of 32 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water and sediment, as well as the surrounding soil of the irrigation channels and lake of a Mediterranean coastal wetland, the Albufera Natural Park (Valencia, Spain). Moreover, the influent and effluent of ten wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that treat wastewater from Valencia and the surrounding areas were also studied. BPA, caffeine, diclofenac, ethyl paraben, methyl paraben, metformin, tramadol and salicylic acid were the predominant PPCPs detected in the channels and the lake, and are in good agreement with those detected in the effluent. Furthermore, 22 PPCPs were detected in >47% of the sediment samples. Of them, BPA, ethyl paraben, furosemide, ibuprofen and salicylic acid were at higher concentrations. In contrast, only seven PPCPs were detected in >44% of the soil samples. Spatial variation showed that the concentration of many PPCPs was higher in the northern area of the park, whereas the ibuprofen concentrations were higher in the south. Differences were also observed according to the type of water used for irrigation and the land uses of the area. A risk assessment based on the hazardous quotient (HQ) indicated that caffeine is a compound of concern, and tramadol at the highest concentration showed a moderate risk for the organisms assessed. Considering the mixture of the PPCPs found at each sampling point, the green algae are at risk, particularly in those points located near the city of Valencia (the most important nearby human settlement). These results indicate the need for further studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Erlotinib is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of the most common type of lung cancer. Due to its recent introduction, very scarce information is available on its occurrence, environmental fate and toxicological effects on aquatic organisms. During chlorination processes normally carried out in wastewater treatment plants and in the pretreatment of hospital effluents, chlorinated transformation products can be formed with an enhanced toxicity relative to the parent compound.
   Thus, the reactivity of the cytostatic drug erlotinib in free chlorine-containing water was investigated for the first time in the present work. A non-targeted screening approach based on the use of differential profiling tools was applied in order to reveal its potential transformation products. Structural elucidation of the detected transformation products was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed approach allowed detecting a total of nineteen transformation products, being eighteen of them described for the first time in this work, which demonstrates its potential in environmental analysis. Among them, six compounds presented chlorine atoms in their structures, which may be of major concern. Other transformation products involved hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. Time-course profiles of erlotinib and its transformation products were followed in real wastewater samples under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. Although the structures of these transformation products could not be positively confirmed due to lack of standards, their chemical formulas and product ions can be added to databases, which will allow their screening in future monitoring studies.

AB Many pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products (TPs) are not efficiently removed from wastewater treatment plants and enter into surface waters. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and behavior of metformin, one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide, and its biological transformation product guanylurea, in eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Greece. All WWTPs were equipped with conventional activated sludge treatment and the samples were taken from the influents and the effluents, over the four seasons of one year. The analytical method developed based on SPE followed by LC-UV/Vis-ESI/MS analysis, while positive findings were confirmed also by means of LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. High polarity of both compounds led to the extraction with Oasis HLB and the use of the anionic surfactant SDS. The results showed that metformin dominated in the influents (bql-1167 ng/L), while guanylurea in the effluents (bql-627 ng/L) of the wastewater treatment plants, with Metformin/Guanylurea ratio ranging between 0.88 and 81.3 in the influents and between 0.005 and 0.78 in the effluents. Lack of a clear seasonal tendency in the occurrence and removal or formation was observed. Finally, an ecotoxicological risk assessment of metformin in effluent wastewaters took place by calculating the ratio between the environmental concentrations (MEG) and the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). Despite the fact that metformin presented low risk in all cases, an environmental concern is suspected for guanylurea since it is continuously released into the aquatic environment.

AB The removal of micropollutants (MPs) from secondary municipal wastewater by an advanced oxidation process (AOP) based on UV irradiation combined with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) has been assessed through pilot-scale experiments incorporating microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Initial tests employed low concentrations of a range of key emerging contaminants of concern, subsequently focusing on the highly recalcitrant compound metaldehyde (MA), and the water quality varied by blending MF and RO permeate.
   Under optimum H2O2 and lamp power conditions, AOP achieved significant removal (>99%) of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) for all waters. Pesticide removal, in particular metaldehyde, atrazine and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was dependent on water transmittance (UVT), and levels of TOC and other hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) scavengers. Further analysis of MA removal showed UVT, hydraulic retention time and H2O2 dose to be influential parameters in determining degradation as a function of UV dose.
   A cost assessment revealed energy consumption to account for 65% of operating expenditure with lamp replacement contributing 25%. A comparison of three unit process sequences, based on MF, RO, AOP and activated carbon (AC), revealed MF-RO-AOP to be the most cost effective provided management of the RD concentrate stream incurred no significant cost. Results demonstrated AOPs to satisfactorily reduce levels of the more challenging recalcitrant MPs to meet stringent water quality standards for wastewater reuse, but that practical limitations exist and the cost penalty is significant.

AB The present work reports the occurrence and monitoring of 11 pharmaceuticals (i.e., caffeine, prazosin, enalapril, carbamazepine, nifedipine, gliclazide, levonorgestrel, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac-Na and mefenamic acid) in surface water and in the influent and effluent of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and hospitals (HSPs). A total of 105 water samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-TOF/MS). The mean concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals in STP influent and effluent ranged from < limit of quantification (LOQ) to 3909 ng L-1 and 12 to 577 ng L-1, respectively. The mean concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals in the hospital influent and effluent ranged from 28 to 1644 ng L-1 and 20 to 1540 ng L-1, respectively. The highest concentration detected in the sampling points was 9099 ng L-1 for caffeine in influent STP. The presence of prazosin has never been reported before in literature. In this study, prazosin was detected in all studied samples, and the highest concentration was 525 ng L-1 in influent STP. Chemometric analysis was used to assess the presence of pharmaceuticals in samples.

AB Many tons and numerous varieties of pharmaceutical substances are used in the UK and other countries. They enter the environment via excretion, improper disposal or industrial waste. If they are not treated and degraded completely they could contaminate the environment. Little is known about their biodegradability. Department of Health (UK) data have been analysed to identify the prescription pharmaceuticals that are most consumed in the UK. This study has produced a list of the 100 most prescribed pharmaceutical substances by mass, which has not been available until now. Co-codamol (codeine phosphate/paracetamol, 444.34 t), paracetamol (403.11 t), co-proxamol (dextropropoxyphene HCl/paracetamol, 336.21 t), metformin hydrochloride (205.79 t) and ibuprofen (162.91 t) are the top five most consumed pharmaceutical substances in the UK. A comparison of these data with information about the biodegradability of the substances in sewage treatment works points to five substances that may accumulate and lead to future problems in the aquatic environment: oxytetracycline, amitriptyline, thioridazine, fluoxetine and dextroproxyphene. However, there may be other non-biodegradable pharmaceutical substances, which have not been reported so far. It is suggested that environmental risk assessment and methods for the removal of these substances from water need to be developed and evaluated, and that field studies on their fates are required.

AB Phenolic wastewater containing phenol and 4-chlorophenol pose a risk to the environment and to human health. Treating them using chemical-biological coupling method is challenging. In this study, manganese oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) were enriched in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) using synthetic phenol wastewater (800 mg L-1) to facilitate in situ production of biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) after 90 days of operation. Then, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) was added to the MBBR to simulate mixed phenolic wastewater. Comparing the MBBR (R1) without feeding Mn(II) and the MBBR with BioMnOx (R2) production, R2 exhibited robust phenol and 4-CP removal performance. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to determine the microbial community. Subsequently, a batch experiment demonstrated that partly purified BioMnOx does not exhibits a capacity for phenol removal, but can efficiently remove 4-CP. Interestingly, 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was found in the products of 4-CP degradation, which was the unique product of 4-CP degradation by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O). In both reactors, only catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O) activity from microbes can be detected, indicating that the existence of BioMnOx provide an alternative pathway in addition to microbe driven 4-CP degradation. Overall, MBBR based MnOB enrichment under high phenol concentration was achieved, and 4-CP/phenol removal can be accelerated by in situ-formed BioMnOx. Considering the C23O-like activity of BioMnOx, our results suggest a new coupling strategy that involves nanomaterials and a microbial consortium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For reducing organic micropollutants (MP) in municipal wastewater effluents, granular activated carbon (GAC) has been tested in various studies. We did systematic literature research and found 44 studies dealing with the adsorption of MPs (carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole) from municipal wastewater on GAC in pilot- and large-scale plants. Within our meta-analysis we plot the bed volumes (BV [m(water)(3)/m(GAc)(3)]) until the breakthrough criterion of MP-BV20% was reached, dependent on potential relevant parameters (empty bed contact time EBCT, influent DOC DOC0 and manufacturing method). Moreover, we performed statistical tests (ANOVA5) to check the results for significance. Single adsorbers operating time differs i.e. by 2500% until breakthrough of diclofenac-BV20% was reached (800-20,000 BV). There was still elimination of the "very well/well" adsorbable MPs such as carbamazepine and diclofenac even when the equilibrium of DOC had already been reached. No strong statistical significance of EBCT and DOC0 on MP-BV20% could be found due to lack of data and the high heterogeneity of the studies using GAC of different qualities. In further studies, adsorbers should be operated >> 20,000 BV for exact calculation of breakthrough curves, and the following parameters should be recorded: selected MPs; DOC0; UVA(254); EBCT; product name, manufacturing method and raw material of GAC; suspended solids (TSS); backwash interval; backwash program and pressure drop within adsorber. Based on our investigations we generally recommend using reactivated GAC to reduce the environmental impact and to carry out tests on pilot scale to collect reliable data for process design.

AB The contamination of major continental river systems by endocrine-active chemicals (EACs) derived from the discharge of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can affect human and ecosystem health. As part of a long-term effort to develop a native fish model organism for assessment of endocrine disruption in Australia's largest watershed, the Murray-Darling River Basin, the present study evaluated endocrine disruption in adult males of the native Australian Murray rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) exposed to effluent from an activated sludge WWTP and water from the Murray River during a 28-d, continuous-flow, on-site experiment. Analysis of the WWTP effluent and river water detected estrone and 17-estradiol at concentrations up to approximately 25ngL(-1). Anti-estrogenicity of effluent samples was detected in vitro using yeast-based bioassays (yeast estrogen screen) throughout the experiment, but estrogenicity was limited to the first week of the experiment. Histological evaluation of the testes indicated significant suppression of spermatogenesis by WWTP effluent after 28d of exposure. Plasma vitellogenin concentrations and expression of vitellogenin messenger RNA in liver were not significantly affected by exposure to WWTP effluent. The combination of low contaminant concentrations in the WWTP effluent, limited endocrine disrupting effects in the Murray rainbowfish, and high in-stream dilution factors (>99%) suggest minimal endocrine disruption impacts on native Australian fish in the Murray River downstream from the WWTP outfall.

AB The water reservoirs are getting polluted due to increasing amounts of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, organic polymers and suspended solids. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been proved to be a promising solution for the purification of water without having harmful impacts on the environment. Parameters such as PAC dosing, wastewater hardness, the effect of coagulant and flocculant were evaluated in a batch scale study. These parameters were further applied on a pilot plant scale for the performance evaluation of PAC based removal of micropollutants concerning the contact time and PAC dosing with main focus on recirculation of PAC sludge. The obtained optimum dose was 10-20 mg/L providing 84.40-91.30% removal efficiency of suspended solid micropollutants (MPs) and this efficiency increased to 88.90-93.00% along with coagulant which further raised by the addition of polymer and recirculation process at batch scale. On pilot plant scale, the concentration in contact reactor and PAC removal effectiveness of dissolved air flotation, lamella separator and sedimentation tank were compared. Constant optimisation resulted in a concentration ranging from 2.70 to 3.40 g/L at dosing of PAC 10 mg/L, coagulant 2.00 mg/L and polymer 0.50 mg/L. PAC doses of 10-20 mg/L with 15-30 min contact time proved best for above 70-80% elimination. The recirculation system has also proved an efficient technique because the PAC's adsorption capacity was practically completely used. Small PAC dosages yielded high micropollutants elimination.

AB In this study, silanized nanodiamond (SND) was synthesized and used as a nano additive to develop the polysulfone (PSf) nanocomposite membrane in order to investigate the effects of the functionalization of nanodiamond (ND) nanoparticles on the structure and performance of PSf membranes for wastewater treatment process. ND was functionalized by silanization method using vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTS) and the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of silane groups on the surface of NDs. Afterward, neat and nanocomposite PSf membranes containing 1.0 wt.% ND and 1.0 wt.% SND were prepared via phase inversion method. Prepared membranes were then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), pure water flux (PWF), contact angle and mechanical strength analyses. FESEM images showed that the number of pores on the surface of membranes increased at the presence of ND and SND nanoparticles but the average pore size decreased. PSf/SND nanocomposite membrane had the maximum PWF of 112 Lm(-2) h(-1) and the lowest contact angle value of 76.44 degrees. However, the presence of ND and SND nanoparticles had no significant effect on mechanical strength of the membranes. Moreover, the EDX analysis showed that the SNDs were dispersed uniformly throughout the PSf matrix. After determination of critical flux, the performance of prepared membranes was investigated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed for 360 min operation. The obtained results revealed that PSf/SND nanocomposite membrane had the lowest irreversible fouling ratio (IFR) and the highest flux recovery ratio (FRR).

AB Paired electrolysis can take advantage of both anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, and thus improve current efficiency for electrochemical wastewater treatment. In this work, differential control of anode/cathode potentials of paired electrolysis for simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN, including ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite) was studied. We first determined the optimal potentials for anodic oxidation of COD/NH4+ or cathodic reduction of NO3/NO2 (minimization of over-oxidation or over-reduction) by preliminary cyclic voltammetry and constant-potential electrolysis experiments, i.e., 1.6 V for anodic oxidation and -1.26 V for cathodic reduction in this case. The optimal working potential of the cathode was achieved at appropriate current density in the paired electrolysis system, the working potential of the anode was independently controlled by adjusting the ratio of its surface area to that of the cathode. In this way, both the cathode and anode could work under optimal potentials. At an optimized cathodic current density of 5.0 mA cm(-2) and cathode/anode surface area ratio of 2: 1, the removal efficiencies of COD and TN from simulated wastewater reached 91.9% and 86.2%, respectively. Additionally, the developed paired electrolysis system was validated by treating an actual pharmaceutical wastewater, results for which showed that a total current efficiency of 84.8% was achieved, which was at least twice as high as that of traditional electrochemical processes.

AB N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), the active component of many insect repellents, is among the most frequently detected compounds in aqueous environments with concentrations reported in the ng L-1 to mu g L-1 range. However, DEET is often detected in blanks and reported concentrations differ significantly depending on the analytical technique employed. In addition, relatively sparse data are available regarding the seasonal variability of DEET concentrations in water and there are apparent inconsistencies with expected use patterns. Therefore, the present study investigates potential interferences affecting the detection and quantification of DEET then the geographical and seasonal variations of DEET concentrations. To examine potential analytical interferences, DEET was analyzed in five geographically-diverse wastewater effluents using both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detectors. At times, the concentrations quantified by the employed analytical methods varied significantly. Five compounds with similar molecular weights and structures as DEET were investigated as potential mimics and some were shown to induce an overestimation of DEET. Further experimentation suggested that the solvents used in sample preparation and HPLC analysis are another possible source of interference. Besides potential interferences, the seven-month weekly monitoring of DEET in the primary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant demonstrated a clear seasonal trend with decreasing concentration from summer to winter. These data collectively demonstrate that there are many challenges in the quantification of DEET in complex environmental samples and that co-occurrence of similarly structured substances present in the water sample and/or the solvents used for the analysis could induce analytical bias.

AB Antibiotics are one of a group of pharmaceutical compounds that have been found in lakes and streams throughout the world and the occurrence of these compounds in the environment has raised concerns regarding the toxicity to aquatic organisms and the emergence of strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objective of this study was to assess the use of a relatively simple coupled solid-phase extraction (SPE)/radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for screening and/or monitoring tetracycline (TC) and sulfonamide (SA) compounds in water. Cross-reactivity of TCs and SAs was used to determine the specificity of the assays. The results indicate that TC, oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC) of the investigated 5 TCs, and sulfamethazine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxane (SDM) and sulfathiazole (STZ) of the investigated 6 SAs in water matrix cross-react to a similar degree within each family in RIA and SPE/RIA. Water samples were collected across a watershed in northern Colorado in addition to the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. SPE/RIA analysis of these samples was compared with SPE/liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) quantification of 5 TC and 6 SA compounds. Results of the study indicate that SPE/RIA can be an effective technique for monitoring antibiotic compounds in waters suspected to be contaminated with these compounds. The coupled method provides a sufficiently low detection limit (0.05 mug/L) to screen large sample sets at environmentally relevant concentrations. The method provides a semi-quantitative composite measurement of similar compounds in an antibiotic family without complex and expensive analytical equipment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study presents the development and validation of a comprehensive quantitative target methodology for the analysis of 2316 emerging pollutants in water based on Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q-ToF-HRMS/MS). Target compounds include pesticides, pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, industrial chemicals, doping compounds, surfactants and transformation products, among others. The method was validated for 195 analytes, chosen to be representative of the chemical space of the target list, enabling the assessment of the performance of the method. The method involves a generic sample preparation based on mixed mode solid phase extraction, a UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS screening method using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode, which provides MS and MS/MS spectra simultaneously and an elaborate strong post-acquisition evaluation of the data. The processing method was optimized to provide a successful identification rate > 95 % and to minimize the number of false positive results (< 5 %). Decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) were also introduced in the validation scheme to provide more realistic metrics on the performance of a HRMS-based wide-scope screening method. A new system of identification points (IPs) based on the one described in the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC was applied to communicate the confidence level in the identification of the analytes. This system considers retention time, mass accuracy, isotopic fit and fragmentation; taking full advantage of the capacities of the HRMS instruments. Finally, 398 contaminants were detected and quantified in real wastewater.

AB The removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) is of growing interest in water research and society. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been proven to be an effective method of removal for TOrCs in water, with the degree of effectiveness depending on dosage, contact time, and activated carbon type. In this study, the attenuation of TOrCs in three different secondary wastewater effluents using four PAC materials was studied in order to elucidate the effectiveness and efficacy of PAC for TOrC removal. With the notable exception of hydrochlorothiazide, all 14 TOrC indicators tested in this study exhibited a positive correlation of removal rate with their log D-ow values, demonstrating that the main adsorption mechanism was hydrophobic interaction. As a predictive model, the modified Chick-Watson model, often used for the prediction of microorganism inactivation by disinfectants, was applied. The applied model exhibited good predictive power for TOrC attenuation by PAC in wastewater. In addition, surrogate models based upon spectroscopic measurements including UV absorbance at 254 nm and total fluorescence were applied to predict TOrC removal by PAC. The surrogate model was found to provide an excellent prediction of TOrC attenuation for all combinations of water quality and PAC type included in this study. The success of spectrometric parameters as surrogates in predicting TOrC attenuation by PAC are particularly useful because of their potential application in real-time on-line sensor monitoring and process control at full-scale water treatment plants, which could lead to significantly reduced operator response times and PAC operational optimization.

AB Ozonation aimed at removing pharmaceuticals was studied in an effluent from an experimental pilot system using staged moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) tanks for the optimal biological treatment of wastewater from a medical care unit of Aarhus University Hospital. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH in samples varied considerably, and the effect of these two parameters on ozone lifetime and the efficiency of ozone in removing pharmaceuticals were determined. The pH in the effluent varied from 5.0 to 9.0 resulting in approximately a doubling of the required ozone dose at the highest pH for each pharmaceutical. DOC varied from 6 to 20 mg-DOC/L. The ozone required for removing each pharmaceutical, varied linearly with DOC and thus, ozone doses normalized to DOC (specific ozone dose) agreed between water samples (typically within 15%). At neutral pH the specific ozone dose required to remove the easiest degradable pharmaceutical, sulfadiazine, was 0.50 +/- 0.04 mg-O-3/mg-DOC and the most recalcitrant, diatrizoic acid, required 4.7 +/- 0.6 mg-O-3/mg-DOC. The lifetime of ozone increased drastically in the higher end of the indicated dosage. At the lowest observed pH of 5.0, its lifetime was quadrupled to 20 min which influences the design of the reaction tank. The addition of 0.1 mg-H2O2 per 1 mg-O-3 mitigated the prolonged lifetime without a corresponding influence in the pharmaceutical removal efficiency of ozone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of organic-carbon-deficient wastewater containing benzotriazole (BTA) in lab-scale aerated biofilters filled with natural manganese oxide ore, sand coated with synthetic manganese oxides and sand (as a control material) in terms of BTA removal efficiency, its transformation products and ecotoxicological impact of the treated wastewater. Additionally, the effect of Mn(II) feeding was tested. The removal of BTA in all the biofilters was >= 97%. The contribution of the biotic removal of this compound was 15%, 50%, and 75% in the systems filled with sand, synthetic and natural manganese oxides, respectively. Only the columns filled with natural manganese oxides provided significant removal of DOC and decrease of UV254 and SUVA(254), with even more pronounced effect with Mn(II) feeding. The presence of Mn(II) was also found to enhance the removal of N-NH4 in the systems filled with either form of manganese oxides, otherwise the removal of N-NH4 was negligible or negative. The transformation reactions of BTA were methylation, hydroxylation, and triazole ring cleavage. Based on the number of compounds and their relative abundance, the methylated transformation products were predominant in the effluent. The reduction of the ecotoxicity (Microtox bioassay) of the effluents was positively correlated with the decrease of UV254, SUVA and DOC and only moderately with the removal of BTA. This study has shown that the natural manganese oxide ore provides the broadest set of services as a filtering material for aerated biofilters treating carbon-deficient wastewater containing BTA.

AB With low levels of human antibiotics in the environment due to release of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, concern is rising about impacts on human health and antibiotic resistance development. Furthermore, WWTP effluent may be released into waterways used as drinking water sources. The aim of this study was to analyze three antibiotics important to human health (sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim) in soil and groundwater at a long-term wastewater reuse system that spray irrigates effluent. Soil samples were collected (i) at a site that had not received irrigation for 7 mo (approximate background concentrations), and then at the same site after (ii) one irrigation event and (iii) 10 wk of irrigation. Water samples were collected three times per year to capture seasonal variability. Sulfamethoxazole was typically at the highest concentrations in effluent (22 +/- 3.7 mu g L-1) with ofloxacin and trimethoprim at 2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.0 +/- 0.02 mu g L-1, respectively. In the soil, ofloxacin had the highest background concentrations (650 +/- 204 ng kg(-1)), whereas concentrations of sulfamethoxazole were highest after continuous effluent irrigation (730 +/- 360 ng kg(-1)). Trimethoprim was only quantified in soil after 10 wk of effluent irrigation (190 +/- 71 ng kg(-1)). Groundwater concentrations were typically <25 ng L-1 with high concentrations of 660 +/- 20 and 67 +/- 7.0 ng L-1 for sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin, respectively. Given that antibiotics interacted with the soil profile and groundwater concentrations were frequently about 1000-fold lower than effluent, soil may be an adequate tertiary treatment for WWTP effluent leading to improved water quality and protection of human health.

AB This study investigated adsorption of the carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater effluent to optimally synthesized magnetic nanocomposite of activated carbon (AC). The adsorbent was characterized by SEM, XRD, VSM, BET and FTIR analysis. Increase in the magnetite content up to mass ratio of 1:8 (Fe3O4: AC) had no adverse effect on the porous structure of adsorbent and decrease in adsorption capacity was only due to increase in inactive mass fraction of adsorbent. However, at higher contents of magnetite, decrease in adsorption capacity may be due to blockage of porous structure of AC. Sedimentation data of MAC 1:8 were well predicted by second order kinetic model with the rate constant of 8.9 x 10 (3) NTU (1) min (1). Response surface methodology was applied to optimize the treatment process. A significant quadratic model was achieved with the maximum removal efficiency of 93% within investigated intervals. By increasing of total dissolved solids (TDS); adsorption performance decreased slightly due to increase in water cluster formation on carboxylic groups which can block adsorption on the carbonyl sites. The equilibrium adsorption data were in agreement with the results predicted using Radke-Prausnitz, Redlich-Peterson and Temkin models. The maximum capacity was found to be 182.9 mg g (1). The adsorption kinetic data were closely fitted to Elovich, intraparticle diffusion and pseudo-second-order models. According to thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption process was found to be spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The error functions were used to evaluate the agreement between the experimental data and predictions using models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes of fluorescence excitation emission matrixes (EEM) of wastewater caused by Fenton process (FP) and Fenton-like process (FLP) were quantified in this study. Their association with the generation of hydroxyl radicals, formation of oxidation products of effluent organic matter (EfOM) and degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were examined as well. Both FP and FLP caused a consistent decrease of EfOM fluorescence. This decrease was most prominent in the EEM region associated with soluble microbial products (SMPs). Measurements of the consumption of the radical probe pCBA and calculations of OH center dot radicals exposures showed that relative changes of EEM quantified using alternative parameters (such as humic region response or peak intensity relative change) were predictive of OH center dot exposures irrespective of whether the wastewater was treated with FP or FLP at any Fe doses and treatment times. The generation of EfOM oxidation products such as formate, oxalate and acetate was also correlated with EEM changes. Similar observations were obtained for PPCPs whose removal was interpreted based on first-order kinetics. Values of selected parameters representing correlations between PPCPs oxidation and EfOM fluorescence decreases were strongly correlated with the intrinsic rates of the oxidation of trace-level organic species by OH center dot radicals.

AB The presence of an ionized carboxyl group in the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug diclofenac potassium results in a high mobility of diclofenac and in its low sorption under conditions of slow sand filtration or subsoil passage. No diclofenac degradation was detected in pure water or sludge during one month. Tertiary treatments of wastewater indicated that the effective removal of diclofenac was by reverse osmosis, but the removal by activated carbon was less satisfactory. This study presents an efficient method for the removal of diclofenac from water by micelle-clay composites that are positively charged, have a large surface area and include large hydrophobic domains. Adsorption of diclofenac in dispersion by charcoal and a composite micelle (otadecyltrimethylammonium [ODTMA] and clay [montmorillonite]) was investigated. Analysis by the Langmuir isotherm revealed that charcoal had a somewhat larger number of adsorption sites than the composite, but the latter had a significantly larger binding affinity for diclofenac. Filtration experiments on a solution containing 300 ppm diclofenac demonstrated poor removal by activated carbon, in contrast to very efficient removal by micelle-clay filters. In the latter case the weight of removed diclofenac exceeded half that of ODTMA in the filter. Filtration of diclofenac solutions at concentrations of 8 and 80 ppb yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of 30 and 60 mL min(-1). One kilogram of ODTMA in the micelle-clay filter has been estimated to remove more than 99% of diclofenac from a solution of 100 ppb during passage of more than 100 m(3).

AB Psychiatric pharmaceuticals are receiving wide-spread attention as emerging contaminants. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent primary point sources for pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. In this study, the occurrence and fate of 10 psychiatric pharmaceuticals, half of which are chiral compounds, were investigated in six WWTPs in Hong Kong over a period of one year. Average levels of the analytes among these WWTPs in influent, effluent, and sludge ranged from <0.1 ng/L (clomipramine) to 84.6 ng/L (sertraline), from 0.3 ng/L (risperidone) to 45.6 ng/L (citalopram), and from <0.1 ng/g dry weight (dw) (risperidone) to 174 ng/g dw (sertraline), respectively. Overall, 26.1% of the analytes were sorbed to suspended solids in influent, indicating the necessity of identifying psychiatric pharmaceuticals in both dissolved and solid phases instead of filtered wastewater only. Mass balance results revealed back-transformation of the studied psychiatric pharmaceuticals compensated for their loss via degradation. Average removal efficiencies in the investigated WWTPs ranged from 20.4% (diazepam) to 50.8% (sertraline). The enantiopure pharmaceutical (+)-cis-1S,4S-sertraline, among four sertraline enantiomers, was the only enantiomeric form detected in all samples. Fluoxetine, citalopram, and mirtazapine did not show significant enantioselectivity during treatment in most cases. Three of the five chiral pharmaceuticals probably posed high ecological risks to aquatic organisms, calling for more comprehensive enantiospecific ecotoxicity studies of these pharmaceuticals.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are widely found in the environment due to vast human consumption. Lots of work has been devoted to investigating the occurrence and seasonal variations globally. To fully understand characteristics and cross-year variation of PhACs in Beijing, 35 PhACs were analyzed in 46 sites across Beijing from both urban and suburban areas. Concentrations of target PhACs were ranged from levels of ng L-1 to mu g L-1. Metoprolol (524 ng L-1), caffeine (390 ng L-1) and acetaminophen (156 ng L-1) were the three most abundant non-antibiotics with the highest median concentration, and nalidixic acid (135 ng L-1), erythromycin (64 ng L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (77 ng L-1) were the most abundant antibiotics. Urban and suburban areas are distinguished by PhAC composition in cluster analysis due to different wastewater collection rate. The ratio of easily removable compound group and hardly removable group was then proposed to reflect the wastewater collection rate. The compositional comparison of PhACs in WWTPs' effluents and their receiving rivers further illustrates the impact of WWTPs in urban area. Higher proportion of antibiotics (>30%) in suburban area reflected the impact of presence of livestock farms, which should be concerned. Further statistical analyses show an improving trend of wastewater collection rate, and excluding metoprolol, an anti-hypertension medicine, the total concentration of 13 target PhACs was reduced by 72% during 2013-2017.

AB The release of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with treated wastewater is one of the major sources of CNTs in the environment. The great sorption capacity of pristine CNTs can be changed during wastewater processing. CNTs in the environment can interact with different components and pollutants. The aim of this study is the determination of the effect of treatment methods of wastewater containing functionalized CNTs on the sorption of new emerging contaminants. The process of sorption of diclofenac sodium (DCF) and naproxen (NPX) was tested using carbon nanotubes released after treatment by UV and/or H2O2. The results revealed that sorption on non-treated CNTOHs was governed by chemisorption, with chemisorption being rate limiting step (pseudo-second order regime). Treatment of the CNTOHs changed the kinetics of NPX sorption to a pseudo-first order (CNTOH-UV and CNTOH-H2O2) or an intraparticle diffusion model (CNTOH-UV + H2O2). DCF sorption was described by pseudo-first or pseudo-second order kinetics. NPX sorption onto treated CNTOHs and CNTCOOHs was ascribed to the Freundlich or Temkin models. The Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models revealed the best fitting for the description of DCF sorption onto CNTOHs and CNTCOOHs. Although treatment affected the physicochemical properties of the CNTs only slightly, it did change the sorption affinity and capacity. NPX sorption was favored over all tested CNTs, and CNTCOOHs revealed a higher sorption capacity for all tested adsorbates. The mechanism of sorption was connected with p-p interactions between the NPX and the CNTOHs, and the functional groups of the CNTCOOHs. DCF sorption onto CNTOHs was governed by electrostatic forces, with adsorption onto CNTCOOHs governed by functionalization.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are known to be a source of surface water contamination by organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals. The objective of the present work was to study the suitability of the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) to monitor beta-blockers and hormones in effluents and surface waters. Four sampling campaigns were carried out in French rivers (the Saone, the Ardieres, the Bourbre, and the Seine) between November 2007 and September 2008. Passive samplers were exposed in surface waters, upstream and downstream of WWTP outflows, and in effluents. Exposures lasted for up to 24d to study the uptake kinetics directly in situ, and repeatability was assessed by exposure of triplicates. A good agreement was found between POCIS and water samples. With the exception of atenolol, beta-blockers showed a linear uptake during at least three weeks, and their sampling rates could be determined in situ. These sampling rates were then used to calculate time-weighted average concentrations of beta-blockers in the Seine River with an overall good accuracy and repeatability. Such calculations could not be performed for hormones because of their variable occurrences and low concentrations in water and POCIS. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler therefore seems to be a suitable tool for monitoring beta-blockers in surface waters impacted by WWTP effluents. Longer exposure durations would be necessary to determine the suitability of POCIS for monitoring hormones. Finally, preliminary assays on the use of several deuterated compounds as performance reference compounds showed promising results for deuterated atenolol. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:279-288.

AB The aim of this work was to assess the treatment of wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical plant through a continuous heterogeneous catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) process using an Fe2O3/SBA-15 nanocomposite catalyst. This catalyst was preliminary tested in a batch stirred tank reactor (STR), to elucidate the influence of significant parameters on the oxidation system, such as temperature, initial oxidant concentration and initial pH of the reaction medium. In that case, a temperature of 80,C using an initial oxidant concentration corresponding to twice the theoretical stoichiometric amount for complete carbon depletion and initial pH of ca. 3 allow TOC degradation of around 50% after 200 min of contact time. Thereafter, the powder catalyst was extruded with bentonite to prepare pellets that could be used in a fixed bed reactor (FBR). Results in the up-flow FBR indicate that the catalyst shows high activity in terms of TOC mineralization (ca. 60% under steady-state conditions), with an excellent use of the oxidant and high stability of the supported iron species. The activity of the catalyst is kept constant, at least, for 55 h of reaction. Furthermore, the BOD5/COD ratio is increased from 0.20 to 0.30, whereas the average oxidation stage (AOS) changed from 0.70 to 2.35. These two parameters show a high oxidation degree of organic compounds in the outlet effluent, which enhances its biodegradability, and favours the possibility of a subsequent coupling with a conventional biological treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical products are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, lakes and, more rarely, in groundwater. The advanced oxidation methods, like ultrasound, find a promising future in the area of wastewater treatment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the influence of several parameters of the ultrasound process on the degradation of paracetamol, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory recalcitrant drug found in water and levodopa, the most frequently prescribed drug for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Experiments were carried out at 574, 860 and 1134 kHz of ultrasonic frequency with horn-type sonicator and actual power values of 9, 17, 22 and 32 W at 20 degrees C. Initial concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg L-1 of both products were used. Treatment efficiency was assessed following changes in pharmaceuticals concentration and chemical oxygen demand.
   The sonochemical degradation of both products follows a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Complete removal of pharmaceuticals was achieved in some cases but some dissolved organic carbon remains in solution showing that long lived intermediates were recalcitrant to ultrasound irradiation. Pollutants conversion and COD removal were found to decrease with increasing the initial solute concentration and decreasing power. The best results were obtained with 574 kHz frequency. Investigations using 1-butanol as radical scavenger and H2O2 as promoter revealed that pollutants degradation proceeds principally through radical reactions, although some differences were observed between both molecules. Addition of H2O2 had a positive effect on degradation rate, but the optimum concentration of hydrogen peroxide depends on the pollutant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effects of thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge on biogas production and removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs). Thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening resulted in approximately 15% increase in biogas production. However, the effects of thermal pretreatement and recuperative thickening on anaerobic digestion performance in respect to the removal of TrOCs were less obvious and varied widely depending on the molecular properties of each compound. Of the 40 TrOCs monitored in this study, 16 TrOCs were detected in all primary sludge samples. Removal from the aqueous phase was negligible for most of these 16 TrOCs. Caffeine and paracetamol were the only two TrOCs with a high removal from the aqueous phase. In comparison to the aqueous phase, TrOC removal from the solid phase was considerably higher. Through a mass balance calculation, it was shown that thermal pre-treatment or a combination of thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening could enhance the biodegradation of five persistent TrOCs, namely TCEP, verapamil, clozapine, triclosan, and triclocarban by 17-50%.

AB Time-dependent dynamics in the concentrations of four anti-influenza drugs (oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and amantadine) in environmental waters collected from the Yodo River basin, Japan, were monitored for the first time over a 1 year period (July 2010 to June 2011). The clear, convex dynamic profiles of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, and zanamivir during a 3 month seasonal influenza outbreak (January to March 2011) were synchronized well with that of the numbers of influenza patients treated with the drugs. The highest levels in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and river waters were, respectively, 177 and 60 ng/L (oseltamivir), 827 and 288 ng/L (oseltamivir carboxylate), and 30 and 15 ng/L (zanamivir). Fixed levels of amantadine were detectable year-round (100-200 ng/L in the STPs and 10-30 ng/L in river waters). The predicted convex profiles of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, and zanamivir in both STPs and river waters were significantly correlated (0.714 < R < 0.932) with the observed values. The profiles were predicted successfully by simple mathematical principles, taking the number of influenza patients, quantities of Tamiflu and Relenza used, dilution by drainwaters passing through STPs, removal rates at STPs, dilution rates in river effluents, and attenuation rates in rivers into consideration.

AB Treated sewage effluents contain complex mixtures of micropollutants, raising concerns about effects on aquatic organisms. The addition of advanced treatment steps has therefore been suggested. However, some of these could potentially produce effluents affecting exposed organisms by unknown modes of action. Here, H-1 NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) metabolomics of fish blood plasma was used to explore potential responses not identified by more targeted (chemical or biological) assays. Rainbow trout was exposed in parallel to six differently treated effluents (e.g., conventional activated sludge, addition of sand filter, further addition of ozonation and/or a moving bed biofilm reactor or a separate membrane bioreactor line). Multivariate data analysis showed changes in the metabolome (HDL, LDL, VLDL and glycerol-containing lipids, cholesterol, glucose, phosphatidylcholine, glutamine, and alanine) between treatment groups. This formed the basis for postulating a hypothesis on how exposure to effluent treated by certain processes, including zonation, would affect the metabolic profiles of exposed fish. The hypothesis withstood testing in an independent study the following year. To conclude, H-1 NMR metabolomics proved suitable for identifying physiological responses not identified by more targeted assays used in parallel studies. Whether these changes are linked to adverse effects remains to be tested.

AB in this study the bioconversion of bismuth to volatile derivatives was investigated in cultures of the common sewage sludge methanogen Methanobacterium formicicum. The production of volatile bismuth compounds was analysed during growth of M.formicicum with respect to the concentration and chemical formulation of the applied bismuth. The main volatile bismuth compound detected in the culture headspace was trimethylbismuth (TMBi), with a maximum conversion rate of up to 2.6 +/- 1.8% from spiked 1 muM bismuth nitrate [Bi(NO3)(3)] in the culture media. This main compound proved to be stable under the incubation conditions in a CO2-H-2 atmosphere. Bismuthine and the partially methylated bismuthines monomethylbismuth hydride and dimethylbismuth hydride were additionally detected in the late exponential growth phase, but only in the presence of low concentrations of spiked Bi(NO3)(3) (10 nM, 100 nM). The conversion of bismuth to TMBi from the bismuth-containing pharmaceuticals Bismofalk " [containing bismuth subgallate and Bi(NO3)(3)] and Noemin((R)) (containing bismuth aluminate) could also be observed, however, with a lower rate than found for Bi(NO3)(3). In vitro experiments with crude extracts of M. formicicum suggest that the methylation of bismuth is mainly catalysed by enzyme-catalysed reactions with methylcobalamin as methyl donor.

AB Pharmaceuticals are consumed in high amounts and can enter as emerging organic compounds in surface waters as they are only partially retained in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Receiving pharmaceuticals may burden the aquatic environment, as they are designed to be bioactive even at low concentrations. Sediment biofilm populations were analyzed in river sediments due to the exposure of an inflow of WWTP effluents. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed of 108 sediment samples, which were taken from multiple cores within three sampling locations in the Panke River, with one sampling site located downstream of the inflow. Sequencing data were processed to infer microbial community structure in samples concerning the environmental variables, such as micropollutants and physicochemical parameters measured for each core. More than 25 different micropollutants were measured in pore water samples, in which bezafibrate, clofibric acid, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were detected at high concentrations. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Ignavibacteriae as the most abundant groups in the samples. Differences in microbial community composition were observed with respect to micropollutants. However, our findings revealed that the composition of the microbial community was not only governed by the effluent. The significant changes in the alpha- and beta-diversity were explained by phenobarbital and SO42-, which did not originate from the WWTP indicating that more unobserved factors are also likely to play a role in affecting the biofilm community's composition.

AB A passive sampling device, a polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), was used to monitor 13 pharmaceuticals and 8 transformation products in upstream and downstream wastewater treatment plant effluent. A POCIS laboratory calibration study was performed to determine uptake behavior and the effect of water flow on the sampling rate. Most compounds showed a linear accumulation, and the sampling rate values ranged from 0.031 to 0.559 L/day. The developed POCIS samplers were used in field experiments in a wastewater-impacted river. Using the calculated sampling rates, the time-weighted average concentration values were measured by three different approaches: (1) laboratory calibration sampling rates (2) performance reference compound (PRC) correction sampling rates and (3) field calibration sampling rates. Nine deuterated compounds (acetaminophen-d(3), antipyrine-d(3), sulfamethoxazole-d(4), carbamazepine-dio, diclofenac acid-d(4), clofibric acid-d(4), bezafibrate-d(6), ibuprofen-d(3) and naproxen-d(3)) were studied as PRCs. Antipyrine-d(3) was successfully tested as a PRC for sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen, diclofenac acid, 4-hydroxydiclofenac acid, carbamazepin, carbamazepin 10,11-epoxide, sulfadiazine, 1-naphthol, antipyrine, naproxen and 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Finally, the POCIS was used to monitor target compounds in river water and measure their attenuation. For most compounds, the POCIS attenuation results were not significantly different from those of the spot samples, which demonstrated that a POCIS with a PRC correction can determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.

AB The secondary effluent from biological treatment process in chemical industrial plant often contains refractory organic matter, which deserves to be further treated in order to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In this study, the key role of biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) in enhanced removal of highly recalcitrant 1,2,4-triazole from bio-treated chemical industrial wastewater was investigated. BioMnOx production by acclimated manganese-oxidizing bacterium (MOB) consortium was confirmed through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Pseudomonas and Bacillus were found to be the most predominant species in acclimated MOB consortium. Mn2+ could be oxidized optimally at neutral pH and initial Mn2+ concentration below 33 mg L-1. However, 1,2,4-triazole removal by BioMnOx produced occurred optimally at slightly acidic pH. High dosage of both Mn2+ and 1,2,4-triazole resulted in decreased 1,2,4-triazole removal. In a biological aerated filter (BAF) coupled with manganese oxidation, 1,2,4-triazole and total organic carbon removal could be significantly enhanced compared to the control system without the participation of manganese oxidation, confirming the key role of BioMnOx in the removal of highly recalcitrant 1,2,4-triazole. This study demonstrated that the biosystem coupled with manganese oxidation had a potential for the removal of various recalcitrant contaminants from biotreated chemical industrial wastewater.

AB Roxarsone has been extensively used as an organoarsenic feed additive. Part of supplemented roxarsone was discharged into wastewater. UASB reactor has been widely applied to treat high concentration of organics wastewater. However, there was little report about the arsenic accumulation from organoarsenic biotransformation in an UASB reactor. In this study, the accumulation and volatilization of arsenic in a 260-day cultured UASB reactor spiked with 13.2 mg/L roxarsone were investigated. In the anaerobic granular sludge (AGS), the total arsenic concentrations were 5276.90 +/- 366.12 mg/kg AGS at the bottom of anaerobic sludge bed and 10,661.92 +/- 539.63 mg/kg AGS at the top of anaerobic sludge bed. Nearly 50% arsenic in the AGS was extracted under acidic conditions, and the main species of the extracted arsenic was arsenite (As(III)). In the aqueous phases, roxarsone was rapidly transformed into 4-hydroxy-3-aminophenylarsonic acid (HAPA) and an unknown organoarsenic, which was further converted to inorganic arsenic and monomethylarsenate (MMA(V)), in which As(III) was also the main species. Volatile arsenic from the reactor spiked with roxarsone was released at a rate of 134.93 +/- 6.61 ng/d. Based on the mass balance analysis of arsenic, 23.40% of the influent arsenic was accumulated in the AGS and 0.002% was released in the form of volatile arsenic. The results from this study indicated that the operation of anaerobic digestion reactor treating organoarsenic-contaminated wastewater and the disposal of the residual AGS should be well managed.

AB The photolytic degradation of norfloxacin, enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolone antibacterials widely used in human and veterinary medicine, was investigated under simulated solar irradiation in different water matrices (river water and synthetic wastewater similar by composition to wastewater of pharmaceutical industry). The results showed that investigated fluoroquinolones degrade very quickly and photodegradation followed pseudo first order kinetics. The slowest photodegradation rate was observed in river water for all three fluoroquinolones. In the case of pharmaceutical mixture irradiation, no significant differences in rate constants were observed compared to single-component experiments. The structures of photodegradation products were determined and photodegradation pathways were suggested. Two main processes occurred primary from enrofloxacin depending on pH values: (I) cyclopropane ring cleavage at pH 4 and (II) oxidative photodegradation at pH 8. The structures of the photoproducts E-1 to E-6 are unknown and have not been reported for this fluoroquinolone. For ciprofloxacin two main processes were also identified depending on experimental conditions. Under acidic conditions (pH 4), reactions involved rather the quinolone ring (cleavage of the cyclopropane ring and fluorine solvolysis), while at pH 8 the side-chain reactions took place. The photodegradation pathway of norfloxacin somewhat differed from the previous two. There was no significant dependence on reaction conditions and there were no two different pathways. Determination and identification of photodegradation products were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The obtained results are of importance for assessing the environmental fate of fluoroquinolones in aqueous media. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been widely reported in most megaci ties in China but seldom in small and median-sized cities. The aim of this study is to investigate occurrence and distribution characteristics of PhACs in a typical small and medium-sized city in China and analyze their sources. 33 PhACs and 4 chiral drugs were selected for a four-season monitoring campaign in Wujin District Jiangsu Province, a typical small and median-sized city, in 2018. PhACs concentration level in surface water, ranging from ng L-1 to mu g L-1, was lower than in large-sized cities and areas in China. Impact from agricultural sources should be concerned in the study area: (1) Significant correlation between concentrations of antibiotics and NH4-N in surface water indicated the potential impact from agricultural sources (fishponds and livestock farms); (2) Government regulating measures on livestock and poultry farms since January 2018 have effectively decreased macrolides and lincosamides emissions into surface water. As for source analysis, CF/CBZ (Caffeine/Carbarnazepine) was a feasible indicator to trace untreated wastewater and enantiorrieric fraction values of metoprolol (MTP) were also suggested to be helpful for identifying untreated wastewater. The results of both two indicators indicated more input of untreated wastewater to surface water in the northeast area and upstream of Wuyi Canal. To our best knowl- edge, this is the first study to systematically analyze PhACs in aquatic environment for a small and medium-sized city in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estrogen in streams threatens aquatic animals, especially where wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent contributes to baseflow. We investigated total estrogen (E1+E2+E3) as estradiol equivalent (E2) and ethynylestradiol (EE2) concentration in Cibolo Creek (Cibolo), a groundwater-fed stream near San Antonio, TX, receiving effluent via two WWTP. We collected water samples bi-monthly from late spring to early fall 2018 in Cibolo and WWTP effluent, and used ELISA analysis and discharge measurements to determine concentrations and loads of estrogens. We measured several environmental variables to investigate what factors influenced estrogen concentrations in Cibolo downstream from WWTP inputs. Mean concentrations of WWTP effluent (E2, 41.43 +/- 15.48; EE2, 11.40 +/- 2.07 ng L-1) were higher compared with concentrations in Cibolo, both downstream (E2, 30.09 +/- 25.85; EE2, 6.33 +/- 1.92 ng L-1) and upstream (E2, 12.91 +/- 11.12; EE2, 4.5 +/- 1.38 ng L-1) of WWTP inputs. Both E2 and EE2 concentrations decreased downstream from WWTP inputs, a section of stream without large quantities of fine sediments for sorption, indicating potential dilution or chemical and biological degradation. Effluent into Cibolo via the first, and older, WWTP contributed the most estrogen load in Cibolo. Median concentrations of E2 and EE2 were 19 and 5 ng L-1, respectively, downstream of WWTP inputs, concentrations known to affect reproductive processes of aquatic biota and impair human health. Results suggest estrogens may pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems wherever WWTP effluent comprises a majority of baseflow, though further studies are required in this stream to verify biological impacts.

AB Seasonal variations in the concentrations of eight ultraviolet (UV) filters and 22 illicit drugs including their metabolites in the Korean aquatic environment were investigated. Seawater samples from three beaches, water samples from two rivers, and influents and effluents from three wastewater treatment plants were analyzed. The UV filter concentrations in the seawater, river water, and effluent samples were 39.4-296, 35.4-117, and 6.84-51.1 ng L-1, respectively. The total UV filter concentrations in the seawater samples were 1.9-4.4 times higher at the peak of the holiday season than outside the peak holiday season. An environmental risk assessment showed that ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) could cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the seawater at the three beaches during the holiday period. Seven of the 22 target illicit drugs including their metabolites were detected in the wastewater influent samples, and the total illicit drug concentrations in the influent samples were 0.08-65.4 ng L-1 The estimated daily consumption rates for cis-tramadol (Cis-TRM), methamphetamine (MTP), meperidine (MEP), and codeine (COD) were 25.7-118.4, 13.8-36.1, 136-12.6, and 1.75-8.64 mg d(-1) (1000 people)(-1), respectively. In popular vacation area, the illicit drug consumption rates (Cis-TRM, MTP and MEP) were 1.6-2.6 times higher at the peak of the summer holiday season than at the beginning of the summer.

AB Parabens, commonly used preservatives, are emerging pollutants that are known to enter waterways through the wastewater system where they can pose a threat to aquatic organisms. Less is known about their presence and contribution to urban waterways in cities with separated stormwater and wastewater systems, such as Sydney, Australia. We measured the occurrence of methyl-(MeP), ethyl-(EtP), propyl-(PrP) and butyl-(BuP) parabens in urban river and stormwater samples across a range of land uses, using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the analysis. MeP in modified stormwater channels was more frequently detected and found at higher mean levels (6.29 mu g L-1) than in urban rivers (3.62 mu g L-1). Waterways in residential catchments had greater mean total paraben load (26.87 mu g L-1) when compared to parkland catchments (12.71 mu g L-1) and bushland catchments (2.10 mu g L-1). EtP had the highest peak concentrations across the study area (max = 305.55 mu g L-1) associated with industrial land uses and areas historically associated with poor water quality. The levels of EtP were relatively high when compared to international studies in cities with combined stormwater and wastewater systems. The results also suggest overflows from the sewer during heavy rain are likely not as significant when compared to the contribution from urban runoff. The study did not reveal the source of the EtP and further studies are recommended to identify this and the potential environmental impact.

AB The appearance of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments has become a serious problem because of their hazardous effect on the biota. Therefore, great efforts are focussed in the removal to these pollutants from wastewaters. In this study, an innovative technology based on the principles of Zero-Waste for the management of wastewater streams is presented. Hence, adsorption of fluoxetine (FLX), selected as a model pollutant, in an eco-friendly adsorbent, biochar, was followed by an in situ removal of the pharmaceutical in the solid matrix by the action of sulfate radicals. Initially, an in-depth characterisation of the adsorbent and the adsorption process was carried out. The pseudo-second order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm described well the process, and the electrostatic attractions were revealed as the primary adsorption mechanism. Later, the removal of the FLX was studied by the sulfate radicals, in the presence of activators (Fe2+ and citric acid), in liquid and onto the biochar medium. It was concluded that in order to enhance the pollutant removal it is necessary the presence of both activators in liquid media. However, in in situ removal onto biochar, it was not necessary the Fe2+ presence and only the addition of complexing agents was required as a result of biochar's mineral content. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach was studied in fixed-bed column assays where the adsorption and the removal of the pollutant were efficiently accomplished. This fact confirms the suitability of the developed process as a viable alternative in the treatment of wastewaters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND Azoles are an important class of compounds that are widely used as corrosion inhibitors in aircraft de-icing agents, cooling towers, semiconductor manufacturing and household dishwashing detergents. They also are important moieties in pharmaceutical drugs and fungicides. Azoles are widespread emerging contaminants occurring frequently in water bodies. Azole compounds can potentially cause inhibition towards key biological processes in natural ecosystems and wastewater treatment processes. Of particular concern is the inhibition of azoles to the nitrification process (aerobic oxidation of ammonium). This study investigated the acute toxicity of azole compounds towards the anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) process, which is an important environmental biotechnology gaining traction for nutrient-nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. In this study, using batch bioassay techniques, the anammox toxicity of eight commonly occurring azole compounds was evaluated. RESULTS The results show that 1H-benzotriazole and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole had the highest inhibitory effect on the anammox process, causing 50% decrease in anammox activity (IC50) at concentrations of 19.6 and 17.8 mg L-1, respectively. 1H-imidazole caused less severe toxicity with an IC50 of 79.4 mg L-1. The other azole compounds were either nontoxic (1H-pyrazole, 1H-1,2,4-triazole and 1-methyl-pyrazole) or at best mildly toxic (1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid and 3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole) towards the anammox bacteria at the concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that most azole compounds tested displayed mild to low or no toxicity towards the anammox bacteria. The anammox bacteria were found to be far less sensitive to azoles compared to nitrifying bacteria. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants present in wastewaters cause severe health hazards among chronically exposed population. Emerging pharmaceutically active contaminants pose a serious challenge to conventional treatment technologies. Employing advanced treatment technologies for the abatement of such contaminants is usually energy-intensive. In this study, a complex pharmaceutical wastewater from a pharmaceutical industry in California, USA, was treated by employing a novel bio-electrochemical treatment train system. Labeled "Bio-electroperoxone," our proposed system comprises (i) an electrically bound biofilm reactor (EBBR) that accelerates bacterial adhesion for the removal of biodegradable and persistent organics and (ii) an electroperoxone reactor that removes recalcitrant organics with minimal energy uptake. The EBBR comprises a platinum-coated titanium cathode and a conductive nematic liquid crystal display electrode (NLCE) obtained from electronic waste that serves as the anode. Characterization of functional groups, morphology, and elemental mapping of NLCE were carried out to explain mechanisms for rapid biofilm attachment. The concomitant electroperoxone reactor comprises a platinum-coated titanium (Pt-Ti) anode and a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) cathode that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of oxygen to form in situ H2O2. The bio-electroperoxone system (i) inactivated 99.99% of the micro-organisms, removed (ii) 92.20% of the color, (iii) 84.72% of the total suspended solids, and (iv) 89% of the total organic carbon (TOC). Possible mechanisms for the degradation of organic contaminants are elucidated. Bio-electroperoxone thus paves the way for an efficient and sustainable approach for the efficient removal of both biodegradable and recalcitrant, persistent organic contaminants from pharmaceutical and possibly other complex wastewaters.

TI Removal of selected emerging micropollutants from wastewater treatment

AB The presence of 48 emerging micropollutants was tested in influent and effluent from primary and secondary treatment at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Serbia. Sixteen emerging micropollutants (active pharmaceutical ingredients, bisphenols, parabens and UV filters) had concentrations >LOQ (max. conc. 33.4 mu g/L). The removal efficiency of primary treatment ranged from 2.0% - 96.0%. In the case of secondary treatment, except for ketoprofen (61.0%), diclofenac (62.6%) and carbamazepine (- 20.0%), all other measured micropollutants had removal efficiency above 77.0%. Advanced non-oxidative lab-scale treatments were investigated. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption achieved removal efficiencies in the range 52.4-99.9%, novel coagulation with natural coagulant isolated from beans achieved removal efficiencies in range 3.2-99.9%, conventional coagulation with ferric chloride 3.12-96.4%, combined adsorption/coagulation 2.69-99.9% and combined PAC/ultrafiltration (PAC/UF) 60-99.9%. For most of the micropollutants, their removal efficiencies were similar to that reported in the literature. Novel natural coagulant showed significant potential compared to the conventional coagulant during a short episode of sub-optimal WWTP operation. When natural coagulant was applied as a part of an adsorption/coagulation hybrid process, there was no negative effect on PAC adsorption, while for conventional coagulant that was not always the case. Also, a structure property relationship (SPR) study revealed correlations between the removal efficiency of the majority of treatments applied and total polar surface area (TPSA) of the micropollutants.

AB South Africa has the largest occurrence of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the world but has also implemented the largest antiretroviral (ARV) treatment programme. It was therefore of interest to determine the presence and concentrations of commonly used antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) and, also, to determine the capabilities of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for removing ARVDs. To this end, a surrogate standard based LC-MS/MS method was optimized and applied for the detection of thirteen ARVDs used in the treatment and management of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in two major and one modular WWTP in the eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The method was validated and the detection limits fell within the range of 2-20 ng L-1. The analytical recoveries for the ARVDs were mainly greater than 50% with acceptable relative standard deviations. The concentration values ranged from < LOD - 53000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 34000 ng L-1 (effluent) in a decentralized wastewater treatment facility (DEWATS); < LOD - 24000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 33000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Northern WWTP and 61-34000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 20000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Phoenix WWTP. Whilst abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine were almost completely removed from the effluents, atazanavir, efavirenz, lopinavir and nevirapine persisted in the effluents from all three WWTPs. To estimate the ecotoxicological risks associated with the discharge of ARVDs, a countrywide survey focussing on the occurrence of ARVDs in WWTPs, surface and fresh water bodies, and aquatic organisms, is necessary.

AB The removal of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) present in urban wastewater by membrane bioreactors (MBRs) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) membranes has been frequently addressed in the literature. However, data regarding the removal of their main human metabolites and transformation products (TPs) is still scarce. In this study, the presence of 13 PhACs and 20 of their metabolites and TPs was monitored during 2 consecutive years in the different treatment steps of urban raw wastewater (sewer, primary treatment, MBR and RO/NF). Rejection of the selected contaminants when using low pressure NF membranes (NF-90) or RO membranes (ESPA 2) after the MBR step was also investigated. The analgesic acetaminophen, which was found at the highest concentrations in the sewer and influent samples (18-74 mu g L-1) over the two experimental periods, was fully eliminated during MBR treatment. Those PhACs that were only partially removed after the MBR, were almost completely removed (> 99%) by the RO membrane working under different process conditions. At a similar average permeate fluxes (18 L m(-2) h(-1)), the NF membrane showed high removal efficiencies (> 90%) for all of the PhACs and their metabolites, though lower than those achieved by the RO membrane. When the flux of the NF90 membrane was increased to 30 L m(-2) h(-1) (while still operating at a feed pressure lower than the RO membrane at 18 L m(-2) h(-1)) the performance of the membrane increased, achieving 98% rejection of PhACs.

AB The presence and persistency of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment attracted great attention recently. Among them, antibiotics and pain-killers accounted for a large quantity. Although many works were devoted to the investigation of their removal in wastewater treatment processes, most of the PPCPs studied were of cationic nature. The net repulsive interactions between anionic PPCPs and negatively charged sorbents make them difficult to be removed in wastewater treatment. In this study, 2:1 clay minerals illite and montmorillonite (MMT) were modified with different amounts of cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammoium bromide (CTAB). The types and sites of interactions between the surfactant-modified clays and the anionic drug diclofenac (DC) were investigated. The uptake of DC on the modified clays was controlled by the CTAB loading level and its surface configuration on the clays. The adsorption sites of DC were limited to the external surfaces of modified illite due to its non-swelling nature. On the contrary, both the external and interlayer sites were available for the adsorption of DC on modified MMT. A CTAB bilayer formation resulted in significant increase in DC adsorption due to the formation of extensive admicelles. FTIR results showed participation of the benzene ring, N-H, and CH2CH3 for the interactions between DC and modified MMT, suggesting that partitioning of DC into the admicelles of CTAB played a significant role in DC uptake. The results could extend the application of surfactant-modified clays for the removal of anionic PPCPs in the wastewater treatment processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paclitaxel is a highly toxic anticancer agent which is used in a wide range against ovarian, breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Paclitaxel is manufactured recently in the north of Iran which may lead to the introduction of the drug into the environment via pharmaceutical wastewater. To our knowledge, Paclitaxel degradation is currently performed using physicochemical methods and biological degradation of Paclitaxel has not been reported. In this study, a Paclitaxel degrading bacterium was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater for the first time. The bacterium was identified using biochemical and molecular assays and its Paclitaxel degradation potential was evaluated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In addition, kinetic and thermodynamic study of Paclitaxel degradation at different experimental conditions was performed. A Citrobacter species named as C. amalonaticus Rashtia able to degrade and utilize Paclitaxel as the sole carbon source was isolated. The isolated strain tolerated high level concentration of Paclitaxel (0.4 mg/mL) in liquid culture media and was able to degrade spillage-level concentrations of the drug (0.01-0.1 mg/mL) with 87-93 % efficacy under aerobic condition. Kinetic and thermodynamic study at different pHs (4.0, 7.0 and 10.0) and temperatures (285, 295 and 310 K) revealed that Paclitaxel degradation is a non-spontaneous process and the highest rate constant was observed in the basic condition and at the highest temperature. The Delta G values at 285, 295 and 310 K were determined 103.3, 105.9 and 109.9 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, The Delta H and activation energy (E-a) of the process were determined +28.7 kJ/mol and +30.87 kJ/mol, respectively.

AB The release of hospital wastewater into the urban sewer networks contributes to the general contamination of aquatic media by pharmaceutical residues. These residues include bio-accumulative pharmaceuticals that lead to increased risk for ecosystems because they can concentrate in organisms and food chains, and therefore reach toxic levels. In order to assess the ecotoxicological risks linked to this particular category of residues, we have developed a specific method, by combining a theoretical calculation of pollutant concentrations in organisms to estimate Body Residue (BR), and ecotoxicity biomarkers in fish cell lines, enabling the calculation of a Critical Body Residue (CBR). This method finally results in the calculation of a specific risk quotient (Qb = BR/CBR), characterizing the risk linked to this type of pollutant. This method was applied to mitotane, a bio-accumulative pharmaceutical typically found in hospital wastewater, in the framework of an exposure scenario corresponding to the discharge of all the hospital wastewaters into the Rhone River which flows through the city of Lyon, France. This approach leads to risk quotients (Qb and Qbg) much higher than those found with the classical approach, i.e. Q = PEC/PNEC (Predictive Environmental Concentration/Predictive Non Effect Concentration) = 0.0006. This difference in the appreciation of risk is important when using cytotoxicity as the criterion for measuring the toxicity of mitotane (Qb = 0.056) and it is even greater when the criterion used is genotoxicity (Qbg = 6.8). This study must be now consolidated by taking the biomagnification of the pharmaceuticals into consideration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The industrial revolution in the production of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has significantly improved public health in recent years. However, this development has also led to water pollution because of the unintentional disposal of these synthetic chemicals, creating unacceptable sanitary conditions. Conventional wastewater treatment systems can eliminate most of the contaminants, however these are not efficient in removing PPCPs. Plant-based remediation is a simple, yet very effective and eco-friendly approach that can complement existing wastewater treatment. Phytoremediation of emerging contaminants is relatively new, and various key concepts including the uptake and detoxification mechanisms remain relatively unexplored compared with microbial processes. This review comprehensively discusses the latest studies on the biochemistry and application of phytoremediation for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater, focusing on the mechanisms of uptake and detoxification through the enzymatic biotransformation of PPCPs and the latest field applications using innovative engineered systems. Future research recommendations are addressed, including the need of topics warranting investigation in PPCPs interactions with plant tissues, their metabolic transformation in plants, development of new predictive uptake models and futuristic advancements involving the cutting-edge methodologies in genetic engineering for the realization of advanced phytoremediation technologies. This review is an effort to gather the scattered information on research updates of phytoremediation in recent decade to present an outlook of the emerging, green biotechnology for the rehabilitation of the environment.

AB Recently, the micro-nano bubble (MB) technology has attracted people's attention due to its special advantages. Here, we carried out the technology of combining MB and hydrogen peroxide (MB/H2O2) to achieve efficient degradation of tetracycline wastewater. The effect of MB/H2O2 technology on the degradation efficiency of tetracycline was deeply analysed by investigating the reaction time, H2O2 dosage, pH and MB inlet flow. The results showed that the degradation rate of tetracycline hydrochloride by MB/H2O2 technology can reach 92.43%, which is 9.44 and 3.94 times that of MB and H2O2 alone. Through electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and free radical quenching experiments, a possible mechanism for MB/H2O2 technology to efficiently degrade TC was proposed. In the MB/H2O2 system, the high temperature and high pressure environment generated when MB ruptures can activate H2O2 to obtain a higher number of active oxygen species. center dot OH is the main reactive oxygen radical in the process of MB/H2O2 degradation of TC, followed by HO2 center dot/center dot O-2-. In addition, the possible intermediate products of the oxidation TC process were identified by HPLC-MS technology. Under the action of center dot OH and HO2 center dot/center dot O-2- free radicals, TC molecules undergo demethylation and hydroxylation, ring-opening reactions, isomerization, deethylation, deacylation, deamination and dehydration reactions to generate intermediate products and finally convert them into CO2 and H2O. The development of MB/H2O2 technology can potentially be used to efficiently remove TC substances in the water environment and provide a new method for water purification.

AB The accumulation of micropollutants (MPs) and their increasing concentration in the aquatic environment are an emerging issue for water quality in the world. The complex web of exposure pathways, as well as the variety in the chemical structure and potency of MPs, represents enormous challenges for researchers and policy initiatives. In order to manage MPs, it has to be decided which of them have to be reduced and to what extent, where in the water cycle this would be the most efficient and which technical means that should be applied to be sustainable. All of these aspects require a knowledge of MPs abundance, properties, fate and impact in the environment, which is essentially determined by two related features: the sources and the physico-chemical characteristics of MPs. Micropollutants including pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and hormones can enter the aquatic environment through both diffuse and point sources, but in urbanised regions wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a crucial role in their dissemination. Conventional WWTPs are effective in removal of macropollutants (e.g. nutrients, suspended solids and some trace elements), while MPs may go through the treatment unchanged or be removed at different rates. Most of the EU countries are convinced that the presence of MPs in the environment poses a serious problem, particularly in highly populated regions where surface water resources serve as a source of potable water. Presently, various technical solutions are available and have been proven possible to integrate with existing treatment processes in an expedient manner. The solutions that have been evaluated are mainly based on ozonation and/or activated carbon treatment technologies which may definitely be considered the most effective compared to the costs incurred.

AB Occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in surface water bodies can cause adverse effects on non-target organisms. When surface waters are used as drinking water sources, temporal variability in EOC concentrations can potentially impact drinking water quality and human health. To better understand spatiotemporal variability of EOCs in drinking water sources in Central Pennsylvania, EOCs were evaluated in six drinking water sources during a two-year study period (April 2016-June 2018) in the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). The study was conducted in two phases: Phase I was a spatially distributed sampling approach within the SRB focusing on seven human pharmaceuticals and Phase II was a temporally intensive sampling regime at a single site focusing on a broader range of EOCs. Concentration-discharge relationships were utilized to classify EOC transport dynamics and understand the extent to which hydrologic and anthropogenic factors, such as surface runoff and wastewater effluent, may contribute to EOC occurrence. Overall, EOCs were present at higher concentrations in colder seasons than warmer seasons. Thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide, and caffeine exhibited accretion dynamics during high-flow periods, suggesting higher transport during surface runoff events. Human pharmaceuticals known to persist in wastewater effluent were inversely correlated with discharge, indicating dilution characteristics consistent with diminished wastewater signals during high-flow periods. Acetaminophen exhibited near-chemostatic transport dynamics, indicating nonpoint source inputs during high-flow periods. Risk calculations revealed that although EOCs posed medium-to-high risk to aquatic organisms, human health risk through fish consumption was low. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Direct reuse of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) in agriculture has recently received increasing attention as a possible solution to water scarcity. The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in RWW can be critical, as these chemicals can be uptaken in irrigated crops and eventually ingested during food consumption.
   In the present study, an integrated model was developed to predict the fate of CECs in water reuse systems where RWW is used for edible crops irrigation. The model was applied to a case study where RWW (originating from a municipal wastewater treatment plant) is discharged into a water channel, with subsequent irrigation of silage maize, rice, wheat and ryegrass. Environmental and human health risks were assessed for 13 CECs, selected based on their chemical and hazard characteristics. Predicted CEC concentrations in the channel showed good agreement with available measurements, indicating potential ecotoxicity of some CECs (estrogens and biocides) due to their limited attenuation. Plant uptake predictions were in good agreement with existing literature data, indicating higher uptake in leaves and roots than fruits. Notably, high uncertainties were shown for weakly acidic CECs, possibly due to degradation in soil and pH variations inside plants. The human health risk due to the ingestion of wheat and rice was assessed using the threshold of toxicological concern and the hazard quotient. Both approaches predicted negligible risk for most CECs, while sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol exhibited the highest risk for consumers. Alternative scenarios were evaluated to identify possible risk minimization strategies (e.g., adoption of a more efficient irrigation system). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Coupled systems between biological treatments and Advance Oxidation Processes emerge as an alternative to reduce costs and obtain high removal efficiencies of these types of substances. In this study, the removal efficiency of micropollutants such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen using a coupled system between a Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland planted with Cyperus ligularis and an Ozonation reactor was evaluated. Three Ozone doses (10, 15 and 21 mg/L) were assessed as explanatory variable and the experiment was performed in six set of samples. In addition, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Total Nitrogen (TN) and in situ variables such as pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, Redox Potential, Electric Conductivity and Temperature were monitored as Covariates. The main results revealed that overall removal efficiency averaged 97.2% and >= 97.3% for Ibuprofen and Naproxen respectively, using the medium Ozone dose (15 mg.L-1) were obtained. Results indicated that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the ozone doses used, whereas significant statistical differences were found between coupling performance and individual technologies. Likewise, the coupled system demonstrated versatility regarding organic matter and nitrogen removal, with performances above to 70% and 50% in terms of DOC and TN, respectively.

AB Paracetamol (PAM) has emerged as an important wastewater contaminant due to its wide usage. In this study, Fenton reactions were introduced to microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for bio-electrochemical degradation of PAM without external power supply. Dual-chamber MFC reactors were employed: in the anode chambers, bio-electrons were released by oxidizing biodegradable pollutants in low-strength real domestic wastewater; in the cathode chambers, the input fluxes of bio-electrons from the anode could promote the yield of free radical (OH)-O-center dot by facilitating the regeneration of iron source. Compared to conventional Fenton reactions in which no bio-electrons were transferred, our approach exhibited the advantage that no continuous addition of Fenton reagents was required in MFC-Fenton system. Significant changes in the UV-vis spectra of catholytes from an MFC-powered process strongly indicated that bio-electricity input played an important role in PAM degradation. The performance of electro-Fenton system was in good agreement with the bio-electricity output-capacity from MFC reactor under expected optimal conditions. At total iron concentration of 5 mg L-1, initial pH value of 2.0 and external resistance of 20 Omega, the highest PAM degradation efficiency of 70% was attained within 9 h. A 25% PAM could be completely mineralized while the majority was mainly converted to intermediate metabolites of p-nitrophenol via p-aminophenol and to less hazardous dicarboxylic/carboxylic acids. These results suggested that MFC-Fenton could be applied as an energy-saving and efficient approach to PAM-containing wastewater treatment, and further to non-biocompatible pharmaceuticals degradation in aquatic environment.

AB The polycyclic musks tonalide (R) (acetyl hexamethyltetraline = 1-(3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-6,7-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone, AHTN), galaxolide (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyrane, HHCB) and the degradation product HHCB-lactone were determined in water samples and brown trouts (Salmo trutta fario) of the river Ammer, a small catchment in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, south-west Germany. The Ammer receives the effluent discharge of two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with 90,000 population equivalents. The wastewater contributes 14% of the total discharge of the river (average 1.0 m(3)/s). Water samples were collected monthly at 12 sampling points from June 2010 to May 2011. Downstream the WWTPs the median concentrations of HHCB, AHTN and HHCB-lactone were 0.26 mu g/L, 0.06 mu g/L and 1.0 mu g/L, respectively. The effluent of the WWTPs was identified as main source of the synthetic musks in the surface water. The ratio of HHCB-lactone/HHCB showed significant seasonal variations indicating the influence of the water temperature on the degradation of HHCB in the surface water.
   A total of 251 trout was caught in two campaigns in October 2010 at 12 sampling points. The median concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in the trouts downstream the WWTPs significantly increased to 10.8 mu g/g lipid weight (LW) and 3.7 mu g/g LW, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urine comprises only a small (similar to 1%) volumetric fraction of municipal wastewater, but represents a dominant source of pharmaceuticals, many of which may pass through conventional wastewater treatment and pose risks to aquatic ecosystems. Point-source treatment of source-separated urine presents a unique opportunity to degrade pharmaceuticals before dilution with wastewater, and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are one increasingly investigated option. However, they often lead to the formation of oxidation byproducts including chlorate, perchlorate at very high concentrations. Here, we show that the high urea content of fresh human urine suppresses the formation of oxychlorides by inhibiting formation of HOCl/OCl- during electrolysis, while still enabling pharmaceutical degradation due to the slow rate of urea oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot. This results in improved performance compared to equivalent treatment of hydrolyzed aged urine. This electrochemical oxidation scheme is shown to degrade the model contaminants cyclophosphamide and sulfamethoxazole with surface-area-to-volume-normalized pseudo-first-order rate constants greater than 0.08 cm/min in authentic fresh human urine. It results in similar to 100 x decrease in pharmaceutical concentrations in 2 h while generating similar to 1000 x lower oxychloride byproduct concentrations in synthetic fresh urine than synthetic hydrolyzed aged urine matrixes. Importantly, this proof-of-principle shows that simple and safe electrochemical methods can be used for point-source-remediation of pharmaceuticals in fresh human urine (before storage and hydrolysis), without formation of significant oxychloride byproducts.

AB Although photo-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed to treat wastewater, few studies have investigated the feasibility of AOPs to simultaneously remove antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and micropollutants (MPs). This study employed a modified photo-Fenton process using ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) to chelate iron(III), thus maintaining the reaction pH in a neutral range. Simultaneous removal of ARB and associated extracellular (e-ARGs) and intracellular ARGs (i-ARGs), was assessed by bacterial cell culture, qPCR and atomic force microscopy. The removal of five MPs was also evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. A low dose comprising 0.1 mM Fe(III), 0.2 mM EDDS, and 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was found to be effective for decreasing ARB by 6-log within 30 min, and e-ARGs by 6-log within 10 min. No ARB regrowth occurred after 48-h, suggesting that the proposed process is an effective disinfectant against ARB. Moreover, five recalcitrant MPs (carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, mecoprop and benzotriazole at an initial concentration of 10 mu g/L each) were > 99% removed after 30 min treatment in ultrapure water. The modified photo-Fenton process was also validated using synthetic wastewater and real secondary wastewater effluent as matrices, and results suggest the dosage should be doubled to ensure equivalent removal performance. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the modified process is an optimistic "one-stop" solution to simultaneously mitigate both chemical and biological hazards. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of three over-the-counter pharmaceuticals from aqueous solution using four different adsorbents was analyzed. To study the effect of infused pharmaceutical and adsorbent on the adsorption system, both the concentration of drug and adsorbent dosage were varied, with constant temperature and pressure at different contact time. Adsorption kinetics, isotherm models, and ANOVA allegorized a generic trend for pharmaceutical removal efficiency of the adsorbents that varied as follows: activated carbon>fly ash>bentonite>sugar cane bagasse ash. The Tempkin model appears to fit the isotherm data better than Freundlich and Langmuir. Correspondingly, the kinetic studies implied a pseudo-second-order fit, to understand the mechanism by which the solute accumulates on the surface of a solid and gets adsorbed to the surface via intra-particle diffusion. Furthermore, some special cases of removal tendencies were noted based on sorbate-sorbent interaction. Effectively, it was observed that at an adsorbent loading of 2g and initial concentration of 0.2mmolL(-1), bentonite, fly ash, and activated carbon were able to strip more than 80% of all pharmaceuticals from urine. A framework for the highest significance of the experiments was obtained using response surface methodology by the combination of ciprofloxacin-bentonite followed by paracetamol-activated carbon and ibuprofen-activated carbon. Quasi-Newton and Bayesian regression methods were implemented on Langmuir isotherm by designing the neural network for the batch adsorption experiments. Based on the numerical calculations and graphical representations, the proposed model leads to the result that error is minimized and the values are optimized for different pharmaceuticals such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin that can be removed from wastewater streams by locally available adsorbents.

AB The determination of acidic pharmaceutical and endocrine disrupting compounds at low ng/L levels in surface and wastewater requires highly selective and sensitive analytical procedures. Therefore, the water samples under study were prepared by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) for analyte enrichment and clean up. Prior to GC-NCI-MS, the polar analytes were derivatized using pentafluorobenzyl bromide. The performance of this analytical method has been revealed in fortification experiments by limits of detection ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 ng, L for, e.g., ibuprofen and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, respectively. SPE may be the most rate determining step of the analytical procedure. Therefore, the performance of SPE disks and cartridges was additionally compared. Method evaluation demonstrated that even complex sample matrices, such as model wastewater or even synthetic humic acids, did not interfere with the quantification and identification of target analytes. The performance of the analytical method developed for water monitoring was further emphasized by the investigation of surface water of the River Saale and effluents of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In those samples, acidic pharmaceuticals and corresponding metabolites occurred at 0.1 ng/L for clofibric acid up to 498 ng/L for bezafibrate. Technical nonylphenol and bisphenol A were found in every water sample. Meanwhile, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was determined only in one WWTP effluent sample at 1 ng/L.

AB This study demonstrates the full scale application of iron dosing in a metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the upstream sewer system for multiple benefits. Two different dosing locations, i.e., the WWTP inlet works (Trial-1) and upstream sewer network (Trial-2) were tested in this study. Both dosing trials achieved multiple benefits such as sulfide control, phosphate removal and improved sludge dewaterability. During Trial-1, a sulfide reduction of >90% was achieved at high dosing rates (>19 kgFe ML-1) of ferrous chloride in the inlet works and in Trial-2 the in-sewer ferrous dosing had significant gas phase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentration reduction in the sewer network. The ferrous dosing enhanced the phosphate removal in the bioreactor up to 76% and 53 +/- 2% during Trial-1 & 2, respectively. The iron ending up in the anaerobic sludge digester reduced the biogas H2S concentration by up to 36% and 45%, respectively. The dewaterability of the digested sludge was improved, with relative increases of 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively. The presence of primary clarifier showed limited impact on the downstream availability of iron for achieving the afore-mentioned multiple benefits. The iron dosing enhanced the total chemical oxygen demand removal in the primary clarifier reaching up to 49% at the high dose rates during Trial-1 and 42 +/- 1% during Trial-2. This study demonstrated that multiple benefits could be achieved independent of the iron dosing location (i.e., at the WWTP inlet or in the network). Further, iron dosing at both locations enhances primary settling, beneficial for bioenergy recovery from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antiestrogens and antiandrogens are relatively rarely studied endocrine disrupting chemicals which can be found in unitreated wastewaters. Antiestrogens and antiandrogens in the wastewater treatment effluents could contribute to sexual disruption of organisms. In this study, to assess the removal of nonspecific antiestrogens and antiandrogens by advanced treatment processes, ozonation and adsorption to granular activated carbon (GAC), the biological activities and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy of wastewater were evaluated. As the applied ozone dose increased to 12 mg/L, the antiestrogenic activity dramatically decreased to 3.2 mu g 4-hydroxytamoxifen equivalent (4HEQ)/L, with a removal efficiency of 84.8%, while the antiandrogenic activity was 23.1 mu g flutamide equivalent (FEQ)/L, with a removal efficiency of 75.5%. The removal of antiestrogenic/antiandrogenic activity has high correlation with the removal of fulvic acid-like materials and humic acid-like organics, suggesting that they can be used as surrogates for antiestrogenic/antiandrogenic activity during ozonation. The adsorption kinetics of antiestrogenic activity and antiandrogenic activity were well described by pseudo-second-order kinetics models. The estimated equilibrium concentration of antiestrogenic activity is 7.9 mu g 4HEQ/L with an effective removal efficiency of 70.5%, while the equilibrium concentration of antiandrogenic activity is 33.7 mu g FEQ/L with a removal efficiency of 67.0%. Biological activity evaluation of wastewater effluents is an attractive way to assess the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals by different treatment processes. Fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as a surrogate measure of bioassays during ozonation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An increasing number of pharmaceutical active substances are produced through biotechnological processes. For sustained and safe growth of the host organisms as well as optimal expression, purification, and formulation of the product, biotechnological manufacturing processes need optimal and robust environmental conditions, which are attained through the use of buffers, chelators, and antibiotics, beside nutrients. These ancillary substances are drained with the wastewater to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and are released after treatment with the effluent to receiving waters. The potential risks of such substances to WWTPs and surface waters were investigated. Three common buffers (morpholinoethane sulfonic acid [MES], morpholinopropanesulfonic acid [MOPS], 1,4-piperazine (diethanesulfonic acid) [PIPES]), one chelator (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]), and one antibiotic (gentamycin) were searched in the literature for environmental data or tested for biodegradability and inhibition of activated sludge as well as acute toxicity to algae, daphnids, and fish. Amounts of the ancillary substances used in the European biotechnological production plants of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd in Basle (Switzerland) and Penzberg (Germany), and actual wastewater fluxes through the respective WWTP, as well as realistic dilution factors for the local receiving water, were documented. Based on this information, site-specific predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the WWTPs and surface waters in Basle and Penzberg were extrapolated. These PECs were compared with predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) for the WWTP and surface waters, derived from sludge inhibition and ecotoxicity results, respectively. For all five ancillary substances investigated, all PEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios are <1, indicating no significant risk to the WWTPs or the receiving waters at both sites. Environ. Toxicol.

AB In this study, we report for the first time application of magnetic ionic liquid (MIL), (Z)-octadec-9-en-1-aminium tetrachloroferrate (III) in the simultaneous preconcentration and quantification of 3 different categories of pharmaceutical products clomipramine, ketoprofen and loperamide from wastewater and human urine samples using dispersive micro-solid phase extraction detected and quantified in high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector. The MIL was characterized by magnetic property measurement systems, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman scattering spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. First, a specified amount of the sorbent was successfully added to the sample solution containing the analytes. Afterward, the sample pH is adjusted and stirred at a constant rate of 700 rpm for 45 min. After the adsorption of the analytes, the sample is then sonicated for desorption then centrifuged and decanted for analysis. After optimization, the limit of detection (LOD) was within 2.3-2.9 mu g/L and the linearity range was within 1-750 mu g/L for all the analytes. The correlation coefficients (R-2) obtained were in the range of 0.9967-0.9974, and the relative standard deviation (RSD, %) for intra-day and inter-day was within 2.7-3.3 and 2.6-3.7, respectively. Finally, the applicability of the method on real wastewater and human urine samples was examined and the preconcentration and quantification of the drugs at microgram levels were confirmed with satisfactory results.

AB Achromobacter denitrificans PR1 has previously shown potential to degrade the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, whereby sulfamethoxazole biotransformation was stimulated in the presence of biogenic substrates. This study examined the biotransformation kinetics of sulfamethoxazole and its two main conjugates, N-4-acetyl-SMX and SMX-N-1-Glucuronide, by activated sludge and activated sludge bioaugmented with A. denitrificans PR1. SMX biotransformation under both anoxic and aerobic conditions was tested, with and without the addition of acetate as growth substrate, to understand the range of applicable conditions for bioaugmentation purposes. Biological process models, such as the pseudo-first order kinetic and cometabolic models, were also applied and, following the estimation of kinetic parameters, could well describe data measured in bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented AS batch experiments under various test conditions. Experimental and modelling results suggest that (i) retransformation of the two conjugates to SMX in AS occurred under both aerobic and anoxic conditions, and (ii) biotransformation kinetics of SMX can vary significantly depending on redox conditions, e.g., SMX was biotransformed by AS only under aerobic conditions. Notably, SMX biotransformation was significantly enhanced when PR1 was bioaugmented in AS. Addition of acetate as biogenic substrate is not necessary, as PR1 was capable of enhancing the SMX biotransformation by using the carbon sources present in wastewater. Overall, bioaugmentation by means of A. denitrificans PR1 could be a viable strategy for enhancing SMX removal in AS wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

AB Contaminant exposure in aqueous systems typically involves complex chemical mixtures. Given the large number of compounds present in the environment, it is critical to identify hazardous chemical interactions rapidly. The present study utilized a prototype for a novel high-throughput assay to quantify behavioral changes over time to identify chemical interactions that affect toxicity. The independent and combined effects of 2 chemicals, diazinon (an insecticide) and 4-nonylphenol (a detergent metabolite), on the swimming behavior of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex were examined. Cumulative distance and change in direction were measured repeatedly via optical tracking over 90min. Exposure to low concentrations of diazinon (0.125-2 mu M) or 4-nonylphenol (0.25-4 mu M) elicited significant concentration- and time-dependent effects on swimming behavior. Exposure to 0.5 mu M 4-nonylphenol alone did not significantly alter mean cumulative distance but did elicit a small, significant increase in mean angle, the measure of change in direction. When 0.5 mu M 4-nonylphenol was used in combination with diazinon (0.125-0.5 mu M), it augmented the adverse impact of diazinon on the swimming behavior of Daphnia. Additionally, enhanced sensitivity to diazinon was observed in animals exposed to treated wastewater effluent for 24h prior to a diazinon challenge. The present experiments demonstrate that exposure to 4-nonylphenol and complex chemical mixtures (e.g., treated wastewater) can enhance the toxicity of exposure to the insecticide diazinon.

AB Two hybrid membrane processes combining powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption with ultrafiltration (UF) were investigated regarding operational performance and efficiency to remove organic micropollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent. A pressurized PAC/UF (pPAC/UF) and a submerged PAC/UF (sPAK/UF) system were operated continuously over a period of six months.
   Both UF membrane systems showed good compatibilitywith the application of PAC showing no abrasion or other negative impacts. The pPAC/UF system reached permeability values up to 290 L/(m(2)h bar) at high fluxes of 80 L/(m(2)h) compared to the sPAC/UF with a permeability of up to 200 L/(m(2)h bar) at fluxes of up to 23 L/(m(2)h). Surface analysis of both membranes with scanning electron microscopy revealed no membrane deterioration after the six-month period of operation. On the surface of the pressurized membrane the formation of a PAC layer was observed, which may have contributed to the high permeability by forming a protective coating.
   Five micropollutants, i.e. sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, mecoprop, diclofenac and benzotriazole in ambient effluent concentrations were investigated. Both PAC/UF systems removed 60-95% of the selected micropollutants at a dosage of 20 mg PAC/L and 4 mg Fe3+/ L.

AB Emerging contaminants, especially, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are not removed well during conventional wastewater treatment and hence pose water quality risk to the environment and potentially to public health. Long-term use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation can lead to accumulation of trace contaminants in the soil, ground water and their subsequent uptake by plants and potentially can enter human food chain. This paper uses biochar as an adsorbent to remove emerging contaminants from treated wastewater by performing fixed bed experiments. Ten emerging contaminants namely, carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine, diethyltoluamide (DEET), diphenhydramine (DPH), meprobamate (MPB), primidone (PMD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), fluoxetine (FXT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and trimethoprim (TMP) were monitored during lab scale experiments. Results from the continuous flow runs showed that the breakthrough curve for compounds caffeine, CBZ, DEET and PFOA follow second order Thomas model with adsorption capacities of 396 mu g g(-1), 392 mu g g(-1), 1160 mu g g(-1) and 32 mu g g(-1) biochar, respectively. Whereas compounds such as DPH, TMP and FXT were completely removed throughout the column runs by biochar. Results for rest of the compounds were interfered by leaching of these compounds from biochar. It was observed that commercially available GAC performed much better than biochar for all the compounds considered. Even at 1% of obtained capacity, biochar amendment to soils where reclaimed water is used for irrigation can reduce the uptake of these compounds by plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presents the current and important results of bioaerosol studies which allow for the comparison of microbial contamination of air in 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which differed in terms of capacity from 350 to 200,000m(3)/day. The abundance of mesophilic bacteria, M+ and M- Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Actinobacteria, coliform and psychrophilic bacteria, and microscopic fungi was determined. Additionally, the air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and direction were also analyzed at each research station. The obtained very numerous results of bioaerosol and climate parameter studies were subjected to statistical analysis. The results regarding the minimum, maximum, and median abundance of the studied bacteria and microscopic fungi at 11 WWTPs and in background studies at control stations were presented in tables. Additionally, basic descriptive statistics for all studied microorganisms at specific seasons were presented. It was established that at the areas of WWTPs, the microscopic fungi were present that the highest concentrations (ranging from 0 to 1,148,530CFUm(-3)), followed by psychrophilic bacteria (ranging from 40 to 225,000CFUm(-3)) and mesophilic bacteria (ranging from 0 to 195,000CFUm(-3)). The novel elaboration of bioaerosol study results based on cluster analysis and determination of a dendrogram allowed to compare the studied WWTPs. The similarity was decided based on the type of studied microorganisms and their dominance and abundance, while no similarities were observed in terms of capacity. In order to investigate the relation between the abundance of bacterial groups as well as microscopic fungi and microclimatic parameters (air temperature and humidity), a calculation of Spearman's range correlation coefficients was conducted.

AB Adsorption on carbon materials (AC-F400, AC-PS, AC-RH, CNF and MWNT) has revealed as an effective treatment for the removal of two representative pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, CBZ, and ciprofloxacin, CPX) in ultrapure water, as isolated compounds and as a mixture of both of them. Accordingly, a real pharmaceutical effluent containing these substances was efficiently treated by adsorption with the tested carbon adsorbents. A relatively high adsorption rate (equilibrium time of 4 h) and large carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin adsorption capacities (q(CBZ) = 242 mg g(-1), q(CPX) = 264 mg g(-1)) were found, using adsorbent doses ranging from 2 to 3 g L-1, natural pH, temperature of 30 degrees C and stirring rate of 250 rpm. Thus, the decreasing in the adsorption removal was observed for both contaminants when the mixture CBZ-CPX was treated, reaching up to 80.5% of decreasing in CBZ adsorption (in presence of CPX) onto F-400 activated carbon. The bi-component adsorption systems were reasonably well-fitted by the extended Freundlich model equation. Meanwhile, the reduction of macroscopic parameters (Total Organic Concentration, TOC, Total Nitrogen, TN, carbonates (CO32-) and aromaticity) in the real hospital wastewater was achieved in high percentages (from 64 to 98.8%). Moreover, the carbon adsorbents were proven as efficient materials in the removal of the pharmaceutical compounds from the hospital effluent matrix; after the treatment, only trace-level concentrations of atenolol and trazodone were detected.

AB Municipalities utilize aquatic environments to assimilate their domestic effluent resulting in eutrophication, anoxia, toxicity and endocrine disruption of aquatic biota. The objective of this study was to assess the potential cumulative impacts of municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) discharges in the Grand River on the health status of a sentinel species and the fish community downstream of 2 MWWE discharges. The fish communities downstream of the MWWE outfalls demonstrated differences in the abundance and diversity, species and family richness, % tolerance and % vulnerability when compared to the fish community upstream or further downstream of these points of effluent discharge. In both years studied, the fish community exposed to MWWE in the riffle-run habitats demonstrated reductions in the proportion of the most prominent fish (Rainbow Darter, Ethoestoma caeruleum) downstream of the outfalls, and a significant increase in the proportion of large mobile, tolerant-omnivorous fish species such as suckers and sunfish. There was less variability in the responses of the fish community to MWWE in the same season between years than between seasons within the same year. An examination of how impaired health of a sentinel species exposed to MWWE discharges parallels changes in the fish community is also conducted. This study successfully demonstrates the cumulative impact of urban development, including multiple outfalls of treated wastewater effluents on fish populations and communities. Municipalities are the major source of nutrients and pharmaceuticals and personal care products to aquatic systems, and they need to consider their impacts carefully with increasing urban population growth and ageing demographics.

AB The sorption kinetics and equilibrium endpoints of two widely prescribed anionic lipid-regulating pharmaceuticals-atorvastatin and simvastatin acid-were evaluated for wastewater-treatment plant primary clarifier biosolids, a peat soil, a sandy soil, and a stream sediment. All equilibrium isotherms were linear over an aqueous concentration range of 0.01 mu g/L to greater than 100 mu g/L. Log K-oc values for statin sorption to biosolids were 2.91 and 2.96 for atorvastatin and simvastatin acids, respectively. Comparative isotherm experiments with the peat soil, sandy soil, and stream sediment found log K-oc values for atorvastatin of 2.96, 2.70, and 3.20, respectively, and values of 2.89, 2.81, and 3.33 for simvastatin acid, respectively. Sorption was noncompetitive between the two statin drugs. Temperature changes did not affect sorption of either statin over the range of 5-32 degrees C, indicating that heats of sorption were near zero. Taken together, these observations suggest that despite its anionic structure, statin sorption occurs via partition (solubilization) of the hydrophobic part of the molecule into the sorbent organic matter. Results from kinetic experiments show that statin sorption to biosolids reaches equilibrium much more rapidly compared to the soils and sediment, as the mass-transfer-rate coefficient, alpha, for the two-site equilibrium/kinetic model is approximately one-order-of magnitude higher for the biosolids. Presentation of these sorption data provides a requisite first step for future studies of statin fate and transport in wastewater-treatment plants and the environment.

AB The ozonation process has recently been proposed as an effective treatment method for removing pharmaceutical compounds from seawater-based wastewater discharged from fish farms or hatcheries. Seawater ozonation can lead to the production of secondary stable oxidants such as bromine (HOBr/OBr-), which can be expressed as a total residual oxidants (TRO) owing to the high reaction rate constant with respect to ozone and bromide ion. TRO formation depends onwater quality, in terms of aspects such as salinity, ammonia, and organic matter content; therefore, it is important to understand the variations in the ozone chemistry of bromide-containing water by considering the factors influencing TRO formation. In addition, the removal of pharmaceutical compounds in bromide-containing water should be evaluated owing to the different oxidation efficiency between TRO and pure aqueous ozone. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the formation of TRO and the removal of pharmaceutical compounds during the ozonation of bromide-containing water. The results show that salinity increased the TRO formation rate by 6%, while ammonia and organic matter decreased the TRO formation rate by 51% and 39%, respectively. The removal efficiency of pharmaceutical compounds by TRO was higher compared with that by only ozone. Ammonia and organic matter inhibited the ozonation of bromide-containing water. These results indicate that TRO can be broadly used in the field of seawater ozonation; however, additional case studies on the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from seawater-based wastewater are needed to elucidate the oxidation mechanisms of various TRO.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater can be characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis. Wastewater from animal farms or pharmaceutical plants usually contains high concentration of antibiotics. In this study, the quenching effect of antibiotics on the typical components of DOM was explored using fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC analysis. Four antibiotics (roxarsone, sulfaquinoxaline sodium, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin) at the concentration of 0.5 similar to 4.0 mg/L and three typical components of DOM (tyrosine, tryptophan, and humic acid) were selected. Fluorescence quenching effects were observed with the addition of antibiotics. Among these four antibiotics, roxarsone (2.9 similar to 20.2 %), sulfaquinoxaline sodium (0 similar to 32.0 %), and oxytetracycline (0 similar to 41.8 %) led to a stronger quenching effect than erythromycin (0 similar to 8.0 %). From the side of DOM, tyrosine and tryptophan (0.5 similar to 41.8 %) exhibited a similar quenching effect, but they were higher than humic acids (0 similar to 20.2 %) at the same concentration of antibiotics. For humic acid, a significant quenching effect was observed only with the addition of roxarsone. This might be the first report about the fluorescence quenching effect caused by antibiotics. The results from this study confirmed the interference of antibiotics on the fluorescence intensity of the main components of DOM and highlighted the importance of correcting fluorescence data in the wastewater containing antibiotics.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in treated wastewater and in surface waters is a growing environmental concern. This paper provides information about general awareness of the issue, disposal practices, willingness to pay for a disposal program, and willingness to participate in a disposal program. The results are based on a telephone survey of 1005 residents in southern California. Less than half of the respondents are aware of the issue. While disposal of unused medications through the trash and toilet/sink is the most common practices, respondents that are aware of the issue are more likely to return pharmaceuticals to a pharmacy or drop them off at a hazardous waste center. The results of a contingent valuation question indicate a substantial willingness to pay a surcharge on prescriptions to support the establishment of a pharmaceutical disposal program. The more conservative estimate of mean willingness to pay is $1.53 per prescription, which translates into an average annual willingness to pay of approximately $14. A benefit-cost comparison suggests ample scope for establishing a pharmaceutical disposal program that would yield positive net social benefits, even if the surcharge was applied to only one prescription per year. We also find that respondents are likely to participate in a disposal program. Assuming that the program is based on drop-off locations at local pharmacies, approximately 70 percent of the respondents would be very likely to return their unwanted or expired medicines.

TI Coupling River Concentration Simulations with a Toxicokinetic Model
   Effectively Predicts the Internal Concentrations of Wastewater-Derived
   Micropollutants in Field Gammarids

AB Although the exposure assessment of wastewater- derived micropollutants via chemical, bioanalytical, and modeling methods in environmental compartments is becoming more frequent, the whole-body burden (i.e., internal concentrations) in nontarget organisms is rarely assessed. An understanding of the internal concentration fluctuation is especially important when exploring the mechanistic linkage between exposure and effects. In this study, we coupled a simple river model with a first-order toxicokinetic (TK) model to predict the concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants in freshwater invertebrates (Gammarus spp.). We applied Monte Carlo simulations and conducted laboratory experiments to account for the uncertain input data and the lack of uptake/depuration rate constants required for the TK model. The internal concentrations in field gammarids were predicted well, and the estimates varied only by a factor of 0.1-1.9. Fast equilibrium may also be assumed such that bioconcentration factors (BCFs) are used together with the daily river dilution patterns to predict internal concentrations. While this assumption is suitable for compounds observed in our experiment to reach the steady state within 48 h in gammarids, the model overpredicted the concentrations of substances that reach this condition after longer periods. Nevertheless, this approach provides conservative estimates and simplifies the coupling of models as BCFs are slightly more accessible than the rate constants. However, if one is interested in a more detailed exposure information (e.g., peak concentration and the whole-body burden recovery after a spill), then the nonsteady-state formulation should be employed.

AB The emergence of resistance to antibacterial drugs and pesticides in water is unprecedented. This may have adverse consequences to human health and ecological systems. This paper first sought the identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in two secondary effluent wastewaters (SEW) of different quality characteristics, followed by their removal by ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI), FeO42-) Screening for 22 pharmaceuticals and 32 pesticides, revealed that 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides in SEW of plant A, and 14 pharmaceuticals and 5 pesticides in SEW of plant B were present at concentrations higher than the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method quantitation limit. The concentrations of pharmaceuticals and pesticides ranged from 0.15 ng/L-413.03 ng/L. Investigation of the removal of these pharmaceuticals and pesticides by Fe(VI) showed that some had recalcitrant activity towards their oxidation. Acid-activated Fe(VI) resulted in enhanced oxidation (12.6%-56.2% degradation efficiency) of 6 and 7 pharmaceuticals in SEW of plant A and plant B, respectively, at a shorter time than Fe(VI) without activation (i.e. 3-5 min versus 15-30 min). The degradation of 1 and 3 pesticides in SEW of plant A and plant B respectively, has also been enhanced by activating Fe(VI) (13.8%-86.2% degradation efficiency). Results on testing of organic matter characterization of treated SEW with and without acid-activated Fe(VI) treatment are also presented. Acid-activated Fe(VI) treatment has potential in enhancing the removal of micropollutants in real wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deriving reliable estimates of chemical emissions to the environment is a key challenge for impact and risk assessment methods and typically the associated uncertainty is not characterised. We have developed an approach to spatially quantify annual chemical emission loads to the aquatic environment together with their associated uncertainty using consumer survey data and publicly accessible and non confidential data sources. The approach is applicable for chemicals widely used across a product sector. Product usage data from consumer survey studies in France, the Netherlands, South Korea and the USA were combined with information on typical product formulations, wastewater removal rates, and the spatial distribution of populations and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP5) in the four countries. Results are presented for three chemicals common to three types of personal care products (shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash) at WWTP and national levels. Uncertainty in WWTP-specific emission estimates was characterised with a 95% confidence interval and ranged up to a factor of 4.8 around the mean, mainly due to uncertainty associated with removal efficiency. Estimates of whole country product usage were comparable to total market estimates derived from sectorial market sales data with differences ranging from a factor 0.8 (for the Netherlands) to 5 (for the USA). The proposed approach is suitable where measured data on chemical emissions is missing and is applicable for use in risk assessments and chemical footprinting methods when applied to specific product categories.

AB The fate of five antiviral drugs (abacavir, emtricitabine, ganciclovir, lamivudine and zidovudine) was investigated in biological wastewater treatment. Investigations of degradation kinetics were accompanied by the elucidation of formed transformation products (TPs) using activated sludge lab experiments and subsequent LC-HRMS analysis. Degradation rate constants ranged between 0.46 L d(-1) g(ss)(-1) (zidovudine) and 55.8 L d(-1) g(ss)(-1) (abacavir). Despite these differences of the degradation kinetics, the same main biotransformation reaction was observed for all five compounds: oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl-moiety to the corresponding carboxylic acid (formation of carboxy-TPs). In addition, the oxidation of thioether moieties to sulfoxides was observed for emtricitabine and lamivudine.
   Antiviral drugs were detected in influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with concentrations up to 980 ng L-1 (emtricitabine), while in WWTP effluents mainly the TPs were found with concentration levels up to 1320 ng L-1 (carboxy-abacavir). Except of zidovudine none of the original antiviral drugs were detected in German rivers and streams, whereas the concentrations of the TPs ranged from 16 ng L-1 for carboxy-lamivudine up to 750 ng L-1 for carboxy-acyclovir. These concentrations indicate an appreciable portion from WWTP effluents present in rivers and streams, as well as the high environmental persistence of the carboxy-TPs. As a result three of the carboxylic TPs were detected in finished drinking water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters are applied widely in personal care products (PCPs), but the distribution and risks of these compounds in the marine environment are not well known. In this study, the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 12 organic UV filters in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) equipped with different treatment levels in Hong Kong, South China, were investigated during one year and a preliminary environmental risk assessment was carried out. Using a newly developed simultaneous multiclass quantification liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM), 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-4 (BP-4) and 2-ethyl-hexyl-4-trimethoxycinnamate (EHMC) were frequently (>= 80%) detected in both influent and effluent with mean concentrations ranging from 23 to 1290 ng/L and 18-1018 ng/L, respectively; less than 2% of samples contained levels greater than 1000 ng/L. Higher concentrations of these frequently detected compounds were found during the wet/summer season, except for BP-4, which was the most abundant compound detected in all samples in terms of total mass. The target compounds behaved differently depending on the treatment level in WWTPs; overall, removal efficiencies were greater after secondary treatment when compared to primary treatment with >55% and <20% of compounds showing high removal (defined as >70% removal), respectively. Reverse osmosis was found to effectively eliminate UV filters from effluent (>99% removal). A preliminary risk assessment indicated that BP-3 and EHMC discharged from WWTPs may pose high risk to fishes in the local environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; VARIABILITY
AB We characterized the transport pathways of pharmaceuticals released from wastewater outfalls in one of Europe's largest estuarine systems (Tagus estuary, Portugal), to identify areas of ecological relevance prone to environmental degradation due to increased exposure to these emerging contaminants. Particle source, Lagrangian trajectories and arrivals over time (1, 6, and 10 days) were used as a proxy to determine the exposure potential and vulnerability of different habitats to an array of pharmaceuticals with different environmental degradation rates and half-lives. Then, exposure potential was combined with information on sensitive habitats to identify vulnerable areas in the estuary. Three different freshwater inflow scenarios were considered simulating Medium flow, No flow and flood conditions (High flow). Model results for areas with higher particle density were concordant with concentration hotspots of pharmaceuticals. Higher potential exposure in a larger area of the estuary was observed for the High freshwater flow; yet reduced particles export to adjacent coastal areas highlights the potential of estuaries and bays as particle sinks. In all modeled scenarios, vulnerable areas were predominantly located in the southern bays up to day 6, and later in eastern areas, which include a nature reserve. These areas are largely composed of intertidal soft substratum and salt marshes habitats, and thus warrant prioritization for monitoring and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals exposure in the Tagus estuary due to the higher risk of exposure of a wealth of vertebrate and invertebrate species that use them. This framework allowed the identification of vulnerable areas to pharmaceutical contamination and can be a valuable instrument to plan the location for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in estuaries and coastal areas.

AB Sources of heavy metals and various micropollutants and their journey into the environment are relatively well studied today. One of the areas where a large proportion of micropollutants end up is wastewater treatment plants (WWTP); therefore, plant operators have become increasingly concerned about how to meet pollution requirements and to reduce pollutant loadings to the environment. This study analyses two possible technological alternatives to remove micropollutants using powdered activated carbon (PAC) by conducting laboratory tests. In the first alternative, a tertiary treatment was conducted with PAC dosed into the treated effluent of the operating WWTP. In the second alternative, PAC was dosed into the bioreactor. The decrease in organic matter and organic micropollutants was measured using the sum parameter total organic carbon (TOC). The tests revealed that for the removal of Cu and TOC the tertiary treatment was more effective, with removal efficiencies of 10.9% and 82.1%, respectively. On the other hand, dosing PAC into the bioreactor had a better removal efficiency for Cr (48.3%), Ni (67.5%), Zn (55.4%), Pb (36.3%), and As (66.7%). As to the removal efficiencies per 1 g of PAC, the highest effect was achieved with the dose of 34 mg/L of PAC dosed into the effluent and 14 mg/L of PAC dosed into the bioreactor. Consequently, the selection of technology requires assessment of the capital costs, operating costs, and sludge treatment technology because dosing PAC into the bioreactor will move all the adsorbed hazardous compounds into the sludge phase, thereby making an immediate use of the sludge complicated.

AB The use of membrane processes for wastewater treatment and reuse is rapidly expanding. organic, inorganic, and biological constituents are effectively removed by reverse osmosis (RO) membrane processes, but concentrate in membrane retentates Disposal of membrane concentrates is a growing concern. Applying advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to RO retentate is logical because extensive treatment and energy inputs were expended to concentrate the organics, and it is cheaper to treat smaller flowstreams. AOPs (e.g., UV irradiation in the presence of titanium dioxide; UV/TiO(2)) can remove a high percentage of organic matter from RO retentates. The combination of AOPs and a simple biological system (e.g., sand filter) can remove higher levels of organic matter at lower UV dosages because AOPs produce biologically degradable material (e.g., organic acids) that have low hydroxyl radical rate constants, meaning that their oxidation, rather than that of the primary organic matter in the RO retentate, dictates the required UV energy inputs. At the highest applied UV dose (10 kWh m(-3)), the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the RO retentate decreased from similar to 40 to 8 mg L(-)1, of which approximately 6 mg L(-)1 were readily biologically degradable. Therefore, after combined UV treatment and biodegradation, the final DOC concentration was 2 mg L(-)1, representing a 91% removal. These results suggest that UV/TiO(2) plus biodegradation of RO retentates is feasible and would significantly reduce the organic pollutant loading into the environment from wastewater reuse facilities.

AB Pharmaceutical products and their byproducts which are present in wastewater and superficial water are becoming an environmental problem. A large effort has been made to introduce new and more efficient treatment processes for removing these emerging pollutants. Among them, activated carbon is currently being studied to be implemented in wastewater treatment plants. In the present study the equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption of carbamazepine (Cbz) and sildenafil citrate (Sil) onto powdered activated carbon are presented. Batch experiments were performed to assess the potential of this kind of activated carbon for removing these recalcitrant pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems. In addition, its adsorption efficiency was compared with the granular activated carbon. The isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson were applied. Pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models, as well as a combined model and an intraparticle diffusion model were assayed on the results obtained.
   Linear and non-linear analyses were carried out to compare the best fitting isotherms and kinetics. The Langmuir isotherm was a good fit for the adsorption of Sil, whereas the Redlich-Peterson isotherm described the adsorption of Cbz. The experimental results for both pharmaceuticals follow a kinetic of pseudo first order. Comparative studies preparing the solutions with distilled water, dechlorinated water and wastewater were performed. No significant differences were observed in these studies.
   When initial concentrations similar to those found in surface waters for both pharmaceuticals were evaluated, removal efficiencies greater than 85% were obtained. Therefore, the use of this kind of activated carbon seems to be an efficient tool for the removal of recalcitrant emerging pollutants, such as Sil and Cbz.

AB The accurate assessment of racemic pharmaceuticals requires enantioselective analytical methods. This study presents the development and validation of an enantioselective liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detection method for the concomitant quantification of the enantiomers of tramadol and their metabolites, N-desmethyltramadol and O-desmethyltramadol, in wastewater samples. Optimized conditions were achieved using a Lux Cellulose-4 column 150 Chi 4.6 mm, 3 mu m isocratic elution, and 0.1% diethylamine in hexane and ethanol (96: 4, v/v) at 0.7 mL min 1. The samples were extracted using 150 mg Oasis (R) mixed-mode cation exchange (MCX) cartridges. The method was validated using a synthetic effluent of a laboratory-scale aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor. The method demonstrated to be selective, accurate, and linear (r(2) > 0.99) over the range of 56 ng L (-1) to 392 ng L (-1). The detection and the quantification limits of each enantiomer were 8 ng L 1 and 28 ng L (-1) for tramadol and N-desmethyltramadol, and 20 ng L (-1) And 56 ng L- 1 for O-desmethyltramadol. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated in a screening study in influent and effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant. The results demonstrated the occurrence of tramadol enantiomers up to 325.1 ng L (-1) and 357.9 ng L (-1), in the effluent and influent samples, respectively. Both metabolites were detected in influents and effluents.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug
   [GRAPHIC]
   which is persistent in wastewater treatment plants and the environment. It has been frequently detected in plant material after irrigation with treated wastewater. To date, little information is, however, available on the transformation of CBZ in plants. In the present study, the uptake, translocation, and transformation of CBZ was studied in hydroponically grown tomato plants. After 35 days of exposure >80% of the total spiked amount of CBZ was taken by the tomato plants and mainly stored in the leaves. A total of 11 transformation products (TP) (mainly phase-I) were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and their total amount corresponded to 33% of the CBZ taken up. The ratio of CBZ metabolites to CBZ was highest in fruits (up to 2.5) and leaves (0.5), suggesting an intensive transformation of CBZ in these compartments. Further 10 TPs (phase-I and II) were identified by LC-high resolution mass spectrometry screening, likely comprising another 12% of CBZ. On the basis of these experiments and on an experiment with CBZ-10, 11-epoxide a transfounation pathway of CBZ in intact tomato plants is proposed that involves epoxidation, hydrolysis, hydroxylation, ring contraction, or loss of the carbamoyl group, followed by conjugation to glucose or cysteine, but also reduction of CBZ. This transformation pathway and analytical data of CBZ transformation products allow for their determination also in field grown vegetable and for the generation of more accurate exposure data of consumers of vegetable irrigated with treated municipal wastewater.

AB Recent droughts in the southwestern United States have heightened the interest in using more reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation. Treated wastewater effluent is a source of irrigation water and contains many pharmaceutical microcontaminants. Currently, there is little knowledge on if these microconstituents will enter food crops and if so where they will be found within the plant. For this experiment, the uptake of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine HCl (Prozac (R)), and ibuprofen within different sections of a celery stalk over a 24-h time period was examined. Results found that all of these pharmaceuticals were taken up into the celery stalks within 24 h. Ibuprofen was found to have reached concentrations of 1 mu g/g within the leaves in just 1 h. Metabolites of the ibuprofen were also detected at all locations within the stalk for all time periods. The concentration of EE2 in the submerged section of the stalk was found to increase from 0.031 to 0.911 mu g/g of celery in just 23 h. The EE2 began to rise higher within the stalk to reach a concentration of 8.94 ng/g about 6 in above the base after 24 h. Fluoxetine HCl concentrations rose to 0.832 mu g/g of celery within the submerged section of the stalk during the 24 h. After 12 h, fluoxetine HCl was detected within the bottom 4 in of the stalk. EE2, fluoxetine HCl, and ibuprofen all exhibit potential for uptake within food crops. Further studies on additional food crops and pharmaceuticals would be required to assess the full risk posed to human eating food crops irrigated with treated wastewater effluent.

AB The occurrence and fate of six phthalates: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) were investigated as phthalates passed through three full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment processes, and ultimately into the recipient Songhua River water in Harbin (China). The six phthalates were detected in the majority of aqueous and solid samples, with DEHP being the most abundant compound. The overall removal efficiency of Sigma PAEs in the Cyclic Activated Sludge Technology (CAST) process was over 72%, while both the A/O and A/A/O processes achieved approximately 30% removal. The better performance of the CAST process relative to the Anoxic/Oxic (A/O) and Anaerobic/Anoxic/Oxic (A/A/O) processes was attributed to the indoor-conditions of the CAST plants, which effectively maintained the temperature of the treatment system. The fate of PAEs within two different types of WWTPs (CAST and A/A/O) were assessed qualitatively using mass balances. The results suggested that PAEs removal resulted from both biotransformation and adsorption, of which the former was particularly significant in the CAST process, while the latter was more significant in the A/A/O process. Substantial levels of several PAEs were detected in the Songhua River, especially downstream of the WWTPs, which means that the discharge from WWTPs has a strong impact on the water quality of the Songhua River during cold winter conditions.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the ability and efficiency of biological treatment to decontaminate pharmaceutical wastewater using indigenous and/or exogenous bacteria. One indigenous bacterium isolated from final effluent of the pharmaceuticals processing wastewater and five exogenous bacteria were molecularly identified and used as individual or mixed free-living cultures in a batch mode remediation process. Raw pharmaceutical effluents had high levels of all the tested parameters makes it one of the strongest industrial effluents. Treatment of pharmaceutical effluent for 6 d was time and bacterial species-dependent. Pseudomonas fluorescens (PF) was the most efficient in removing all the tested parameters except NO3 which increased due to oxidation of NH3 while Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (S1) and Bacillus cereus (L1) characterized by the lowest efficiency for contaminants removal. There was a general trend of increasing the removal efficiency (RE) of all parameters by all the tested bacteria with increasing the exposure time. However, bulk changes in all parameters were achieved within the first 24 h. The highest removals recorded were 94.63%, 79.44%, 75.07%, 81.03%, 90%, 93.75%, 55.2%, 94.29%, and 15.6% for total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, fat, oil and grease (FOG), nitrate (NO3), ammonia (NH3), phenol, and total viable count of bacteria (TVC), respectively. Despite the highly efficient removals achieved for the tested parameters, their residual levels of all the parameters still above the maximum permissible limits for the safe discharge except FOG. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use the most promising bacteria in a fixed form to bring the effluent to the safe limits for the environment.

AB Simple semi-theoretical models were developed to estimate the performance of three different kinds of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in the degradation of pharmaceuticals. The AOPs included the photo-Fenton process as an example of a liquid-liquid reaction, the TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation process as a solid-liquid reaction, and the combined ozone and hydrogen peroxide oxidation process as a gas liquid reaction; the effects of the aqueous matrices (CESs: co-existing substances) of actual wastewater on the removal of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and diclofenac) was taken into account By comparing the characteristic parameters of the models, obtained from the experiments using pure water and actual wastewater, the effects of CESs on the respective removal mechanisms could be separately and quantitatively evaluated. As a general tendency, the AOPs proceeded less effectively (were inhibited) in the matrices containing CESs, as observed with the use of a lower initial concentration of pharmaceuticals. The inhibition mechanisms differed for the three types of AOPs. In the photo-Fenton process, the Fenton reaction was improved by the incorporation of CESs, while the photo-reduction reaction was significantly inhibited. In the TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation process, competition between the pharmaceuticals and CESs for adsorption on the catalyst surface was a less significant inhibitory factor than the scavenger effects of the CESs. The combined ozone and hydrogen peroxide oxidation process was most strongly inhibited by CESs among the AOPs investigated in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feast-famine moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) have shown high potential for removing organic micropollutants from wastewater. However, the relationship between biofilm community during feast-famine adaptation and micropollutant removal is yet unclear. In this study, we determined the biotransformation kinetics of 36 micropollutants and characterized the microbial communities in an MBBR during a 71-day adaptation period of feast-famine regime (raw/effluent wastewater). The feast-famine regime significantly changed the biodegradation rate constants (k) of 24 micropollutants in different ways: 66 times enhanced degradation for propranolol, while more than 10 times for atenolol, metoprolol, tramadol and venlafaxine, less than 2.8 times for losartan, iomeprol and iohexol were detected. 25?60 days of adaptation time was needed to reach the maximum k. Biofilm accumulated during the adaptation, but the kDNA (k relative to the biofilm with DNA concentration as a proxy for kbiomass) of most micropollutants (except propranolol, metoprolol and venlafaxine) declined. This might indicate that the proliferation of potential degraders for micropollutants was slower than other microorganisms under the feast-famine regime. The microbial community changed significantly during the first 8 days of operation, followed by a relatively steady evolution towards the enrichment of nitrifiers until day 71. A multivariate statistical correlation analysis revealed that the development of occurrence of 88 individual taxonomic groups were found to exhibit a significant positive correlation to the kDNA of micropollutants (p 0.05, r 0.5), which represent potential biomarkers linking to biotransformation of micropollutants. These results fill the knowledge gaps between dynamics of biofilm communities and micropollutant removal in the feast-famine regime, which is essential for designing highly efficient MBBR.

AB The prevalent presence of antibiotic compounds (e.g., chloramphenicol [CAP]) in wastewater and effluents without pretreatment can bring adverse impacts on human and animals; therefore, the remediation of these substrates is emergently essential. To synthesize the novel mesoporous carbon for chloramphenicol remediation, we pyrolyzed a species of copper-based metal-organic framework, namely Cu-3(BTC)(2) (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid), at 700 degrees C, characterized by several physical analytical techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement. The procedure to optimize the optimum conditions for the removal of CAP was conducted based on investigating three factors including concentration (1.6 -18.4 mg/L), adsorbent dosage (0.08-0.92 g/L), and pH (2.6-9.4). As a consequence, up to 87.6% of chloramphenicol could be removed from water under these conditions. Moreover, the effects of contact time (0-120 min) and concentration (10-40 mg/L), as well as other adsorption kinetic and isotherm models, were vigorously studied. With a relatively high surface area (78.8 m(2)/g), many functional groups on the surface (2.44 mmoL/g for acidic and base groups), and high maximum adsorption capacity (37.2 mg/g), the mesoporous carbon from Cu-3(BTC)(2) can be used as an efficient adsorbent for CAP removal from wastewater.

AB In this work, the use of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) against the degradation of an emerging contaminant has been subjected under systematic investigation. The optimization of treatment of the antidepressant drug Venlafaxine (VFA) was performed, using UV light, the combined UV/H2O2 process, solar light, Fenton and finally the solar photo-Fenton process in laboratory scale. The degradation kinetics, the time necessary to remove 90% of the contaminant and the optimal reactants concentration were proposed. The treatment in pure water, (synthetic) wastewater and urine was assessed, in an effort to identify the opportunities and pitfalls the application of process would encounter in a field application. Treatment by the UV-based methods was found sufficiently efficient and the application of the solar photo-Fenton process showed feasibility in a potential field application with appropriate context. Real urban wastewater effluents after biological and physicochemical treatment were tested, as well as human urine, as a proposal for on-site collection and treatment was also treated. Biological treatment before applying the tested AOPs improved their efficiency, and the strategy of diluting urine prior to treatment greatly enhanced the efficacy of the process. Finally, the identification of the degradation pathway and the biodegradability tests of AOPs treated VFA solutions exhibit promising results concerning the strategy of treatment for similar pollutants of emerging concern.

AB One of the two main objectives of this work is to oxidize MBR effluents with ozone/peroxide in high pH conditions in order to improve oxidation of pharmaceuticals, which could efficiently be rejected by the nanofiltration (NF) stage. The other main objective is to effectively oxidize of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in MBR effluents in order to decrease fouling in the filtration stage. In this work, ozone/peroxide oxidation was applied to the MBR effluents in high pH conditions in order to improve the formation of OH radicals, and oxidized effluents were filtered by the NF membrane (NE90) in order to investigate fouling potentials and the removal of pharmaceuticals. Natural and synthetic wastewater samples were used as feed solutions for the MBR system, which was equipped with a U-shaped hollow fiber membrane module. The flux decline was decreased from 29% to 15% when 9 mg/L of ozone was used, the same decline was also observed when 6 mg/L ozone and hydrogen peroxide (1/1 ozone/peroxide mol ratio) were used. A further decrease in flux decline was observed when pH was adjusted to 9.00 (29% to 9%) prior to the ozone/peroxide oxidation. In most cases, the increase in the ozone dose, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and the adjustment of the pH level led to an increase in the removal of pharmaceuticals. Iopromide, TCEP and Naproxen were found to be more resistant to the oxidation when pH was increased.

AB The present study investigated the biological quantification of estrogenic activity in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in the recipient river in north-western Italy. Samples of the WWTP effluent and those of river water upstream and downstream the WWTP were taken from September 2006 to May 2007. The effluent was evaluated in the presence and absence of chlorination. The E-screen assay, with human estrogens receptor-positive MCF-7 BUS breast cancer cells, was performed on samples after solid-phase extraction to determine the total estrogenic activity by measuring the 17 beta-estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ). In order to study the correlation between estrogenicity and toxicity, untreated samples were also assayed with the acute toxicity test Microtox (TM). Furthermore, to determine the efficiency of the chlorination process, all the samples were analysed for disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes) and Escherichia coli.
   The mean EEQs were 5.0 ng/L (+/- 6.1 ng/L) upstream of the plant, 6.7 ng/L (+/- 7.4 ng/L) downstream from the plant and 23.3 ng/L (+/- 20.4 ng/L) in the WWTP effluent. The difference between upstream and downstream of the treatment plant was not significant. Chlorinated water samples had lower estrogenic activity and E coli concentrations, but had greater toxicity and higher trihalomethane concentrations. Estrogenic activity was not correlated with toxicity. These results suggest that the WWTP effluent had little impact on the estrogenic activity of the recipient river. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the behaviour and characteristics of soluble microbial products (SMP) in two anoxic-aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs): MB-k-ontrol and MBRpharma, for treating municipal wastewater. Both protein and polysaccharides measured exhibited higher concentrations in the MBRpharma than the MBRcontrol. Molecular weight (MW) distribution analysis revealed that the presence of pharmaceuticals enhanced the accumulation of SMPs with macro- (13,091 kDa and 1587 kDa) and intermediate-MW (189 kDa) compounds in the anoxic MBRpharma, while a substantial decrease was observed in both MBR effluents. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence contours indicated that the exposure to pharmaceuticals seemed to stimulate the production of aromatic proteins containing tyrosine (10.1-32.6%) and tryptophan (14.7-43.1%), compared to MBRcontrol (9.9-29.1% for tyrosine; 11.8 42.5% for tryptophan). Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed aromatics, long-chain alkanes and esters were the predominant SMPs in the MBRs. More peaks were present in the aerobic MBRpharma (196) than anoxic MBRpharma (133). The SMPs identified exhibited both biodegradability and recalcitrance in the MBR treatment processes. Only 8 compounds in the MBRpharma were the same as in the MBRcontrol Alkanes were the most dominant SMPs (51%) in the MBRcontrol, while aromatics were dominant (40%) in the MBRpharma" A significant decrease in aromatics (from 16 to 7) in the MBRpharma permeate was observed, compared to the aerobic MBRpharma. Approximately 21% of compounds in the aerobic MBRcontrol were rejected by membrane filtration, while this increased to 28% in the MBRpharma (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are biologically active compounds that are routinely detected in the environment and usually associated with treated wastewater discharge. Due to their high biological activity, antibiotics may have more environmental impacts than other pharmaceuticals. Wetlands are often used to treat or polish wastewater, with the goals of reducing nutrient and carbon loading into the environment. Nitrogen and carbon processing in wetlands is largely associated with microbial activity, however impacts to microbial activity due to antibiotic loading into treatment wetlands is relatively unknown. Two wetland soils (mineral and peat) were individually spiked with ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline ranging from 1-1000 ppb to examine effects on microbial mediated evolution of CH4, CO2 and N-2. The antibiotics both positively and negatively affected microbial respiration (a proxy for microbial activity) rates in the two wetland soils depending on soil properties and concentration. Sulfamethoxazole reduced CO2 and N2O respiration rates at higher concentrations (500, 1000 ppb) in the mineral soil. However, the CO2 rates recovered within 48 hours, while N2O suppression continued through the end of the incubation. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole also demonstrated the ability to suppress respiration at low spiking concentrations (1, 50 ppb) for several treatments. The results demonstrate the ability of antibiotics to impact soil respiration at environmentally relevant concentrations. Parameters that appear to affect the impacts of antibiotics were sorption, length of exposure and soil carbon content. Future studies are needed to provide further insight into antibiotic effects to microbial community structure.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds can reach detectable concentrations in rivers and lakes if production and use are sufficiently large and the compounds show some mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment. In this study, we report on the occurrence and on the enantiomer composition of the chiral pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen (IB) in surface waters and in samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Enantioselective gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry was used for analysis. IB was present in influents of WWTPs at concentrations of up to 3 mu g/L with a high enantiomeric excess of the pharmacologically active S enantiomer (S much greater than R), as from human urinary excretion. The principal human urinary metabolites of IB, hydroxy-IB and carhoxy-IB, were observed in WWTP influents at even higher concentrations. In contrast to other pharmaceutical compounds such as clofibric acid and diclofenac, IB and its meta bolites a re then efficiently degraded (>95%) during treatment in WWTPs. Laboratory incubation experiments confirmed this rapid degradation. In rivers and lakes, IB was detected at concentrations of up to 8 ng/L, generally with some excess of the S enantiomer; the IB metabolites were not detected (<1 ng/L). Incubation of lake water fortified with (rac)-IB indicated a faster dissipation of the S enantiomer, thus resulting eventually in residues with a reversed (R > S) enantiomer composition as compared to that from human metabolism. Inefficient WWTPs and direct discharges of untreated wastewater from storm events, however, can still he a source for increased levels of IB in surface Water.

AB The study of the presence in the aquatic environment of certain substances considered as contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) is a preliminary step to the analysis of the possible harmful effects on aquatic ecosystems and the establishment of the corresponding environmental quality standards. In order to monitor the occurrence of CECs in the aquatic environment, the European Commission established in 2015 and 2018 two watch-list of substances for Union-wide monitoring in the field of water policy (Decision (EU) 2015/495 and Decision (EU) 2018/ 840). In the coast of the Basque Country, southeast of the Bay of Biscay, 19 of these watch list substances were monitored quarterly from May 2017 to March 2019. Water samples were collected at the effluent of three wastewater treatment plants and five control points associated with receiving waters (transitional and coastal water bodies). The most frequently quantified substances were azithromycin (91%), imidacloprid (82%), clarithromycin (80%), diclofenac (78%) and erythromycin (73%), with frequencies of quantification higher in wastewaters (83-100%) than in receiving waters (70-85%). In general, concentrations in wastewater were also higher than in receiving waters, indicating a dilution effect in the environment. In receiving waters, six out of the nineteen substances monitored exceeded their respective Predicted No-Effect Concentrations: azithromycin (34%), imidacloprid (9%), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) (9%), clarithromycin (7%), ciprofloxacin (7%), and diclofenac (5%); and therefore, their levels could pose an environmental risk.

AB The oil industry faces economic and environmental challenges due to its energyand water-intensive processes. Surplus residual feedstocks and the water produced via heavy oil upgrading and processing are among the most challenging problems in the oil industry. Utilization these waste materials and a lack of efficient technologies to treat them are the main challenges causing the industry to consider them as waste materials. Existing technologies only add a small value, require high capital investment, and generate high greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, in this study, we review and highlight the major findings regarding the oxy-cracking process, which is introduced as an alternative beyond combustion, as an environmentally friendly technique for converting these feedstocks into value-added products and also enhances the recyclability of wastewater. Through these residual feedstocks are partially oxidized in basic aqueous media at mild operational temperatures (150-230 degrees C) and pressures (3.4-5.2 MPa). Several operating conditions have been reported to optimize the conversion and selectivity of the products, and the results showed that the temperature and residence time have significant impacts on the yield and environmental impact. The experimental findings were validated with theoretical calculations, which provided insights on understanding the kinetic behavior based on the radical mechanism. The characterization findings revealed that the oxy-cracking could be a platform for a wide range of products such as humic acids, clean fuel, and carbon nanomaterials, and to recover valuable metals. Moreover, this process could be implemented for treatment of oil sand processes affected water and for decomposing emerging pharmaceuticals.

AB Acesulfame potassium (ACE) is a widely used artificial sweetener that has consistently been detected in wastewater and surface waters. The high-valent iron-based green oxidant known as ferrate(VI) (potassium ferrate(VI); Fe(VI)) had low reactivity with ACE (i.e. 4 h (or 240 min) contact time removed only similar to 67% ACE) at a molar ratio of 6.0 ([Fe(VI)]:[ACE]). Comparatively, it took 60 s (or 1 min) to remove similar to 94% ACE when HCI (786 mu M) was added to a mixture of Fe(VI)-ACE at the same molar ratio of 6.0 (or acid-activated Fe(VI)). Significantly, the final pH (i.e. 7.6-8.1) was similar for Fe(VI) and acid-activated Fe(VI). An empirical model using response surface methodology was developed that could describe reasonably well the removal efficiency of ACE. Inorganic constituents of wastewater (Cl-, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) had no significant effect on the oxidation of ACE by acid-activated Fe(VI). The degradation efficiency of ACE decreased in the presence of 10 mg/L of natural organic matter (NOM) but remained unchanged at 5 mg NOM/L. Sulfamic acid as the oxidized product of ACE was identified by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method. Reaction pathways include ring opening of ACE through hydrolytic transformation. Acid-activated Fe(VI) has advantage of rapid removal of ACE under mild alkaline conditions of wastewater treatment plants compared to other oxidation processes such as chlorination, ozonation, and light-based processes.

AB The removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential through a membrane bioreactor (MBR) coupled to a nanofiltration (NF) pilot plant that treats urban wastewater is investigated. The results are compared to the fate of the individual NDMA precursors detected: azithromycin, citalopram, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ranitidine, venlafaxine and its metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine. Specifically, the effect of dissolved oxygen in the aerobic chamber of the MBR pilot plant on the removal of NDMA formation potential (FP) and individual precursors is studied.
   During normal aerobic operation, implying a fully nitrifying system, the MBR was able to reduce NDMA precursors above 94%, however this removal percentage was reduced to values as low as 72% when changing the conditions to minimize nitrification. Removal decreased also for azithromycin (68 -59%), citalopram (31-17%), venlafaxine (35-15%) and erythromycin (61-16%) on average during nitrifying versus non-nitrifying conditions. The removal of clarithromycin, o-desmethylvenlafaxine and ranitidine could not be correlated with the nitrification inhibition, as it varied greatly during the experiment time. The MBR pilot plant is coupled to a nanofiltration (NF) system and the results on the rejection of both, NDMA FP and individual precursors, through this system was above 90%.
   Finally, results obtained for the MBR pilot plant are compared to the percentage of removal by a conventional full scale biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) fed with the same influent. During aerobic operation, the removal of NDMA FP by the MBR pilot plant was similar to the full scale WWTP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iodinated contrast media (ICM), which are used for radiological visualization of human tissue and cardiovascular system, are poorly biodegradable; hence, new methods of their removal are sought. In this study, the effectiveness of selected X-ray ICM removal by means of UVand UV/TiO2 pretreatment processes from synthetic hospital wastewater was demonstrated. The following compounds were investigated: iodipamide, iohexol, and diatrizoate. The experiments were as follows: (i) estimated susceptibility of the ICMto decay by UV radiation in different aquatic matrices, (ii) determined an optimal retention time of hospital wastewater in the UV reactor, (iii) determined optimum TiO2 concentration to improve the effectiveness of the UV pretreatment, and (iv) investigated removal of ICM by combination of the photochemical and biological treatment methods. The quantum yields of selected ICM decay in deionized water (pH=7.0) were established as 0.006, 0.004, and 0.029 for iohexol, diatrizoate, and iodipamide, respectively. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that diatrizoate and iohexol removal in the UV/TiO2 process is more efficient than in UV process alone. For diatrizoate, the removal efficiency equaled to 40 and 30 %, respectively, and for iohexol, the efficiency was 38 and 27 %, respectively. No significant increase in iodipamide removal in UVand UV/TiO2 processes was observed (29 and 28 %, respectively). However, highest removal efficiency was demonstrated in synthetic hospital wastewater with the combined photochemical and biological treatment method. The removal of diatrizoate and iohexol increased to at least 90 %, and for iodipamide, to at least 50 %.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) are widely used anticonvulsants that are extensively metabolized in the human body. The pharmaceuticals and their human metabolites are present in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in rivers and streams, and in drinking water. In this study, the biodegradation of OXC and its main human metabolite, 10-hydroxy-CBZ (10OHCBZ), and the main human metabolite of CBZ, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (DiOHCBZ), was investigated in contact with activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sand filter material from a waterworks. The transformation of DiOHCBZ, 10OHCBZ, and OXC led to the formation of the following main TPs: 1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BaQD), 1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BaQM), 9-aldehyde-acridine, 9-carboxylic acid-acridine (9-CA-ADIN), hydroxyl 9-CA-ADIN, acridone (ADON), 11-keto-OXC, and 2,2'-(carbamoylazanediyl)dibenzoic acid. TP formation could be explained by three proposed transformation pathways, including reactions such as oxidation, alpha-ketol rearrangement, or benzylic acid rearrangement. The results highlight the fact that the TP abundances strongly depend on the concentrations spiked in the lab-scale experiments. BaQD, 9-CA-ADIN, and ADON were detected in WWTP effluents, rivers, and streams. 9-CA-ADIN was found at maximum concentrations in WWTP effluent and rivers up to 920 +/- 50 ng L-1 and 304 +/- 26 ng L-1, respectively. Even in drinking water, BaQD and 9-CA-ADIN were present at concentrations of 26 +/- 2 ng L-1 and 189 +/- 3 ng L-1, respectively.

AB The presence of 170 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, priority substances according to the 2008/105EU Directive and four metals (Cd, Ni, Hg, Pb) have been investigated at the Llobregat delta, south of Barcelona (Spain). In the area, reclaimed water is destined to satisfy environmental uses, irrigation and the construction of a hydraulic barrier against seawater intrusion in the deep aquifer of the delta. A monitoring survey was undertaken of water samples from a tertiary wastewater treatment plant (Depurbaix), treated waste water with an additional treatment of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection (WWATP, for the hydraulic barrier injection). Groundwater samples from the aquifer receiving recharge were also investigated. The pharmaceutical group of substances was detected in sampled waters at concentrations rarely exceeding a few mu g/L, among the compounds Caffeine. Nicotine and Galaxolide (musk fragrance) were found to be present in more than 60% of the samples. Diuron was the only priority substance detected. The four metals were always present in a variable concentration. After the WWATP treatment the majority of analytes are removed from tertiary treated wastewater or their concentration is reduced below 0.1 mu g/L Monitoring revealed a widespread occurrence of analysed compounds in groundwater. Among them Codeine (analgesic), Ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory), lopamidol, lopromide (contrast agent) and Paraxanthine (metabolite of caffeine) have only been detected in groundwater, and are not present in water currently being injected in the deep aquifer.

AB Organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) have recently been documented in several aquatic ecosystems. We examined the effects of three OWCs (caffeine, acetaminophen, and triclosan) on the activity level, startle response, survivorship, and growth of northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) tadpoles. We conducted two experiments: one on the effects of acetaminophen and triclosan alone and in combination, and the other on the effects of caffeine and acetaminophen alone and in combination. In both experiments acetaminophen had no effect on activity, startle response, survivorship, or final mass. In experiment 1, tadpoles exposed to triclosan were less active than controls. Tadpoles exposed to the highest triclosan concentration had lower startle response and survivorship than in the other concentrations and in the control. Tadpoles exposed to the intermediate triclosan concentrations were heavier than in other treatments, but not in the control. In experiment 2, tadpoles exposed to the highest caffeine concentration were the most active. Acetaminophen increased the effect of caffeine on activity. More tadpoles exposed to caffeine exhibited a startle response than did control tadpoles. Survivorship was 100% for all caffeine treatments. There was a tendency (P = 0.06) for tadpoles exposed to higher concentrations of caffeine to be smaller. In general, the interactive effects were not important. Our results show that ecologically relevant levels of some OWCs can have both behavioral and physiological effects on R. pipiens tadpoles. Thus, amphibians may be affected by exposure to levels of OWCs that appear to be widespread in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We investigated the mobility and distribution of cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) in four contaminated soil profiles from Bangladesh. The sources of contamination of these profiles were tannery wastes, city sewage and the wastes of pharmaceutical and paper mill factories at different locations in Bangladesh. The samples were collected from the A-, B- and C-horizons of each profile: two sub-samples from the A-horizon at depths of 0-5 cm (A1) and > 5 cm (A2), and one sample each from the B- and C-horizons. Soil samples were analysed for total metal content by dissolution in aqua regia followed by sequential extraction of the fractions based on their varying solubility. There were six operationally defined groups of extraction sequences: water soluble (F1), exchangeable (F2), carbonate (F3), oxide (F4), organic (F5) and residual (F6). The total concentration of Cd, Ni and Zn in the A-horizon (0-5 cm) ranged from 0.10 to 0.62, from 31 to 54 and from 85 to 838 mg kg(-1), respectively. In the B- and C-horizons, the concentrations of these metals decreased many fold, particularly in the city sewage profile where the decrease for Cd and Zn was approximately fourfold. The distribution of metals among the chemical fractions depended on their total concentrations. In the A1-horizon, Cd had the highest mobility factor [MF = (F1+F2+F3)/(F1+F2+F3+F4+F5+F6) x 100] at 41-43% and Ni had the lowest at 3-13%, while Zn, showed intermediate values at 8-25%. The MF decreased with depth in all soil profiles. Among the fractions, the residual fraction contained the lowest levels of Cd but the highest levels of Ni and Zn. This state affected their relative mobility and distribution in soil profiles. Of the soil profiles, the mobility of all metals was higher in the city sewage soil than in any of the other three soils investigated, suggesting that the former may create a health risk by contaminating agricultural products and ground water as it also contained higher amounts of Cd and Zn.

AB Micropollutants (MPs) are organic chemicals that are present in the environment at low concentrations (ng/L-mu g/L), for example pharmaceuticals. A constructed wetland (CW) is a promising post-treatment technique to remove MPs from wastewater effluent. Selecting a suitable material for support matrix is important when designing such a CW. Nine materials were studied as potential support matrices: Light Expanded Clay Aggregates (LECA), compost, bark, granulated activated carbon (GAC), biochar, granulated cork, lava rock, sand and gravel. Batch experiments were conducted to study MP removal by nine materials in phosphate buffer with 5 or 50 mu g/L MPs, or wastewater effluent with 50 mg/L of MPs. GAC and biochar removed almost all MPs in both phosphate buffer and wastewater effluent, followed by bark, compost, granulated cork. Sand, gravel, LECA and lava rock removed less than 30% of most MPs in both matrixes. Based on set criteria (e.g. removal efficiency), biochar, bark, compost, LECA and sand were selected, and used in combinations in column studies to test their overall performance. A combination of bark and biochar performed the best on MP removal, as 4 MPs were highly (70%-100%) removed, 4 MPs were moderately (30%-70%) removed while only 3 MPs were hardly removed. The main flow regime of this combination was both plug flow and dispersive flow. Moreover, we hypothesized to apply bark and biochar in a CW. Based on the assumptions and calculations, some benefits are expected, such as increasing MP removal and extending operation time. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Agriculture is considered as the main source of water contamination by pesticides. However, food packaging or processing industries are also recognised as relevant point sources of contamination by these compounds, not yet investigated in depth. The objective of this work has been to improve current knowledge about the presence and concentration of pesticides in the effluent of a food processing industry, as well as to investigate their main transformation products (TPs). An analytical strategy combining target and suspect analysis has been applied to provide an evaluation of the effluents. The methodology involves solid-phase extraction (SPE) of wastewater samples followed by (i) liquid chromatography quadrupole-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS/MS) for quantitative target analysis and (ii) liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-HRMS) to identify non-target pesticides and possible TPs. The results revealed the presence of 17 of the target pesticides analysed and 3 additional ones as a result of the suspect screening performed by HRMS. The TPs were investigated for the pesticides found at the highest concentrations: imazalil (7038-19802 ng/L), pyrimethanil (744-9591 ng/L) and thiabendazole (341-926 ng/L). Up to 14 TPs could be tentatively identified, demonstrating the relevance of this type of studies. These data provide a better understanding of the occurrence of pesticides and their TPs in agro-food industrial effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The temporal dynamics of the wastewater influent loads of 25 drug target residues (DTR, both pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs) was assessed during 84 consecutive days. This monitoring scale enables longer temporal patterns than weekday/weekend patterns to be explored. In this study, we focus on day to day variations and the potential statistical correlation of each DTR analyzed in order to better understand the potential forcings that lead to the load variation of DTRs (alone or in clusters). The weekly patterns based on the weekly loads of DTRs were also analyzed and the impact of social and meteorological events on their variations was investigated.
   Two cold events occurred during the monitoring period and were associated with the highest loads of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as the lowest loads of stimulants. During the Easter holidays, a significant decrease in some year-long medication as well as analgesics was found, consistent with the demographic decrease within the catchment during this period. Lastly, a good correlation between the academic calendar and the loads of stimulants was found, emphasizing the over-representation of students in the consumption of recreational drugs.
   This study furnishes new insights in order to better understand the variations in DTR loads in wastewater influents, beyond the weekday/weekend pattern and the seasonal effect. Further investigations remain necessary, especially a real-time monitoring of the population figures within the catchment in order to improve our understanding of these results.

AB The occurrences of pharmaceuticals and personal care products as emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) have been reported in several countries of the world except from African countries. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the occurrence of nine antibiotics, five antipyretics, atenolol, bezafibrate, and caffeine in wastewater and surface water samples from the Umgeni River. The water samples were extracted with solid-phase extraction using hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and C-18 cartridges for the acidic and neutral drugs, respectively. The quantification was carried out with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) using the standard addition method. The method limits of detections were in the range of 0.14-0.97 mu g/L while the recoveries were between 53.8 and 108.1 %. The wastewater had 100 % occurrence of the analytes studied, with caffeine having the highest concentration at 61 +/- 5 mu g/L and nalidixic acid being the most observed antibiotic at 31 +/- 3 mu g/L. The waste treatment process reduced the influent concentrations by 43.0-94.2 % before discharge except for atenolol removal that is lower. The concentrations of the analytes were lower in the surface water with most compounds having concentrations below 10 mu g/L except acetaminophen and atenolol. The estuary mouth and Blue Lagoon had the highest concentrations of some of the compounds in surface water which depict downstream load. The factors governing the fate and mobility of these compounds in this environment are not fully understood yet and will require further studies.

AB Factors controlling photolysis and UV/H2O2 photooxidation rates of the biochemically active compounds (BACs) sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, bisphenol A, and diclofenac were determined. Experiments were conducted with a quasi-collimated beam apparatus equipped with low-pressure UV lamps. The effects of pH, H2O2 concentration, and background water matrix (ultrapure water, lake water, wastewater treatment plant effluent) on BAC transformation rates were evaluated. For the sulfa drugs, solution pH affected direct photolysis rates but had little effect on the hydroxyl radical oxidation rate. For sulfamethoxazole, the neutral form photolyzed more easily than the anionic form while the reverse was the case for sulfamethazine and sulfadiazine. For trimethoprim, the hydroxyl radical oxidation rate was higher for the cationic form (pH 3.6) than for the neutral form (pH 7.85). Quantum yields and second order rate constants describing the reaction between the hydroxyl radical and BACs were determined and used together with background water quality data to predict fluence-based BAC transformation rate constants (k'). For both the lake water and wastewater treatment plant effluent matrices, predicted k' values were generally in good agreement with experimentally determined k' values. At typical UV/H2O2 treatment conditions (fluence = 540 mJ cm(-2), H2O2 dose = 6 mg L-1), BAC transformation percentages in North Carolina lake water ranged from 43% for trimethoprim to 98% for diclofenac. In wastewater treatment plant effluent, BAC transformation percentages were lower (31-97%) at the same treatment conditions because the hydroxyl radical scavenging rate was higher.

TI Study of effects of pharmaceuticals on the activated sludge process
   combining advanced oxidation using ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide to
   increase their removal and mineralization of wastewater

DE Activated sludge; Acclimatization; Advanced oxidation processes;
   Mineralization; Pharmaceuticals; Wastewater treatment
AB Carbamazepine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and 17-alpha ethinylestradiol have been identified as pharmaceuticals of high ecotoxic risk and widespread presence in wastewaters. Recent studies suggest some pharmaceuticals can affect activated sludge (AS) biomass in terms of microbial community profile, however without focusing on the macroscopic aspects of the process. So this work evaluates the effect of introducing these five pharmaceuticals at mu g.L-1 concentration in synthetic municipal wastewater, measuring response both in macroscopic (quality parameters of biologically treated effluent and biomass' oxygen uptake rate) and microscopic (genera and phyla) aspects. As these pharmaceuticals are not completely removed by AS, a subsequent increase in their removal and mineralization of recalcitrant organics was sought by applying an oxidation process with UV/H2O2. There was an increase of 3.4 times in true color, 7.7 times in turbidity, 2.2 times in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and a decrease of 48 % in oxygen uptake rate (OUR) immediately after the insertion of the pharmaceuticals, but all parameters returned to original values after 22 days of acclimatization, indicating that biomass microbial community modified to adapt to the introduction of the pharmaceuticals. Identification of microbial species showed changes in the proportion of bacterial genera and phyla. A 10 mg/L dose of H2O2 with UV after biological treatment reached log reductions between 1.80-2.43 for the pharmaceuticals. However, to obtain removal of organics higher than 30 %, H2O2 doses greater than 30 mg/L were necessary. Mineralization of biologically treated effluent was obtained with UV dose 130.5 kJ/m(2) and H2O2 dose 200 mg/L.

AB In the present study, we investigated the impact of treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in subsoil pore-water, a so-far under-appreciated matrix. We hypothesized that TWW irrigation increases ARG prevalence in subsoil pore-water. This hypothesis was tested using a multiphase approach, which consisted of sampling percolated subsoil pore-water from lysimeter-wells of a real-scale TWW-irrigated field, operated for commercial farming practices, and controlled, laboratory microcosms irrigated with freshwater or TWW. We monitored the abundance of six selected ARGs (sul1, bla(OXA-58), tetM, qnrS, bla(CTX-M-32) and bla(TEM)), the intI1 gene associated with mobile genetic elements and an indicator for anthropogenic pollution and bacterial abundance (16S rRNA gene) by qPCR. The bacterial load of subsoil pore water was independent of both, irrigation intensity in the field study and irrigation water type in the microcosms. Among the tested genes in the field study, sul1 and intI1 exhibited constantly higher relative abundances. Their abundance was further positively correlated with increasing irrigation intensity. Controlled microcosm experiments verified the observed field study results: the relative abundance of several genes, including sul1 and intI1, increased significantly when irrigating with TWW compared to freshwater irrigation. Overall, TWW irrigation promoted the spread of ARGs and intI1 in the subsoil pore-water, while the bacterial load was maintained. The combined results from the real-scale agricultural field and the controlled lab microcosms indicate that the dissemination of ARGs in various subsurface environments needs to be taken into account during TWW irrigation scenarios.

AB Rhizobacterial dynamics, relating to pollutant degradation mechanisms, over the course of plant lifespan have rarely been reported when using phytoremediation technologies for pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewater treatment. This study investigated the rhizobacterial dynamics of Typha angustifolia in constructed wetlands to treat ibuprofen (IBP)-polluted wastewater throughout plant development from seedling, vegetative, bolting, mature, to senescent stages. It was found that conventional pollutant and IBP removals increased with plant development, reaching to the best performance at bolting or mature stage (removal efficiencies: 92% organics, 52% ammonia, 60% phosphorus and 76% IBP). In the IBP-stressed wetlands, the rhizobacterial diversity during plant development was adversely affected by IBP accompanied with a reduced evenness. The bacterial communities changed dynamically at different developmental stages and showed significant differences compared to the control wetlands (free of IBP). The dominant bacteria colonized in the rhizosphere was the phylum Actinobacteria, having a final relative abundance of 0.79 and containing a large amount of genus norank_o_ PeM15. Positive interactions were evident among the rhizobacteria in IBP-stressed wetlands and the predicted functions of 16S rRNA genes revealed the potential co-metabolism and metabolism of IBP. The co-metabolism of IBP might be related to root exudates such as amino acid, lipid, fatty acid and organic acid. In addition, positive correlations between the organic compounds of interstitial water (bulk environment) and the rhizobacterial communities were observed in IBP-stressed wetlands, which suggests that the influence of IBP on bulk microbiome might be able to modulate rhizosphere microbiome to achieve the degradation of IBP via co-metabolism or metabolism.

AB Chemcatcher(R) and POCIS passive sampling devices are widely used for monitoring polar organic pollutants in water. Chemcatcher(R) uses a bound Horizon Atlantic (TM) HLB-L sorbent disk as receiving phase, whilst the POCIS uses the same material in the form of loose powder. Both devices (n = 3) were deployed for 21 days in the final effluent at three wastewater treatment plants in South Wales, UK. Following deployment, sampler extracts were analysed using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Compounds were identified using an in-house database of pharmaceuticals using a metabolomics workflow. Sixty-eight compounds were identified in all samplers. For the POCIS, substantial losses of sorbent (11-51%) were found during deployment and subsequent laboratory analysis, necessitating the use of a recovery factor. Percentage relative standard deviations varied (with 10 compounds exceeding 30% in both samplers) between individual compounds and between samplers deployed at the three sites. The relative performance of the two devices was evaluated using the mass of analyte sequestered, measured as an integrated peak area. The ratio of the uptake of the pharmaceuticals for the POCIS versus Chemcatcher(R) was lower (1.84x) than would be expected on the basis of the ratio of active sampling areas (3.01x) of the two devices. The lower than predicted uptake may be attributable to the loose sorbent material moving inside the POCIS when deployed in the field in the vertical plane. In order to overcome this, it is recommended to deploy the POCIS horizontally inside the deployment cage.

AB The current work deals with efficient removal of acetaminophen (AC) from hospital wastewater using electro-Fenton (EF) process. The degradation yield of 99.5% was obtained under optimal experimental conditions, namely 5.75 mg L-1 initial AC concentration, 2.75 pH solution, 3-cm inter-electrode distance, 100 mg L-1 KCl electrolyte, 122.5 mu L L-1 H2O2, 8 mA cm(-2) current density at equilibrium time of 8 min. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested that the effect of mentioned operating parameters was statistically significant on the AC removal. The low probability amount of P value (P < 0.0001), the Fisher's F-value of 65.91, and correlation coefficient of the model (R-2 = 0.9545) revealed a satisfactory correlation between the experimental and the predicted values of AC removal. The predicted removal efficiency of 99.4% was in satisfactory agreement with the obtained experimental removal efficiency of 98.7%. The AC degradation during the EF followed a first-order kinetic model with rate constants (K-app) of 0.6718 min(-1). Using the ordinary radical scavengers revealed that main mechanism of AC degradation controlled by the hydroxyl free radicals produced throughout the EF process. The excess amount of iron (II) scavenged the active radicals and diminished the concentration of OH available to react with AC. The optimum molar ratio of H2O2 to -Fe2+ was found to be 2.5. The developed EF process as a promising technique applied for treatment of real samples.

AB Dams are universally constructed to change hydrodynamic forces and impound water in urban rivers, but few efforts have been made to expound the impact of dams on the transport of antibiotics in rivers. In this study, the main object and focus was to elucidate the intercept effect of rubber dam and the gate dam on the sediment-water phase redistribution of eight typical antibiotics along an urban river with the water replenished from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results show that the eight antibiotics were widely detected in the whole river segment, and the WWTPs were found to be the main sources. Among the eight antibiotics, fluoroquinolones had the highest concentrations in the surface water, while tetracyclines constituted the dominant composition in the sediments. Due to the retention effect, the rubber dam encouraged the enrichment and degradation of the antibiotics in the river. However, the role of gate dams depended mainly on the opening and closing of the sluice gate. For all eight antibiotics, each dam or WWTP exhibited a generally consistent impact on the changes (e.g., an increase or decrease) of the sediment-water partitioning coefficients, although obvious differences existed between effect degree. Moreover, the changes in the coefficients caused by the rubber damwere completely opposite to those affected by gate dams. Contrary to the other six antibiotics, the two sulfonamides showed significant relationships with the dissolved organic matter in the surface water but had no significant relationships with the organic matter in the sediments.

AB In this study, a 1200 L outdoor pilot scale microalgal photobioreactor (PBR) was used for toilet wastewater (WW) treatment and evaluate its ability to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The PBR was operated at two different hydraulic retention times (HRTs), which were 8 and 12 days, during Period I (September-October) and Period II (October-December), respectively. Algal biomass concentrations varied by operating period because of seasonal changes. Nutrients (ammonia, nitrogen and total phosphorous) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were monitored and efficiently removed in both periods (> 80%), attaining the legislation limits. At the theoretical hydraulic steady state in both periods, pharmaceutical removal reached high levels (> 48%). Two harvesting techniques were applied to the PBR microalgae effluent. Gravity sedimentation was efficient for biomass removal (> 99% in 7 min) in Period I when large particles, flocs and aggregates were present. In contrast, a longer sedimentation time was required when biomass was mainly composed of single cells (88% clarification in a 24 h in Period II). The second harvesting technique investigated was the co-pelletization of algal biomass with the ligninolytic fungus Trametes versicolor, attaining > 98% clarification for Period II biomass once pellets were formed. The novel technology of co-pelletization enabled the complete harvesting of single algae cells from the liquid medium in a sustainable way, which benefits the subsequent use of both biomass and the clarified effluent.

AB Trace emerging contaminants (ECs) occur in both waste and surface waters that are rich in particulates that have been found to sorb several organic contaminants. An analytical method based on off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was developed for the detection and quantification of 31 ECs from surface water, wastewater, suspended particulate matter (SPM) as well as sediments. Lyophilized sediments and air-dried SPM were subjected to ultrasonic extraction. Water samples and extracts were then concentrated and cleaned-up by off-line SPE. Quantification was realized using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer in both full scan (FS) and MS2 modes. These two modes were optimized and compared to determine which one was the most suitable for each matrix studied. Yeast estrogen screen assay (YES-assay) adapted from the direct measurement of estrogenic activity without sample extraction was tested on filtered wastewater samples. An endocrine disrupting effect was detected in all effluent samples analyzed with estradiol equivalent concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 720 ng eq E2 L-1 for the WWTP-1 and 6.5-42 ng eq E2 L-1 for the WWTP-2. The analytical methods were also applied on six samples of surface water, the corresponding SPM, the sediments and thirty-nine effluent samples from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) sampled over a period of five months (February to June 2014).

AB Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate of species which are adapted to cold freshwater ecosystems. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46 degrees N, 10 degrees E; 1799 m asl) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. Larvae of this species were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 h to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (STP/10, STP/100, STP/1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the STP/10 effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.

AB Surface active agents (SAA) with negative charge of polar group are named as anionic compounds. They are the main constituent of most products containing synthetic surfactants. The linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkyl ethoxysulfates (AES) and alkyl sulfates (AS) are typically applied from this class of compounds. Those surfactants are ingredients of household detergents and cleaners, laundry detergents, cosmetic etc. Moreover they can be applied in the paper, textile and tanning industry as optical brighteners, dispersant, wetting and suspending agents. They can be substrates in the formulation of different products like dyes, pigments, pesticides, exchange resins, plasticizers and pharmaceuticals. Anionic surfactants after use are passed into sewage-treatment plants, where they are partially degraded and adsorbed to sewage sludge (applied in agriculture fields). Finally, the anionic SAA or their degradation products are discharged into surface waters and onto bottom sediments, soils or living organisms. Therefore, it is important (widely application, bioaccumulation, toxicity for living organisms) to investigate the environmental fate of those class of compounds in more details. This research involves determination the concentration of anionic surfactants with use appropriated analytical techniques in environmental samples The official methodology for determination of anionic SAA in liquid samples is based on the ion-pair reaction of these analytes compounds with methylene blue (MB) and an extraction with toxic solvent chloroform. During isolation step of anionic compounds from solid samples are employed Soxhlet and ultrasonic-assisted extraction techniques with use of methanol or mixture of other organic solvents as extraction medium. To overcome disadvantages of those traditional techniques were applied following techniques at sample preparation step from liquid and solid matrices: solid-phase extraction (SPE) and solid-phases microextraction (SPME); accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), respectively. For estimate total concentration of anionic analytes in extracts the spectrophotometric technique is used (as official regulation). For determination concentration of individual analytes were applied gas (derivatization step requires) and liquid chromatography mainly with mass spectrometry technique. The presence of anionic surface active agents was confirmed in various ecosystems (liquid and solid environmental samples).

AB Interest in water recycling has provided opportunities to evaluate the potential impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) on plants where recycled wastewater is used for watering and irrigation. Most researches have focused on the impact of pharmaceuticals on seed germination and plant physiology or the uptake of pharmaceuticals into plants. We sought to find out whether nutrient and metal uptake into wheat plants were affected by the presence of PPCPs (acetaminophen, caffeine, beta-estradiol, and gemfibrozil) in soil. As acetaminophen, caffeine, beta-estradiol, and gemfibrozil concentrations in soil increased, plant physiological parameters such as electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation also increased significantly over levels in control plants grown in parallel. Furthermore, increasing PPCP soil concentrations led to decreasing element concentrations in wheat plants, suggesting a reduction in uptake of nutrients and metals in the presence of pharmaceuticals. Our short-term observations suggest plants irrigated with recycled wastewater containing PPCPs experience stress which is ultimately reflected in a reduction of nutrient and metal uptake by wheat plants.

AB Multiple regression models, clustering tree diagrams, regression trees (CHAID) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied to the study of the removal of organic matter and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater by means of constructed wetlands (CWs). These four statistical analyses pointed out the importance of physico-chemical parameters, plant presence and chemical structure in the elimination of most pollutants. Temperature, pH values, dissolved oxygen concentration, redox potential and conductivity were related to the removal of the studied substances. Plant presence (Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis) enhanced the removal of organic matter and some PPCPs. Multiple regression equations and CHAID trees provided numerical estimations of pollutant removal efficiencies in CWs. These models were validated and they could be a useful and interesting tool for the quick estimation of removal efficiencies in already working CWs and for the design of new systems which must fulfil certain quality requirements.

AB Advanced wastewater treatment is necessary to effectively remove emerging contaminants (ECs) with chronic toxicity, endocrine disrupting effects, and the capability to induce the proliferation of highly resistant microbial strains in the environment from before wastewater disposal or reuse. This paper investigates the efficiency of a novel hybrid process that applies membrane ultrafiltration, activated carbon adsorption, and ultrasound irradiation simultaneously to remove ECs. Diclofenac, carbamazepine, and amoxicillin are chosen for this investigation because of their assessed significant environmental risks. Removal mechanisms and enhancement effects are analysed in single and combined processes. The influence of adsorbent dose and ultrasonic frequency to EC removal are also investigated. Results suggest that adsorption is probably the main removal mechanism and is affected by the nature of ECs and the presence of other components in the mixture. Almost complete removals are achieved in the hybrid process for all ECs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic carbons can significantly lower the costs of wastewater treatment due to easy separation of the adsorbent. However, current production techniques often involve the use of chlorinated or sulfonated Fe precursors with an inherent potential for secondary pollution. In this study, ochre, an iron-rich waste stream was investigated as a sustainable Fe source to produce magnetic activated biochar from two agricultural feedstocks, softwood and wheat straw. Fe doping resulted in significant shifts in pyrolysis yield distribution with increased gas yields (+50%) and gas energy content (+40%) lowering the energy costs for production. Physical activation transformed ochre to magnetite/maghemite resulting in activated magnetic biochars and led to a 4-fold increase in the adsorption capacities for two common micropollutants - caffeine and fluconazole. The results show that Fe doping not only benefits the adsorbent properties but also the production process, leading the way to sustainable carbon adsorbents.

AB The monitoring of emerging pollutants in wastewaters is nowadays an issue of special concern, with the classical quantification methods being time and reagent consuming. In this sense, a FTIR transmission spectroscopy based chemometric methodology was developed for the determination of eight of these pollutants. A total of 456 samples were, therefore, obtained, from an activated sludge wastewater treatment process spiked with the studied pollutants, and analysed in the range of 200 cm(-1) to 14,000 cm(-1). Then, a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) analysis aiming at identifying each sample pollutant was employed. Next, partial least squares (PLS) and ordinary least squares (OLS) modelling approaches were employed in order to obtain suitable prediction models. This procedure resulted in good prediction abilities regarding the estimation of atrazine, desloratadine, paracetamol, beta-estradiol, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and ethynylestradiol concentrations in wastewaters. These promising results suggest this technology as a fast, eco-friendly and reagent free alternative methodology for the quantification of emerging pollutants in wastewaters.

AB Previous studies have suggested the use of sucralose, a synthetic non-nutritive sweetener, as an indicator of domestic wastewater loading to surface waters. This paper presents a novel flow schematic approach for quantifying volumetric load contributions from different water sources by utilizing sucralose as a master diagnostic variable in combination with other trace compounds. This conceptual approach was validated through demonstration of sucralose presence at positive field sites susceptible to either water reuse or septic infiltration and its absence at negative field sites. Differences in the ratios of carbamazepine to sucralose and gadolinium anomaly to sucralose were demonstrated for eight septic and water reuse effluents. Utilization of these ratios as a means of distinguishing septic and water reuse loading to water bodies merits additional study. In the absence of sustained loading, the use of carbamazepine might be hindered by photolysis and gadolinium anomaly might be hindered when volumetric loading is less than 20%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ozone (O-3)-based processes (O-3, O-3/H2O2, and O-3/UV) were investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals in real wastewater using a bench-scale experimental setup. An ozone dose of 6 mg/L (contact time = 10 minutes) was found to reduce the concentration of most pharmaceuticals detected in secondary effluent. Caffeine, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and cyclophosphamide were removed with efficiencies of 84, 89, and 46%, respectively, even with a contact time of 15 minutes (O-3 dose = 6 mg/L). In the case of the ozone process alone, the concentration of bromate ion in the effluent increased with longer contact time. On the other hand, it was found that the O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV processes can be used as alternative processes for effective removal of pharmaceuticals, while leaving a low residual concentration of dissolved ozone in the system, thereby preventing bromate formation.

AB The concentrations of three fragrance materials (OTNE, HHCB, and AHTN) and triclosan at the inlet and outlet of a wastewater treatment plant were measured, and the decrease of these targeted compounds during aeration process of activated sludge was investigated experimentally and compared with that in the plant. The ratios of the decreases in the aeration experiments were 24%-46% for 8 h and were compared with the estimated decrease ratio in the plant. From a mass balance comparison including the transference to the air phase with bubbling, OTNE in the mixed liquor appeared to be majorly volatilized with bubble while HHCB to be volatilized and/or removed with excess sludge withdrawal. The volatilization for AHTN and triclosan was on the other hand, low (AHTN) or scarce (triclosan). The decrease of them is probably owing the biological decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present work reportes the pertinence of samarium (Sm) doped spinel nanoferrites as magnetically recoverable photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater. Thus, a series of Sm substituted spinel nanoferrites, MSmxFe2-xO4 (M = Ni, Co; x = 0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.1) were synthesized via sol-gel methodology. The effect of Sm doping on the structural, morphological, optical and magnetic properties of pristine nanoferrites was investigated systematically. Further, the fabricated samples were explored as photocatalysts for the oxidative degradation of antibiotics (ofloxacin and norfloxacin) and dyes (methyl orange and safranin O). The Sm doped nanoferrites exhibit astonishing catalytic efficacy that can be attributed to higher surface area, octahedral site preference of Sm ions and reduced band gap. The synthesized nanoferrites display excellent recyclability which enables them to be utilized as potential photo catalysts for wastewater treatment. (C) 2020 Chinese Society of Rare Earths.

AB In this work, the cubic cobalt and zinc doped and co-doped magnetite nanocatalysts were synthesized and characterized using different analysis. The so-synthesized photocatalysts were used for the activation of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and persulfate (PS) under UVA irradiation. The integration of Fe2.5Co0.3Zn0.2O4 improved the activation of PS and HP; wherein, the UVA/Fe2.5Co0.3Zn0.2O4/PS process demonstrated higher degradation performance for Sulfalene (SFL) as a veterinary pharmaceutical contaminant in water. Afterward, the effect of different physicochemical parameters was studied and the radicals generated through the process were identified using chemical scavengers. UVA/Fe2.5Co0.3Zn0.2O4/PS process brought about 67% of SFL degradation in real wastewater. Moreover, 85% of TOC removal was achieved within 15 h of the above-mentioned process. Eventually, the phototoxicity of the untreated and treated SFL solution after 120 min of the UVA/Fe2.5Co0.3Zn0.2O4/PS process was studied using Lemna minor aquatic species.

AB A submerged forward osmotic membrane bioreactor (FOMBR) was used to reveal the removal and degradation mechanism of carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater. The results showed that the removal mechanism consisted of the rejection of the forward osmotic (FO) membrane and biodegradation of the activated sludge. The removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N, and CBZ by the FOMBR were approximately 94.77%-97.45%, 93.56%-99.28%, and 88.20%-94.45%, respectively. Moreover, the COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies were positively correlated with the increased CBZ concentrations. The results of the soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) tests illustrated that the membrane fouling potential of EPS may be higher than that of SMP. According to the identified 14 degradation products, oxidation, hydroxylation, and decarboxylation were defined as the primary CBZ degradation mechanism. In addition, the RNA results showed that Delftia could be the characteristic bacteria in the CBZ degradation process.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation in arid and hot climates where plant transpiration is high may affect plant accumulation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this study, carrot, lettuce, and tomato plants were grown in solution containing 16 PPCP/EDCs in either a cool-humid or a warm-dry environment. Leaf bio-concentration factors (BCF) were positively correlated with transpiration for chemical groups of different ionized states (p <0.05). However, root BCFs were correlated with transpiration only for neutral PPCP/EDCs (p <0.05). Neutral and cationic PPCP/EDCs showed similar accumulation, while anionic PPCP/EDCs had significantly higher accumulation in roots and significantly lower accumulation in leaves (p < 0.05). Results show that plant transpiration may play a significant role in the uptake and translocation of PPCP/EDCs, which may have a pronounced effect in arid and hot climates where irrigation with treated wastewater is common.

AB Many drugs such as beta-blockers have been shown to occur in aquatic environments. Even if adequate ecotoxicity data are not available, it is of primary importance to get informations about their fate in environmental waters, particularly about their photofate in sewage treatment plant effluents (STP). The main difficulties when studying pharmaceutical photochemical behaviour in environmental waters, are linked to the very low environmentally relevant concentrations (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) which can generate problems in terms of analytical sensitivity. Moreover, the complexity of environmental matrices can modify micropollutants degradation kinetics. The photodegradation of beta-blockers has been compared at two concentration levels (10 mu g L-1 and 10 mg L-1) and in two different matrices (pure water and STP effluent). It has been shown that the concentration does not influence beta-blockers degradation pathways, thus allowing the identification of degradation compounds using the 10 mg L-1 solutions. Although environmental waters speed up the degradation process, the same photoproducts were appeared in both matrices. Using LC-MS/MS, hydroxyl radical additions have been identified as an important degradation pathway for especially pindolol, propranolol and timolol, leading to several positional isomers, corresponding to mono-, di- or tri-hydroxylations. Kinetics of appearance/disappearance of these photoproducts have been studied in STIR effluents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study applied a laboratory-scaled, staged anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (SAF-MBR) added with granular activated carbon (GAC) as fluidized media to treat a synthetic wastewater containing 0.1 mg/L of three different pharmaceutical micropollutants. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole were selected as target micropollutants to investigate their removal efficiency during SAF-MBR operation. More than 96% of overall COD removal efficiency was achieved at 8.7 h of total HRT with 288 mg/L of bulk VSS concentration. Transmembrane pressure (TMP) from membrane remained less than 0.3 bar during operational period. After the SAF-MBR was introduced with the micropollutants at 5 Lm(-2) h(-1) of permeate flux, they were removed completely within 3 days of operation. Our batch experiments supported that the removal of micropollutants in reactor bulk was immensely pronounced by adsorption to GACs, sorption and biodegradation due to the biofilm formed on GACs fluidized in SAF-MBR system.

AB The purpose of this work was the economic assessment of different municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluent treatment operating strategies based on the combination of nanofiltration (NF) and EDDS-assisted solar photo-Fenton at neutral pH or ozonation at natural pH. The study focused on micro-contaminant (MC) removal as evaluated by LC-Qtrap-MS. Direct treatment of MCs in MWTP effluents was compared with their treatment in an NF rejection stream. Costs were estimated based on a flow rate of 1000 m(3) per day (365 operating days per year) and over 90% degradation of 35 different MCs. The highest operating costs were related to EDDS and the hydrogen peroxide for photo-Fenton, pumping for NF and O-3 generation for ozonation. It was concluded that both photo-Fenton and ozonation applied to NF rejection lowered treatment costs compared to MWTP effluent treatment. Ozonation was the most economical in all cases.

AB A Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, non-endospore-forming rod-shaped bacterium with ibuprofen-degrading capacity, designated strain I11(T), was isolated from activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. The major respiratory quinone was demethylmenaquinone DMK-7, C-18:1 cis9 was the predominant fatty acid, phosphatidylglycerol was the predominant polar lipid, the cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and the G+C content of the genonnic DNA was 74.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain I11(T) were Patulibacter ginsengiterrae CECT 7603(T) (96.8% similarity), Patulibacter minatonensis DSM 18081(T) (96.6 %) and Patulibacter americanus DSM 16676(T) (96.6%). Phenotypic characterization supports the inclusion of strain I11(T) within the genus Patulibacter (phylum Actinobacteria). However, distinctive features and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis suggest that is represents a novel species, for which the name Patulibacter medicamentivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is I11(T) (=DSM 25962(T)=CECT 8141(T)).

AB Only a limited number of households in the Amazon are served by sewage collection or treatment facili-ties, suggesting that there might be a significant emission of pharmaceuticals and other wastewater con-taminants into freshwater ecosystems. In this work, we performed a wide-scope screening to assess the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites in freshwater ecosystems of the Brazil-ian Amazon. Our study included 40 samples taken along the Amazon River, in three of its major tribu-taries, and in small tributaries crossing four important urban areas (Manaus, Santarem, Macapa, Belem). More than 900 compounds were investigated making use of target and suspect screening approaches, based on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with ion mobility sep-aration. Empirical collision-cross section (CCS) values were used to help and confirm identifications in target screening, while in the suspect screening approach CCS values were predicted using Artificial Neu-ral Networks to increase the confidence of the tentative identification. In this way, 51 compounds and metabolites were identified. The highest prevalence was found in streams crossing the urban areas of Manaus, Macapa and Belem, with some samples containing up to 30 -40 compounds, while samples taken in Santarem showed a lower number (8 -11), and the samples taken in the main course of the Amazon River and its tributaries contained between 1 and 7 compounds. Most compounds identified in areas with significant urban impact belonged to the analgesics and antihypertensive categories, followed by stimulants and antibiotics. Compounds such as caffeine, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, and cotinine (the metabolite of nicotine), were also detected in areas with relatively low anthropogenic impact and showed the highest total prevalence. This study supports the need to improve the sanita-tion system of urban areas in the Brazilian Amazon and the development of follow-up studies aimed at quantifying exposure levels and risks for Amazonian freshwater biodiversity.

AB The occurrence, removal, mass loading, seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of nine psychiatric pharmaceuticals and four of their selected metabolites, were studied in one hospital and one urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ioannina city, in northwestern Greece, providing information about the efficiency of the plants and their contribution into the final receiver's flow. Samples were collected from the influents and the effluents of the plants in different sampling campaigns, from July to December 2016. Analytical methodology was based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, after solid-phase extraction through Oasis HLB cartridges. Concentrations in both WWTPs ranged between bLOQ and 1126.3 ng/L in the influents and between bLOQ and 1127.4 ng/L, in the effluents. Results indicated that venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine were the most frequently detected compounds in the influents and the effluents of both WWTPs. Metabolite to parent compound ratio ranged in the influents between 0.01 and 87.2 while in the effluents between 0.01 and 47.7. Based on mass loads in the influents, venlafaxine is consumed in high amounts (up to 67.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.), and consequently its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine (up to 139.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.). Similarly to the influents, environmental emissions, were also higher for venlafaxine and O-desmethyl venlafaxine (10.1 and 13.3 mg/d/1000 inhab., respectively). Removal efficiencies in the hospital WWTP ranged from -100% to 98.9%, while in the city WWTP from -49.9% to 99.8%. Furthermore, an important outcome was the evaluation of the potential ecotoxicological risk, by means of risk quotients (RQs), where none of the target psychiatrics or their metabolites showed RQ above 1.

AB Antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper provides comprehensive data on the occurrences of 19 antibiotics, bacteria resistant to 10 antibiotics, and 15 ARGs in raw influent and different treatment stages of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems. Seventeen out of the 19 target antibiotics were detected in raw influent with concentrations of up to ten micrograms per liter. Concentrations of antibiotics measured in the secondary effluent were much lower compared to those in the raw influent. Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, meropenem, minocycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine and vancomycin had highest removal by CAS or MBR systems with median removal efficiency (RE) > 70%, while trimethoprim and lincomycin were recalcitrant in the CAS system with median RE <50%. Similarly, the target ARB and ARGs were omnipresent in the raw influent samples with average concentrations as high as 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/mL and 2.0 x 10(7) gene copies/mL, respectively. The concentrations of ARB in secondary effluent of the CAS system declined relative to the raw influent (i.e. lower than raw influent by 2-3 orders of magnitude) and no ARB were detected in the MF permeate of the MBR system. For ARGs, their concentrations in secondary effluent/MF permeate ranged from below method quantification limit (<MQL) to 10(4) gene copies/mL. It is noteworthy that several ARGs, i.e. bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(SHV), ermB, intl1, sul1 and tetO, were still found in the MF permeate of the MBR system at average concentrations up to 10(3) copies/mL. In conclusion, MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of ARB, ARGs and most target antibiotics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, fate, geographical and seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of eleven of the most consumed pharmaceuticals in Portugal were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) influents and (WWI) and effluents (WWE). WWI and WWE samples, from two sampling campaigns (spring and summer), in 2013, were evaluated in 15 different WWTPs across the country, by solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (LC-MS-MS).
   Lipid regulators were the most frequently found in WWI and WWE (184.1 and 22.3 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), followed by anti-inflammatories (1339.4 and 15.0 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), and antibiotics (330.7 and 68.6 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). Anxiolytics were the least detected with 3.3 and 3.4 mg/day/1000 inhab. in WWI and WWE, respectively.
   The mass loads, both in WWI and WWE, were higher in summer than those found during the spring season, being remarkable the high values registered in a region where population triplicates in this time of the year. The mean removal efficiency achieved was of 94.5%, nonetheless, between the different therapeutic groups, as well as within each group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100%. In the summer higher efficiencies were observed regarding lipid regulators and antibiotics.
   Furthermore, an important outcome was the evaluation, by means of risk quotients (RQs), of the potential ecotoxicological risk posed by the selected pharmaceuticals to different aquatic organisms, exposed to the effluents studied. Ciprofloxacin, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, simvastatin and diclofenac showed RQs higher than one, being expected that these pharmaceuticals might pose a threat to the three trophic levels (algae, daphnids and fish) evaluated. These results highlight the importance of these monitoring studies, as required by the Directive 2013/39/EU, in order to minimize their aquatic environmental contamination and support future prioritization measures.

AB The elimination of 81 pharmaceuticals (PhACs) by means of a biological treatment based on the fungus Trametes versicolor was evaluated in this work. PhAC removal studied in different types of wastewaters (urban, reverse osmosis concentrate, hospital, and veterinary hospital wastewaters) were reviewed and compared with conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. In addition, hazard indexes were calculated based on the exposure levels and ecotoxicity for each compound and used for the evaluation of the contaminants removal. PhAC elimination achieved with the fungal treatment (mean value 76%) was similar or slightly worse than the elimination achieved in the CAS treatment (85%). However, the fungal reactor was superior in removing more hazardous compounds (antibiotics and psychiatric drugs) than the conventional activated sludge in terms of environmental risk reduction (93% and 53% of reduction respectively). Fungal treatment can thus be considered as a good alternative to conventional treatment technologies for the elimination of PhACs from wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUNDThe decomposition of carbamazepine (CBZ) in synthetic solution and in municipal effluent was investigated using a sono-electrochemical reactor. Sono-electrolysis was conducted using two concentrical electrodes installed in a cylindrical reactor containing a ceramic transducer.
   RESULTSCBZ concentration (C-0=10 mgL(-1)) optimally diminished up to 90% by applying a current intensity of 4.86A for 177 min and by imposing an ultrasound power of 38.29 W. The optimal conditions were subsequently applied for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater effluent contaminated with 10 mu g CBZL(-1). The reported removal efficiencies of CBZ, TOC, COD and colour were 93%, 60%, 93% and 86%, respectively. Likewise, the toxicity was completely removed (bacterium Vibrio fisheri) from the municipal wastewater effluent (>96%).
   CONCLUSIONSThe advantages of coupling ultrasonication and electrooxidation (US-EO) treatment for CBZ removal were demonstrated. An experimental design methodology based on response surface methodology was applied to determine the optimal experimental conditions in terms of cost/effectiveness of removal.

AB BACKGROUND: Furaltadone (FD), a nitrofuran derivative, is a highly effective chemotherapeutic drug. In China the FD wastewater discharged by the pharmaceutical industry is high in organics and biorefractory compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism of FD in aqueous solution by ozone oxidation. Preliminary results on the reaction mechanism were obtained using three different spectral analysis techniques. RESULTS: The ozonation mechanism was significantly affected by the pH value. At low pH values the primary reaction is direct oxidation of ozone, an incomplete oxidisation, which can only destroy the FD molecule's conjugated structure. At high pH values the major reaction changes to hydroxyl radical oxidation. FD can be rapidly oxidised into CO2, H2O, NH3, NO3-, HCHO, oxalic acid and other aliphatic acids of low molecular weight, which can be entirely mineralised by continued ozonation. CONCLUSION: The pH value significantly influences the mode of FD ozonation. The present experiment suggests a potentially useful pretreatment method for conventional biological treatment of wastewater containing FD. (c) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Because of the growing need to eliminate undesirable microorganisms in different industrial treatments, mainly in the food and agricultural sector and the pharmaceutical industry, a number of increasingly effective systems for disinfection to eliminate microorganisms have been devised. This article analyzes different methods to eliminate and/or significantly reduce the number of microorganisms in industrial contexts and in environmental engineering. Although, in the past, thermal treatments had been used most frequently for microbial elimination, the method is costly and has the disadvantage of modifying the organoleptic and/or physicochemical properties of the food products. For this reason, new technologies rapidly are being developed, such as high-intensity pulsed electric fields, high-pressure systems, ultrasounds, and irradiation, which effectively eliminate microorganisms without deteriorating the properties of the product. These emerging technologies are potentially applicable in the field of environmental engineering. Water Environ. Res., 83, 233 (2011).

AB A model based on graph theory was developed to efficiently evaluate the impact of the effluent from 742 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on micropollutant loading throughout all river catchments in Switzerland. Model results agree well with measured loads for 12 compounds in river water samples, revealing mean predictive accuracy factors between 0.8 and 3.4. Subsequently, pollutant concentrations were predicted for river sections downstream from 543 WWTPs where hydrological information was available, and compared with recent recommendations for water quality criteria. At base flow conditions, carbamazepine concentrations (parent compound only) are ubiquitously below a water quality criterion of 0.5 mu g L(-1). In contrast, the sum of diclofenac and its metabolites is expected to exceed the corresponding water quality criterion of 0.1 mu g L(-1) in 224 river sections. If diclofenac cannot be eliminated at the source, the model suggests a directed upgrade of 173 WWTPs to meet the condition that concentrations are never to exceed this water quality criterion.

AB A quantitative assessment of pollutants of emerging concern in the Hartbeespoort Damcatchment area was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS) to establish the occurrence, source and distribution of 15 environmental pollutants, including 10 pharmaceuticals, 1 pesticide and 4 steroid hormones. Seasonal sampling was conducted in the Hartbeespoort Lake using sub-surface grab sampling to determine the lake's ecological status and obtain data for establishment of progressive operational monitoring. The Jukskei River, which lies upstream of the Hartbeespoort Dam, was sampled in the winter season. Five year old carp Cyprinus carpio) and catfish Clarias gariepinus) were also sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam to study bioaccumulation in biota as well as to estimate risk associated with fish consumption. In the Jukskei River, the main source of 11 emerging pollutants EPs) was identified as raw sewage overflow, with the highest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 593 ng L-1 being recorded at the Midrand point and the lowest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 164 ng L-1 at the N14 site located 1 km downstream of a large wastewater treatment plant. The Jukskei River was found to be the largest contributor of the emerging contaminants detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam. In the Hartbeespoort Dam EP concentrations were generally in the order efavirenz > nevirapine > carbamazepine > methocarbamol > bromacil > venlafaxine. Water and sediment were sampled from the uMngeni River estuary within 24 h after large volumes of an assortment of pharmaceuticalwaste had been discovered to bewashed into the river estuary after flash rainfall on 18 May 2016. Analytical results revealed high levels of some emerging pollutants in sediment samples, up to 81 ng g(-1) for nevirapine and 4 ng g(-1) for etilefrine HCL. This study shows that efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, methocarbamol, bromacil and venlafaxine are contaminants that require operational monitoring in South African urban waters.

AB Lipid regulators have been detected in effluents from sewage treatment plants and surface waters from humans via excretion. This study was designed to assess the ecotoxicity of fibrates, lipid regulating agents. The following compounds were investigated: Bezafibrate, Fenofibrate and Gemfibrozil and their derivatives obtained by solar simulator irradiation. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, rotifers and microcrustaceans to assess acute and chronic toxicity, while SOS Chromotest and Ames test were utilized to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds.
   The photoproducts were identified by their physical features and for the first risk evaluation, the environmental impact of parental compounds was calculated by Measured Environmental Concentrations (MEC) using the available data from the literature regarding drug occurrence in the aquatic environment and the Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNEC) based on our toxicity data. The results showed that acute toxicity was in the order of dozens of mg/L for all the trophic levels utilized in bioassays (bacteria, rotifers, crustaceans). Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on rotifers and crustaceans while the algae seemed to be slightly affected by this class of pharmaceuticals. Genotoxic and mutagenic effects were especially found for the Gemfibrozil photoproduct suggesting that also byproducts have to be considered in the environmental risk of drugs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of floating organic droplet (DLLME-SFO) was applied to isolate budesonide (BUD) and sulfasalazine (SULF) from aqueous samples. The effects of different parameters on the efficiency on the extraction such as type of extrahent and dispersive solvent, ionic strength, pH of sample, and centrifugation time were investigated. Moreover, the influence of foreign substances on a studied process was tested. The calibration curves were recorded. The linearity ranges for BUD and SULF were 0.022-8.611 mu g mL(-1) and 0.020-7.968 mu g mL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) 0.011 mu g mL(-1) and 0.012 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The enrichment factors (EF) for two analytes were high: for BUD it was 145.7 and for SULF, 119.5. The elaborated procedure was applied for HPLC-UV determination of these analytes in water and wastewater samples.

AB The application of appropriate advanced treatment process in the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has become an important issue considering the elimination of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In the present study, the removal of 13 PPCPs belonging to different therapeutic classes by the sequential ultraviolet (UV) and ozonation process in a full-scale WWTP in Beijing was investigated over the course of ten months. Most of the target PPCPs were effectively removed, and the median removal efficiencies of individual PPCPs, ranging from - 13% to 89%, were dependent on their reaction rate constants with molecular ozone. Noticeable fluctuation in the removal efficiencies of the same PPCPs was observed in different sampling campaigns. Nevertheless, the sequential UV and ozonation process still made a significant contribution to the total elimination of most PPCPs in the full-scale WWTP, by compensating for the poor or fluctuant removal performance of PPCPs by biologic treatment process.

AB Investigations of agricultural nonpoint source pollution typically focus on a relatively narrow range of targeted toxic and biostimulatory compounds (e.g., specific pesticides, nutrients). Regular application of numerous other organic compounds to agricultural fields in pesticide formulations, irrigation water, soil amendments, and fertilizers may result in their transport into surface waters via runoff. We examined whether potentially toxic dissolved and particle-associated "nontarget" organic compounds were present in surface runoff from agricultural fields irrigated with disinfected tertiary recycled water or wastewater effluent-dominated streamwater. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of filtered runoff samples revealed the presence of numerous nontarget compounds of potential toxicological significance including pesticide transformation products, pesticide adjuvant chemicals, plasticizers, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, and personal care product ingredients. Although the toxicity of many of these compounds is poorly characterized, some may elicit subtle but profound toxicological effects. Agricultural runoff also represented a source of allochthonous natural organic matter to the stream system.

The generation of cyanide ions was observed in hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine), losartan potassium, metronidazole, and allopurinol. The largest generation was observed in hexamine. In both hexamine and losartan potassium, the amount of cyanide ion formed increased to a maximum at 45-60 min. The generation of cyanide ions was attributed to the formation of nitroso product by oxidizing action of sodium hypochlorite.

AB The object of this study was to remove the tetracycline (TC) residue in pharmaceutical wastewater after flocculation treatment. MnO2/graphene nanocomposite was synthesized by an in situ hydrothermal method and its TC removal rate was up to 99.4%. This nanocomposite had excellent water solubility. More importantly, the introduction of MnO2 nanorods allowed the avoidance of excessive stacking of treated graphene sheets during the adsorption process, which made the TC molecules to have more opportunities to make contact with the adsorbents. In order to eliminate the interference factors, the adsorption isotherm, kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism were all studied in TC aqueous solution. The influence of solution pH, contact time, MnO2 loading amount, temperature and solution concentration on the adsorption process were also assessed. The main adsorption mechanism contributed to the complexation of Mn(IV) and pi-pi interactions of the benzene ring structure on treated graphene sheets with TC molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4 graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized by chemical coprecipitation method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction. A simple, rapid, convenient and environmentally friendly method was developed for separation and pre-concentration of trace amounts of bisphenol A, naproxen and triclosan in wastewater samples by high performance liquid chromatography with magnetic Fe3O4 graphene oxide nanocomposite as the adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction. Various parameters possibly influencing the extraction performance such as amount of the adsorbent, extraction time, sample pH and elution conditions were optimized. Under the optimal working conditions, the developed method showed good linearity (R>0.9997) in the range of 1-200 mu g/L, and the limits of detection are between 0.5 and 0.8 mu g/L. The enrichment factors are in the range of 81-89. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, is 3.36-4.26%.

AB Hospital wastewater consists of various pharmaceutical compounds. If a proper treatment procedure is not considered, discharging these compounds into the environment can cause serious problems in the aqueous ecosystem, as well as those connected to humans wellbeing. This study aimed to remove ranitidine and cefixime trihydrate drugs simultaneously using adapted activated sludge in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and to monitor each drug degradation separately by means of statistical analysis using MATLAB 8.1 software. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand analyses were conducted; furthermore, the spectrophotometric spectrum of the solution was recorded as well. The partial least squares analytical method using MATLAB 8.1 software was utilized to analyze the results with the obtained R-2 value of 0.99 for both ranitidine and cefixime. 71.67% of ranitidine and 59.67% of cefixime trihydrate were removed during the biological treatment in the SBR.

AB Spent brewery grains, a by-product of the brewing process, were used as precursor ofbiocharsand activated carbons to be applied to the removal of pharmaceuticals from water.Biocharswere obtained by pyrolysis of the raw materials, while activated carbons were produced by adding a previous chemical activation step. The influence of using different precursors (from distinct fermentation processes), activating agents (potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and phosphoric acid), pyrolysis temperatures, and residence times was assessed. The adsorbents were physicochemically characterized and applied to the removal of the antiepileptic carbamazepine from water. Potassium hydroxide activation produced the materials with the most promising properties and adsorptive removals, with specific surface areas up to 1120 m(2)g(-1)and maximum adsorption capacities up to 190 +/- 27 mg g(-1)in ultrapure water. The adsorption capacity suffered a reduction of < 70% in wastewater, allowing to evaluate the impact of realistic matrices on the efficiency of the materials.

AB A tertiary treatment of effluent from a biological domestic wastewater treatment plant was tested by combining filtration and solar photocatalysis. Adsorption was carried out by a sequence of two column filters, the first one filled with granular activated carbon (GAC) and the second one with granulated nano-composite of micelle-montmorillonite mixed with sand (20:100, w/w). The applied solar advanced oxidation process was homogeneous photo-Fenton photocatalysis using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as oxidant agent. This combination of simple, robust, and low-cost technologies aimed to ensure water disinfection and emerging contaminants (ECs, mainly pharmaceuticals) removal. The filtration step showed good performances in removing dissolved organic matter and practically removing all bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis from the secondary treated water. Solar advanced oxidation processes were efficient in elimination of trace levels of ECs. The final effluent presented an improved sanitary level with acceptable chemical and biological characteristics for irrigation.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and pharmaceutical compounds (PhC) are xenobiotics present in many saline wastewaters. Although fungi are known for their ability to remove xenobiotics, the potential of halophilic fungi to degrade highly persistent pollutants was not yet investigated. The use of two halophilic fungi, Aspergillus sydowii and Aspergillus destruens, for the elimination of PAH and PhC at saline conditions was studied. In saline synthetic medium both fungi used benzo-alpha-pyrene and phenanthrene as sole carbon source and removed over 90% of both PAH, A. sydowii due to biodegradation and A. destruens to bioadsorption. They removed 100% of a mixture of fifteen PAH in saline biorefinery wastewater. Test using Cucumis sativus demonstrated that wastewater treated with the two fungi lowered considerably the phytotoxicity. This study is the first demonstration that ascomycetous halophilic fungi, in contrast to other fungi (and in particular basidiomycetes) can be used for mycotreatments under salinity conditions.

AB Adsorption studies of salicylic acid (SA) and 4-nitroaniline (4NA) from aqueous solutions were performed with magnetic biochar (MBC) in order to train students in analytical techniques such as standard calibration curves, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and chemical separations within the context of wastewater purification. Analysis of samples purified by MBC enhances student understanding of water quality and the importance of potable water production, a growing worldwide concern. MBC was prepared by iron oxide precipitation onto the biochar surface using an aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+ solution followed by NaOH treatment. MBC effectiveness in removing organic contaminants from water was evaluated using UV-vis spectroscopy, Beer's law, and a comparison to standard calibration curves while determining the concentrations of two contaminant compounds. The use of MBC to remove organic contaminants in water highlights the effectiveness of this technique for wastewater remediation and prompt discussion of water quality concerns with undergraduate students.

AB The present study investigated the feasibility of using modified attapulgites for the sorptive removal of beta-blocker propranolol. The attapulgites were modified by different reagents including hydrochloric acid, silane coupling agent and chotosan. And the modified attapulgites were characterized by N-2 sorption-desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, and X-ray diffraction technique. The as-made attapulgites were applied to removing propranolol from aqueous solution, and the effects of pH, ionic strength. sorbent dosage, and humic acid on sorption were investigated by batch experiments. The sorption capacity of the as-made attapulgites was compared with that of natural attapulgite, powdered activated carbon and other reported sorbent. The results suggested that the acid-activated attapulgite had a higher sorption capacity for propranolol than the other sorbents involved. The sorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms of propranolol onto acid-activated attapulgite were also studied. The sorption process followed the pseudo-second order equation and the sorption data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm equations. Both physisorption and chemisorption played important roles for propranolol sorption onto acid-activated ATP. Owing to its high sorption capacity and low cost, acid-activated attapulgite has potential value in the removal of propranolol from sewage and natural waters in engineering application.

AB Palygorskite-montmorillonite (PM) was studied as a potential sewage treatment effluent filter material for carbamazepine. Batch sorption experiments were conducted as a function of granule size (0.3-0.6, 1.7-2.0 and 2.8 mm) and different sewage effluent conditions (pH, ionic strength and temperature). Results showed PM had a mix of fibrous and plate-like morphologies. Sorption and desorption isotherms were fitted to the Freundlich model. Sorption is granule size-dependent and the medium granule size would be an appropriate size for optimizing both flow and carbamazepine retention. Highest and lowest sorption capacities corresponded to the smallest and the largest granule sizes, respectively. The lowest and the highest equilibrium aqueous (C-e) and sorbed (q(e)) carbamazepine concentrations were 0.4 mg L-1 and 4.5 mg L-1, and 0.6 mg kg(-1) and 411.8 mg kg(-1), respectively. Observed higher relative sorption at elevated concentrations with a Freundlich exponent greater than one, indicated cooperative sorption. The sorption-desorption hysteresis (isotherm non-singularity) indicated irreversible sorption. Higher sorption observed at higher rather than at lower ionic strength conditions is likely due to a salting-out effect. Negative free energy and the inverse sorption capacity-temperature relationship indicated the carbamazepine sorption process was favorable or spontaneous. Solution pH had little effect on sorption.

DT Article
AB Azoles are an important class of small molecules in pharmaceuticals and in pesticides which are found in surface water and effluents of wastewater treatment plants. With increasing research on novel characteristics of such compounds, they are considered emerging contaminants, thus, the efficiency of existing technologies for their treatment becomes an important matter. Peroxidases have proven to be effective in transformation of phenols and anilines via radical coupling. Here, the feasibility of oxidative polymerization of selected azoles with soybean peroxidase is demonstrated. The sensitivity of such treatment to the most important parameters, pH, enzyme activity and peroxide concentration, was investigated. Enzymatic treatment was shown to be effective with >= 70% transformation efficiency in all cases, with hydroxybenzotriazole having the highest efficiency among the substrates tested, thus providing a baseline for future study of real wastewater and environmental samples. Radical-coupling products after treatment were shown by mass spectrometry to be dimers and trimers and structures are proposed based on regiochemistry predicted from radical spin-density computations. Ionization energy and reduction potential of the compounds studied were also computed to look for a correlation with enzyme reactivity.

AB The increasing demand for fresh water has forced many countries to use reclaimed wastewater for agricultural purposes. This water contains pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that remain biologically active following passage through wastewater treatment plants. Run-off from farms and contaminated water from treatment facilities exposes aquatic ecosystems to PPCPs. This study examined the effects of PPCPs on a lower trophic organism. Culex quinquefasciatus larvae were reared in water contaminated with environmentally relevant concentrations of common PPCPs. Acetaminophen alone and a mixture of contaminants were found to increase developmental time of larvae. Susceptibility to Bti increased in larvae exposed to antibiotics, acetaminophen, or a mixture of PPCPs. Antibiotics, hormones, and the mixture altered the mosquito bacterial microbiome. Overall, the results indicate that at environmentally relevant concentrations, PPCPs in reclaimed water can have biologically important effects on an ecologically and medically important lower trophic level insect.

AB Purpose of Review In the presented review, we have summarized recent achievements on the use of immobilized oxidoreductases for biodegradation of hazardous organic pollutants including mainly dyes, pharmaceuticals, phenols, and bisphenols. In order to facilitate process optimization and achievement of high removal rates, effect of various process conditions on biodegradation has been highlighted and discussed. Recent Findings Current reports clearly show that immobilized oxidoreductases are capable of efficient conversion of organic pollutants, usually reaching over 90% of removal rate. Further, immobilized enzymes showed great recyclability potential, allowing their reuse in numerous of catalytic cycles. Collected data clearly indicates immobilized oxidoreductases as an efficient biocatalytic tools for removal of hazardous phenolic compounds, making them a promising option for future water purification. Data shows, however, that both immobilization and biodegradation conditions affect conversion efficiency; therefore, process optimization is required to achieve high removal rates. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated future trends and highlighted several issues that have to be solved in the near-future research, to facilitate large-scale application of the immobilized oxidoreductases in wastewater treatment.

AB Experiments with the ultraviolet (UV)/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) were conducted to investigate the abatement of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant effluent. The fluence and the starting concentration of H2O2 in a bench-scale batch reactor were varied according to response surface method (RSM) to examine their influence on the treatment efficiency. It was shown that the investigated AOP is very effective for the abatement of micropollutants with conversion rates typically higher than 90%. Empirical relationships between fluence, H2O2 dosage and the resulting concentration of micropollutants were established by RSM. By this means it was shown that X-ray-contrast media had been degraded only by UV light. Nevertheless, most substances were degraded by the combination of UV irradiation and H2O2. Based on RSM an optimisation of multiple responses was conducted to find the minimal fluence and H2O2 dosage that are needed to reach an efficient abatement of micropollutants.

AB The present study measured the occurrence, distribution, and bioaccumulation of fluoxetine in samples of water, polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), sediment, and caged freshwater mussels at stream sites near a municipal wastewater treatment facility effluent discharge. We assessed the relation of the environmental concentrations to reproductive endpoints in mussels in acute laboratory tests. Concentrations of fluoxetine in water and POCIS samples were similar (<20% difference) within each site and were greatest in the effluent channel (104-119 ng/L), and decreased at 50 m and 100 m downstream. Likewise, concentrations of fluoxetine in sediment and mussel (Elliptio complanata) tissue were greatest in the effluent channel (17.4 ng/g wet wt for sediment and 79.1 ng/g wet wt for mussels). In 96-h lab tests, fluoxetine significantly induced parturition of nonviable larvae from female E. complanata exposed to 300 mu g/L (p = 0.0118) and 3,0001 mu g/L (p < 0.0001) compared to controls. Fluoxetine exposure at 300 mu g/L (p= 0.0075) and 3,0001 mu g/L (p= 0.0001) also resulted in stimulation of lure display behavior in female Lampsilis fasciola and Lampsilis cardium, respectively. In male E. complanata, 3,000 mu g fluoxetine/L significantly induced release of spermatozeugmata during a 48-h exposure. These results suggest that fluoxetine accumulates in mussel tissue and has the potential to disrupt several aspects of reproduction in freshwater mussels, a faunal group recognized as one of the most imperiled in the world. Despite the disparity between measured environmental concentrations of fluoxetine and effects concentrations in our short-term tests with these long-lived animals, additional tests are warranted to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations and critical lifestages (e.g., juveniles).

AB Continuous input of pharmaceuticals into rivers, through wastewater treatment systems, may cause adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems of the receiving waterbodies, due to the intrinsic biological activity of these compounds. To investigate this issue, we have carried out an Environmental Risk Assessment in the lower part of the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). The survey was carried out along three campaigns in 7 sampling points, located in the main river and in one of its tributaries (Anoia River). In each sample, 29 commonly used pharmaceuticals, belonging to different therapeutical classes (analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), lipid regulators, psychiatric drugs, anti-histamines, anti-ulcer agents, antibiotics and beta-blockers) have been determined. Simultaneously, the macro invertebrate community status of the same points has been also studied.
   Hazard quotient indexes have been estimated for the most representative compounds as the ratio between concentrations and EC50 reported values, for three bioassays commonly used in environmental toxicology, namely, fish, Daphnia and algae.
   Hazard indexes are obtained for each sample by summing up the hazard quotients of all the compounds present, and taking its average along the three sampling campaigns. In general. hazard quotients tend to increase when going downstream. Only those points located most upstream of the two rivers can be qualified under low risk for the three bioassays. The most sensitive bioassay seems to be algae, followed by Daphnia and fish.
   Log-transformed hazard indexes show fairly good inverse correlations (r = -0.58 to -0.93, p < 0.05) with Shannon diversity indexes of macroinvertebrates, determined from both densities and biomasses. Best correlations are obtained for Daphnia based hazard indexes, as expected from its taxonomical proximity to macroinvertebrates. The abnormal correlation behaviour found in one point located in the Anoia River is explained by the presence of other previously reported pollutants of industrial origin. generated by the nearby existing industry.

AB The removal of 26 organic micropollutants (OMPs) in synthetic municipal wastewater was investigated via the process of aerobic sequential batch reactor (SBR) alone and SBR followed by nanofiltration (NF). SBR-NF performed better than SBR alone, ascribed to the contribution of NF: 1) complete biomass rejection resulted in diverse microbial community and much less fluctuated performance than SBR alone, and 2) direct OMPs rejection (74-98%) increased their retention time in SBR and thus overall removal via biodegradation/transformation and accumulation in SBR. Nine OMPs showed high biological removal (over 60%), 6 OMPs showed moderate biological removal (30-70%) and 10 OMPs showed low biological removal (below 40%). Most readily and moderately biodegradable OMPs contained strong electron donating group. Most refractory OMPs contained strong electron withdrawing group and/or halogen substitute. The batch addition of powdered activated carbon (100 mg/L) into SBR showed short term sorption performance for both OMPs and bulk organics.

AB In this study, fungal membrane bioreactor (FMBR) and semiconductor photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) were used in order to test the efficiency of integrated fungal biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation of textile wastewater from reactive washing processes. It was found that color removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction efficiencies were 88% and 53% for photocatalytic degradation, respectively. TiO2 and ZnO were tested as semiconductor catalysts in the PMR and TiO2 showed better efficiencies than ZnO for both color and COD removal. However, it was attained that color removal and COD reduction efficiencies were about 56% and 60% for fungal biodegradation using Phatterochaete chrysosporium, respectively. Moreover, integrated system in which photocatalytic degradation was employed as a post-treatment application after fungal biodegradation process achieved high removal efficiencies for color and COD removal as 93% and 99%, respectively.

AB This work determines the principal environmental pollution pathways of pharmaceuticals on the island of Mallorca (Spain). The evaluation was made on the basis of the quantification of pharmaceutical residues by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in several environmental water samples, including wastewater-treatment plant effluents, municipal solid waste landfill leachates, groundwater (GW), and marine water. An overall set of 19 pharmaceuticals has been identified in the environment of the 27 human pharmaceuticals investigated in this study. WWTP effluents are the main source of discharge of the pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment. The data indicate that reuse of treated domestic wastewater for irrigation (which supplies some 30 % of the total water demand in Mallorca) contributes to the contamination of GW. In addition, leaching from landfills is identified as another, but minor, possible source of introduction of pharmaceuticals to GW aquifers. Finally, WWTP effluents ending in the Mediterranean Sea, primarily highly urbanized coastal areas, cause pharmaceutical residues to occur in marine water bodies.

AB There are current concerns about the presence of persistent chemicals in recharge water used in soil aquifer treatment systems. Triclocarban (TCC) has been reported as a persistent, high production volume chemical with the potential to bioaccumulate in the environment. It is also known to have adverse effects such as toxicity and suspected endocrine disruption. This study was carried out to study the fate of TCC in soil aquifer treatment (SAT) through laboratory simulations in a soil column. The system performance was evaluated with regards to TCC influent concentration, sand (column) depth, and residence time. Results obtained confirmed the ability of SAT to reduce TCC concentrations in wastewater. Sorption and biodegradation were responsible for TCC removal, the latter mechanism however being unsustainable. The removal efficiency was found to be dependent on concentration and decreased over time and increased with column depth. Within the duration of the experimental run, TCC negatively impacted on treatment performance through a reduction in COD removals observed in the column.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter ecosystems, which causes changes to microbial community structure and development of resistant genes. Anaerobic treatments can be an alternative application for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters, which has high organic content. This study aims to develop an understanding of the effects of sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline (ETS), sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST), erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) and erythromycintetracycline (ET) combinations on the anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The results of this investigation revealed that bacteria have a competitive advantage over archaea under all antibiotic combinations. The ET reactor showed a better performance compared to other reactors; this could be due to antagonistic effects of sulfamethoxazole. Acute inhibition in the microbial community was also strongly affected by antibiotics concentrations. This indicated that the composition of the microbial community changed in association with anaerobic sequencing batch reactor performances. The results of this research support the idea that an acute test could be used to control and improve the anaerobic treatment system.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) are introduced into agricultural soils via irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW). Our data show that carbamazepine, lamotrigine, caffeine, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and sildenafil are persistent in soils when introduced via TWW. However, other PCs, namely diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and naproxen were not detected in soils when introduced via TWW. This is likely due to rapid degradation as confirmed in our microcosm studies where they exhibited half-lives (t(1/2)) between 0.2-9.5 days when soils were spiked at 50 ng/g soil and between 3 and 68 days when soils were spiked at 5000 ng/g soil. The degradation rate and extent of PCs observed in microcosm studies were similar in soils that had been previously irrigated with TWW or fresh water. This suggests that pre-exposure of the soils to PCs via irrigation with TWW does not enhance their biodegradation. This suggests that PCs are probably degraded in soils via co-metabolism.

AB This study examined the relationship between molecular properties and the fate of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in the aqueous and solid phases during wastewater treatment by MBR. A set of 29 TrOCs was selected to represent pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones, phytoestrogens, UV-filters and pesticides that occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater. Both adsorption and biodegradation/transformation were found responsible for the removal of TrOCs by MBR treatment. A connection between biodegradation and molecular structure could be observed while adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism for the hydrophobic (log D > 3.2) compounds. Highly hydrophobic (log D > 3.2) but readily biodegradable compounds did not accumulate in sludge. In contrast, recalcitrant compounds with a moderate hydrophobicity, such as carbamazepine, accumulated significantly in the solid phase. The results provide a framework to predict the removal and fate of TrOCs by MBR treatment. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater effluents due to its resistance to biodegradation-based conventional treatment. Advanced oxidation can efficiently degrade carbamazepine, but the toxicity and persistence of the oxidation products may be more relevant than the parent. This study sets out to determine whether the products of advanced oxidation of carbamazepine can be biotransformed and ultimately mineralized by developing a novel methodology to assess these sequential treatment processes. The methodology traces the transformation products of the C-14-labeled carbamazepine during UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation and subsequent biotransformation by mixed, undefined cultures using liquid scintillation counting and liquid chromatography with radioactivity, mass spectrometry, and UV detectors. The results show that the oxidation byproducts of carbamazepine containing a hydroxyl or carbonyl group can be fully mineralized by a mixed bacterial inoculum. A tertiary treatment approach that includes oxidation and biotransformation has the potential to synergistically mineralize persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB Home and personal care products (HPCPs) including biocides, benzotriazoles (BTs) and ultraviolet (UV) filters are widely used in our daily life. After use, they are discharged with domestic wastewater into the receiving environment. This study investigated the occurrence of 29 representative HPCPs, including biocides, BTs and UV filters, in the riverine environment of a rural region of South China where no wastewater treatment plants were present, and assessed their potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms. The results showed the detection of 11 biocides and 4 BTs in surface water, and 9 biocides, 3 BTs and 4 UV filters in sediment. In surface water, methylparaben (MeP), triclocarban (TCC), and triclosan (TCS) were detected at all sites with median concentrations of 9.23 ng/L, 2.64 ng/L and 5.39 ng/L, respectively. However, the highest median concentrations were found for clotrimazole (CLOT), 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (MBT) and carbendazim (CARB) at 55.6 ng/L, 33.7 ng/L and 13.8 ng/L, respectively. In sediment, TCC, TCS, and UV-326 were detected with their maximum concentrations up to 353 ng/g, 155 ng/g, and 133 ng/g, respectively. The concentrations for those detected HPCPs in surface water and sediment were generally lower in the upper reach (rural area) of Sha River than in the lower reach of Sha River with close proximity to Dongjiang River (Pt-test < 0.05), indicating other input sources of HPCPs in the lower reach. Biocides showed significantly higher levels in surface water in the wet season than in the dry and intermediate seasons. Preliminary risk assessment demonstrated that the majority of HPCPs monitored represented low risk in surface waters. There are potentially greater risks to aquatic organisms from the use of TCS and TCC in the wet season than in dry and intermediate seasons in surface waters. This preliminary assessment also indicates potential concerns associated with TCC, TCS, DEFT, CARB, and CLOT in sediments, although additional data should be generated to assess this fully. Thus future research is needed to investigate ecological effects of these HPCPs on benthic organisms in sediment of rural rivers receiving untreated wastewater discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB A multiresidue analytical method was developed for the determination of 9 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 19 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including acidic and neutral pharmaceuticals in water and soil samples using rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS). Solid phase extraction (SPE), and ultrasonic extraction combined with silica gel purification were applied as pretreatment methods for water and soil samples, respectively. The extracts of the EDCs and PPCPs in water and soil samples were then analyzed by RRLC-MS/MS in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode in three independent runs. The chromatographic mobile phases consisted of Milli-Q water and acetonitrile for EDCs and neutral pharmaceuticals, and Milli-Q water containing 0.01% acetic acid (v/v) and acetonitrile: methanol (1: 1, v/v) for acidic pharmaceuticals at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Most of the target compounds exhibited signal suppression due to matrix effects. Measures taken to reduce matrix effects included use of isotope-labeled internal standards, and application of matrix-match calibration curves in the RRLC-MS/MS analyses. The limits of quantitation ranged between 0.15 and 14.08 ng/L for water samples and between 0.06 and 10.64 ng/g for solid samples. The recoveries for the target analytes ranged from 62 to 208% in water samples and 43 to 177% in solid samples, with majority of the target compounds having recoveries ranging between 70-120%. Precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was obtained less than 7.6 and 20.5% for repeatability and reproducibility, respectively. The established method was successfully applied to the water and soil samples from four irrigated plots in Guangzhou. Six compounds namely bisphenol-A, 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, triclocarban, salicylic acid and clofibric acid were detected in the soils.

AB Recent studies conducted in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere indicate that low-level concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites may be widespread contaminants in our aquatic environment. The persistence of pharmaceutical contaminants has been attributed to (1) human consumption of drugs and subsequent discharges from sewage treatment plants, and (2) veterinary use of drugs and nonpoint discharges from agricultural runoff. Contamination of water resources by these compounds, particularly endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is emerging as an international environmental concern. The long-term effects of continuous, low-level exposure to PPCPs is not well understood. Preliminary data for raw water samples collected from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, are summarized. Three PPCP compounds (clofibric acid, naproxen, and estrone) were analyzed using solid-phase extraction, derivatization, and GC/MS. Batch experiments also were conducted to determine equilibrium capacity of activated carbon for clofibric acid. Preliminary results indicate the occurrence of the selected PPCP contaminants In raw water samples at or near method-detection limits. For batch equilibrium experiments, preliminary results indicate that activated carbon potentially can be used to remove clofibric acid from water. More research is needed to develop rapid and reliable methods for PPCP analysis and to determine the effectiveness of treatment processes for removal of PPCP contaminants in water.

AB Various pharmaceuticals have been detected in natural water and wastewater bodies, causing threats to water ecosystem and human health. Although electrochemical anodic-oxidation (EAO) has been shown to be efficient for pharmaceuticals degradation from aqueous solution, it still has a distinct need to apply EAO technology for pharmaceuticals removal rationally. This review provides the most recent progress on the mechanisms, influencing factors, and new technique of EAO for pharmaceuticals degradation. The mechanism and superiority of EAO were analyzed. Major influencing factors (e.g., electrode materials, electrochemical reactor, applied current density, anode-cathode distance, electrolyte type and concentration, initial solution pH value, and initial pharmaceuticals concentration) were discussed on the removal of pharmaceuticals. The latest development of reactive electrochemical membranes (REM) was regarded as an emerging EAO technique, and it was also highlighted. This work revealed that the EAO of pharmaceuticals has extraordinary application prospects in the field of water and wastewater treatment.

AB In order to assess the environmental impacts caused by flood to the paddy field, 940 semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were screened in paddy soil samples taken in central Vietnam before and after flooding. The concentration of 166 SVOCs in soil samples ranged from 0.031 to 2241 (mean 89.1) mu g kg(-1)dry wt. Chemicals originating from household sources showed the highest level, followed by chemicals originating from agriculture. Since untreated domestic wastewater used for agricultural irrigation, organic micro-pollutants in domestic wastewater is the main source of pollutants in paddy soil. However, contamination levels of pollutants in paddy soil after flooding were lower than those before flooding, possibly due to the removal of pollutants by floodwater. As a result, pollution characteristic of pollutants at sampling locations were different before flooding while they became similar after flooding due to the dispersion and elution of organic pollutants from soil into floodwaters.

AB Iron ions have been immobilized on TiO2/HNTs with poly-o-phenylenediamine and poly-m-phenylenediamine simultaneously by ion imprinting technology. The ion imprinting photocatalysts have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-VIS DRS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results demonstrated that there existed POPD and PMPD in photocatalysts. ICP-AES proved that there were iron ions in the samples compared to TiO2/HNTs. The photocatalytic activity of ion imprinting photocatalysts was studied by the degradation of tetracycline wastewater under visible light irradiation. The results showed that it was more conducive to polymerization of monomers at pH=3. The optimum mass ratio of OPD:MPD was 4:1, and the optimum value of iron ion was 0.01 g. The photodegradation rate of 40 mg L-1 tetracycline-simulated wastewater could reach 75.96%.

The occurrence of 78 pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutic classes was assessed in hospital effluents and WWTP wastewaters (influent and effluent) as well as the contribution of each hospital in WWTP influent in terms of pharmaceutical load. Results indicate that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in both hospital and urban wastewaters. The contribution of hospitals to the input of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewaters widely varies, according to their dimension. The estimated total mass loadings were 306 g d(-1) for the university hospital, 155 g d(-1) for the general one, 14 g d(-1) for the pediatric hospital and 1.5 g d(-1) for the maternity hospital, showing that the biggest hospitals have a greater contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, analysis of individual contributions of each therapeutic group showed that NSAIDs, analgesics and antibiotics are among the groups with the highest inputs.
   Removal efficiency can go from over 90% for pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to not removal for beta-blockers and salbutamol. Total mass load of pharmaceuticals into receiving surface waters was estimated between 5 and 14 g/d/1000 inhabitants.
   Finally, the environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals detected in hospital and WWTP effluents was assessed by means of hazard quotients toward different trophic levels (algae, daphnids and fish). Several pharmaceuticals present in the different matrices were identified as potentially hazardous to aquatic organisms, showing that especial attention should be paid to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin and clarithromycin, since their hazard quotients in WWTP effluent revealed that they could pose an ecotoxicological risk to algae.

AB Pharmaceuticals occurrence and environmental risk assessment were assessed in Portuguese surface waters, evaluating the impact of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and river flow rates. Twenty three pharmaceuticals from 6 therapeutic groups, including metabolites and 1 transformation product, were analysed in 72 samples collected from 20 different sites, upstream and downstream the selected WWTPs, in two different seasons. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy.
   Pharmaceuticals were detected in 27.8% of the samples. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-inflammatories and antibiotics presented the highest detection frequencies (27.8, 23.6 and 23.6%, respectively) and average concentrations (37.9, 36.1 and 33.5 ng L-1, respectively). When assessing the impact of WWTPs, an increase of 21.4% in the average concentrations was observed in the samples located downstream these facilities, when compared with the upstream samples.
   Increased detection frequencies and concentrations were observed at lower flow rates, both when comparing summer and winter campaigns and by evaluating the different rivers.
   Risk quotients (RQs) higher than one were found for two pharmaceuticals, concerning two trophic levels. However, since Iberian rivers are highly influenced by water scarcity, in drought periods, the flow rates in these rivers can decrease at least ten times from the lowest value observed in the sampling campaigns. In these conditions, RQs higher than 1 would be observed for 5 pharmaceuticals, additionally, all the detected pharmaceuticals (11) would present RQs higher than 0.1.
   These results emphasize that the river flow rate represents an important parameter influencing pharmaceuticals concentrations, highlighting the ecotoxicological pressure, especially due to water scarcity in drought periods. This should be a priority issue in the environmental policies for minimizing its impact in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical pre-treatment of synthetic Procaine Penicillin G (PPG) effluent with ozone (applied dose = 1440 mg/h; treatment duration = 60 min) at pH = 7 was investigated. Successive biological treatability studies were performed with raw, ozonated penicillin formulation effluent and synthetic readily biodegradable substrate as simulated domestic wastewater. The PPG effluent additions were adjusted to constitute approximately 30% of the total COD in the reactor. Ozonation of PPG effluent resulted in practically complete removal of the parent pollutant accompanied by 40% COD abatement. Speaking for the raw PPG effluent, prolonged acclimation periods were necessary to obtain significant COD removal efficiencies. Batch activated sludge treatment experiments and respirometric studies have demonstrated that the selection of true retention time is extremely crucial for having high amount of slowly hydrolysable substrate or complex wastewater, like pharmaceutical effluent. The effect of ozonation time on biological treatability performance of PPG has been evaluated in the study. Pre-ozonation of PPG effluent did not improve its ultimate biodegradability.

AB The discovery of various sartans, which are among the most used antihypertensive drugs in the world, is increasingly frequent not only in wastewater but also in surface water and, in some cases, even in drinking or groundwater. In this paper, the degradation pathway of olmesartan acid, one of the most used sartans, was investigated by simulating the chlorination process normally used in a wastewater treatment plant to reduce similar emerging pollutants. The structures of nine isolated degradation byproducts (DPs), eight of which were isolated for the first time, were separated via chromatography column and HPLC methods, identified by combining nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, and justified by a proposed mechanism of formation beginning from the parent drug. Ecotoxicity tests on olmesartan acid and its nine DPs showed that 50% of the investigated byproducts inhibited the target species Aliivibrio fischeri and Raphidocelis subcapitata, causing functional decreases of 18% and 53%, respectively.

AB The uncontrolled release of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals into the environment is a worldwide increasing problem. Thus, highly efficient treatment technologies for wastewater are urgently needed. In this work, seven kinds of typical antibiotics (including water and alcohol soluble ones) are successfully separated from the corresponding aqueous and ethanolic solutions using highly regular laminated membranes. Our membranes are assembled with 2-4 mu m titanium carbide nanosheets. The solvent permeance through such titanium carbide membrane is one order of magnitude higher than that through most polymeric nanofiltration membranes with similar antibiotics rejection. This high flux is due to the regular two-dimensional (2D) structure resulting from the large aspect ratio of titanium carbide nanosheets. Moreover, the electrostatic interaction between the surface terminations and the antibiotics also affects the rejection and enhances the antifouling property. Such 2D titanium carbide membranes further broaden the application scope of laminated materials for separation and purification of high value added drugs in academia and industry.

AB Lime amendment of biosolids can produce large quantities of hydroxyl ions and increase biosolids pH. The mobility of some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) is closely correlated with the pH of biosolids. In this study the mobility of six PPCPs: erythromycin, fluoxetine, carbamazepine, naproxen, gemfibrozil and triclosan, was measured in unamended and lime-amended biosolids over 63 days. Biosolids were equilibrated either a at pH range of 5.5-11.5 or cured over a time period up to 63 days. The mobility was calculated as the proportion of PPCPs associated with the soluble phase after a given equilibrium time or a curing period. In unamended biosolids the mobility of erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil and triclosan decreased, the mobility of naproxen increased and the mobility of carbamazepine was almost unchanged over 63 days of curing. Compared to unamended biosolids, lime addition increased the mobility of erythromycin and naproxen by 21.7% and 33.8% respectively, but suppressed the mobility of carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil and triclosan by up to 100% after 63 days. The pH influence on hydrophobicity and speciation of PPCPs correlated well with the mobility of erythromycin and fluoxetine, but only partially correlated with the mobility of the other 4 compounds over the pH of 5.5-11.5. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) and emission-excitation matrices (EEMs) provided spectroscopic evidences showing that the increases in amide and carboxylic groups, the decrease in polysaccharides, and the increases in humic substances in dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be responsible for the changes in the PPCPs' mobility. The effects of lime amendment lasted for approximately a month. The results of this work suggest that lime amendment prevents some PPCPs from being dissolved in biosolids soluble phases, but may not "lock" all PPCPs into biosolids. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study focuses on the degradation of pharmaceuticals from a municipal wastewater after secondary treatment by applying various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) like UVC, H2O2/UVC, anodic oxidation (AO), AO with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO-H2O2), AO-H2O2/UVC and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) using either UVC radiation (PEF-UVC) or UVA radiation (PEF-UVA). The municipal wastewater after secondary treatment was spiked with 5.0 mg L-1 of trimethoprim (TMP) antibiotic. The efficiency of processes to remove TMP followed the order UVC < AO-H2O2 < PEF-UVA << AO approximate to PEF-UVC < AO-H2O2/UVC < PEF-UVA (pH = 2.8) < H2O2/UVC approximate to PEF-UVC (pH = 2.8), using neutral pH, except when identified. While the UVC radiation alone led to a very low TMP removal, the H2O2/UVC process promoted a very high TMP degradation due to the production of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) by H2O2 cleavage. In the AO-H2O2/UVC process, the electrogeneration of H2O2 can avoid the risks associated with the transportation, storage and manipulation of this oxidant and, furthermore, (OH)-O-center dot at the anode surface are also formed. Nevertheless, low contents of H2O2 were detected mainly at the beginning of the reaction, leading to a lower initial reaction rate when compared with the H2O2/UVC system. In the PEF-UVC, the addition of iron at neutral pH led to the visible formation of insoluble iron oxides that can filter the light. At pH 2.8, the iron remained dissolved, thereby promoting the Fenton's-reaction and increasing the organics removal. The UVA-driven processes showed limited efficiency when compared with those using UVC light. For all processes with H2O2 electrogeneration, the active chlorine species can be scavenged by the H2O2, diminishing the efficiency of the processes. This can explain the lower efficiency of AO-H2O2 when compared with AO. Moreover, the degradation of the MWWTP effluent spiked with 18 pharmaceuticals in mu g L-1 during AO process was assessed as well as the influence of the following operational variables on the process efficiency: (i) H2O2 concentration on H2O2/UVC, (ii) current density on AO, AO-H2O2, AO-H2O2/UVC, PEF-UVC and PEF-UVA, and (iii) pH on PEF-UVA.

AB Magnetically separable catalysts with high solar photocatalytic ozonation activity were successfully synthesized. First maghemite and then titania (anatase) nanoparticles were deposited onto the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by co-precipitation and sol-gel methods. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption/desorption, TEM, XPS and VSM, and were applied for the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) existing in urban wastewater through photocatalytic ozonation. Ozone alone can completely remove a mixture of the four ECs in water, but the mineralization degree was very low (44.9%). Photocatalytic oxidation led to a higher level of mineralization (48.3% TOC removal) in the experimental conditions, but some intermediate products such as phenolic compounds and carboxylates which are toxic and difficult to degrade were generated during the photocatalytic oxidation process. Photocatalytic ozonation led to the highest removal efficiency for TOC (65.7%), which suggested a lower concentration of intermediate products accumulated during photocatalytic ozonation, the integration of ozonation and solar photocatalytic oxidation improved the mineralization efficiency.

AB The viability of treating high-concentration antibiotic wastewater by an anaerobic membrane bioreactor was studied using submerged flat sheet membrane. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time on the removal of cephalosporin derivative, viz. cephalexin, and the intermediates 7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and acyl group (phenyl acetic acid) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor with enhanced biodegradation using the bioaugmentation technique. The pharmaceutical industry is looking for alternatives to either direct disposal of 7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid and phenyl acetic acid, or further degradation and disposal, which will essentially require additional costs and maintenance. The present regulatory standard, implemented at a global level, does not allow for such disposal alternatives and hence the present study was aimed at the complete removal of the intermediates 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid prior to discharge.

AB The aim of this work is to prepare polypropylene (PP) membrane by embedding carboxylated(-COOH) and also polyethylene glycol(-PEG) functionalized nanodiamond to improve membrane hydrophilicity and decline membrane fouling in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Porosity, contact angle, mechanical strength, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and membrane pure water permeation analysis were performed for the characterization of the membranes. The membranes with 0.75 wt.% of nanoparticles introduced the highest water flux, porosity and mechanical strength. The performance of PP, PP/ND-COOH (0.75 wt.%) and PP/ND-PEG (0.75 wt.%) membranes was studied in a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). COD removal was more than 91% in all cases. It was found that antifouling characteristics, membrane resistance (R-m) and specific cake layer resistance (alpha) of nanocomposite membranes were better than of neat PP membrane. PP/ND-PEG (0.75 wt.%) membrane exposed highest hydrophilicity and maximum critical flux and anti-fouling characteristics. The results indicated that embedding nanodiamond in PP membrane can reduce membrane fouling in MBR.

AB Contamination of surface waters in underdeveloped countries is a great concern. Treated and untreated wastewaters have been discharged into rivers and streams, leading to possible waterborne infection outbreaks which may represent a significant dissemination mechanism of antibiotic resistance genes among pathogenic bacterial populations.
   The present study aims to determine the multi-drug resistance patterns among isolated and identified bacterial strains in a pharmaceutical wastewater effluent in north Tunisia. Fourteen isolates were obtained and seven of them were identified. These isolates belong to different genera namely, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Exiguobacterium, Delftia and Morganella. Susceptibility patterns of these isolates were studied toward commonly used antibiotics in Tunisia. All the identified isolates were found to have 100% susceptibility against colistin sulfate and 100% resistance against amoxicillin. Among the 11 antibiotics tested, six patterns of multi-drug resistance were obtained. The potential of the examined wastewater effluent in spreading multi-drug resistance and the associated public health implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The separate and combined in vitro toxic effects of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazole and trimethoprim) commonly found in urban wastewater effluents were assessed on the immune parameters of Elliptio complanata at environmentally relevant concentrations. The observed responses were then compared to those produced by the physicochemical-treated wastewater effluent of a major city before and after the removal of microorganisms. Most of the selected antibiotics, separately and as mixture, induced changes in immune responses. The removal of microorganisms and fine particles from the effluent increased or decreased the resulting immunotoxic effects, depending of the observed parameter. The immunotoxic effects of erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were closely associated to the antibiotic mixture and the filtered effluent. In conclusion, the data revealed that the removal of fine particles and microorganisms from municipal effluents can alter the toxic nature of the effluent that is closely associated with the cumulative effects of antibiotics.

AB The rapid increase in demand and development of industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals to sustain and improve quality of life worldwide have resulted in the contamination and high prevalence of these chemicals in air, water and soils, posing a potential threat to the environment. Pesticides are a common hazard around the world, as these chemicals are leaching into soils, groundwater and surface water and creating health concerns in many communities. The persistence of pesticides makes their removal and detoxification a more urgent undertaking. The toxicity or the contamination of pesticides can be reduced by the bioremediation process which involves the use of microbes or plants. Bioremediation technologies have been successfully employed in the field and are gaining more and more importance with increased acceptance of eco-friendly remediation solutions. Owing to complex nature of pesticides, more versatile and robust techniques need to be developed which can produce the desired result in a very cost-effective manner.

AB Alarming water pollution is toxic to the aquatic ecosystem leading to a sharp decline in species diversity. Diatoms have great potency to survive in contaminated water bodies, hence they can be compelling bioindicators to monitor the change in the environmental matrices effectively. Around the globe, researchers are intended to evaluate the impact of pollution on the diatoms recovery and techniques used for the assessment. The diatoms are precious for futuristic need viz. value-added products, energy generation, pharmaceuticals, and aquaculture feedstocks. All these applications led to a significant rise in diatoms research among the scientific community. This review presents different isolation practices, cultivation, and other challenges associated with the diatoms. A precise focus is given to diatoms isolation techniques from highly polluted water bodies with the main thrust towards obtaining an axenic culture to elucidate the significance of pure diatom cultures. Recovery of "jewels of the sea" from polluted water signifies the prospective ecological and economic aspects.

AB It is known that antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. In some countries the use is controlled, however few restrictions to their use are enforced in many countries. Antibiotics and their metabolites can reach the water bodies through sewage systems, especially in those countries with partial or absent wastewater treatment systems. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics has been linked with the increase of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The relation between the occurrence of antibiotics and resistance genes in surface waters has been widely studied worldwide evincing the great importance of this subject. In this work, a methodology for quantification of 40 antibiotics of 5 different classes, in river water, by SPE-LC-MS/MS was validated. Samples were taken during a two-year period from Diluvio River, a stream that crosses the city of Porto Alegre (RS - Brazil) and receives in nature domestic effluent. The methodology met the requirements of validation, with Limit of Quantification varying from 20 ng L-1 to 100 ng L-1. A total of 48 samples was analyzed for the presence of antibiotics for two years. From the 40 antibiotics analyzed, 8 of them(Azithromycin, Cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, norfloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were present in all sampling points in the range of <LOQ to 344 ng L-1. The occurrence of antibiotics resistance genes in the sampling points was determined using qPCR. Specific primers were utilized to detected resistance genes to the beta-lactam cephalexin (bla(TEM) gene), to the quilonones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (qnrS gene), to the macrolides azithromycin and clindamycin (ermB gene), and to the sulfonamides sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole (sulI gene), which were quantified the selected water samples. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed the presence of ARGs in all samples, with the highest concentration found for bla(TEM). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of fi-estradiol (E2) and alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) would need to be improved in order to comply with prospective Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) of 0.4 and 0.035 ng.L-1 respectively. The effluent concentration of a micropollutant in an activated sludge process is a function of the removal rate, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the flow pattern, which is usually overlooked. In order to better understand this aspect, we carried out tracer studies in eight WWTPs in the UK and found that relatively modest changes in aeration tanks would translate into tangible improvements in their flow pattern. We further evaluated the degradation rates for El (estrone), E2, E3 (estriol) and EE2 in each WWTP and we estimated that the modification of the flow pattern would be sufficient to place effluent concentrations of E2 (23.2 L.giA " d(-1)<kbio<210 L"gi,7s " d-1) far below the prospective EQS, while EE2 (0.3 L"gcts"d-1<kbia<2.9 L"gis"c1-1) would have to rely on river dilution for compliance. Regarding El and E3, with no prospective legislation, the modifications would place E3 (9.9 L"girils " id-1<kbio<39.5 L"gris"c1-1) effluent concentrations easily below its predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC = 60 ng.L-1) while for El, (2.6 L " gc,Is " d(-1)<kbio<19.2 L"Zis " c1-1) it would very much depend on the degradation rates of the specific WWTP (PNEC = 6 ng.1.-1). Improvement in flow pattern had the additional benefit of improving the effectiveness of other plausible changes in HRT or biological removal rates. Managing the flow pattern of existing WWTPs is a cost-efficient tool for managing the fate of estrogens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Urine diverting toilet; Nutrient recycling; Attitude and perceptions;
   Survey
ID SOURCE SEPARATION; HUMAN EXCRETA; TECHNOLOGY; NUTRIENT
AB Urine constitutes only about 1% of domestic sewage but contains 50% or more of the excreted nutrients and chemicals like hormones and pharmaceutical residues. Urine diverting toilet (UDT) systems can be considered a more sustainable alternative to wastewater management because they allow nutrient recycling, reduce water use, and allow source-separation of hormones and chemicals that can harm the environment. An online survey was conducted to determine whether UDTs are acceptable to the general public in Hawaii and if attitudes and perceptions towards it and human waste (HW) recycling vary with age, sex, level of education, religious affiliation, ethnicity, and employment status. The survey was also intended to detect possible drivers and barriers for the UDTs. Variations on variables were tested at 5% significance (p = 0.05) level (Chi-squared test or ANOVA) and considered significantly different if the p-value was less than 0.05. The results were encouraging as more than 60% are willing to pay extra for the UDT, while only 22% knew that such systems existed. No statistically significant difference was found between males and females on all survey questions at the 5% level. However, females had higher willingness to pay (WTP) than males and WTP increased with age and income. The WTP of Caucasians was higher than Asians and differed significantly. Some respondents expressed concern about the legal provisions for recycling of HW. The survey results indicate that with a public education program, it is possible that most people would be willing to adopt UDTs and HW recycling with incurred societal benefits of reduced water and fertilizer use, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and collection of micropollutants at the source to prevent their entry into waterways. Because of the small sample size (N = 132, 13% response rate) the survey is not representative but may be indicative of the general attitude of Hawaiian people. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals may enter soils due to the application of treated wastewater or biosolids. Their leakage from soils towards the groundwater, and their uptake by plants is largely controlled by sorption and degradation of those compounds in soils. Standard laboratory batch degradation and sorption experiments were performed using soil samples obtained from the top horizons of seven different soil types and 6 pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, irbesartan, fexofenadine, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole), which were applied either as single-solute solutions or as mixtures (not for sorption). The highest dissipation half-lives were observed for citalopram (average DT50, S for a single compound of 152 +/- 53.5 days) followed by carbamazepine (106.0 +/- 17.5 days), irbesartan (24.4 +/- 3.5 days), fexofenadine (23.5 +/- 20.9 days), clindamycin (10.8 +/- 4.2 days) and sulfamethoxazole (9.6 +/- 2.0 days). The simultaneous application of all compounds increased the half-lives (DT50,M) of all compounds (particularly carbamazepine, citalopram, fexofenadine and irbesartan), which is likely explained by the negative impact of antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin) on soil microbial community. However, this trend was not consistent in all soils. In several cases, the DT50, S values were even higher than the DT50, M values. Principal component analyses showed that while knowledge of basic soil properties determines grouping of soils according sorption behavior, knowledge of the microbial community structure could be used to group soils according to the dissipation behavior of tested compounds in these soils. The derived multiple linear regression models for estimating dissipation half-lives (DT50,S) for citalopram, clindamycin, fexofenadine, irbesartan and sulfamethoxazole always included at least one microbial factor (either amount of phosphorus in microbial biomass or microbial biomarkers derived from phospholipid fatty acids) that deceased half-lives (i.e., enhanced dissipations). Equations for citalopram, clindamycin, fexofenadine and sulfamethoxazole included the Freundlich sorption coefficient, which likely increased half-lives (i.e., prolonged dissipations).

AB Antibiotics used for human and veterinary purposes are released into the environment, resulting in potential adverse effects, including the development and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Here we investigated the dynamic fate of 36 antibiotics in a large river basin Dongjiang in South China, and discussed their potential antibiotic resistance selection risk. Based on the usage, excretion rate, wastewater treatment rate, human population and animal numbers the emissions of 36 frequently detected antibiotics were estimated for the Dongjiang River Basin. The total usage of the 36 antibiotics in the basin was 623.4 tons, which included 37% for human use and the rest for veterinary purposes. After being metabolized and partially treated, the amount of antibiotics excreted and released into the environment decreased to 267.6 tons. By allocating the high-precision antibiotic discharge inventory to 42 sewage plants and 17 livestock farms, an improved GREAT-ER (Geography referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for European Rivers) model for the Dongjiang River Basin, with a well calibration river flow network based on the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), was established to simulate the dynamic fate of 36 antibiotics. The simulation results showed that antibiotics contaminated >50% of the river sections. The modelled concentrations in water were almost within an order of magnitude of the measured concentrations. Antibiotic contamination in the dry season was obviously higher than that in the wet season. The concentrations of the antibiotics were always higher at the discharge zones and lower reaches of the river basin than the other reaches. The antibiotic resistance risk assessment showed that 23 out of the 36 antibiotics (nearly 65%) could pose high risks in the river basin. For those river reaches with high risks, the risk levels could mostly be reduced to low risk levels with a certain distance (15 km) from the pollution source. Therefore, more attention should be paid to those impact zones in term of antibiotic resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging are difficult to impossible to remove in wastewater treatment plants, and may enter groundwater production wells and hence municipal tap water via bank filtration. As anthropogenic gadolinium (Gd) may be accompanied by other, more harmful waste water-derived (micro) pollutants such as endocrine disruptors, we investigated the potential pathway of anthropogenic Gd into popular tap water-based beverages sold in highly frequented fast food restaurants. We, therefore, determined the concentration and distribution of geogenic and anthropogenic rare earth elements (REE) in tap water and in a related tap water-based popular soft drink (Coca Cola) from two fast food franchises (McDonalds and Burger King) in six major German cities. We observed anthropogenic Gd in both tap water and corresponding soft drinks in all investigated cities, extending the database for anthropogenic Gd in tap waters and highlighting its widespread distribution. In Berlin and Dusseldorf, where tap water is (mainly) produced by river bank filtration, 85 to 99% of the total Gd is of anthropogenic origin. The surprisingly high anthropogenic fraction (91%) in tap water from Munich reveals that even the shallow groundwater tapped in two Alpine valleys is eventually exposed to anthropogenic pollution. The REE distribution in post-mix soft drinks generally follows that of the corresponding tap water, except for enrichments of ytterbium (Yb), lutetium (Lu) and cerium (Ce), which are derived from the syrup. The concentration of anthropogenic Gd is similar in the soft drinks and in the corresponding tap water, demonstrating that the highly stable Gd-based contrast agents are not removed in soda fountains but are directly transferred to the beverages.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been found as contaminants in wastewater, causing concern for the health of aquatic life and humans. The anti-cholesterol medication bezafibrate is one such contaminant and is difficult to remove from wastewater. The lack of studies investigating the bonding behavior of bezafibrate with potential acceptor motifs prompted us to determine the types of molecules that would engage in intermolecular bonds with the drug. Although co-crystallization of bezafibrate has been previously attempted, we altered the approach by utilizing molecules containing only hydrogen-bond-acceptor sites. Here, we discuss the first successful co-crystallizations of bezafibrate, intermolecular bonding behavior, and solution-state binding studies with potential acceptor molecules. One acceptor, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, exhibits a shorter bond in the solid state, and a solution-state binding constant over 18 times higher than any other drug-acceptor pair studied here. These studies should aid in designing contaminant-removal materials that will effectively bond with the drug.

AB The present study evaluates the reduction of antibiotic COD from wastewater by combined coagulation and advanced oxidation processes (AOP(S)). The reduction of Azithromycin COD by combined coagulation and Fenton-like processes reached a maximum 96.9% at a reaction time of 30 min, dosage of ferric chloride 120 mg/L, dosages of Fe-0 and H(2)O(2)of 0.36mM/L and 0.38 mM/L, respectively. Also, 97.9% of Clarithromycin COD reduction, was achieved at a reaction time of 30 min, dosage of ferric chloride 120 mg/L, dosages of Fe-0 and H2O2 of 0.3 mM/L and 0.3mM/L, respectively. The results of kinetic studies were best fitted to the pseudo first order equation. The results showed a higher rate constant value for combined coagulation and Fenton-like processes [(k(ap) = 0.022 min(-1) and half-life time of 31.5 min for Azithromycin) and (k(ap) = 0.023 min(-1) and half-life time of 30.1 min for Clarithromycin)].

AB A heteropolyacid Zr(IV) tungstate-based cation exchanger has been synthesized. An amorphous sample, prepared at pH 1.2 and having a Na+ ion exchange capacity of 0.92 meq g(-1), was selected for further studies. Its physicochemical properties were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, and scanning electron studies. To understand the cation exchange behavior of the material, distribution coefficients (K-d) for metal ions in various solvent systems were determined. Some important binary separations of metal ions, namely Mg2+-Bi3+, Cd2+-Bi3+, Fe3+-Bi3+, Th4+-Bi3+, and Fe3+-Zn2+, were achieved on such columns. The practical utility of these separations was demonstrated by separating Fe3+ and Zn2+ ions quantitatively in commercial pharmaceutical formulation. The cation exchanger has been successfully applied also for the treatment of industrial wastewater and a synthetic mixture. All the results suggests that Zr(IV) tungstate has excellent potential for the removal of metals from aqueous systems using packed columns of this material.

AB The current study investigated the sorption of sulfadimethoxine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TET), and oxytetracycline (OTC) to Na-rich montmorillonite clay in synthetic effluent (SE) and field wastewater effluent (FE). Both SMT and SMX showed a low sorption capacity and are therefore likely to be highly mobile in the environment, while the sorption of TET to clay in environmental pH range (6.5-7.5) showed similarly high adsorption capacity. Differences in sorption capacities of TET and OTC to SE or FE were attributed to the various concentrations of divalent cations in the effluents. In addition, differences in sorption of OTC or TET to SE were attributed to their different molecular structure. Moreover, the adsorption of TET in SE and FE showed linear adsorption isotherms and fitted to Freundlich model. Further experiments showed that addition of humic acid or SE to TET sorbed to clay did not enhance or suppress the sorption of TET to clay.

AB Pharmaceuticals and household chemicals are important components of municipal sewage. Many of them are biologically active, disrupting not only hormonal regulation of aquatic animals but also, indirectly, disturbing their immunological protection. In the environment, chemicals rarely act as individual substances, but as elements of mixtures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to check whether the acute laboratory exposure of common carp juveniles to a mixture of ibuprofen, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol in increasing concentrations, modifies the levels of innate immunity (lysozyme, C-reactive protein) as well as general stress (metallothioneins, heat shock proteins HSP70) markers in brain, liver, gills, spleen and mucus. The levels of the markers were measured by an immunodetection technique. Not only do the pharmaceuticals and household chemicals impair immunological reactions of young carp in various tissues but also do that in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver, gills, spleen and mucus. This has a very important implication, since it may result in higher sensitivity of young fish to pathogens due to energy allocation to defence processes. The comparisons of the pattern of stress reactions in the studied organ samples indicated that mucus appeared to be a good, non-invasive material for monitoring of environmental state and fish conditions.

AB Antibiotics are commonly detected in the environment as contaminants. Exposure to antibiotics may induce antimicrobial-resistance, as well as the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in bacterial populations. We selected the resistance gene marA, mediating resistance to multiple antibiotics, and explored its distribution in sediment and water samples from surface and sewage treatment waters. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (fluoroquinolones), sulphamethoxazole (sulphonamide), erythromycin, clarythromycin, and spiramycin (macrolides), lincomycin (lincosamide), and oxytetracycline (tetracycline) were measured in the same samples to determine antibiotic contamination. Bacterial populations from environmental samples were challenged with antibiotics to identify resistant isolates. The gene marA was found in almost all environmental samples and was confirmed by PCR amplification in antibiotic-resistant colonies. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the majority of resistant isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Bacillus, not previously known to possess the regulator marA. We assayed the incidence of marA in environmental bacterial populations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus by quantitative real-time PCR in correlation with the levels of antibiotics. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the possible lateral acquisition of murA by Bacillus from Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae revealing a novel marA homolog in Bacillus. Quantitative PCR assays indicate that the frequency of this gene in antropised environments seems to be related to bacterial exposure to water-borne antibiotics.(C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as one of the reservoirs of antibiotics. Although nitrifying bacteria have been reported to be capable of degrading various antibiotics, there are very few studies investigating long-term effects of antibiotics on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria. In this study, cephalexin (CFX) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) were selected to assess chronic impacts on nitrifying sludge with stepwise increasing concentrations in two independent bioreactors. The results showed that CFX and SDZ at an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge, as evidenced by removal efficiencies of more than 88% and 85%, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) made a major contribution to the biodegradation of CFX and SDZ via cometabolism, compared to limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nitriteoxidizing bacteria. Chronic exposure to CFX (>= 30 mu g/L) could stimulate ammonium oxidation activity in terms of a significant enhancement of ammonium oxidation rate (p < 0.01). In contrast, the ammonium oxidation activity was inhibited due to exposure to 30 mu g/L SDZ (p < 0.01), then it recovered after long-term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 AWL SDZ. In addition, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of AOB decreased distinctly from 23.8% to 28.8% in the control phase (without CFX or SDZ) to 14.2% and 10.8% under exposure to 100 mu g/L CFX and SDZ, respectively. However, the expression level of amoA gene was up-regulated to overcome this adverse impact and maintain a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and antibiotics.

AB Concentration of the global population is increasingly occurring in megacities and other developing regions, where access to medicines is increasing more rapidly than waste management systems are implemented. Because freshwater and coastal systems are influenced by wastewater effluent discharges of differential quality, exposures in aquatic systems must be considered. Here, we performed a global scanning assessment of antihistamines(AHs), a common class of medicines, in surface waters and effluents. Antihistamines were identified, literature occurrence and ecotox-icology data on AHs collated, therapeutichazardvalues(THVs) calculated, and environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) of AHs compared to ecotoxicity thresholds and drug specific THVs to estimate hazards in surface waters and effluents. Literature searches of 62 different AHs in environmental matrices identified 111 unique occurrence publications of 24 specific AHs, largely from Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. However, the majority of surface water (63%) and effluent (85%) observations were from Europe and North America, which highlights relatively limited information from many regions, including developing countries and rapidly urbanizing are asin Africa, Latin America and Asia. Less than 10% of all observations were for estuarine or marine systems, though the majority of human populations reside close to coastal habitats. EED 5th and 95th centiles for all AHs were 2 and 212 ng/L in surface water, 5 and 1308 ng/L in effluent and 6 and 4287 ng/L in influent, respectively. Unfortunately, global hazards and risks of AHs to non-target species remain poorly understood. However, loratadine observations in surface waters exceeded a THV without an uncertainty factor 40% of the time, indicating future research is needed to understand aquatic toxicology, hazards and risks as sociated with this AH. This unique global scanning study further illustrates the utility of global asessments of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants to identify chemicals requiring toxicology study and regions where environmental monitoring, assessment and management efforts appear limited and necessary.

AB A wide variety of antibacterial compounds is rapidly oxidized by O-3 and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) during aqueous ozonation. Quantitative microbiological assays have been developed here or adapted from existing methods and utilized to measure the resulting changes in antibacterial potencies during O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot treatment of 13 antibacterial molecules (roxithromycin, azithromycin, tylosin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, penicillin G, cephalexin, sulfamethoxazole,trimethoprim, lincomycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and amikacin) from 9 structural classes (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, lincosamides, tetracyclines, glycopeptides, and aminoglycosides), as well as the biocide triclosan. Potency measurements were determined from dose-response relationships obtained by exposing Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis reference strains to treated samples of each antibacterial compound via broth micro- or macrodilution assays and related to the measured residual concentrations of parent antibacterial in each sample. Data obtained from these experiments show that O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot reactions lead in nearly all cases to stoichiometric elimination of antibacterial activity (i.e., loss of 1 mole equivalent of potency per mole of parent compound consumed). The beta-lactams penicillin G (PG) and cephalexin (CP) represent the only clear exceptions, as bioassay measurements indicate that biologically active products may be formed in the reactions of these two compounds with both O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot. The active product(s) generated in the direct reaction of O-3 with PG appear(s) to be recalcitrant to further transformation by O-3, though any biologically active products formed in the reactions of CP with O-3, or of either PG or CP with (OH)-O-center dot, are apparently deactivated by further reactions with O-3 or (OH)-O-center dot, respectively. Thus, with few exceptions, it can be expected that municipal wastewater ozonation will generally yield sufficient structural modification of antibacterial molecules to eliminate their antibacterial activities, whether oxidation results from selective reactions with O-3 or from relatively nonselective reactions with incidentally produced (OH)-O-center dot.

AB Human consumption of pharmaceuticals leads to high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, which is usually not or insufficiently collected and treated before release into freshwater ecosystems. There, pharmaceuticals may pose a threat to aquatic biota. Unfortunately, occurrence data of pharmaceuticals in freshwaters at the global scale is scarce and unevenly distributed, thus preventing the identification of hotspots, the prediction of the impact of Global Change (particularly streamflow and population changes) on their occurrence, and the design of appropriate mitigation actions. Here, we use diclofenac (DCL) as a typical pharmaceutical contaminant, and a global model of DCL chemical fate based on wastewater sanitation, population density and hydrology to estimate current concentrations in the river network, the impact of future changes in runoff and population, and potential mitigation actions in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Our model is calibrated against measurements available in the literature. We estimate that 2.74 +/- 0.63% of global river network length has DCL concentrations exceeding the proposed EU Watch list limit (100 ng L-1). Furthermore, many rivers downstream from highly populated areas show values beyond 1000 ng L-1, particularly those associated to megacities in Asia lacking sufficient wastewater treatment. This situation will worsen with Global Change, as streamflow changes and human population growth will increase the proportion of the river network above 100 ng L-1 up to 3.10 +/- 0.72%. Given this background, we assessed feasible source and end-of-pipe mitigation actions, including per capita consumption reduction through eco-directed sustainable prescribing (EDSP), the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 of halving the proportion of population without access to safely managed sanitation services, and improvement of wastewater treatment plants up to the Swiss standards. Among the considered end-of-pipe mitigation actions, implementation of SDG 6 was the most effective, reducing the proportion of the river network above 100 ng L-1 down to 2.95 +/- 0.68%. However, EDSP brought this proportion down to 2.80 +/- 0.64%. Overall, our findings indicate that the sole implementation of technological improvements will be insufficient to prevent the expected increase in pharmaceuticals concentration, and that technological solution need to be combined with source mitigation actions.

AB The aim of this work was to study the effect of tetracycline, which is on the growth, physiological characteristics, and contaminants removal by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results showed that the biomass and photosynthetic pigment concentration of C. reinhardtii exposed to tetracycline were lower than those of the control, while the superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activities, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, were higher than those of the control. Additionally, when the tetracycline concentration reached 0.25 mg/L, the removal of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased from 80.8 to 55.0%, 100 to 92.5%, and 36.5 to 11.5%, respectively. Thus, tetracycline concentrations of 0-0.25 mg/L are expected to have a significant effect on the growth and nutrient removal of C. reinhardtii in recycled water from wastewater treatment plants.

AB Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent; however, the effects of ibuprofen on aquatic organisms are poorly understood. This study presents the transcriptome-wide response of the inland silverside, Menidia beryllina, to chronic exposure to ibuprofen. At the lowest exposure concentration (0.0115 mg/L), we detected a downregulation of many genes involved in skeletal development, aerobic respiration, and immune function. At the highest exposure concentration (1.15 mg/L), we detected increased expression of regulatory genes in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway and several immune genes involved in an inflammatory response. Additionally, there was differential expression of genes involved in oxidative stress responses and a downregulation of genes involved in osmoregulation. This study provides useful information for monitoring the effects of this common wastewater effluent contaminant in the environment and for the generation of biomarkers of exposure to ibuprofen that may be transferable to other fish species.

AB Contaminants giving rise to emerging concern like pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) have been detected in wastewaters, as reported in the literature, but little is known about their (eco)toxicological effects and consequent human health impact. The present study aimed at overcoming this lack of information through the use of in silico methods integrated with traditional toxicological risk analysis. This is part of a pilot project involving the management of wastewater treatment plants in the Ledra River basin (Daly). We obtained data to work up a global risk assessment method combining the evaluations of health risks to humans and ecological receptors from chemical contaminants found in this specific area. The (eco)toxicological risk is expressed by a single numerical value, permitting the comparison of different sampling sites and the evaluation of future environmental and technical interventions.

AB The effects of elevated inorganic salt concentration on anaerobic membrane bioreactor ( AnMBR) treatment regarding basic biological performance and trace organic contaminant ( TrOC) removal were investigated. A set of 33 TrOCs were selected to represent pharmaceuticals, steroids, and pesticides in municipal wastewater. Results show potential adverse effects of increase in the bioreactor salinity to 15 g/L ( as NaCl) on the performance of AnMBR with respect to chemical oxygen demand removal, biogas production, and the removal of most hydrophilic TrOCs. Furthermore, a decrease in biomass production was observed as salinity in the bioreactor increased. The removal of most hydrophobic TrOCs was high and was not significantly affected by salinity build-up in the bioreactor. The accumulation of a few persistent TrOCs in the sludge phase was observed, but such accumulation did not vary significantly as salinity in the bioreactor increased.

AB The discharge of synthetic and natural steroid estrogens from municipal wastewaters to the aquatic environment has received increased attention because of their potential reproductive effects on fish. Using 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a representative steroid estrogen, several oxidants applied in wastewater treatment (chlorine, bromine, ozone, hydroxyl radical, chlorine dioxide, and ferrate) were shown to selectively and rapidly transform EE2. For typically applied oxidant doses, these transformations occur in the time range of seconds to minutes. The resulting initial transformation products of EE2 exhibit a substantially lower in vitro estrogenic activity (< 13% of EE2). For selected structural derivatives of EE2, a quantitative structure-activity relationship was established between substituents changed on the phenolic moiety and the relative in vitro estrogenic activity. In addition,the initial EE2 transformation products that still exhibit residual estrogenic activity are quickly further transformed by most of the tested oxidants. Therefore, oxidative wastewater treatment may serve as a powerful tool to remove estrogenic activity induced by steroid estrogens.

AB The removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) by a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with synthetic sewage was evaluated and moreover, compared with that by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated under same conditions in parallel. Eight kinds of typical EDCs, including 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynilestradiol (EE2), 4-octylphenol (4-OP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPnEO), were spiked into the feed. Their concentrations in influent, effluent and supernatant were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The overall estrogenecity was evaluated as 17 beta-estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ), determined via yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. E2, E3, BPA and 4-OP were well removed by both MBR and SBR, with removal rates more than 95% and no significant differences between the two reactors. However, with regard to the other four EDCs, of which the removal rates were lower, MBR performed better. Comparison between supernatant and effluent of the two reactors indicated that membrane separation of sludge and effluent, compared with sedimentation, can relatively improve elimination of target EDCs and total estrogenecity. By applying different solids retention times (SRTs) (5, 10, 20 and 40 d) to the MBR, 10 and 5 d were found to be the lower critical SRTs for efficient target EDCs and EEQ removal, respectively.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts have been shown to be effective at degrading a wide range of organic micropollutants during short-term batch experiments conducted under ideal laboratory solution conditions (e.g., deionized water). However, little research has been performed regarding longer-term photocatalyst performance in more complex matrices representative of contaminated water sources (e.g., wastewater effluent, groundwater). Here, a benchtop continuous-flow reactor was developed for the purpose of studying the activity, inhibition, and deactivation of immobilized TiO2 photocatalysts during water treatment applications. As a demonstration, degradation of four pharmaceutical micropollutants (iopromide, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine) was monitored in both a pH-buffered electrolyte solution and a biologically treated wastewater effluent (WWE) to study the effects of non-target constituents enriched in the latter matrix. Reactor performance was shown to be stable over 7 d when treating micropollutants in buffered electrolyte, with 7-d averaged k(obs) values (acetaminophen = 0.97 +/- 0.10 h(-1): carbamazepine = 0.50 +/- 0.04 h(-1); iopromide = 0.49 +/- 0.03 h(-1); sulfamethoxazole = 0.79 +/- 0.06 h(-1)) agreeing closely with measurements from short-term circulating batch reactions. When reactor influent was switched to WWE, treatment efficiencies decreased to varying degrees (acetaminophen = 40% decrease; carbamazepine = 60%; iopromide = 78%; sulfamethoxazole = 54%). A large fraction of the catalyst activity was recovered upon switching back to the buffered electrolyte influent after 4d. suggesting that much of the observed decrease resulted from reversible inhibition by non-target constituents (e.g., scavenging of photocatalyst-generated (OH)-O-center dot). However, there was also a portion of the decrease in activity that was not recovered, indicating WWE constituents also contributed to photocatalyst deactivation (acetaminophen = 6% deactivation; carbamazepine = 24%; iopromide = 16%; sulfamethoxazole = 25%). Experiments conducted using pretreated WWE and synthetic WWE mimic solutions indicated that both effluent organic matter and inorganic constituents in WWE contributed to the observed photocatalyst inhibition/deactivation. Analysis of immobilized TiO2 thin films after 4 d of continuous treatment of the WWE matrix indicated minor deterioration of the porous film and formation of surface precipitates enriched in Al and Ca. Results demonstrated the marked influence of non-target constituents present in complex matrices on long-term photocatalyst activity and highlighted the need for further study of this important issue to advance the development of practical photocatalytic water treatment technologies.

AB Sewage effluent ozonation can reduce concentrations of chemical pollutants including pharmaceutical residues. However, the formation of potentially toxic ozonation byproducts (OBPs) is a matter of concern. This study sought to elucidate toxicity mechanisms of ozonated carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug frequently detected in sewage effluents and surface water, in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to ozonated and non-ozonated CBZ from 3 h post-fertilization (hpf) until 144 hpf. Embryotoxicity endpoints (proportion of dead and malformed embryos) were assessed at 24, 48, and 144 hpf. Heart rate was recorded at 48 hpf. Exposure to ozonated CBZ gave rise to cardiovascular-related malformations and reduced heart rate. Moreover, embryo-larvae exposed to ozonated CBZ displayed a lack of swim bladder inflation. Hence, the expression patterns of CBZ target genes involved in cardiovascular and embryonal development were investigated through a stepwise gene co-expression analysis approach. Two co-expression networks and their upstream transcription regulators were identified, offering mechanistic explanations for the observed toxicity phenotypes. The study presents a novel application of gene co-expression analysis elucidating potential toxicity mechanisms of an ozonated pharmaceutical with environmental relevance. The resulting data was used to establish a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP). (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contaminants that are becoming detected in the environment but are not yet generally regulated or monitored are known collectively as emerging contaminants. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of 42 emerging organic compounds (EOCs) were investigated in the Yangtze River Estuary and adjacent East China Sea coastal areas. Study compounds were mainly pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, hormones and sterols, and also included two industrial endocrine disruptors. Samples were analyzed using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF) and,ultra-performance liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Results revealed that chloramphenicols, sulfonamides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the dominant compounds in filtered samples with relatively high concentrations and detection frequencies. EOC levels varied with location, with the highest concentrations being observed around rivers discharging into the estuary, and near sewage outfalls. Colloids that were separated by CFUF tended to be a sink for EOCs with up to 60% being colloid-associated in the water phase. In addition, colloidal properties, including hydrodynamic size, zeta-potential and organic carbon composition, were found to be the main factors controlling the association of EOCs with aquatic colloids. Moreover, these colloidal properties were all significantly related to salinity, indicating the critical role played by increasing salinity in EOCs-colloids interaction in an estuarine system.

AB N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is the active ingredient in many insect repellants against biting insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. It is one of the few micro-pollutants that are increasingly found in natural waters. The fact that DEET occurs in both influent and effluent of wastewater treatment works is indicative of its refractory nature. This work investigates the reactions of DEET with ozone, an oxidant that is becoming more common in treatments and disinfections of wastewater and drinking water. The transformation pathways were mapped, and a reaction model that accurately predicts the reactions was developed. The ozonation of DEET did not decrease the bioactivity of treated water, but instead resulted in a twofold increase in the microtoxicity. The findings suggest that the products of DEET ozonation has greater toxicity potentials compared to the parent compound posing a real hazard to human health and environment.

AB A countercurrent seepage bioreactor immobilized with Phanerochaete chrysosporium was continuously operated under non-sterile conditions to treat a synthetic wastewater spiked with naproxen and carbamazepine (1000 mu g/L each) for 165 days. There were no serious bacterial contaminations occurred during the operational period. Naproxen was always removed to the undetectable level regardless of the experimental conditions, while the average removal efficiency for carbamazepine, a well-known recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compound, reached around 80%. The excellent removal performance was mainly attributed to the application of countercurrent seepage mode and the cardhouse fabric of the carriers, which provided the high efficiency in the transfer of oxygen and nutrients inside the bioreactor. From the fungal immobilization combined with the temperature adjustment, the fungal activity including the enzyme production was protected as well as the bacterial contamination inside the reactor was suppressed effectively.

AB Two laboratory scale fully aerated continuous flow wastewater treatment systems were used to compare the removal of five benzotriazoles and one benzothiazole by suspended and attached growth biomass. The activated sludge system was operated under low organic loading conditions. The moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) system consisted of two serially connected reactors filled with K3-biocarriers. It was either operated under low or high organic loading conditions. Target compounds were removed partially and with different rates in tested systems. For MBBR, increased loading resulted in significantly lower biodegradation for 4 out of 6 examined compounds. Calculation of specific removal rates (normalized to biomass) revealed that attached biomass had higher biodegradation potential for target compounds comparing to suspended biomass. Clear differences in the biodegradation ability of attached biomass grown in different bioreactors of MBBR systems were also observed. Batch experiments showed that micropollutants biodegradation by both types of biomass is co-metabolic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the response of the microbial community from CWs microcosms tested for the removal of two veterinary antibiotics, enrofloxacin (ENR) and tetracycline (TET), from livestock industry wastewater. Three treatments were tested (control, ENR or TET (100 mu g L-1)) over 12 weeks in microcosms unplanted and planted with Phragmites australis. CWs removal efficiency was relatively stable along time, with removals higher than 98% for ENR and 94% for TET. In addition, CWs were able to reduce wastewater toxicity, independently of antibiotics presence. Despite no significant differences were observed in terms of microbial abundance, bacterial richness or diversity, analysis of similarities (two-way crossed ANOSIM) showed a significant effect of both time and treatments in bacterial community structure. This study points to CWs applicability for veterinary antibiotics removal from livestock wastewaters, showing that CWs microbial communities were able to adapt without significant changes in their diversity or depuration capacity.

ID SURFACE-WATER
AB A study has been conducted on a retention soil filter (RSF) to test its effectiveness in removing pharmaceutical residues and microorganisms from combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Efficient removal of solids, nutrients and heavy metals has already been proven. The possibility that organic micropollutants and microorganisms are also retained by the use of RSFs has been identified, but data are lacking. Results obtained in this study, in which testing for removal by a RSF of numerous micropollutant substances was performed, are most promising. The pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen are presented in detail as examples of such micropollutants. Both showed a reduction in positive samples of more than 55% as well as a significant reduction in median and maximum concentrations. For microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, coliphages and Giardia lamblia (cysts), an average reduction in concentrations by three logarithmic steps (99.9%) was achieved. These results add to the evidence that using a RSF in the advanced treatment of wastewater from CSOs reduces the exposure of watercourses to pharmaceutical residues and microbial contamination.

AB Sludge generated in waste water treatment process can be a major sink for some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The land application of sewage sludge (in the form of biosolids in the United States) can therefore potentially introduce PPCPs into the environment. After treatment, biosolids are often subjected to a storage period before land application. However, little information is available with regard to the fate of PPCPs in biosolids during the storage. In this work, the persistence of seven pharmaceuticals and one antibacterial was evaluated using ultrasonic extraction and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The impacts of aeration and sunlight exposure were investigated. During the experiment, no elimination was observed for carbamazepine, triclosan, and ciprofloxacin while elimination was found for tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. Using an availability-adjusted kinetic model, the 50% dissipation time was 37 to >77 d for tetracycline, 53 to >77 d for doxycycline, 1.0-1.6 d for clindamycin, 1.1-1.9 d for clarithromycin, and 7.0-17 d for erythromycin. Those compounds were found more persistent under anaerobic conditions than aerobic condition with a longer 50% dissipation time by a factor of 1.5-2. However, minor impact was observed from sunlight irradiation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing urbanisation in the future will put mounting stresses on the receiving environments around those urban centres due to increased sedimentation and contaminant runoff. Emerging contaminants (ECs) are an extensive array of chemicals and many are not under regulatory action. Within New Zealand likely future pressures from ECs will be in both urban centres and rural areas due to intensive agriculture, although at present there is a lack of information on the state of the environment in both sectors. This study was initiated to gauge the distribution of ECs in the urban environment by measuring concentrations of flame retardants, plasticisers, alkylphenols, herbicides and pesticides, steroid oestrogens, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in sediment from 13 estuarine sites around Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city. Total polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardant concentrations ((7)Sigma(PBDE)) ranged from 0.55 to 573 ng/g (dw). The phthalate plasticiser di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was measured at up to 11,500 ng/g from one site. Nonylphenol (NP) was found at up to 32,000 ng/g at one site adjacent to the city's major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). However, median concentrations of NP were 153 ng/g, suggesting this site was not representative of the region. Nonylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates (NPEO1,2) had highest concentrations (1600 ng/g) at a marina. Highest glyphosate concentrations (up to 950 ng/g) were observed at residential sites. Steroid oestrogens were detected at extremely low concentrations (maximum 22 ng/g), while all other pesticides or herbicides were not detected at any sites. Multi-residue analysis of 46 pharmaceuticals showed presence of 21 compounds at one or more sites, with average concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 7.66 ng/g. Generally, environmental concentrations of ECs were similar to those reported world-wide. However, comparisons for pharmaceuticals were problematic, due to very few studies on pharmaceutical concentrations in estuarine sediments, with most focussed on sewage and stream water phases.

AB Organic compounds such as sterols and hormones have been detected in surface waters at ecologically relevant concentrations with sources including effluent discharged from publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) as well as leachate and runoff from land amended with municipal sludge (biosolids). Greater than 20% of regulated effluents discharged into U.S. surface waters experience in-stream dilution of <10-fold and potential impacts are particularly likely in receiving waters dominated by POTW effluents. The increasing use of biosolids on agricultural land exerts additional stress, thereby necessitating environmental monitoring for potential ecological and human health effects. Alternatively or in addition to monitoring efforts, screening for potentially hazardous chemicals can be performed using empirical models that are scalable and can deliver results rapidly. The present study makes use of data from U.S. EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) to predict the aqueous-phase concentrations and removal efficiencies of 10 sterols (campesterol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, H-stigmastanol, cholesterol, desmosterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and ergosterol) as well as the putative toxicity posed by four specific hormones based on their reported biosolids concentrations using published empirical models. Model predictions indicate that removal efficiencies for sterols are uniformly high (similar to 99%) and closely match removal rates calculated from chemical monitoring at POTWs (paired t-test; p = 0.01). Results from toxicity modeling indicate that the hormones estrone, estradiol and estriol had the highest leaching potentials amongst the compounds considered here and that 17 beta-ethinylestradiol was found to pose a potentially significant threat to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) via run-off or leaching from biosolids-amended fields. This study exemplifies the use of in silico analysis to (i) identify potentially problematic organic compounds in biosolids, (ii) predict influent and effluent levels for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) of emerging concern, and (iii) provide initial estimates of runoff concentrations, in this case for four prominent hormones known to act as endocrine disruptors.

AB An analytical method for phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals and acidic pharmaceuticals in river water was developed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with negative chemical ionization (NCI) technique, and used for the determination of these compounds in the Pearl Rivers (Liuxi, Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers). Derivatization using pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (PFBOCl) and pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) before GC-MS analysis were applied and optimized for phenolic compounds and acidic compounds, respectively. The target compounds were analyzed for river waters from the upstream to downstream of the Pearl Rivers. Phenolic compounds 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol-A (BPA), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and triclosan (TCS) were detected at trace or low levels in the water samples from Liuxi River and Zhujiang River. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was not detected in the Pearl Rivers. The highest concentrations of the phenolic compounds were found in Shijing River, and they were 3150 ng/L for 4-t-OP, 11,300 ng/L for 4-NP, 1040 ng/L for BPA, 79 ng/L for El, 7.7 ng/L for E2 and 355 ng/L for TCS, respectively. only a few acidic pharmaceuticals were detected at low concentrations in water from Liuxi River and Zhujiang River, but the highest concentrations for the acidic pharmaceuticals were also found in Shijing River. The highest concentrations detected for clofibric acid, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, naproxen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac were 17 ng/L, 685 ng/L, 19.8 ng/L, 125 ng/L, 24.6 ng/l and 150 ng/L, respectively. The results suggest Liuxi and Zhujiang Rivers are only slightly contaminated and can be used as drinking water sources, but Shijing River is heavily polluted by the wastewater from nearby towns.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), represented by steroid hormones, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and bisphenol A have been determined in four sediment cores from the Gulf of Mexico, from New Orleans surface water (Lake Pontchartrain and Mississippi River), and from the influent and effluent of a New Orleans municipal sewage treatment plant. During the five-month monitoring of selected EDCs in the Mississippi River (MR) and Lake Pontchartrain (LP) in 2008, 21 of 29 OCPs in MR and 17 of 29 OCPs in LP were detected; bisphenol A was detected in all of the samples. Steroid hormones (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) were detected occasionally. Total EDC (OCPs + PCBs + steroid hormones + bisphenol A) concentrations in the two surface water samples were found to vary from 148 to 1112 ng L-1. Strong correlation of the distribution of total OCPs, total PCBs and total EDCs between solid and water phases was found in LP, while moderate or no correlation existed in MR. OCPs, PCBs, steroid hormones, and bisphenol A were all detected in the ocean sediments, and total EDCs were measured in the range of 77 to 1796 ng g(-1) dry sediment weight. The EDCs were also found in untreated and treated municipal sewage samples with a removal efficiency of 83% for OCPs but no removal efficiency for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol.

AB As a metabolite of lipid regulators, clofibric acid (CA) was investigated in this study for its ultraviolet (UV) degradation at monochromatic wavelength of 185 nm using Milli-Q water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. The effects of CA initial concentration, solution pH, humic acid (HA), nitrate and bicarbonate anions on CA degradation performances were evaluated. All CA degradation patterns well fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The results showed that -OH generated from water photolysis by UV185 irradiation was involved, resulting in indirect CA photolysis but contributed less to the whole CA removal when compared to the main direct photolysis process. Acid condition favored slightly to CA degradation and other constituents in solution, such as HA (5.0-100.0 mgL(-1)), nitrate and bicarbonate anions (1.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1 and 0.1 mol L-1), had negative effects on CA degradation. When using real STP effluent CA degradation could reach 97.4% (without filtration) and 99.3% (with filtration) after 1 hr irradiation, showing its potential mean in pharmaceuticals removal in UV disinfection unit. Mineralization tests showed that rapid chloride ion release happened, resulting in no chlorinated intermediates accumulation, and those non-chlorinated intermediate products could further be nearly completely degraded to CO2 and H2O after 6 hrs.

AB A wide variety of chemicals are used in pharmaceuticals. Most of these are already under thorough control for endocrine activity. The main causal agents recognized for endocrine disruption from sewage are substances used in medicine (sex hormones, glucocorticoids, and others), natural substances (estrone and 17beta-estradiol), and synthetic estrogens (e.g., 17alpha-ethinylestradiol). Similar substances are used in anabolic agents (growth hormones) in livestock production in some countries. Although the estimated use of anabolic agents in livestock production is approximately one order of magnitude below the natural release of estrogens from farm animals, their possible significance remains unanswered.
   At present, no other medical substances are recognized as endocrine disruptors in the environment. However, candidates may be identified on the basis of simple assumptions regarding their use and activity: (1) Nonestrogenic steroids may react with environmental endocrine receptors or metabolize on their way to the environment and thus form endocrine disruptors. (2) Many high-volume drugs released to the environment have not yet been tested for their endocrine properties, and some of these are known to interact with the human endocrine system. (3) Compared to medicinal substances, personal care products and additives in drugs are used in high amounts; from this group, parabens, siloxanes, and other substances are suspected of causing endocrine disruption in the environment.

AB Ketoprofen and diclofenac are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for similar indications, and both are frequently found in surface waters. Diclofenac affects organ histology and gene expression in fish at around 1 mu g/L. Here, we exposed rainbow trout to ketoprofen (1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) to investigate if this alternative causes less risk for pharmacological responses in fish. The bioconcentration factor from water to fish blood plasma was <0.05(4 for diclofenac based on previous studies). Ketoprofen only reached up to 0.6 parts per thousand of the human therapeutic plasma concentration, thus the probability of target-related effects was estimated to be fairly low. Accordingly, a comprehensive analysis of hepatic gene expression revealed no consistent responses. In some contrast, trout exposed to undiluted, treated sewage effluents bioconcentrated ketoprofen and other NSAIDs much more efficiently, according to a meta-analysis of recent studies. Neither of the setups is however an ideal representation of the field situation. If a controlled exposure system with a single chemical in pure water is a reasonable representation of the environment, then the use of ketoprofen is likely to pose a lower risk for wild fish than diclofenac, but if bioconcentration factors from effluent-exposed fish are applied, the risks may be more similar.

AB To tackle water micropollutant pollution, the development of an advanced wastewater treatment is necessary and should be supported by an environmental evaluation to guide decision-makers. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been applied in the literature for several technologies and highlighted the variability of results (e.g. site-specific conditions) and the limited (eco-)toxicity benefits compared to additional operating impacts. In this study, the LCA of an activated carbon (AC) adsorption process based on a fluidized bed (limiting AC usage) was performed to determine its optimal operating conditions (dosage, use of micro-grain -mu GAC or powder PAC) and environmental benefits compared to the common ozonation process. This study was based on pilot processes installed at the Seine Centre treatment plant (France), using sensitivity analyses to identify the conditions for choosing a technology. For the seven scenarios (fluidized bed with 10 and 20 mg/L, both for PAC and mu GAC; ozonation with 0.6 and 0.9 gO(3)/gDOC; and pre-ozonation combined with mu GAC), the operational impacts generated (energy and material use) and the impacts avoided (micropollutant removal) were evaluated for climate change, freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity (USEtox characterization factors for micropollutants complemented with literature data). The LCA results showed that the fluidized bed process should preferably be operated with mu GAC rather than PAC. The advantage of mu GAC adsorption compared to ozonation is negligible but could nevertheless be significant in European countries with a significant share of coal based electricity (i.e. all countries except Sweden and France). As in most of the previous works, the (eco)toxicity impacts avoided were found to be negligible, but other substances, such as hormones and oxidation by-products, should be further considered and characterized to better represent the treatment performances. The combination of ozonation and mu GAC adsorption on a fluidized bed is a promising option to efficiently remove micropollutants, as well as oxidation by-products, while keeping the impacts generated within a reasonable range. This paper presented valuable results to support the eco-design of advanced wastewater treatment (both in terms of operating conditions and targeted substances) but should be complemented with large-scale evaluations (e.g. using consequential LCA) and better impact characterization of micropollutants.

AB Background, aim, and scope The presence of a variety of pollutants in the aquatic environment that can potentially interfere with the production of sex steroid hormones in wildlife and humans has been of increasing concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of extracts from Hong Kong marine waters, and influents and effluents from wastewater treatment plants on steroidogenesis using the H295R cell bioassay. After exposing H295R cells to extracts of water, the expression of four steroidogenic genes and the production of three steroid hormones were measured. Materials and methods Water samples were collected during the summer of 2005 from 24 coastal marine areas and from the influents and effluents of two major waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in Hong Kong, China. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE). H295R cells were exposed for 48 h to dilutions of these extracts. Modulations of the expression of the steroidogenic genes CYP19, CYP17, 3 beta HSD2, and CYP11 beta 2 were determined by measuring mRNA concentrations by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). Production of the hormones progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) was quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
   Results Extracts from samples collected in two fish culture areas inhibited growth and proliferation of H295R cells at concentrations greater or equal to 10(5) L equivalents. The cells were exposed to the equivalent concentration of active substances in 10,000 L of water. Thus, to observe the same level of effect as observed in vitro on aquatic organisms would require a bioaccumulation factor of this same magnitude. None of the other 22 marine samples affected growth of the cells at any dilution tested. Twelve of the marine water samples completely inhibited the expression of CYP19 without affecting E2 production; inhibition of CYP17 expression was observed only in one of the samples while expression of CYP11 beta 2 was induced as much as five- and ninefold after exposure of cells to extracts from two locations. The expression of the progesterone gene 3 beta HSD2 was not affected by any of the samples; only one sample induced approximately fourfold the production of E2. Although more than twofold inductions were observed for P and T production, none of these values were statistically significant to conclude effects on the production of these two hormones. While influents from WWTPs did not affect gene expression, an approximately 30% inhibition in the production of E2 and a 40% increase in P occurred for the exposure with influents from the Sha Tin and Stonecutters WWTPs, respectively. Effluents from WWTPs did not affect the production of any of the studied hormones, but a decrement in the expression of the aldosterone gene CYP11 beta 2 was observed for the Sha Tin WWTP exposure. No direct correlation could be established between gene expression and hormone production.
   Discussion Observed cytotoxicity in the two samples from fish culture areas suggest the presence of toxic compounds; chemical analysis is required for their full identification. Although effluents from WWTPs did not affect hormone production, other types of endocrine activity such as receptor-mediated effects cannot be ruled out. Interactions due to the complexity of the samples and alternative steroidogenic pathways might explain the lack of correlation between gene expression and hormone production results.
   Conclusions Changes observed in gene expression and hormone production suggest the presence in Hong Kong coastal waters of pollutants with endocrine disruption potential and others of significant toxic effects. The aromatase and aldosterone genes seem to be the most affected by the exposures, while E2 and P are the hormones with more significant changes observed. Results also suggest effectiveness in the removing of compounds with endocrine activity by the WWTPs studied, as effluent samples did not significantly affect hormone production. The H295R cell showed to be a valuable toll in the battery required for the analysis of endocrine disrupting activities of complex environmental samples.
   Recommendations and perspectives Due to the intrinsic complexity of environmental samples, a combination of analytical tools is required to realistically assess environmental conditions, especially in aquatic systems. In the evaluation of endocrine disrupting activities, the H295R cell bioassay should be used in combination with other genomic, biological, chemical, and hydrological tests to establish viable modes for endocrine disruption and identify compounds responsible for the observed effects.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter aquatic environments via sewage treatment facilities and their potentially toxic effects oil biota, particularly aquatic organisms, are of considerable concern. In this Study, we investigated the acute toxicity of selected PPCPs on a freshwater crustacean (Thamnocephalus platyurus) and a fish species (Oryzias latipes). The 24-hr median lethal concentration (LC50) values of ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, indometacin, carbamazepine, propranolol, ifenprodil, clarithromycin and triclosan for T. platyurus were estimated to be 19.59, 3.95, 16.14, > 100, 10.31, 4.43, 94.23 and 0.47 mg/l respectively. Conversely, the 96-hr LC50 values for these PPCPs were estimated at > 100, 8.04, 81.92, 45.87, 11.40, 8.71, > 100 and 0.60 mg/l for O. latipes, respectively. The toxic sensitivity of T platyurus to these PPCPs, except for carbamazepine, was therefore higher than for O. latipes. No acute toxicity effects were associated with PPCPs, such as atenolol, disopyramide, famotidine, fluconazole, erythromycin and levofloxacin, in the two aquatic organisms at the concentrations tested ill this Study (> 100 mg/l). These findings may help us to understand the potential biological effects and risks associated with PPCP exposure in aquatic organisms. Further long-term studies are required to fully assess the growth and reproduction of these compounds on aquatic biota.

AB To encourage the reutilization of treated wastewaters as an adaptation strategy to climate change it is necessary to demonstrate their quality. If this is ensured, reclaimed waters could be a valuable resource that produces very little environmental impact and risks to human health. However, wastewaters are one of the main sources of emerging pollutants that are discharged in the environment. For this, it is essential to assess the presence of these pollutants, especially pharmaceutical compounds, in treated wastewaters. Moreover, the different treatment processes must be evaluated in order to know if conventional and natural treatment technologies are efficient in the removal of these types of compounds. This is an important consideration if the treated wastewaters are used in agricultural activities. Owing to the complexity of wastewater matrixes and the low concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in these types of samples, it is necessary to use sensitive analytical methodologies. In this study, the presence of 11 pharmaceutical compounds were assessed in three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gran Canaria (Spain). Two of these WWTPs use conventional purification technologies and they are located in densely populated areas, while the other studied WWTP is based in constructed wetlands which purify the wastewaters of a rural area. The sampling was performed monthly for two years. A solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was applied for the analysis of the samples, and the 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in all the studied WWTPs. The concentrations were variable and ranged from ngL(-1) in some compounds like diclofenac or carbamazepine to mu gL(-1) in common pharmaceutical compounds such as caffeine, naproxen or ibuprofen. In addition, removal efficiencies in both conventional and natural purification systems were evaluated. Similar removal efficiencies were obtained using different purifying treatments, especially for some pharmaceutical families as stimulants or anti-inflammatories. Other compounds like carbamazepine showed a recalcitrant behavior. Secondary treatments presented similar removal efficiencies in both conventional and natural wastewater treatment plants, but conventional treatments showed slightly higher elimination ratios. Regarding tertiary system, the treatment with highest removal efficiencies was reverse osmosis in comparison with microfiltration and electrodialysis reversal.

AB A screening-level risk assessment of biosolids-borne PPCPs in agricultural scenarios was developed in this work. While several of these compounds are efficiently removed in sewage treatment plants (STPs), others are recalcitrant to degradation and can be found in sludge at significant levels. As the rate of biosolids reuse for fertilising and/or amendment purposes is increasing, it is necessary to evaluate the fate in soil and possible biotransfer of this type of pollutants in the long-term. The study includes six compounds that were selected considering data availability, presence in sludge and persistence. Due to the scarce data still present in literature, a probabilistic assessment to address uncertainty was developed. A 95th percentile of the hazard index (HI) exceeding 1 was obtained, with main contributions of triclosan and carbamazepine. Although these estimates were obtained under a worst-case approach, and that they can vary depending on scenario characteristics, they change the least-concern classification associated to the presence of PPCPs in biosolids. A sensitivity analysis indicates the high influence of application rate and sludge concentration level on the results. Thus, the importance of developing new strategies of removal in advanced STPs and the establishment of a specific biosolids reuse regulation including this type of compounds acquires an added significance.

AB Caffeine has already been used as an indicator of anthropogenic impacts, especially the ones related to the disposal of sewage in water bodies. In this work, the presence of caffeine has been correlated with the estrogenic activity of water samples measured using the BLYES assay. After testing 96 surface water samples, it was concluded that caffeine can be used to prioritize samples to be tested for estrogenic activity in water quality programs evaluating emerging contaminants with endocrine disruptor activity.

AB The present study demonstrates the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water from the Mankyung River, South Korea. Samples collected at 5 Sites along the Mankyung River were assayed using a liquid chromatograph coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) for 13 PPCPs. Overall, I I out of the 13 selected PPCPs, which span a range of therapeutic classes and one personal care product, were detected in surface water samples collected from the Mankyung River. The most prevalent contaminants were ibuprofen, with average concentrations ranging from not detected (ND) to 414 ng/l, followed by carbamazepine (ND-595 ng/l), atenolol (ND-690 ng/l), clarithromycin (ND-443 ng/l), mefenamic acid (ND-326 ng/l), erythromycin (ND-137 ng/l) fluconazole (ND-111 ng/l), levofloxacin (ND-87.4 ng/l), indomethacin (ND-33.5 ng/l), propranolol (ND-40.1 ng/l). ifenprodil (ND-35.4 ng/l), disopyramide (ND) and triclosan (ND). PPCP concentrations were highest in surface water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP), implying possibly insufficient removal efficiency of the PPCPs in the STP. Contamination by PPCPs such as ibuprofen, carbamazepine, atenolol, mefenamic acid and clarithromycin was high in the Mankyung River compared to concentrations in other countries.

AB BACKGROUND: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibiotic largely used to treat bacterial infections and found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. Zero valent iron (ZVI, Fe2+) technology has great potential for the degradation of residual pharmaceuticals. The effect of some parameters (anaerobic/aerobic, particle size, iron ligands and anions) were evaluated for CIP degradation in distilled water (DW) and finally compared to that obtained in STP effluent.
   RESULTS: The smaller ZVI particle (200 mesh) resulted in a lower degradation rate than the larger particle (20 mesh) in both anaerobic and aerobic treatment. This is due mainly to the fast generation of Fe2+, hindering the degradation process due to (OH)-O-center dot scavenging. A linear increase of CIP degradation ratewas observed when the reactionwas carried out with increasing EDTA concentrations. The Cl- anions had a positive effect on CIP degradation in the ZVI process. On the other hand, the presence of NO3- resulted in a decrease of degradation rate, both with 20 and 200 mesh particles. CIP could be degraded in two STP effluents mediated by ZVI (20 mesh).
   CONCLUSIONS: The ZVI process can be used efficiently for the degradation of CIP in two types of STP effluent (anaerobic treatment or anaerobic/aerobic treatment), revealing a possible applicability of the ZVI process to this type of matrix. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Natural estrogens, such as 17 beta-estradiol (E2), are the main substances responsible for estrogenic activity found in domestic sewage. In the work described herein, the degradation of E2 has been investigated by single ozonation and catalytic ozonation in the presence of manganese ion (Mn2+) and oxalic acid. The presence of Mn2+ and oxalic acid in the ozonation processes significantly improved the E2 degradation and, hence, the reduction of estrogenic activity in aqueous solution. The addition of Mn2+ and oxalic acid produced many more hydroxyl radicals in the catalytic ozonation system than in the single ozonation system. Oxidation products formed during ozonation of E2 have been identified by means of gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), on the basis of which a possible reaction pathway for E2 degradation by ozonation is proposed. E2 was first oxidized to hydroxyl-semiquinone isomers, and these were subsequently degraded to low molecular weight compounds such as oxalic acid and malonic acid. The latter were easily oxidized by ozone to form carbon dioxide (CO2). The results demonstrate that the ozonationMn2+oxalic acid system may serve as a powerful tool for removing E2, and the addition of Mn2+ and oxalic acid is favourable for the complete removal of estrogenic activity induced by steroid estrogens in aqueous solution.

AB This study considers the implications and research needs arising from anticancer (also referred to as antineoplastic) drugs being released into the aquatic environment, for the entire therapeutic classes used: cytotoxic, cytostatic and endocrine therapy drugs.
   A categorization approach, based on French consumption amounts, allowed to highlight parent molecules and several metabolites on which further occurrence and ecotoxicological studies should be conducted.
   Investigations of consumption trends at a national and a local scale show an increase in the use of anticancer drugs between 2004 and 2008, thus leading to increased levels released in the environment. It therefore appears necessary to continue surveying their presence in surface waters and in wastewater treatment plant (WWIP)) effluents.
   Furthermore, due to the rise of anticancer home treatments, most of the prescribed molecules are now available in town pharmacies. Consequently, hospital effluents are no longer the main expected entry route of anticancer drugs into the aquatic environment.
   Concerning ecotoxicological risks, current knowledge remains insufficient to support a definitive conclusion. Risk posed by cytotoxic molecules is still not well documented and it is not possible to conclude on their long-term effects on non-target organisms. To date, ecotoxicological effects have been assessed using standardized or in vitro assays. Such tests however may not be suitable for anticancer drugs, and further work should focus on full-life cycle or even multigenerational tests.
   Environmental significance (i.e. occurrence and effects) of cytostatics (protein kinases inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies), if any, is not documented. Protein kinases inhibitors, in particular, deserve further investigation due to their universal mode of action.
   Finally, concerning endocrine therapy drugs, molecules such as antiestrogen Tamoxifen and its active metabolites. could be of concern.
   Overall, to accurately assess the ecotoxicological risk of anticancer drugs, we discuss the need to break away from tests on isolated molecules and to test effects of mixtures at the low ng.l(-1) range. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hormones in water samples have been classified as 'emerging pollutants' and may pose a potential risk for humans. Hormones can be found in both surface and ground water at low concentrations. These compounds enter water streams through wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and may elicit endocrine disruption to organisms. As a result of the low concentrations, a suitable analytical methodology is essential for their determination. In the past, residues of oestrogens in aqueous and solid environmental samples have commonly been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with mass spectrometry (MS). However, the necessary derivatisation steps are not only time consuming and laborious but also tedious. The first part of this case study was to develop a method to determine trace concentrations of the estrone (E1), 17 alpha-estradiol (E2 alpha), 17-beta-estradiol (E2 beta) and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormones using reverse phase ultra-fast liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UFLC). Using the developed method, the second part of the case study was to determine the concentrations of the hormones in raw and treated potable water samples from the Vaal River catchment area in the south of Johannesburg, South Africa. Analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE C-18 sorbent) cartridges and subsequently injected into ultra-fast liquid chromatography with the reverse phase column coupled to mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS) for analyte determinations. The limits of quantification were in the range of 0.24 to 0.32 ng center dot L-1 for the analytes. Accuracy was 95.6, 93.8, 97.6 and 100.9% for EE2, E2a, E2 beta and E1, respectively. In raw water samples taken during the rainy wet season, estrone was detected at concentrations of 0.90 and 4.43 ng center dot L-1. However, treated potable water samples did not contain detectable levels of hormones. This is potentially due to the ability of a water treatment process to remove endocrine disruptors during water purification.

AB All pharmaceuticals are separated chromatographically using the liquid chromatography time of flight/mass spectrometry (LC-ToF/MS) on a 5 mu m, 2.1 mm x 250 mm, C18 column at 0.3 mL/min. The recovery is investigated at two spiking levels, 10 and 1 ng/mL; the mean recovery is higher than 77, 84, and 93% in sewage treatment plants (STP) influent, STP effluent, and surface water, respectively. The limit of quantification (LOQ) averages 29, 16, 7, and 2 ng/L in STP influent, STP effluent, surface water, and drinking water, respectively. The matrix effect is also evaluated in STP influent and effluent. It is observed that sulfamethoxazole, prednisolone, ketoprofen, and glibenclamide are highly impacted compared to other compounds, -99, -110, 77, and 91%, respectively. The results show that six out of nine pharmaceuticals, namely atenolol, acetaminophen, theophylline, caffeine, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole are detected in STP influent, STP effluent, and surface water. However, the means of concentration are 561, 3305, 1805, 3900, 78, and 308 ng/L for atenolol, acetaminophen, theophylline, caffeine, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, in STP influent. Caffeine and acetaminophen are detected with the highest concentration, reaching up to 8700 and 4919 ng/L, respectively, in STP influent.

AB One of the key questions arising from the presence of micro-pollutants in surface-, ground-, and drinking water is whether they pose a risk to human and ecosystem health In our laboratories we. have identified a number of biological effects by several pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) on human, animal and/or plant cells at different levels of biological organisation. In part, these effects occur at concentrations even below those reported in drinking water. Even though it is often still difficult to fully deduce the role of some of these effects on the whole organism or population level as well as after chronic exposure, the effects observed illustrate that the input of micro-pollutants into the environment must be avoided or as far as possible reduced. Much effort has already been devoted to improved treatment of sewage and raw drinking water. A comprehensive protection from aquatic micro-pollutants, however, cannot reside in water treatment technology alone. instead, all components of the life cycle of these chemicals must be put to the table to turn around the current trend of increasing environmental loads. The goal of this report is to illustrate why a more comprehensive way of risk assessment is needed and what this should include.

AB The "Fish Plasma Model" has been proposed for prioritizing pharmaceuticals for in-depth environmental risk assessment efforts. The model compares estimated drug concentrations in fish plasma with human therapeutic plasma concentrations in order to assess the risk for a pharmacological interaction in the fish. In this study the equation used to estimate bioconcentration from water to fish blood plasma was field-tested by exposing rainbow trout in situ to sewage effluents from three treatment plants. Measured plasma levels of diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen and gemfibrozil were similar or lower than those modelled, which is acceptable for an early tier. However, measured levels of ibuprofen were >200 times higher than modelled for the largest plant (Gryaab Goteborg). Comparing measured fish plasma concentrations to the human therapeutic concentrations ranked the relative risks from the pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac and gemfibrozil, followed by ibuprofen, presented the highest risk for target interactions, whereas naproxen and ketoprofen presented little risk. Remarkably, measured bioconcentration factors varied considerably between sites. This variation could not be attributed to differences in water concentrations, temperatures, pH or exposure times, thereby suggesting that chemical characteristics of effluents and/or recipient waters strongly affected the uptake/bioconcentration of the pharmaceuticals.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment lately have been acknowledged to constitute a health risk for humans and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Human and veterinary applications are the main sources of PhACs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge to the environment through sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, the occurrence and fate of selected human PhACs belonging to different therapeutic classes (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, anti-epileptics, antibiotics and beta-blockers) were investigated in a small river in the very south of Sweden. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of a high and rather constant load in sewage influent on downstream concentrations and whether substances that are metabolized to a high degree in humans also show a low persistency in a natural aquatic environment. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the STP, in a series of dammed reservoirs leading to discharge into the Hoje River in Sweden, and at several locations in the river downstream of the outfall. After enrichment by solid-phase extraction, the compounds were analyzed using GC-MS (methylated derivatives) or LC-MS/MS. In addition to the targeted pharmaceuticals, GC-MS analysis of the samples revealed the presence of other sewage-related pollutants (triclosan, caffeine, flame-retardants, antioxidants) and these results where included for comparison. Removal efficiencies were calculated in the STP and found to display a wide range with numerous species surviving treatment at greater than half their influent concentrations, including diclofenac, the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, a beta-blocker (propanolol), and antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Low removals were also observed for Tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (flame retardant), BHT-aldehyde (oxidation product of BHT) and synthetic musk (HHCB). The concentrations of chloride (Cl-) and boron (B) were used as natural inert tracers to estimate the relative extent of dilution of PhACs measured in the effluent of the STP on concentrations measured further downstream. Based on spatial trends of concentrations (recalculated to reflect a hypothetical scenario with no dilution), ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen and dicofenac were shown to be subject to significant abiotic or biotic transformations or physical sequestration in the river. The beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol, the antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfametoxazole, and carbamazepine demonstrated a high degree of persistence. Fluctuations in the concentration of carbamazepine and gemfibrozil were observed along the series of reservoirs and within the river and are hypothesized to be due to release of parent compound from glucuronides. Several of the investigated substances (metaprolol, propanolol and carbamazepin) that exhibit low excretion rates as parent compounds demonstrate a surprising persistence in the aquatic environment. It is concluded that pharmaceutical substances with a high metabolic rate in humans (low excretion rate) do not necessarily induce a short lifetime in aquatic environments. Results from this study emphasize the need for a broader view on the concept of persistence that accounts for loading rates, in addition to removal mechanisms (e.g., transformation, volatility and physical sequestration by solids), under a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

AB Mesoporous ionosilicas bearing ammonium groups appear as versatile adsorbent for anionic drugs. High amounts of the anionic drugs diclofenac and sulindac are irreversibly trapped within the materials whereas neutral species are hardly adsorbed. Our results open the route towards new ionic materials for wastewater treatment via ion exchange.

AB The current study introduces catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) as an efficient technique for complete mineralization of glyphosate or N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (PMG) in wastewater using the iron nanoparticle (Fe NP)-dispersed carbon nanofibers (CNFs) decorated over activated carbon beads (ACBs) (similar to 0.8 mm size). A high BET specific surface area of Fe-CNF/ACB (similar to 338 m(2)/g), good Fe-loading (similar to 4 mg/g), high thermal stability (25 1000 degrees C), augmented exposure of the Fe NPs to the surrounding liquid, and graphitic characteristics (I-D/I-G = 0.946) of the CNFs, all contribute towards efficient CWAO of the aqueous PMG. The experimental data show complete degradation of PMG at 100 mg/L at 220 degrees C and 25 bar within 6 h, using the catalyst dose of 0.75 g/L. The turnover frequency value was calculated to be 2.056 x 10(-2) s(-1), indicating an efficient role of the active Fe metal sites in degradation of PMG. Additionally, 80% chemical oxygen demand removal was measured in 6 h using Fe-CNF/ACB. Assuming the pseudo-first-order rate kinetics, the rate constant and apparent activation energy were calculated to be 0.01 min(-1) at 220 degrees C, and similar to 50 kJ/mol, respectively. Initiated by the reactive hydroxyl radicals generated in the aqueous solution, PMG was converted to CO2, H2O, and some inorganic ions via formation of sarcosine and amino methyl phosphonic acid intermediates. The treated water showed no toxicity. The method of preparation for the Fe-CNF/ACB catalyst and the CWAO technology are scalable and should be explored to treat the other recalcitrant herbicide, pesticide and pharmaceutical organic compounds.

AB In this study, a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electro-oxidation technology coupled with nanofiltration membrane (EO-NF) technology was investigated for its effectiveness in removing antibiotics (i.e., sulfamethazine:SMZ) and mitigating biofouling during secondary wastewater treatment. The result showed that EO obtained an effective SMZ removal, owing to the center dot OH generation observed by Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis; complete elimination of SMZ was found under the high current density (30 mA/cm(2)) and long Electrolysis Time (ET = 60 min). Meanwhile, EO-NF process enabled to reduce COD content from 60 mg/L to nearly 5 mg/L. Furthermore, regardless of the effect of EO process, NF could retain most NH3-N because of the excellent performance of NF for ions rejection, and its permeate concentration was below 0.5 mg/L. EO was able to reduce membrane fouling notably, increasing the final flux (15 L/(m(2).h)) of NF by 25.1% during long-term operation (240 h). Scanning electron microscopy-Energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) showed that a porous layer formed on the vicinity of NF membrane in the case of filtrating EO effluent, in contrast to a uniform and dense biofouling layer generated during the direct NF. Besides, the content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the number of bacterial colonies in the retentate of the EO-NF process were greater than those of the direct NF process. This resulted in a smaller amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) attaching to the membrane surface, decreasing the tightness and hardness of the fouling layer in the case of EO, as indicated by CLSM analysis. Overall, considering its ability to effectively eliminate persistent contaminants and reduce membrane fouling, BDD-based EO is considered a promising pre-treatment option for future NF applications.

AB Groundwater treatment sludge was a ferrihydrite-rich solid waste and abundantly generated for potable water production in groundwater treatment plant. Here we demonstrated an alternative strategy to reuse the sludge for preparing nano-rod erdite particles (EPs) via a facile hydrothermal method with only adding Na2S. The produced EPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM results showed that with the molar ratio of N2S to Fe in the sludge increasing from 1 to 2, the product EPs grew long from 0.5-1 mu m to 1-4 mu m. The product EP-0.2, prepared at the molar ratio of 0.2, was amorphous aggregates with dotted distribution of hexahedral pyrite. With the molar ratio increasing to 2, the product EP-2 was in the form of nanorod, and exhibited high TC adsorption capacity of 1960.8 mg/g, approximately 15 times of that of EP-0.2. By adding 0.02g EP-2, the removal rate of TC was 92.5% at the initial TC concentration of 1000 mg/L, higher than that of active carbon, diatomite, polyaluminium chloride and polyferric sulfate, and nearly 100% TC and 51.5% total organic carbon were removed from pharmaceutical wastewater. EP-2 was completely hydrolyzed to yield Fe oxyhydroxide in TC-containing solution, which exhibited adequate hydroxyl groups to link the -NH2 group at the side chain of TC molecules, resulting in high TC adsorption. This is the first report of recycling groundwater treatment sludge for preparing nano-rod erdite particles, which can be serve as low-cost materials in wastewater treatment. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intentional and unintentional contamination incidents, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and accidental spills, can result in large volumes of contaminated water. These waters may require pretreatment before disposal and assurances that treated waters will not adversely impact biological processes at wastewater treatment facilities, or receiving waters. Based on recommendations of an industrial workgroup, this study addresses such concerns by studying electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) pre-treatment for contaminated waters, using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode, prior to discharge to wastewater treatment facilities. Reaction conditions were investigated, and microbial toxicity was assessed using the Microtox (R) toxicity assay and the Nitrification Inhibition test. A range of contaminants were studied including herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and flame retardants. Resulting toxicities varied with supporting electrolyte from 5% to 92%, often increasing, indicating that microbial toxicity, in addition to parent compound degradation, should be monitored during treatment. These toxicity results are particularly novel because they systematically compare the microbial toxicity effects of a variety of supporting electrolytes, indicating some electrolytes may not be appropriate in certain applications. Further, these results are the first known report of the use of the Nitrification Inhibition test for this application. Overall, these results systematically demonstrate that anodic oxidation using the BDD anode is useful for addressing water contaminated with refractory organic contaminants, while minimizing impacts to wastewater plants or receiving waters accepting EAOP-treated effluent. The results of this study indicate nitrate can be a suitable electrolyte for incident response and, more importantly, serve as a baseline for site specific EAOP usage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Anew photocatalyst based on nano-sized TiO2 supported on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored photocatalytic properties upon irradiation by both UV and solar simulated light was successfully employed for the degradation of a mixture of 22 organic pollutants in both ultrapure water and real secondary wastewater effluent. First-order degradation rates showed that under UV irradiation nanosized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs is much more effective than conventional Degussa P25 for degradation of iopamidol, iopromide, diatrizoic acid, diclofenac, triclosan and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water. For the remaining organics the degradation rates were comparable being in most of the cases Degussa P25 slightly more effective than nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs. Reactions performed in real secondary wastewater effluent showed a general reduction of degradation rates. Specifically, such a reduction was in the range 9-87% and 9-96% for the Degussa P25 and the nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs, respectively. Overall, the nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs under UV irradiation displayed comparable degradation rates with respect to convention Degussa P25. Under simulated solar irradiation the new prepared photocatalyst showed lower efficiency than Degussa P25 in ultrapure water. Such a gap was greatly reduced when the reactions were carried out in real secondary wastewater effluent. The nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs demonstrated to have the addition benefit to be easily removed from the aqueous solution by a mild centrifugation or a filtration step and, consequently, can be reused for a further photocatalytic treatment batch. Therefore, the obtained results showed that new photocatalyst based on nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs has proved to be a promising candidate to be used in a photocatalytic based-AOP and to be integrated with a biological step for the effective removal of emerging organic pollutants.

AB In recent years, there has been growing interest in the fabrication of nanoscale adsorbent materials, which have become very important due to their special properties, namely, their uniform porosity, high stability, and tunable surface chemistry. This study presents the successful synthesis of a nanosized network polymer (4Czpyz-poly) and its application toward the capture of CO2 gas and pollutant removal from wastewater. 4Czpyz-poly is a novel microporous polymer synthesized by a simple oxidative polymerization reaction with a range of particle sizes between 100 and 400 nm. This polymer has an excellent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)-specific surface area of 1898 m(2) g(-1) and exhibits a uniform pore width of 1.69 nm. The prepared 4Czpyz-poly reversibly adsorbs 18.29 wt % of CO2 at 273 K/1 bar and 12.33 wt % at 295 K/1 bar. Furthermore, 4Czpyz-poly is employed for the adsorption of pollutants from wastewater, particularly two pharmaceuticals and two dyes. The effect of pH is investigated, and different adsorption behaviors are recorded. Kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption method adheres to pseudo-second-order kinetics, while the Langmuir adsorption isotherm better simulates the adsorption process. The recorded maximum adsorption capacities for methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (ME), caffeine (CFN), and desipramine (DES) are 204, 476, 109, and 303 mg g(-1), respectively. The recovery and reusability of 4Czpyz-poly are feasible for up to five cycles with an insignificant loss in adsorption efficiency. The adsorption of pharmaceutical mixtures and dye mixtures is evaluated by mixing CFN with DES, MB with acid fuchsin (AF), MO with AF, and MO with MB. The polymer shows excellent adsorption for hydrophobic and hydrophilic pharmaceuticals as well as cationic and anionic dyes with a slight preference for cationic and hydrophobic pollutants.

AB Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water, wastewater, soil, sediment and tissue samples. Concerns regarding the comparability of data obtained in different laboratories has been a major bottleneck to incentivize the compilation of publicly available of ARGs quantifications gathered from different reports. In this study, the influence of the DNA extraction kits (NZY Tissue gDNA Isolation kit or DNeasy PowerWater kit) and of the operator on the DNA extraction yield and on qPCR genes quantification was assessed. Since in wastewater and water samples the matrix effect can affect the DNA recovery and, therefore, gene quantification, an internal standard, consisting in a cloned gene not found in environmental samples, was tested. The aim was to assess how qPCR determinations in wastewater and water samples can be affected by the matrix effect. The results show that the DNA extraction operator did not significantly influence DNA yield. The use of distinct kits resulted in qPCR gene quantifications that did not differ in more than 1 log-unit mL(-1). The matrix effect, assessed based on the use of an internal standard, was associated with an underestimation that ranged 0.1-0.9 log gene copy number mL(-1) of sample, irrespective of the water type.
   The reliability on the use of a DNA extraction kit that costs about 3 times less than the most commonly used can be an incentive for the use of DNA based analyses of ARGs in environmental waters. Moreover, the fact that both the DNA extraction operator and the reduced matrix effect have little influence on the final results, are good news, encouraging the compilation of data produced in distinct laboratories. Nevertheless, harmonization efforts are still necessary to minimize bias that may be due associated with other conditions, such as equipment.

AB The steadily increasing production of pharmaceutical substances, their widespread use in health care for people and animals and inadequate disposal methods have attracted much interest in risks involved in the presence of these substances and their metabolites in the environment. Drugs present in wastewater are often resistant to biodegradation and can disturb biological processes of removing contaminants from wastewater. It should be emphasized that conventional wastewater treatment plants are not adapted to disposal of such contaminants as pharmaceutical substances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of erythromycin on changes in dehydrogenase activity in activated sludge and oxygen uptake rate of the whole population of microorganisms of active sludge, heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifying bacteria of the first and second phase. A decline in activity of dehydrogenases of activated sludge in the presence of erythromycin was observed. With the concentration of this antibiotic of 150 mg/L, the lowest value of dehydrogenase activity was 35.5 mu mol TF/gSS, whereas the degree of inhibition for this concentration reached 33.7%. It was also found that oxygen uptake rate declined for the entire population of microorganisms of active sludge in the presence of the antibiotic. The highest value of the inhibition degree for this oxygen uptake rate was 28.8%. Furthermore, an insignificant decline in the degree of inhibition of oxygen uptake rate was observed for heterotrophic bacteria (13.7%). The most sensitive to erythromycin were nitrifying bacteria. Degree of inhibition of oxygen uptake rate in the presence of this antibiotic for nitrifying bacteria of the first phase reached 40-64.5%, whereas for the bacteria of second phase, this value was 28.2-62%.

AB Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate vertebrate growth, development, and metabolism. Despite their importance, there is a need for effective detection of TH-disruption by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The frog olfactory system substantially remodels during TH-dependent metamorphosis and the objective of the present study is to examine olfactory system gene expression for TH biomarkers that can evaluate the biological effects of complex mixtures such as municipal wastewater. We first examine classic TH-response gene transcripts using reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory bulb (OB) of premetamorphic Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana tadpoles after 48 h exposure to biologically-relevant concentrations of the THs, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3) and L-thyroxine (T-4), or 17-beta estradiol (E-2); a hormone that can crosstalk with THs. As the OE was particularly sensitive to THs, further RNAseq analysis found > 30,000 TH-responsive contigs. In contrast, E-2 affected 267 contigs of which only 57 overlapped with THs suggesting that E-2 has limited effect on the OE at this developmental phase. Gene ontology enrichment analyses identified sensory perception and nucleoside diphosphate phosphorylation as the top affected terms for THs and E-2, respectively. Using classic and additional RNA-seq-derived TH-response gene transcripts, we queried TH-disrupting activity in municipal wastewater effluent from two different treatment systems: anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and membrane enhanced biological phosphorous removal (MEBPR). While we observed physical EDC removal in both systems, some TH disruption activity was retained in the effluents. This work lays an important foundation for linking TH-dependent gene expression with olfactory system function in amphibians.

AB The aim of the research was to show the presence of micropollutants contained in the wastewater of Mexico City within the distribution canals of the Mezquital Valley (MV), as well as their retention in agricultural soil and aquifers. This system constitutes the world's oldest and largest example of the use of untreated wastewater for agricultural irrigation. The artificial recharge associated with the MV aquifers, with groundwater extracted for human consumption showing its importance as a water resource for Mexico City. The results of sampling show the presence of 18 compounds, with 10 of these considered as endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs). The concentration of these pollutants ranged from 2 ng/L for 17 beta-estradiol to 99 ng/L for DEHP, with these values decreasing throughout the course of the canals due to the wastewater dilution factor, their retention in agricultural soil, and their accumulation in the local aquifer. The main mechanisms involved in natural attenuation are adsorption, filtration, and biodegradation. Drinking water equivalent levels (DWELs) were estimated for 11 compounds with regard to acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), by assuming local exposure parameters for a rural Mexican population. These were compared with the maximum groundwater concentrations (Cgw) to screen the potential risks. The very low ratios of Cgw to DWELs indicate no appreciable human health risk from the presence of trace concentrations of these compounds in the source of drinking water in the MV. Despite this, far from being exceeded after more than 100 years of irrigation with residual water, the natural soil attenuation seems to remain stable.

AB Fabrication of less-fouling and high performance membrane is essential to offer significant cost reductions in membrane bioreactor (MBR) processes. In this regard, nanodiamond (ND) embedded cellulose acetate (CA) nanocomposite membrane was prepared and characterized in a lab-scale submerged MBR system for treating of pharmaceutical wastewater. In order to achieve efficient dispersion and providing more hydrophilic property, NDs were functionalized via heat treatment method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurements were used to determine the surface properties of membranes. To compare the nanocomposite membranes with a pure CA membrane, critical flux, fouling behavior, and anti-fouling properties against extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were investigated. SEM images showed that in the presence of 0.5 wt% of functionalized ND nanoparticles, porous structure appears on the membrane surfaces. The obtained results showed that in presence of functionalized NDs; ND-COOH, surface hydrophilicity of nanocomposite membrane was much higher than that of pristine CA membrane. Higher critical flux was obtained by CA/ND-COOH (0.5 wt.% of NDs) nanocomposite membrane due to the change of surface characteristics. The filamentous bacteria in the MBR resulted in more foulants on the CA membrane surface, while less filamentous bacteria were attached on the CA/ND-COOH nanocomposite membrane. Analysis of extractable EPS showed that the concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates in the EPS and soluble microbial products (SMP) for CA/ND-COOH (0.5 wt.%) membrane are less than other membranes. Also, COD removal for all of the membranes was higher than 90%, whereas only 83.4% removal efficiency was reached in the activated sludge.

AB Treated wastewater (TWW) reuse for agricultural irrigation is a well-established approach to coping with water shortages in semi-arid and arid environments. Recently, additional uses of TWW have emerged, including streamflow augmentation and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the water quality and fish health, in an artificial reservoir located in an arid climate (the Yeruham Reservoir, Israel), which regularly receives TWW and sporadic winter floods. The temporal distribution of water levels, nutrients and organic micropollutants (OMPs) were measured during the years 2013-2014. OMPs were also measured in sediment and fish tissues. Finally, the status of fish health was evaluated by histopathology. Water levels and quality were mainly influenced by seasonal processes such as floods and evaporation, and not by the discharge of TWW. Out of 16 tested OMPs, estrone, carbamazepine, diclofenac and bezafibrate were found in the reservoir water, but mostly at concentrations below the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for fish. Concentrations of PCBs and dioxins in fish muscle and liver were much lower than the EU maximal permitted concentrations, and similar to concentrations that were found in food fish in Israel and Europe. In the histopathological analysis, there were no evident tissue abnormalities, and low to moderate infection levels of fish parasites were recorded. The results from the Yeruham Reservoir demonstrated a unique model for the mixture effect between TWW reuse and natural floods to support a unique stable and thriving ecosystem in a water reservoir located in an arid region. This type of reservoir can be widely used for recreation, education, and the social and economic development of a rural environment, such as has occurred in the Yeruham region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The concern for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in purified wastewater has grown in recent years. In this context, efficient and economically viable processes are required for their removal. In this study, adsorption was conducted to assess the removal of ibuprofen, caffeine, diazepam and acetaminophen, both as separated processes as in combination with a biological process in sequencing batch reactors. Removal efficiencies of these pharmaceutical active compounds were evaluated using two commercial activated carbons in granular and powder form and a discarded (after its use) activated carbon from a drinking water treatment plant. Concerning the biological treatment tests, simulated municipal wastewater was doped with 3 mg/L of each pharmaceutical active compounds. Results showed that caffeine, acetaminophen and ibuprofen achieved excellent removal percentages, even without powder activated carbon addition (more than 94%); By contrast, whereas diazepam removal was low (lower than 50%); however, it was improved up to 68% with the powder activated carbon addition to the sequencing batch reactors. Regarding adsorption tests as separated process, ibuprofen was the pharmaceutical active compounds with the lowest removal percentage (around 50% for the granular activated carbon) and diazepam (around 80% for the granular activated carbon) was the compound with the maximum removal efficiency for the tested concentrations (between 0.5 and 3 mg/L). Finally, results were very promising for the reused activated carbon since the removal efficiency of the pharmaceutical active compounds was higher than 90% (except for ibuprofen) when 0.5 g/L of reused activated carbon was applied in powder form to solutions of 3 mg/L of each pharmaceutical active compounds. In this way, a low cost activated carbon could be applied in wastewater treatment plants for pharmaceutical active compounds removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental antiandrogenic (AA) contaminants in effluents from wastewater treatment plants have the potential for negative impacts on wildlife and human health. The aim of our study was to identify chemical contaminants with likely AA activity in the biological effluents and evaluate the removal of these antiandrogens (AAs) during advanced treatment comprising adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC). In this study, profiling of AA contaminants in biological effluents and tertiary effluents was conducted using effect-directed analysis (EDA) including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation, a recombinant yeast screen containing androgen receptor (YAS), in combination with mass spectrometry analyses. Analysis of a wastewater secondary effluent from a membrane bioreactor revealed complex profiles of AA activity comprising 14 HPLC fractions and simpler profiles of GAC effluents with only 2 to 4 moderately polar HPLC fractions depending on GAC treatment conditions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-nanospray mass spectrometry analyses of AA fractions in the secondary effluent resulted in detection of over 10 chemical contaminants, which showed inhibition of YAS activity and were potential AAs. The putative AAs included biocides, food additives, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals and industrial contaminants. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the AA properties of N-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WS3), cetirizine, and oxcarbazepine are reported. The EDA used in this study was proven to be a powerful tool to identify novel chemical structures with AA activity in the complex aquatic environment. The adsorption process to GAC of all the identified antiandrogens, except WS3 and triclosan, fit well with the pseudo-second order kinetics models. Adsorption to GAC could further remove most of the AAs identified in the biological effluents with high efficiencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years deposal of pharmaceutical wastes has become a major problem globally. Therefore, it is necessary to removes pharmaceutical waste from the municipal as well as industrial effluents before its discharge. The convectional wastewater and biological treatments are generally failed to separate different drugs from wastewater streams. Thus, heterogeneous photocatalysis process becomes lucrative method for reduction of detrimental effects of pharmaceutical compounds. The main disadvantage of the process is the reuse or recycle of photocatalysis is a tedious job. In this work, the degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibiotic drug, by heterogeneous photocatalysis was study using supported TiO2 nanoparticle. The major concern of this study is to bring down the limitations of suspension mode heterogeneous photocatalysis by implementation of immobilized TiO2 with help of calcium alginate beads. The alginate supported catalyst beads was characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDAX) as well as the characteristic crystalline forms of TiO2 nanoparticle was confirmed by XRD. The degradation efficiency of TiO2 impregnated alginate beads (TIAB) was compared with the performance of free TiO2 suspension. Although, the degradation efficiency was reduced considerably using TIAB but the recycle and reuse of catalyst was increased quite appreciably. The kinetic parameters related to this work have also been measure. Moreover, to study the susceptibility of the present system photocatalysis of other three drugs ibuprofen (IBP), atenolol (ATL) and carbamazepine (CBZ) has been carried out using immobilized TiO2. The continuous mode operation in PBPR has ensured the applicability of alginate beads along with TiO2 in wastewater treatment. The variation of residence time has significant impact on the performance of PBPR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In arid regions of the southwestern United States, municipal wastewater treatment plants commonly discharge treated effluent directly into streams that would otherwise be dry most of the year. A better understanding is needed of how effluent-dependent waters (EDWs) differ from more natural aquatic ecosystems and the ecological effect of low levels of environmentally persistent organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) with distance from the pollutant source. In a controlled experiment, we found 26 compounds common to municipal effluent in treatment raceways all at concentrations <1.0 mu g/L Male bonytail chub (Gila elegans) in tanks containing municipal effluent had significantly lower levels of 11-ketotestosterone (p=0.021) yet higher levels of 17 beta-estradiol (p = 0.002) and vitellogenin (p = 0.036) compared to control male fish. Female bonytail chub in treatment tanks had significantly lower concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol than control females (p = 0.001). The normally inverse relationship between primary male and female sex hormones, expected in un-impaired fish, was greatly decreased in treatment (r = 0.00) versus control (r = -0.66) female fish. We found a similar, but not as significant, trend between treatment (r = -0.45) and control (r = -0.82) male fish. Measures of fish condition showed no significant differences between male or female fish housed in effluent or clean water. Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish. The population-level impacts of these findings are uncertain. Studies examining the long-term, generational and behavioral effects to aquatic organisms chronically exposed to low levels of OWC mixtures are needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years greater attention has been paid to the presence of pollutants in wastewater treatment plants, mainly because of strict environmental regulations and the possibility of reusing treated water in industrial processes. Since some organic pollutant compounds are not sufficiently removed in conventional activated sludge treatment (CAST) plants, new treatment processes have been developed, such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs). In this study a submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used to treat mixed industrial wastewaters in parallel with a CAST plant. Two hydraulic retention times (HRT) of wastewater were tested as one of the operational conditions of MBR and the quality of effluents of the two processes were studied and compared. Several general quality parameters were analysed in wastewaters: chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, conductivity, nitrogen, phosphate, suspended solids (SS) and turbidity. The two systems reduced COD by around 90%. SS was reduced by around 81% in the CAST plant and around 90% in the MBR plant. The results for the other general parameters were similar or better in the MBR process, which worked at a lower HRT. We also studied the removal of a group of six phthalates and bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate ester by SPME/GC-MS in the two treatment plants. Most of these compounds were not completely removed in the two treatment plants and were identified at low mu g l(-1) levels. We also tentatively identify some organic compounds in the wastewaters. Most of the compounds we found in the influent, MBR effluent and CAST effluent were benzene derivates, styrene, naphthalene and naphthalene derivates, and phenol derivates.

AB For the first time, high energy VUV photons and generation of O-3 by (V)UV lamps were applied together for removal of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from biologically treated wastewater (BTWW) in pilot-scale. The core of the pilot container unit was a photoreactor assembly consisting of six photoreactors, each containing a low-pressure Hg lamp (UV dose of 1.2 J/cm(2) and 6.6 J/cm(2) at 185 nm and 254 nm, respectively). BTWW was irradiated (4.75 min residence time) by (V)UV light in presence of in situ photochemically generated O-3 from coolant air of the lamps. Experiments were conducted at the site of two wastewater treatment plants. Out of seven target APIs (namely carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, metoprolol, sitagliptin, and sulfamethoxazole), 80-100% removal was accomplished for five and 40-80% for two compounds. Two degradation products of carbamazepine were detected. Degradation products of other target compounds were not found. The applied O-3 dose was 30-45 mg O-3/mg dissolved organic carbon. Inactivation of up to log-4.8, log-4.5 and log-3.8 could be achieved for total coliform, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. SOS Chromotest indicated no genotoxicity nor acute toxicity. Generation of neither NH4+, NO2- nor NO3- was observed during post-treatment. Electric energy per order values were calculated for the first time for (V)UV/O-3 treatment in BTWW with a median value of 1.5 kWh/m(3). This technology can be proposed for posttreatment of BTWWs of small settlements or livestock farms to degrade micropollutants before water discharge or for production of irrigation water. Further studies are essential in pilot-scale for other applications. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals and other ionizable contaminants from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent can bioaccumulate in fish, particularly in effluent dominated and dependent systems in semi-arid and arid regions. However, invertebrate bioaccumulation of these compounds has been less studied. Using municipal wastewater effluent as source water in outdoor stream mesocosms to simulate effluent-dependent lotic systems, we examined bioaccumulation of several widely-used pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen (nonsteroidal antiinflamatory), caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), diltiazem (calcium channel blocker), diphenhydramine (anti-histamine), fluoxetine (anti-depressant), norfluoxetine (anti-depressant metabolite), and sertraline (anti-depressant) in freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea), periphyton and stoneroller minnows (Campostoma anomalum), a commonly studied grazer in stream ecology, during a replicated outdoor stream mesocosm study at the Baylor Experimental Aquatic Research facility. Target analytes were determined in tissues, source effluent and stream water by isotope dilution LC-MS/MS. After an 8-day uptake period, clams accumulated a number of pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and sertraline with maximum concentrations reaching low pg/kg. We observed uptake rates in clams for acetaminophen at 2.8 mu g/kg per day, followed by diphenhydramine (1.2 mu g/kg per day) and carbamazepine (1.1 mu g/kg per day). Caffeine, carbamazepine, diltiazem and diphenhydramine were measured in periphyton. Diphenhydramine was the only compound detected in all matrices, where bioaccumulation factors ( BAFs) were elevated in bivalves (1631 +/- 589 L/kg), compared to stoneroller minnows (247 +/- 84 L/kg) and periphyton (315 +/- 116 L/kg). Such BAF variability across multiple biological matrices highlight the need to understand bioaccumulation differences for ionizable contaminants among freshwater biota, including threatened and endangered species (e.g., unionids), commercially important bivalves (e.g., estuarine and marine bivalves), and fish.

AB Considering the low recyclability of powder adsorbents, an efficient method is needed to fabricate a novel threedimensional (3D) adsorbents. Take advantage of the 3D iron network and admirable adsorption performance of the Fe-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF), a solvothermal method was used to in-situ growing a series of Fe-based MOFs (MIL-53(Fe) MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe)) onto the iron network (MIL stands for Materials of Institute Lavoisier). The successful growing of MILs(Fe) on the iron network was verified by optical microscopy, SEM, XRD, FT-IR and XPS characterizations. As expected, the 3D MILs(Fe) (Fe/MILs) inherited the high adsorption capacity of powdery MILs(Fe), while excellent recycling performance was obtained. Among them, Fe/MIL-100(Fe) exhibited the highest performance towards tetracycline (TC), more than 95% of TC could be removed at fifth adsorption cycle. Mechanism indicated that the pi-pi and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions between Fe/MIL-100(Fe) and TC molecules played an essential role in the adsorption process. Besides, the Fe/MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent was stable in water with negligible iron leaching in solution. It is worth noting that Fe/MIL-100(Fe) kept a high adsorption performance towards TC in a wide pH range of 2-10 and suffered minor influence from the anion and humic acid in solution. Even in actual aqueous solution (tap water, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater), high performance was presented by the Fe/MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent. This work provided a new method to synthesis 3D MILs(Fe) adsorbents for wastewater remediation.

AB The anti-diabetic agent metformin (MF) is one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical compound worldwide. It is not completely metabolized after administration where 52% is excreted in urine. Accordingly, it highly contributes in generating wastewater containing MF. This pollutant is not effectively removed by the conventional wastewater treatment methods. Therefore, an effective advanced treatment technique should be implemented for the removal of MF from wastewater. In this study, silica-alumina (SA) is used as an environmentally-safe and effective adsorbent for removing MF from aqueous solution by adsorption. Adsorption experiments were employed studying the effect of pH, contact time, and MF initial concentration to investigate both the removal efficiency of MF and the interaction mechanism. A set of characterization techniques, such as SEM, BET, FTIR, TPD-MS, and zeta potential were performed before and after adsorption experiments to confirm the role of structural morphology, surface area, porosity, surface acidity and charge in adsorption. The characterization analysis showed that SA has BET surface area of 470 m(2)/g. From the total BET surface area, the microporous surface area was around 31% (147 m(2)/g), while the rest corresponds to the mesoporous surface area (323 m(2)/g). The batch adsorption results showed that high concentrations of MF were efficiently removed from water samples with a maximum uptake of 46 mg/L at optimal pH 9.0 (optimal pH). The mechanism responsible for adsorption was observed to be carried out via an electrostatic interaction between a negatively charged SA and a positively charged MF. TGA/DT analysis was conducted to assess the reusability of the spent SA by thermal regeneration at 673 K. The adsorbent was completely regenerated and maintained a 95% removal after 3 cycles without impacting the surface characteristics.

AB Little information exists on the co-occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacterial pathogens, and organic wastewater-associated chemicals (OWCs) within Great Lakes tributaries. Fifteen watershed sites and one beach site adjacent to the Little Calumet River-Portage Burns Waterway (LCRPBW) on Lake Michigan were tested on four dates for pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, chloride, color, ammonia- and nitrate-nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, sulfate, turbidity, and atrazine; for concentrations of FIB; and for genes indicating the presence of human-pathogenic enterococci (ENT) and of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (EC) from various animal sources. Nineteen samples were also tested for 60 OWCs. Half of the watershed samples met EC recreational water quality standards; none met ENT standards. Human-wastewater-associated OWC detections were correlated with human-influence indicators such as population/km(2), chloride concentrations, and the presence of WWTP effluents, but EC and ENT concentrations were not. Bacterial pathogen genes indicated rural human and several potential animal sources. OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern (musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB, alkylphenols, carbamazepine) and 3 bacterial pathogen genes were detected at the mouth of the LCRPBW, but no such OWCs and only 1 pathogen gene were detected at the beach. The LCRPBW has significant potential to deliver FIB, potential bacterial pathogens, and OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern to the nearshore of Lake Michigan, under conditions enhancing nearshore transport of the river plume. Nearshore mixing of lake and river water, and the lack of relationship between OWCs and FIB or pathogen genes, pose numerous challenges for watershed and nearshore assessment and remediation.

AB An integrated separation process is proposed for recovery and enantioseparation of a chiral antihypertensive drug amlodipine from wastewater. Utilizing this integrated technology, both high recovery (Y) and high enantiomeric excess (ee) were obtained due to the strong enrichment ability of supported liquid membrane with strip dispersion (SLM-SD) and the good enantioseparation ability of organic phase crystallization. These two steps were coupled by an intermediate step: aqueous phase crystallization. In the SLM-SD, an extractant P204 (bi (2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) was dissolved in n-heptane to form a liquid membrane phase, and hydrochloric acid was used as stripping agent. One-stage SLM-SD recycled the amlodipine from wastewater into a stripping phase with a removal (E-AD) of 99.67% and a Y-1,Y-AD of 87.91% after optimizing the parameters: pH and the concentrations of P204, hydrochloric acid, and amlodipine. Sodium hydroxide and (L)-tartaric acid were added into the stripping aqueous phase to obtain amlodipine-1/2(L)-tartrate acid crystals, which were directly used in the subsequent organic phase crystallization without tedious additional steps. The Y-2,Y- (AD) of aqueous phase crystal reached 99% at a pH of over 6.68 and a molar ratio of over 0.5 for (L)-tartrate acid to amlodipine. Using (L)-tartaric acid or (D)-tartaric acid as resolving agent and dimethylsulfoxide as solvent, high-value-added products (R)-amlodipine and (S)-amlodipine were obtained by two steps of organic phase crystallization. The ee of products was over 99% after optimizing the dosages of dimethylsulfoxide and resolving agent. To increase the total yield, the generated mother liquors were re-treated by SLM-SD with the recovery of over 99% for residual amlodipine.

AB Non-target screening of water samples from the Nidda river basin in central Germany was conducted with the goal to identify previously unknown chemical contaminants and their emission sources. The focus was on organic, water-borne contaminants which were not typical to municipal wastewater. Grab samples of river water from 13 locations on the Nidda and 15 of its tributaries, in sum 112 samples, were analysed with high resolution LC-QToF-MS/MS. To facilitate the identification of substances, features originating from the same compound such as adducts and isotopologues as well as in-source fragments and species with multiple charge states were registered and grouped by a componentization step utilizing both retention times and peak shapes of the features to combine them in a single component. This led to a reduction of the number of features by an average of 1235 per sample (46%). These grouped features were prioritized if these were detected only in specific tributaries or specific river sections, reducing the number of components by an average of 913 per sample (78%). In addition, grouped features were labelled as typically found in municipal wastewater by combining data from 16 wastewater treatment plants located across Germany and Switzerland and comparing this to components detected in the Nidda basin. These were removed, leading to a further reduction of components by an average of 72 per sample (30%) for an average total reduction of 2536 per sample (93%). Finally, nine compounds, with emission sources in three specific tributaries, were identified, including the textile additive Nylostab SEED (R), which was previously not known to be an environmental contaminant, as well as naturally occurring compounds such as highly toxic microcystins.

AB The coupling of biological with advanced oxidation processes for the removal of 13 pharmaceuticals is reported in this study. The efficiency of this system was examined by using two ligninolytic fungi, Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma lucidum. Pharmaceuticals' removal was examined by using four different quinone substances (1,4-benzoquinone, 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and gallic acid). The quinone redox cycling mechanism of the fungal species promotes the production of hydrogen peroxide for subsequent decomposition to non-selective and highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals in presence of Fe(III)-oxalate. Results evidenced that the most effective mediators for T. versicolor and G. lucidum were 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and gallic acid (GA), respectively. Time-course experiments showed that higher concentrations of Fe(II) were produced using DMBQ and GA, suggesting that the efficiency of the mediator in reducing Fe(III) is linked to the removal of pharmaceuticals. The application of DMBQ in the redox cycling process of T. versicolor resulted to 60-100% removal for all the pharmaceuticals, due to the high affinity of laccase enzyme for DMBQH(2). The advanced bio-oxidation of T. versicolor was tested for hospital wastewater treatment. Results showed a decrease of the elimination degree for pharmaceuticals as compared to the previous bioassays conducted with a synthetic medium. Nevertheless, significant removals (30-100%) were achieved by using DMBQ and GA as mediators of the redox cycle for T. versicolor under the non-sterilized conditions of the hospital wastewater. The use of GA is of great importance since its phenolic form, equivalent to the hydroquinone form, is considered as a critical parameter in Fe(III) reduction.

AB A Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped actinobacterial strain, designated as ZYR 51(T), was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater in Jinhua city, Zhejiang province, Eastern China. Isolation was aided by using a resuscitation-promoting factor, suggesting the strain was recovered from a viable but non-culturable state. Strain ZYR 51(T) was characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Growth was found to occur at 10-45 A degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and 0-9 % NaCl (w/v). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that strain ZYR 51(T) belongs to the genus Gordonia and showed low level similarities (below 97 %) with all other members of this genus. The strain was found to possess meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP), along with MK-9(H-2) as the predominant menaquonine. Mycolic acids were found to be present. C-16:0 (34.9 %), 10-methyl C-18:0 (30.3 %), iso-C-18:0(8.2 %), and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c as define by MIDI; 18.8 %) were identified as the major cellular fatty acids. The polar lipid profile of strain ZYR 51(T) was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and some unknown lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ZYR 51(T) was determined to be 67.7 mol%. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia jinhuaensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain is ZYR 51(T) (=CGMCC 1.12827(T) = NBRL B-59111(T) = NBRC 110001(T)).

AB Reclaimed water has been widely applied in irrigation and industrial production. Revealing the behavior of emerging contaminants in the production process of reclaimed water is the first prerequisite for developing relevant water quality standards. This study investigated 43 emerging contaminants, including 22 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), 11 organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), and 10 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 3 reclaimed wastewater treatment plants (RWTPs) in Beijing. The composition profiles and removal efficiencies of these contaminants in RWTPs were determined. The results indicated that the distribution characteristics of the different types of contaminants in the three RWTPs were similar. Caffeine, sul2 and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate were the dominant substances in the wastewater, and their highest concentrations were 27104 ng/L, 1.4 x 10(7) copies/mL and 262 ng/L, respectively. Ofloxacin and sul2 were observed to be the dominant substances in the sludge, and their highest concentrations were 5419 ng/g and 3.7 x 10(8) copies/g, respectively. Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic system combined with the membrane bioreactor process achieved a relatively high aqueous removal of PPCPs (87%). ARGs and OPFRs were challenging to remove, with average removal rates of 6.5% and 31%, respectively. Quantitative meta-analysis indicated that tertiary treatment processes performed better in emerging contaminant removal than secondary processes. Diethyltoluamide exhibited the highest mass load discharge, with 33.5 mg/d per 1000 inhabitants. Octocrylene and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate posed high risks (risk quotient>1.0) to aquatic organisms. This study provides essential evidence to screen high priority pollutants and develop corresponding standard in RWTPs. (c) Higher Education Press 2021

AB The distribution of micropollutants in biotic phases of horizontal sub-surface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands was investigated. 88 diverse micropollutants (personal care products, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs) were monitored for in full-scale HSSF steel slag and gravel beds to assess their fate and behaviour during tertiary wastewater treatment. Of the studied micropollutants 54 were found in receiving and treated wastewaters. Treatment reduced concentrations of several micropollutants by >50% (removal range -112% to 98%) and resulted in changes to the stereo-isomeric composition of chiral species. For example, stereo-selective changes were observed for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and atenolol during HSSF constructed wetland treatment for the first time. Analysis of sludge present within the HSSF beds found 37 micropollutants to be present. However, concentrations for the majority of these micropollutants were not considered high enough to suggest partitioning into sludge was a contributing mechanism of removal. Nevertheless the preservative methylparaben was found at 2772 mg bed(-1). Its daily removal from wastewater of 3.4 mg d(-1) indicates partitioning and accumulation in sludge contributes to its removal. Other micropollutants found at high levels in sludge (relative to their overall removals) were the antidepressants sertraline and fluoxetine, and the metabolite desmethylcitalopram. Furthermore, process balances indicated uptake and metabolism by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud did not contribute significantly to micropollutant removal. However analysis of plant tissues evidenced uptake, metabolism and accumulation of recalcitrant micropollutants such as ketamine and carbamazepine. It is considered that the rate of uptake was too slow to have a notable impact on removal at the 14 h hydraulic retention time. Despite evidence of other removal mechanisms at play (e.g., partitioning into sludge and plant uptake), findings indicate biodegradation is the dominant mechanism of micropollutant removal in HSSF constructed wetlands.

AB Performance of an up-flow submerged aerated biological filter (SABF), treating mixture of VOCs in pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated. Methanol, acetone, dichloromethane, benzene and toluene were chosen as target pollutants. The effects of airflow rate, hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate on VOC emission were evaluated. During the start-up phase, SABF removed over 92% of COD, up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.09 +/- 0.05 kg/m(3)/d at 12 h HRT. It was observed that the limited mass transfer of VOC to the gas phase at low air flow rate (0.4 L/min, with an empty bed residence time of 114 s) reduced its emission from the reactor. Performance of SABF varied with hydraulic retention time (HRT) and maximum COD removal (93%) was achieved at 10 h. Reduced contact time (less than 10 h) between pollutant and biomass affected the degradation of dichloromethane, benzene and toluene in the liquid phase. SABF exhibited effective degradation (95%) of VOCs up to an OLR of 17.45 +/- 0.01 kg/m(3)/d. Enzyme inactivation reduced the efficiency (72%) of the SABF for increased OLR of 20.85 +/- 0.03 kg/m(3)/d. Irrespective of organic loading rate, competition for the active site between the pollutants mainly affected the degradation of benzene and toluene in the liquid phase. Presence of high biomass and reduced mass transfer of VOCs to gas phase due to low air flow rate reduced VOC stripping even at higher organic loading rate. Average gas phase emission reduced to 0.075% for DCM, benzene, toluene whereas methanol and acetone was completely removed from the gas phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contamination of natural aquatic ecosystems by hospital wastewater is a major environmental and human health issue. Disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, radionuclides and solvents are widely used in hospitals for medical purposes and research. After application, some of these substances combine with hospital effluents and, in industrialised countries, reach the municipal sewer network. In certain developing countries, hospitals usually discharge their wastewater into septic tanks equipped with diffusion wells. The discharge of chemical compounds from hospital activities into the natural environment can lead to the pollution of water resources and risks for human health. The aim of this article is to present: (i) the steps of a procedure intended to evaluate risks to human health linked to hospital effluents discharged into a septic tank equipped with a diffusion well; and (ii) the results of its application on the effluents of a hospital in Port-au-Prince. The procedure is based on a scenario that describes the discharge of hospital effluents,via septic tanks, into a karstic formation where water resources are used for human consumption. COD, Chloroform, dichlomethane, dibromochloromethane, dichlorobromomethane and bromoform contents were measured. Furthermore, the presence of heavy metals (chrome, nickel and lead) and faecal coliforms were studied. Maximum concentrations were 700 NPP/100 ml for faecal coliforms and 112 mg/L for COD. A risk of infection of 10(-5) infection per year was calculated. Major chemical risks. particularly for children, relating to Pb(II), Cr(III), Cr(VI) and Ni(II) contained in the ground water were also characterised. Certain aspects of the scenario studied require improvement, especially those relating to the characterisation of drugs in groundwater and the detection of other microbiological indicators such as protozoa, enterococcus and viruses.

AB This study evaluates the applicability of TiO2-based photocatalysts for the treatment of pharmaceutical micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluent (SWE). Photolytic experiments using SWEs with different compositions demonstrated that the rates of photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen and carbamazepine inversely correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), regardless of the type of applied light source and initial pharmaceutical concentration. The critical relevance of organic matter to the scavenging behavior of SWE was further verified by assessing the photocatalytic performance as a function of the concentrations of potential effluent-derived quenchers (i.e., NO3-, Cl-, alkalinity, and humic acid). Kinetic comparison of the degradation of trace levels of pharmaceuticals (i.e., caffeine, cimetidine, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole) using TiO2/UV-A, TiO2/UV-C, and H2O2/UV-C systems revealed that heterogeneous processes showed more significant performance reduction with increasing DOC concentration; this result indicates that organic matter plays dual roles in the scavenging activity of an effluent matrix: (1) OH radical ((OH)-O-center dot) quenching and (2) active-site coverage. TiO2 surface modifications (i.e., Pt and SiOx loading) accelerated the degradation of all the tested pharmaceuticals in SWEs to a certain degree. Particularly, the relevant altered surface affinity preferentially increased the susceptibility of specific pharmaceuticals to photocatalytic treatment. The presence of the effluent matrix substantially impaired the performance of visible-light-active photocatalysts in most cases. However, photocatalytic pharmaceutical degradation on Pt-doped TiO2, which occurs via direct charge transfer, was much less hindered in SWEs than that on Pt-deposited WO3, which occurs via (OH)-O-center dot-mediated oxidation.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is the most frequently detected pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments effluent by wastewater treatment plants. Batch and column experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of CBZ from ultra-pure water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent using raw zeolitic tuff (RZT) and surfactant modified zeolite (SMZ). Point zero net charge (pHpzc), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) were investigated for adsorbents to evaluate the physiochemical changes resulted from the modification process using Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br). XRD and FTIR showed that the surfactant modification of RZT has created an amorphous surface with new alkyl groups on the surface. The pHpzc was determined to be approximately 7.9 for RZT and SMZ. The results indicated that the CBZ uptake by SMZ is higher than RZT in all sorption tests (>8 fold). Batch results showed that the sorption capacity of RZT and SMZ in WWTP effluent (0.029 and 0.25 mg/g) is higher than RZT and SMZ (0.018 and 0.14 mg/g) in ultrapure water (1.6-1.8 fold). Batch tests showed that the equilibrium time of CBZ removal in the WWTP matrix (47 h) is much longer than CBZ removal in ultrapure water. The sorption capacity of RZT & SMZ in WWTP effluent (0.03, 0.33 mg/g) is higher than RZT and SMZ (0.02 and 0.17 mg/g) in ultrapure water (1.5-2 fold) using column test. This study has clearly demonstrated that the performance of RZT and SMZ is more efficient for the removal of CBZ from realistic wastewater than ultrapure water. It is evident that the surfactant modification of RZT has enhanced the CBZ removal in both matrices.

AB Organic contaminants, specifically contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), have a great environmental impact, since the removal of these pollutants is of great difficulty by conventional treatments and the presence of these pollutants in the aquatic medium, even at low concentrations, is extremely hazardous to human health. Advanced oxidation processes and, specifically, TiO2-photocatalytic process is considered an option with positive results for an efficient treatment. However, the photocatalyst must be accessible to the UV radiation, for the activation of the TiO2. For this reason, it is recommendable to use a floating photocatalyst (with lower density than water) if the UV light comes from the solar radiation, because it will be on the water surface. In addition, this characteristic of the catalyst can entail an increase of the process efficiency if the pollutant is mainly located on the surface of water. In this context, the goal of this work is the preparation of floating photocatalysts for the removal of CECs from wastewater. TiO2 is deposited in low-density-polyethylene (LDPE), support with lower density than water and high stability and resistance to degradation. LDPE-TiO2 mixtures were prepared by different methods: mixing TiO2 and LDPE in a hot-cylinder-mixer or using o-xylene or an anionic surfactant as dispersing agent, in order to increase the dispersion of TiO2 before extrusion. Filaments obtained were printed as meshes in a Fused-Deposition-Modelling 3D-printer. The printed photocatalysts improved the activity in comparison with the plate obtained in the cylinder, used as benchmark. Thus, this study opens the doors to the in-situ treatment of CECs, using floating photocatalysts and solar radiation as the sole reagent, a very economical, efficient, easily implantable and environmentally compatible process.

AB In this study, the effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) oxidation on the deactivation of wastewater (WW)-derived N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors was investigated under various conditions (i.e., ClO2 application pH, dose and contact time). At pH 6.0, decreases in NDMA formation potentials (FPs) or occurrences (under uniform formation conditions [UFC]) were relatively low (<25%) with ClO2 oxidation regardless of WW-impact. A negative removal was also observed after ClO2 oxidation in some of the non-impacted waters. However, NDMA FP removals were significant (up to similar to 85%) under the same oxidation conditions in WW-impacted waters at pH 7.8. This indicates that the majority of WW-derived NDMA precursors can be deactivated with ClO2 oxidation above neutral pH. This was attributed to the better oxidative reaction of ClO2 with amines that have lone pair electrons to be shared at higher oxidation pH conditions. In addition, relatively short oxidation periods with ClO2 (i.e., <= 10 min) or low Ct (concentration x time, similar to 10 mg * min/L) values were sufficient for the deactivation of WW-derived NDMA precursors. ClO2 oxidation was effective in freshlyWW-impacted waters. Natural attenuation processes (e.g., sorption, biodegradation, etc.) can change the reactivity of WW-derived NDMA precursors for oxidation with ClO2. The effect of ClO2 on the removal of THM precursors was low(<25%) and independent of oxidation conditions. Given the low formation of regulated THMs and HAAs, ClO2 oxidation presents a viable option for the simultaneous control of NDMA and regulated DBP formation during water treatment, especially for utilities treating WW-impacted water sources.

AB During onsite wastewater treatment, trace organic compounds are often present in the effluents applied to subsurface soils for advanced treatment during vadose zone percolation and groundwater recharge. The fate of the endocrine-disrupting surfactant metabolites 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxylate (NP1EO), and 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxycarboxylate (NP1EC), metal-chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilotri acetic acid (NTA), antimicrobial agent triclosan, stimulant caffeine, and antibiotic sulfamethoxazole during transport through an unsaturated sandy loam soil was studied at a field-scale test site. To assess the effects of effluent quality and hydraulic loading rate (HLR) on compound fate in the soil profile, two effluents (septic tank or textile biofilter) were applied at two design HLRs (2 or 8 cm/d). Chemical concentrations were determined in the two effluents and soil pore water at 60, 120, and 240 cm below the soil infiltrative surface. Concentrations of trace organic compounds in septic tank effluent were reduced by more than 90% during transport through 240 cm (often within 60 cm) of soil, likely due to sorption and biotransformation. However, the concentration of NP increased with depth in the shallow soil profile. Additional treatment of anaerobic septic tank effluent with an aerobic textile biofilter reduced effluent concentrations of many compounds, but generally did not affect any changes in pore water concentrations. The soil profile receiving septic tank effluent (vs. textile biofilter effluent) generally had greater percent removal efficiencies. EDTA, NP, NP I EC, and sulfamethoxazole were measured in soil pore water, indicating the ability of some trace organic compounds to reach shallow groundwater. Risk is highly dependent on the degree of further treatment in the saturated zone and the types and proximity of uses for the receiving groundwater environment. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The pharmaceutical benzodiazepine diazepam and its metabolite oxazepam have been detected in wastewater treatment plants effluents, surface water and treated drinking water, but their transformation during chlorination process is not well understood. We investigated the reactions of diazepam and oxazepam with free available chlorine using a high-resolution mass analyzer and theoretical calculation to elucidate the fate of benzodiazepines during water chlorination process. The obtained apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) for chlorine reaction with diazepam and oxazepam varied from 0.01 to 1.7 M-1 s(-1) and 0.7 to 31.6 M-1 s(-1) in the pH range of 5.5-10.0, respectively. Under typical wastewater disinfection conditions of neutral pH values, free chlorine concentrations of 5 mg L-1 and contact times of up to 2 h, the corresponding half-lives for diazepam (similar to 180 min) and oxazepam (similar to 61 min) suggest that diazepam will be partly transformed during disinfection. Conversely, oxazepam will be considerably transformed during wastewater disinfection. The pH-dependency of k(app) for diazepam could be explained by the reactions between neutral diazepam and HClO species. The kinetic pattern for oxazepam can be well described by species-specific reactions involving oxazepam or Cl-2 and Cl2O species. In total, fifteen and eight transformation products were identified for chlorination of diazepam and oxazepam, respectively. The C-3 of 1,4-benzodiazepine structure was the main site of attack, leading predominantly to the oxidation and then cleavage of the C(3)-N(4) bond, as well as diazepine ring contractions. Based on mass balance estimation, the main chlorination product for diazepam and oxazepam are 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro- 2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2,3-dione and 6-chloro-4-phenyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone, respectively.

AB Background: There is growing interest in the natural and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. While nutrient removal in wetlands has been extensively investigated, information regarding the degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has only recently been emerging. PPCPs are widely distributed in urban wastewaters and can be removed to some extent by the constructed wetlands. The medium-term (3-5 years) behavior of these systems regarding PPCP removal is still unknown.
   Objectives: The efficiency of a Leca-based laboratory-scale constructed wetland planted with Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex. Steudel in treating an aqueous solution of the pharmaceuticals, namely, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine, was to investigate.
   Materials and Methods: The two pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CW) were operated in parallel; one as an experimental unit (a planted reactor with P. australis) and the other as a control (an unplanted reactor with Leca). Pretreatment and analyses of the carbamazepine, ibuprofen, sulfadiazine, and tissue samples (Leca, P. australis body and P. australis leaf) were conducted using HPLC.
   Results: The carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine removal efficiencies for the planted and unplanted reactors were 89.23% and 95.94%, 89.50% and 94.73%, and 67.20% and 93.68%, respectively. The Leca bed permitted an efficient removal. Leca has a high sorption capacity for these pharmaceuticals, with removal efficiencies of 93.68-95.94% in the unplanted reactors.
   Conclusions: Sorption processes might be of a major importance in achieving efficient treatment of wastewater, particularly in the removal of organic material that are resistant to biodegradation, in which case the materials composing the support matrix may play an important role. The results obtained in the present study indicate that a constructed wetland with Leca as a substrate and planted with P. australis is effective in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine.

AB Contamination of receiving waters with pharmaceutical compounds is of pressing concern. This constitutes the first study to report on the development of a semi-quantitative risk assessment (RA) model for evaluating the environmental threat posed by three EU watch list pharmaceutical compounds namely, diclofenac, 17-betaestradiol and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, to aquatic ecosystems using Irish data as a case study. This RA model adopts the Irish Environmental Protection Agency Source-Pathway-Receptor concept to define relevant parameters for calculating low, medium or high risk score for each agglomeration of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which include catchment, treatments, operational and management factors. This RA model may potentially be used on a national scale to (i) identify WWTPs that pose a particular risk as regards releasing disproportionally high levels of these pharmaceutical compounds, and (ii) help identify priority locations for introducing or upgrading control measures (e.g. tertiary treatment, source reduction). To assess risks for these substances of emerging concern, the model was applied to 16 urban WWTPs located in different regions in Ireland that were scored for the three different compounds and ranked as low, medium or high risk. As a validation proxy, this case study used limited monitoring data recorded at some these plants receiving waters. It is envisaged that this semi-quantitative RA approach may aid other EU countries investigate and screen for potential risks where limited measured or predicted environmental pollutant concentrations and/or hydrological data are available. This model is semi-quantitative, as other factors such as influence of climate change and drug usage or prescription data will need to be considered in a future point for estimating and predicting risks.

AB The antibiotic-contaminated water treatment is an important step for pollutant reduction and the promotion of water environment quality. Uncertainty in wastewater treatment technology, fluctuations in effluent water quality, and operation costs cause an emerging issue to develop materials effective for the removal of antibiotics. The environment-friendly clay such as vermiculite could be potentially promising candidates for removing 6-APA (6-aminopenicillanic) from pharmaceutical effluent. Antibiotic removal was achieved by using an eco-friendly, time-saving, powerful, and easy applying synthesis method via tetraethoxysilane (Si). Expert systems are widely powerful tools for minimizing the complexities and complications in wastewater treatment. Response surface methodology (RSM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were used to develop systematically predicting interactions of synthesis conditions on 6-APA adsorption capacity and optimize the best amount of compound. The three parameters of the amount of adsorbent (weight.), initial concentration (mg/mL), and reaction time (min) are selected as input and the adsorption capacity (mg/g) were computed as the output of the models. The effect of process variables investigated by RSM through central composite design matrix and the results compared with ANFIS model. The maximum amount of adsorption capacity predicted by RSM for VMT and VMT-Si were 162.5 and 179.8 mg/g, respectively. The suggested models were successfully validated with the acceptable confidence levels 0.99 and 0.97, for VMT and VMT-Si using RSM and 0.99 and 0.99 by ANFIS. ANFIS model demonstrated higher predictive capability than RSM model based on the good agreement in predictable dataset to experimental data.

AB The present work focuses on the treatment of real industrial pharmaceutical effluent, utilizing novel composite beads made up of waste foundry sand (FS) and fuller's earth (FE), both being good source of iron. These composite beads serves as a surface for the coating of TiO2 along withfacilitating the iron leaching, thus leading to the in-situ dual effect of photocatalysis and photo-Fenton. Optimization of various parameters like a number of beads, treatment time, the dosage of H2O2 using batch and the continuous re-circulation mode reactor has been studied in the sunlight. For the batch scale study, the treatment time of 3.65 h, the number of beads as 98 (98 % surface area covered), and H2O2 dose as 800 mg L-1 were came out to be optimized conditions with maximum % COD reduction. The dual effect was effective in eliminating the complex compounds present in the effluent as confirmed through GC-MS analysis along with the significant reduction in (COD) (71 %) for batch reactor. The treatment time for the real wastewater was reduced by 60-70 min as compared to the exclusive processes of photo-Fenton and TiO2 photocatalysis. In the continuous recirculation mode, 75 % reduction in COD was obtained in 5 h. Further, the bacterial assays proved the disposability of the treated wastewater as per the government regulations. Cost analysis of the overall treatment was also evaluated of the prototype for the complete revelation of the dual process for commercial-scale applications and it was found to be <0.1$ L-1. The composite was successfully recycled for more than 150 cycles without loss in activity of catalyst. The intactness of dual activity during recycles was confirmed through various characterization techniques like XRD, SEM-EDS, FTIR and UV-DRS. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants like pharmaceutical drugs and personal care products in aquatic systems is now being identified as a potential risk to human health. Since conventional wastewater treatment systems are unable to remove them sufficiently, high concentrations of some of the commonly used drugs are reported to be occurring in many effluents. Microalgae-based systems have been investigated in recent years as an environmentally safe alternative to chemical oxidation methods for elimination of these emerging contaminants. Therefore, a process utilizing the microalgal consortium was assessed for its potential to tolerate environmentally high concentrations of pharmaceutical drugs and also to simultaneously remove the synthetic hormone estradiol, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, and antibacterial agent triclosan. The effective concentration with 50% mortality for the consortium was determined for each contaminant as 16, 8, and 8 mg L-1 for estradiol, diclofenac, and triclosan, respectively. These three drugs were then spiked separately in algal growth media at effective concentration with 50% mortality, and the microalgal growth in presence of these drugs and the drug removal was monitored in shake-flask setup. The study shows substantial removal of estradiol 91.73% +/- 0.0175, diclofenac 74.68% +/- 0.0092, and triclosan 78.47% +/- 0.015 by the microalgal consortium during their growth phase. Further, it was observed that degradation of the drugs by microalgae was the prominent removal mechanism and not adsorption. Estradiol and diclofenac did not show any immediate negative impacts on the microalgal growth as seen from the biomass and chlorophyll content measurements. However, triclosan proved detrimental to the microalgal growth as the consortium did not survive beyond 5 days after spiking. Promising results for emerging contaminants removal was obtained, and a treatment system can be designed to remove different drugs from wastewater by using the naturally occurring microalgal consortium.

TI Evidence for selection of multi-resistant E. coli by hospital effluent
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Antibiotic resistance; Resistance selection; Hospital effluent
AB There is a risk that residues of antibiotics and other antimicrobials in hospital and municipal wastewaters could select for resistant bacteria. Still, direct experimental evidence for selection is lacking. Here, we investigated if effluent from a large Swedish hospital, as well as influent and effluent from the connected municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) select for antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli in three controlled experimental setups. Exposure of sterile-filtered hospital effluent to a planktonic mix of 149 different E. coli wastewater isolates showed a strong selection of multi-resistant strains. Accordingly, exposure to a complex wastewater community selected for strains resistant to several antibiotic classes. Exposing individual strains with variable resistance patterns revealed a rapid bactericidal effect of hospital effluent on susceptible, but not multi-resistant E. coli. No selection was observed after exposure to WWTP effluent, while exposure to WWTP influent indicated a small selective effect for ceftazidime and cefadroxil resistant strains, and only in the E. coli mix assay. An analysis of commonly used antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in combination with growth and resistance pattern of individual E. coli isolates suggested a possible contribution of ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams to the se-lection by hospital effluent. However, more research is needed to clarify the contribution from different selective agents. While this study does not indicate selection by the studied WWTP effluent, there is some indications of selective effects by municipal influent on beta-lactam-resistant strains. Such effects may be more pronounced in countries with higher antibiotic use than Sweden. Despite the limited antibiotic use in Sweden, the hospital effluent strongly and consistently selected for multi-resistance, indicating widespread risks. Hence, there is an urgent need for further evaluation of risks for resistance selection in hospital sewers, as well as for strategies to remove selective agents and resistant bacteria.

AB In a water scarcity scenario, the reused wastewater could be an essential source for agricultural irrigation considering that 60% of fresh water is destined to this area. In this study, an organic fertilizer (Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, DTPA) was used as a new chelating agent of iron for photo-Fenton's application at neutral pH using LEDs. Secondary effluents with different characteristics were tested for propranolol removal and bacterial inactivation. With DTPA, the best results were achieved with MBR matrix: 94.0% of propranolol removal and total bacterial inactivation after 120 min. IFAS matrix showed the worst results: 63.2% of propranolol removal and only 2-log reduction for Total Coliforms. The performance of DTPA as chelating agent was compared with EDTA and EDDS with two matrices. In MBR matrix, propranolol removal with EDTA was 100% in 15 min, while DTPA and EDDS reached similar results at 120 min (94.0 and 91.3%), respectively. The iron precipitation was evaluated, and DTPA showed high stability with Fe2+ (only 10.4% of iron reduction instead 97.3% for EDDS). In addition, it looks like that the stability of iron chelates plays an important role in bacterial inactivation. Thus, the experiments with DTPA showed the lowest bacterial growth-on-the-plate after 72 h of the end of the experiment. Biodegradability and phytotoxicity were also evaluated and the experiments with DTPA had the lowest toxicity. The results of the experiments performed with DTPA were compared with the values in Proposal for agricultural water reuse suggesting that treated effluent accomplish the requirements for agriculture.

AB The performance of a lab-scale submerged membrane bioreactor system (SMBR) for treating a process wastewater containing the pharmaceutical active compound (PhAc) etodolac with four different microfiltration (MF) membranes (MP005, MV02, CA, and MCE) was investigated at three different sludge retention times (SRTs) under constant pressure. In the first phase of the study, the continuous bioreactor system was operated at SRTs of 15 and 30 days and without sludge wasting (WSW). After steady state conditions were reached, the SMBR process was started as the second phase. Short-term filtration (24 h) tests were conducted for each SRT. When the SRTs were increased, both permeate volumes and steady-state flux values increased. The best etodolac removals were obtained in case of WSW for both bioreactor system and SMBR. The etodolac removals achieved by the different membranes for the period WSW were observed in the following order: MV02 = MP005 > CA = MCE. In addition, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies for bioreactor system and SMBR were approximately 80 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 2%, respectively, at all SRTs. The COD removals at each of the three SRTs were similar for all of the membranes. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and soluble microbial products (SMPs) were analyzed as fouling control factors. Increasing the SRT caused increases in sludge concentrations in the SMBR as well as in increased etodolac removal, while EPS and SMP protein and carbohydrate concentrations decreased. Fouling on the pores and surfaces of the membranes were characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and contact angle measurements. The resistance in series model was used to evaluate the flux decline caused by the gel layer, cake resistance, and internal pore blocking in the MF membranes at the three different SRTs.

AB The occurrence of 28 pharmaceuticals of major human consumption in Spain, including analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, and beta-blockers, was assessed along the Ebro river basin, one of the biggest irrigated lands in that country. Target compounds were simultaneously analyzed by off-line solid-phase extraction, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The loads of detected pharmaceuticals and their removal rates were studied in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the main cities along the basin. Total loads ranged from 2 to 5 and from 0.5 to 1.5 g/d/1,000 inhabitants in influent and effluent wastewaters, respectively. High removal rates (60-90%) were achieved mainly for analgesics and anti-inflammatories. The other groups showed lower rates, ranging from 20 to 60%, and in most cases, the antiepileptic carbamazepine, macrolide antibiotics, and trimethoprim were not eliminated at all. Finally, the contribution of WWTP effluents to the presence of pharmaceuticals in receiving river waters was surveyed. In receiving surface water, the most ubiquitous compounds were the analgesics and anti-inflammatories ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen; the lipid regulators bezafibrate and gemfibrozil; the antibiotics erythromycin, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and less frequently, ofloxacin; the antiepileptic carbamazepine; the antihistamine ranitidine; and the beta-blockers atenolol and sotalol. Although levels found in WWTP effluents ranged from low mu g/L to high ng/L, pharmaceuticals in river waters occurred at levels at least one order of magnitude lower (low ng/L range) because of dilution effect. From the results obtained, it was proved that WWTP are hot spots of aquatic contamination concerning pharmaceuticals of human consumption.

AB In this study, the toxic effects of binary mixtures of Pharmaceutical Active Compounds (PhACs) that are observed in the effluents from a wide range sewage treatment plants and surface water bodies were investigated using the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri (Microtox (R) test). The selected chemicals were the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac sodium [DCF] and the anti-epileptic carbamazepine [CBZ]. In addition, caffeine [CFF], a psychoactive stimulant of the central nervous system, was also included in the study. Binary combinations were prepared at a predefined ratio that corresponded to the individual IC50 values of the investigated compounds (equitoxic ratio). The experimental results were compared with those obtained using the two most frequently used predictive models in aquatic toxicology: the Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA) models. The results indicated that both models predict the observed mixture toxicity of the DCF-CBZ and DCF-CFF mixtures quite well. However, in the case of CFF-CBZ, both models slightly overestimated the experimental results, suggesting the presence of a potential antagonistic effect. The application of the Combination Index (CI) method, which allows us to identify and quantify the nature of the interactions between the chemicals present in a mixture (synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects), confirmed the additive behaviour of the DCF-CBZ and DCF-CFF combinations and the slightly antagonistic effect observed for the binary mixture of CFF-CBZ.

AB This study aims to evaluate the dynamics and their ecological risks for aquatic species of lipid regulator, nervous stimulant, anti-inflammatory and endocrine disrupters in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), submerged aerated biological filters (SABF) and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW) reactors that treat swine wastewater. Four organic loads of swine wastewater (SW) were used according to changing the chemical oxygen demand. 13 contaminants were quantified, standing out the endocrine disruptors, lipid regulator and anti-inflammatory. In phase III, 8318.4 ng L-1 of 4-ocylphenol was found at the influent of the UASB reactor and removal from 1877.1 to 13.7 ng L-1 in the bisphenol A system. With the maximum organic load, there was a reduction among all the treatment units, with concentrations between 1877.1 and 13.7 ng L-1 of bisphenol A and had naproxen removal of 94.5% and 2,7 ng L-1 after treating phases II and III. It was found that 24.6% of the contaminants presented a high ecological risk, with maximum values of 27.4 (4-nonylphenol, phase II), 24.6 and 5.9 (17 beta-estradiol, phase IV and I, respectively), 13.4 (4-ocylphenol, phase III) and 4.4 (estrone, phase IV) in the influent system. The reduction of ecological risk potentials was optimized by SABF and HSSF-CW. The effect oxygen availability and microbiological activities optimized the reduction of ecological risks on zebrafish (Danio rerio) and cnidarian (Hydra attenuata) species, moreover, the reduction of mass flows and ecological risks of the emerging contaminants are associated with the use of biological reactors in series and organic stabilizations.

AB In this paper, we investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SUX) antibiotic in pharmaceutical wastewaters by employing a ternary heterostructure catalyst composed of MgO and ZnO nano particles anchored on graphene nanosheets (MZG) under UV-A (LED) and US irradiations as a novel study. Synthesis of MZG was performed via multi-step hydrothermal-assisted method and characterized by employing XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, BET, EIS, DRS, EDS, TEM, EDX, and TGA techniques. By introduction of ZnO and graphene, photocatalytic activity of MgO was enhanced in both UV and visible regions. A good catalytic potential and significant synergistic effect was obtained for ternary system (MZG/LED/US) compared to binary and single processes. After 120 min of sonophotocatalytic treatment, complete degradation of SUX (55 mg/L) can be attained at MZG: 0.8 g/L, pH: 9.0, LED power: 90 W and US power: 250 W. Kinetic studies revealed that sonophotocatalytic degradation process followed the pseudo first-order kinetic model. HO% species were detected as dominant oxidative free radicals which contributed in SUX degradation process. A comprehensive possible mechanism was proposed for photocatalysis and sonocatalysis processes involved in MZG/LED/US system in detail. The nanocomposite was reused for six successive cycles with maximum 9.8% drop in degradation efficiency. An efficient improvement was achieved in the biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater after treatment by MZG/LED/US with 94% and 81% removal of COD and TOC, respectively. To conclude, combining MZG, LED and US waves can be utilized as a novel and efficient strategy to treat real pharmaceutical wastewaters in practical applications, owing to high performance in degradation/mineralization, excellent reusability potential and high activity in sonolysis and photolysis systems.

AB Increasing presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in water sources and their adverse health effects on aquatic life are major concerns for water utilities and authorities worldwide. The oxidation kinetics for degradation of ozone resistant steroid hormones were investigated to quantify their removal in natural water under varying water temperatures and pH. Studying effect of temperature on oxidation of these compounds is one of the novel aspects of this research. The fate of four progestogens (progesterone, medroxyprogesetrone, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone) and, for the first time, of the androgenic steroid testosterone, in the presence of ozone was measured at bench scale in ultrapure water, natural surface water and wastewater. The estimated second order constant rate for testosterone of 590 +/- 0.13 M(-1)s(-1) was comparable to our estimates and previous reports for similar structure progesterone (444-601 M(-1)s(-1)) and medroxyprogesterone (532 +/- 0.04 M(-1)s(-1)) and significantly lower than for levonorgestrel (2233 M(-1)s(-1)) and norethindrone (2292 M-1 s(-1)). For all compounds the second-order rate constants increased from 3 folds for norethindrone to 5.5 folds for progesterone with temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 degrees C. The required activation energy was estimated for the five selected steroids and ranged from 30 Kj mol(-1) (norethindrone) to 39 Kj mol(-1) (progesterone). The removal rates of the selected compounds were predicted in natural water and wastewater. Finally, we showed that ozonation using typical disinfection dosages (Ct(o3) = 2 mg min L-1) were capable of removing 77% (progesterone) to 99% (levonorgestrel) at 21 degrees C and even less (47% medroxyprogesterone to 96% norethindrone) at 5 degrees C of the selected compounds.

AB This study investigated the removal of 15 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) occurring at ambient concentrations from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by advanced oxidation using UV/H2O2 at pilot-scale. Pseudo first-order rate constants (k(obs)) for photolytic as well as combined oxidative and photolytic degradation observed at pilot-scale were validated with results from a bench-scale collimated beam device. No significant difference was determined between pilot- and lab-scale performance. During continuous pilot-scale operation at constant UV fluence of 800 mJ/cm(2) and H2O2 dosage of 10 mg/L, the removal of various TOrCs was investigated. The average observed removal for photo-susceptible (k(UV)>10(-3) cm(2)/mJ; like diclofenac, iopromide and sulfamethoxazole), moderately photo-susceptible (10(-4)<k(UV)<10(-3) cm(2)/mL; like climbazole, tramadol, sotalol, citalopram, benzotriazole, venlafaxine and metoprolol), and most photo-resistant (k(UV)<10(-4) cm(2)/mJ; like primidone, carbamazepine and gabapentin) compounds was 90%, 49% and 37% including outliers, respectively. The poorly reactive compound TCEP was not significantly eliminated during pilot-scale experiments. Additionally, based on removal kinetics of photo-resistant TOrCs, continuous pilot-scale operation revealed high variations of OH-radical exposure determined from removal kinetics of photo-resistant TOrCs, primarily due to nitrite concentration fluctuations in the feed water. Furthermore, a correlation between OH-radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by mechanistic modeling using UV fluence, H2O2 dosage, and standard water quality parameters (i.e., DOC, NO3-, NO2- and HCO3-) as model input data. This correlation revealed the possibility of OH-radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proved its applicability for pilot-scale operations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) contains emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that have estrogenic properties. PPCPs are thought to be responsible for feminization of male fish in heavily urbanized areas around the globe. While many observations of feminized male fish have been made, the impact of feminization on reproductive success is not well understood. To address this lack of knowledge of the impacts of feminization, we examined the reproductive fitness of rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum), a fish that is also known to have been feminized in some reaches of the Grand River, Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In order to assess their reproductive health, somatic indices, gonadal steroid production, fecundity, and histological severity of intersex were measured in male rainbow darter collected through an urban gradient. Reproductive fitness was assessed by stripping milt and eggs from wild spawning fish, fertilizing eggs manually, and rearing embryos to hatch. The fertilization success and survival of embryos to hatch were compared among sites. In this study, it was found that rainbow darter collected at sites near a large municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) had decreased gonad size, increased severity of intersex, and decreased androgen production relative to other sites. Fish collected near the largest MWWTP also had lower fertilization success and survival to hatch. In contrast, fish collected near a second MWWTP farther upstream had comparable fertilization success, but lower survival to hatch relative to the upstream rural reference site. Intersex severity was negatively correlated with fertilization success, but not survival to hatch, suggesting that intersex is a good indicator of a population's fertilization success. Further investigation is required in order to determine if feminization will impact the sustainability of wild populations of fish. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the occurrences of bacteria families and relevant pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater effluents from Bogota (Colombia), and their treatment by the photo-electro-Fenton process were studied. Twenty-five representative pharmaceuticals (azithromycin, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, enalapril, gabapentin, iopromide, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, valsartan, clindamycin, erythromycin, levamisole, lincomycin, norfloxacin, oxolinic acid, phenazone, primidone, salbutamol, sulfadiazine, tetracycline, tramadol, and venlafaxine) were quantified in the effluent by LCMS/MS analysis. Four of these target compounds (azithromycin, diclofenac, trimethoprim, norfloxacin) were found at concentrations that represent an environmental risk. In addition, several bacteria families related to water and foodborne diseases were identified in such effluents (e.g., Pseudomonadaceae, cam pylobacteraceae, Aeromonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroidaceae), via shotgun-metagenomic technique. Then, a bench-scale photo-electro-Fenton (PEF) system equipped with a DSA anode (Ti/IrO2-SnO2) and a GDE cathode was applied to treat such effluents. After 60 min, this treatment led to a decrease in the ratio of the bacterial content in the original samples, similar to 150 thousand times, and a pondered removal of 66.12% for the pharmaceuticals. The study of the process pathways indicated that the bacteria and pharmaceuticals elimination mainly occurred through attacks of hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Interestingly, in the case of pharmaceuticals, their environmental risk quotients were diminished after the PEF application. Furthermore, the prolonged action of this electrochemical process induced similar to 15% of mineralization and a significant reduction of the total DNA (removal >85%). Hence, the photo-electro-Fenton process showed to be a promising alternative to deal with municipal effluents for limiting the waterborne diseases, pollution by pharmaceuticals, and mobility/availability of genetic material coming from microorganisms.

AB This study investigated the potential of sediments accumulated in sewer systems to record human activities through the occurrence of drug target residues (DTR). The installation studied is 17 m deep underground decantation tank that traps the coarse fractions of a unitary sewer system (northern part of Orleans, France), collecting both stormwater and wastewater. The sediments deposited in this tank could constitute a nonesuch opportunity to study the historical evolution of illicit and licit drug consumption in the catchment, however, the deposition processes and the record of DTRs remain largely unknown at present. Five cores were acquired from 2015 to 2017. One hundred fifty-two sediment samples were extracted using a mixture of ultra-pure water:methanol (1:1) prior to analysis of the extracts by high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Several classical sedimentological analyses such as total organic carbon, facies description and granulometry were also performed on these samples, in order to understand the most important factors (e.g., physico-chemical properties of the DTRs, solid type, assumed load in wastewater) impacting their deposition. The key role of the speciation of DTRs was highlighted by the higher contents in neutral and anionic DTRs in organic layers, whereas only cationic DTRs were found in mineral layers. The considerable modifications in the sediments' properties, generated by distinct origins (i.e., stormwater or wastewater), are therefore the most important drivers that must be taken into account when back-calculating the historical patterns of drug consumption from their DTR concentrations in decantation tank sediments. Further research remains necessary to fully understand the deposition process, but this study provides new clues explaining these temporal evolutions.

AB The study examines the optimum condition of an electro-coagulation (EC) unit for treatment of hospital wastewater (HWW) using iron (Fe) electrodes. The impact of factors such as pH, current, and electrolysis time on COD, chloride, and anode dissolution was investigated. For this purpose, Box-Behnken (BB) design based on the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design and analyze the results. The predicted value of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and chloride removal at optimum conditions (pH: 7.41, current: 2.64 A and electrolysis time: 41.31 min) were 92.81% and 71.23%, respectively. At same optimum conditions, the value of energy and electrode consumption per kg of COD was 0.06376 kWh/kg COD and 1.362 kg/kg COD, respectively. High value ofR(2)(i.e.,R-2 > 99%) for all three responses (Y-1,Y-2, andY(3)) obtained from ANOVA confirms that the proposed model is valid, accurate, and acceptable. The kinetic study shows linear relationship and follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. Pareto graph shows that the percentage impact of current factor on COD and chloride removal was maximum, that is, 54.984% and 66.79%, respectively. Lastly, the total cost of EC treatment was calculated in terms of COD removal and was found to be 55.47 (sic)/kg COD. Practitioner points
   Using Fe electrode results in 92.81% COD and 71.23% Chloride removal, respectively. High value ofR(2) > 99% for all three responses from ANOVA confirms the proposed model is valid. Pareto analysis shows current factor has maximum percentage impact on pollutant removal. Kinetic study shows linear relationship and follows pseudo-first-order kinetics.

AB Trends in the widespread use of personal care products (PCPs) containing triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) have led to continuous emissions of these chemicals into the environment. Consequently, both chemicals are ubiquitously present at high concentrations in the aquatic systems based on widely reported measured environmental concentration (MECs) data in different environmental systems (e.g. freshwater) worldwide, especially in developed countries. In developing countries, however, lack of MECs data is a major issue, and therefore, inhibits effective risk assessment of these chemicals. Herein, TCS and TCC releases from personal care products (PCPs) were quantified, using a modelling approach to determine predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in wastewater, freshwater, and soils, and likely risk(s) were estimated by calculating risk quotient (RQs). TCS and TCC in freshwater had RQs >1 based on estimated PECs with wide variations (approximate to 2-232) as performed across the three dilutions factors (1,3, and 10) considered in this study; an indicator of their likely adverse effect on freshwater organisms. In untreated and treated wastewater, TCS RQs values for bacteria were >1, but <1 for TCC, implying the former may adversely affect the functioning of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and with no plausible impacts from the latter. In terrestrial systems, RQ results for individual chemicals revealed no or limited risks; therefore, additional investigations are required on their toxicity, as effects data was very limited and characterised by wide variations. Future national monitoring programs in developing countries should consider including TCS and TCC as the results suggest both chemicals are of concern to freshwater, and TCS in WWTPs. Potential risks of their metabolites remain unquantified to date. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) has been recognized as a cost-effective membrane technology for wastewater reclamation, while little information is available about its performance in pilot scale for practical engineering application. In addition, the biofouling issue is always a barrier to membrane process for its long-term stable operation which requires further investigations. In this study, the performance of a pilot-scale two-stage NF system was continually monitored for three months. The membrane autopsy characterization was conducted when the irreversible membrane fouling occurred. The rejections of COD, TOC and TP by NF were 96.5 +/- 1.2%, 91.9 +/- 1.9% and 97.7 +/- 2.1%, respectively. A total of 23 emerging contaminants have been detected in NF influent, including 19 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and four environmental estrogens (EEs). Except for bisphenol A (57.6%) and ibuprofen (69.9%), the rejections of other 21 emerging contaminants were all higher than 80% by the NF system. Microbial community structure analysis showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the two predominant bacteria on the membrane surface with percentages of 34.1%-41.0% and 23.4%-30.6% at phylum level, respectively. At genus level, Stenotrophomonas and Pseudoxanthomonas were primarily dominant in the first stage, while Cloacibacterium and Methyloversatilis showed higher relative abundances in the second stage. Sphingopyxis was an extremely stubborn genus on the membrane surface. Besides, the biodiversity of microbial communities in the first stage was higher than that in the second stage, possibly showing more severe biofouling in the first stage of the two-stage NF system. This study has provided insights to understand the practical performance of NF technology in pilot scale and could give guideline for biofouling control in NF engineering application.

AB The transformation products (TPs) of water contaminants generated during wastewater treatment can sometimes be equally or even more hazardous than the parent compounds. Therefore, for a comprehensive assessment of removal efficiency of a water treatment technology, it is mandatory to monitor not only the pollutants but also of their TPs. However, this type of evaluation studies is lacking in the case of water combined treatments. In this study, the elimination of metoprolol (MTP), metoprolol acid (MTPA) and the TPs generated was evaluated in pure water and hospital wastewater (HWW) using UV/H2O2 before and after fungal (FG) or conventional activated sludge (CAS). The major transformation pathways were suggested in terms of transformation of the parent compounds through bio-transformation and photo-transformation mechanisms. The results reveal an extended removal of MTP, MTPA and TPs after UV/H2O2 single experiment treating spiked pure water at 2.5 mg/L, without increasing the treated effluents toxicity. However, combined treatments were required to achieve similar removal percentages in spiked real HWW at 2.0 mu g/L: while AOPs combined with FG exhibited lower removal efficiencies with generation of persistent intermediates (such as alpha-HMTP and TP240), AOPs combined with CAS attained the higher persistent TPs removal. In particular, AOP + CAS was classified as the most effective combination for HWW with the highest removal of the parent compounds (86% for MTP and 100% for MTPA), of the intermediates generated (up to 85%) and with a low presence of toxic TPs (such as O-DMTP). This study demonstrates that comprehensive evaluation of the intermediates generated along water treatment technologies is highly recommended to successfully evaluate their removal efficiencies.

AB A multi-component geochemical dataset was collected from groundwater and surface-water bodies associated with the urban Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer, Colorado, USA, to facilitate analysis of recharge sources, geochemical interactions, and groundwater-residence times. Results indicate that groundwater can be separated into three distinct geochemical zones based on location within the flow system and proximity to surface water, and these zones can be used to infer sources of recharge and groundwater movement through the aquifer. Rare-earth-element concentrations and detections of wastewater-indicator compounds indicate the presence of effluent from wastewater-treatment plants in both groundwater and surface water. Effluent presence in groundwater indicates that streams in the area lose to groundwater in some seasons and are a source of focused groundwater recharge. Distributions of pharmaceuticals and wastewater-indicator compounds also inform an understanding of groundwater-surface-water interactions. Noble-gas isotopes corroborate rare-earth-element data in indicating geochemical evolution within the aquifer from recharge area to discharge area and qualitatively indicate variable groundwater-residence times and mixing with pre-modern groundwater. Quantitative groundwater-residence times calculated from H-3/He-3, SF6, and lumped-parameter modeling generally are less than 20 years, but the presence of mixing with older groundwater of an unknown age is also indicated at selected locations. Future investigations would benefit by including groundwater-age tracers suited to quantification of mixing for both young (years to decades) and old (centuries and millennia) groundwater. This multi-faceted analysis facilitated development of a conceptual model for the investigated groundwater-flow system and illustrates the application of an encompassing suite of analytes in exploring hydrologic and geochemical interactions in complex systems.

AB Households in rural locations utilize septic tanks for wastewater treatment and can cause surface water contamination. A new methodology was developed to help investigate the role septic tanks play in the dissemination of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, personal care products and stimulants in the aqueous environment. Simultaneous analysis of 16 chiral and achiral anthropogenic markers was achieved using a Chirobiotic V2 (R) enantioselective column in polar ionic mode. The optimized method achieved quantitation limits for 16 compounds in the range 0.001-2.9 mu g L-1 and 0.0002-0.43 mu g L-1 for septic tank effluent and stream water, respectively. Application of the method to samples collected in North East Scotland found caffeine to be ubiquitous in all samples studied suggesting it as a good indicator of septic tank discharge. In rural streams studied, concentrations of all prescription drugs investigated were <= 0.02 mu g L-1. However, analgesics and stimulants were at high concentration in one location indicating direct discharge of septic tank wastewater (i.e., not dissipated through a soak away). For example, paracetamol, cotinine and caffeine were measured at 1100 mu g L-1, 31 mu g L-1 and 200 mu g L-1, respectively, which is comparable to septic tank effluents. Furthermore, S(+)-amphetamine and R(-)-amphetamine were present in this stream sample at 0.20 and 0.27 mu g L-1. This corresponds to an enantiomeric fraction of 0.43, which is typical of untreated wastewaters in the UK. Findings illustrate further study on the diffuse impact of septic tanks to surface water is needed and can be supported using this new multi-residue enantioselective method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing drug which is used widely in Europe and North America. In the environment, it is found as a persistent and recalcitrant contaminant, being one of the most prominent hazardous pharmaceuticals and personal care products in effluents of wastewater treatment plants. Phragmites australis is one of the species with both, the highest potential of detoxification and phytoremediation. It has been used successfully in the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater. Recently, the identification of endophytic microorganisms from different plant species growing in contaminated sites has provided a list of candidates which could be used as bio-inoculants for bioremediation of difficult compounds. In this study, Phragmites australis plants were exposed to 5 mg/L of carbamazepine. After 9 days the plants had removed 90% of the initial concentration. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from these plants and further characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the majority of these isolates belong to three groups: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Carbamazepine uptake and plant growth promoting (PGP) traits were analyzed among the isolates. Ninety percent of the isolates produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and all of them possess at least one of the PGP traits tested. One isolate identified as Chryseobacterium taeanense combines good carbamazepine uptake and all of the PGP traits. Rhizobium daejeonense can remove carbamazepine and produces 23 mu g/mL of IAA. Diaphorobacter nitroreducens and Achromobacter mucicolens are suitable for carbamazepine removal while both, Pseudomonas veronii and Pseudomonas lini show high siderophore production and phosphate solubilization. Alone or in combination, these isolates might be applied as inoculates in constructed wetlands in order to enhance the phytoremediation of carbamazepine during wastewater treatment.

AB This work investigated the application of a solar driven advanced oxidation process (solar photo-Fenton), for the degradation of antibiotics at low concentration level (mu g L-1) in secondary treated domestic effluents at a pilot-scale. The examined antibiotics were ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP). A compound parabolic collector (CPC) pilot plant was used for the photocatalytic experiments. The process was mainly evaluated by a fast and reliable analytical method based on a UPLC-MS/MS system. Solar photo-Fenton process using low iron and hydrogen peroxide doses ([Fe2+](0) = 5 mg L-1; [H2O2](0) = 75 mg L-1) was proved to be an efficient method for the elimination of these compounds with relatively high degradation rates. The photocatalytic degradation of OFX and TMP with the solar photo-Fenton process followed apparent first-order kinetics. A modification of the first-order kinetic expression was proposed and has been successfully used to explain the degradation kinetics of the compounds during the solar photo-Fenton treatment. The results demonstrated the capacity of the applied advanced process to reduce the initial wastewater toxicity against the examined plant species (Sorghum saccharatum, Lepidium sativum, Sinapis alba) and the water flea Daphnia magna. The phytotoxicity of the treated samples, expressed as root growth inhibition, was higher compared to that observed on the inhibition of seed germination. Enterococci, including those resistant to OFX and TMP, were completely eliminated at the end of the treatment. The total cost of the full scale unit for the treatment of 150 m(3) day(-1) of secondary wastewater effluent was found to be 0.85 (sic) m(-3). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water authorities and drinking water companies are challenged with the question if, where and how to abate contaminants of emerging concern in the urban water cycle. The most effective strategy under given conditions is often unclear to these stakeholders as it requires insight into several aspects of the contaminants such as sources, properties, and mitigation options. Furthermore the various parties in the urban water cycle are not always aware of each other's requirements and priorities. Processes to set priorities and come to agreements are lacking, hampering the articulation and implementation of possible solutions. To support decision makers with this task, a decision support system was developed to serve as a point of departure for getting the relevant stakeholders together and finding common ground. The decision support system was iteratively developed in stages. Stakeholders were interviewed and a decision support system prototype developed. Subsequently, this prototype was evaluated by the stakeholders and adjusted accordingly. The iterative process lead to a final system focused on the management of contaminants of emerging concern within the urban water cycle, from wastewater, surface water and groundwater to drinking water, that suggests mitigation methods beyond technical solutions. Possible wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques in combination with decentralised and nontechnical methods were taken into account in an integrated way. The system contains background information on contaminants of emerging concern such as physical/chemical characteristics, toxicity and legislative frameworks, water cycle entrance pathways and a database with associated possible mitigation methods. Monitoring data can be uploaded to assess environmental and human health risks in a specific water system. The developed system was received with great interest by potential users, and implemented in an international water cycle network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phenol is one of the most toxic pollutants which get into the water ponds and streams with wastewater from chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. The most effective method of wastewater treatment from phenol is its adsorption on activated carbon, but the disadvantages of this sorbent usage are its high cost, the necessity of regeneration and soot formation due to the brittleness of carbon atoms bonds. A new trend that has intensively developed in the practice of water treatment recently is the use of wastes of industrial and agricultural production as reagents for removing of pollutants from natural water and wastewater. Cellulose and keratin-containing wastes from processing of agricultural raw materials are of particular interest. The advantages of these reagents are available resource base, renewability, low cost, availability and ease of disposal. Therefore, in single-step static adsorption mode with the use of phenol solutions as the model systems the kinetics of phenol adsorption by natural materials, namely, wheat husk, rye husk, oat husk and barley husk was studied at different temperatures (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C). Rye husk did not show any sorption properties in relation to phenol. For wheat, oat and barley husks the adsorption isotherms were constructed in coordinates: 1/F = f(1/C), lgF = f(lgC), lnF = f(epsilon(2)). The equations which describe the processes of phenol sorption by wheat, oat and barley husks were calculated. It was found that processes of phenol adsorption by wheat, oats and barley husks can be better represented by the Dubinin - Radushkevich equation, although Langmuir equation can also be used to describe these processes with correlation coefficients more than 0,992. Also the thermodynamic constants and energy of phenol sorption by natural materials were determined.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of triclosan in the tropical rivers where received the effluents from a hospital wastewater treatment plant (HWWTP) in southern Taiwan. Three and ten sampling sites were selected at the Jiaosu River (S0-S2) and Dian-Bao River (S3-S12), respectively. The samples of the HWWTP influent, effluent and receiving river water and sediment were collected and analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Results showed that the triclosan level in surface water of the Jiaosu River and Dian-Bao River ranged from 3 to 68 ng/L and ranged from <2.7 to 51 ng/L, respectively. The hospital did contribute a loading of triclosan to the neighboring river. The mean value of triclosan concentration in the downstream surface water of the Jiaosu River (S1 20.2 ng/L) was approximately three times higher than that of the background level (S0 6.0 ng/L) (p=0.011). The concentrations of triclosan in two surface water samples were over the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 50 ng/L for algae. In addition, significant seasonal differences of triclosan in surface water of Jiaosu River (p=0.020) and the HWWTP effluents (p=0.302) were also observed. The concentrations of triclosan in sediments of these two rivers seemed stable. On average, triclosan was detected in 86 % of the sediment samples with a range from <1.1 to 13 ng/g. Triclosan in surface water and sediments of the tropical rivers might be rapidly photolyzed due to plenty of sunshine. It is worth to further investigate the occurrence and fate of triclosan photoproduct in the aquatic environment of the tropics.

AB In order to transform a wide range of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), the three oxidative enzymes laccase (Lac) from Trametes versicolor, versatile peroxidase (VP) from Bjerkandera adusta and glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergillus niger were concomitantly cross-linked after aggregation, thus, making a combined cross-linked enzyme aggregate (combi-CLEA) that was versatile and involved in an enzymatic cascade reaction. From the initial enzymes about 30% of initial laccase activity was recovered along with 40% for each of VP and GOD. The combi-CLEA showed good results in conditions close to those of real wastewater (neutral pH and medium temperature) as well as a good ability to resist to denaturing conditions such as high temperature (60 C) and low pH (3). Batch experiments were realized to test the free enzyme's ability to degrade, a PhACs cocktail, mainly in a synthetic wastewater containing acetaminophen, naproxen, mefenamic acid, indometacin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, caffeine, diazepam, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, fenofibrate and bezafibrate, carbamazepine and its by-product 10-11 epoxy-carbamazepine. High removal was achieved (more than 80%) for the five first compounds. Then, the elimination ability of the combi-CLEA with or without hydrogen peroxide, glucose or manganese sulfate was determined. Globally, our results demonstrated that VP has a wider removal spectrum than Lac. These removal features are enhanced under more specific conditions, whereas the combi-CLEAcombined advantages of both VP and laccase. Finally, the elimination of PhACs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent using the combi-CLEA was marginally investigated. Concentrations of most of the selected PhACs were below the limit of quantification (lower than 20 ng/L) except for acetaminophen. Its combi-CLEA-mediated removal reached up to 25%.

AB Stable and efficient performance of biological treatment plants requires optimization of treatment system operating parameters. Among the various operating parameters, temperature is an important factor that influences the treatment system microbial community, which is responsible for the efficient removal of organic pollutants. This study investigated the effect of temperature on the microbiome of a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) treating hospital wastewater (HWW). Specifically, the effect of temperatures (T=20 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 10 degrees C) on the removal of pharmaceuticals from HWW was examined. The maximum removal of chemical oxygen demand (similar to 70%) and ammoniacal nitrogen (similar to 75%) in the SMBR occurred at 20 degrees C. The suspended solids (SS) concentration in the SMBR decreased from 8.5 g L-1 SS at 20 degrees C to 6.75 g L-1 SS at 15 degrees C and to 5.2 g L-1 SS at 10 degrees C. At the lowest temperature (10 degrees C), there was moderate removal of ibuprofen, hydroxyl-ibuprofen estrone, and caffeine, but the removal of sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, diclofenac, hydroxy diclofenac, atenolol, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine was inhibited substantially relative to that at higher temperatures. The microbiome analysis indicated a reduction in the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosospira, Rhodanobacter, and Sphingobium) at low temperatures, which appeared to be correlated with the decrease in performance. Analysis of the microeukaryote community revealed a massive decrease in the relative abundance of the ciliate population at the low temperature and an increase in the abundance of the fungal group (Basidiomycota and unclassified fungus). Despite the dominance of fungal groups at the lower temperature, the decreased SMBR performance suggests that those fungal groups did not play an important role in pharmaceutical degradation.

AB Cerium fluoride (CeF3) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and applied in polysulfone (PS) membrane fabricated by phase inversion method. The produced nanocomposite membranes (PS/CeF3) with different contents of CeF3 NPS (0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1% w/w) were used to treat pharmaceutical wastewaters. The membranes were characterized by FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, porosity, and water contact angle analyses. Evaluation of the characteristics and performance of the nanocomposite membranes confirmed that utilizing photocatalytic CeF(3)NPs in membrane structure could effectively decompose organic contaminants in pharmaceutical wastewaters. It also improves the hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of membrane during filtration especially, in the presence of UV irradiation. The permeate flux of the PS membrane increased from 35.1 to 63.77 l/m(2)h by embedding 0.75% of CeF(3)NPs in membrane structure due to the porosity enhancement from 71.36-78.42% and the decrease in contact angle from 62.9o to 53.73o. Moreover, the flux decline of PS/CeF3-0.75% membrane under UV irradiation was from 63.6 to 46.1 l/m(2)h that considerably lower than that of the neat PS membrane (from 34.7 to 4.9). On the other hand, the degradation efficiency of PS/CeF3-0.75% membrane was more than 97%, and COD removed was more than 65% while they were 75% and 31%, respectively for the nascent PS membrane. Therefore, applying the appropriate amount of CeF(3)NPs in PS membranes not only greatly increased the permeate flux but also significantly enhanced the degradation efficiency and COD removal. This indicates that nanocomposite membranes can be confidently applied for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment UV irradiation.

AB There is a growing interest in the occurrence and sources of pharmaceutical substances in the environment. This paper reports the first detailed transect of pharmaceutical occurrence along the River Thames, UK, from source to sea, undertaken during a period of high flow in 2016. In 37 samples a total of 41 pharmaceuticals and 2 lifestyle compounds (cocaine and sucralose) were detected. Total concentration of pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.0012 mu g/l to 10.24 mu g/l with a median of 2.6 mu g/l. Sucralose concentrations varied from <0.01 to 5.9 mu g/l with a median concentration of 1.93 mu g/l and was detected in every sample except the groundwater-dominated sources of the Thames. Antimicrobials, including those on the surface water watch list (erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin) were detected in every site downstream of the Thames source. Diclofenac, recently on the surface water watch list, was detected in 97% of Thames samples and above the proposed EQS of 0.1 mu g/l in 12 samples. Distinct increases in concentration and number of pharmaceuticals were found downstream of the Oxford, Mogdon and Hogsmill wastewater treatment works (WWTW) but were more subdued downstream of the Crossness and Beckton WWTW due to the tidal nature of the Thames and combined sewer outflows. Sucralose was found to be an excellent tracer of wastewaters (treated and untreated) and can be used as a proxy for many pharmaceuticals. Paracetamol and ibuprofen were tracers of untreated wastewater inputs to the Thames due to their high biodegradation within WWTWs. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Scarcity of water and concerns about the ecotoxicity of micro-contaminants are driving an interest in the use of advanced tertiary processes in wastewater treatment plants. However, the life cycle environmental implications of these treatments remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, this study evaluates through life cycle assessment the following four advanced process options for removal of micro-contaminants from real effluents: i) solar photo-Fenton (SPF) operating at acidic pH; ii) acidic SPF coupled with nanofiltration (NF); iii) SPF operating at neutral pH; and iv) neutral SPF coupled with NF. The results show that acidic SPF coupled with NF is the best option for all 15 impacts considered. For example, its climate change potential is almost three times lower than that of the neutral SPF process (311 vs 928 kg CO2 eq./1000 m(3) of treated effluent). The latter is the worst option for 12 impact categories. For the remaining three impacts (acidification, depletion of metals and particulate matter formation), acidic SPF without NF is least sustainable; it is also the second worst option for seven other impacts. Neutral SPF with NF is the second worst technology for climate change, ozone and fossil fuel depletion as well as marine eutrophication. In summary, both types of SPF perform better environmentally with than without NF and the acidic SPF treatment is more sustainable than the neutral version. Thus, the results of this work suggest that ongoing efforts on developing neutral SPF should instead be focused on further improvements of its acidic equivalent coupled with NF. These results can also be used to inform future development of policy related to the removal of micro-contaminants from wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seven treatment wetlands and a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were weekly monitored over the course of one year for removal of conventional wastewater parameters, selected micropollutants (caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame, and carbamazepine) and biological effects. The treatment wetland designs investigated include a horizontal subsurface flow (HF) wetland and a variety of wetlands with intensification (aeration, two-stages, or reciprocating flow). Complementary to the common approach of analyzing individual chemicals, in vitro bioassays can detect the toxicity of a mixture of known and unknown components given in a water sample. A panel of five in vitro cell-based reporter gene bioassays was selected to cover environmentally relevant endpoints (AhR: indicative of activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor; PPAR gamma: binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; ER alpha: activation of the estrogen receptor alpha; GR: activation of the glucocorticoid receptor; oxidative stress response). While carbamazepine was persistent in the intensified treatment wetlands, mean monthly mass removal of up to 51% was achieved in the HF wetland. The two-stage wetland system showed highest removal efficacy for all biological effects (91% to >99%). The removal efficacy for biological effects ranged from 56% to 77% for the HF wetland and 60% to 99% for the WWTP. Bioanalytical equivalent concentrations (BEQs) for AhR, PPAR gamma, and oxidative stress response were often below the recommended effect-based trigger (EBT) values for surface water, indicating the great benefit for using nature-based solutions for water treatment. Intensified treatment wetlands remove both individual micropollutants and mixture effects more efficiently than conventional (non-aerated) HF wetlands, and in some cases, the WWTP.

AB Limited reviews have investigated sources, behaviour and health risks of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the wastewater-human pathway. The current review seeks to: (1) determine hotspot sources of ARGs, and their behaviour and fate in wastewaters; (2) discuss ARG health risks, and risk factors; and (3) highlight future research directions. Diverse ARGs conferring single and multi-drug resistance to common and last-resort antimicrobials are widely reported. Hotspot sources of ARGs include medical facilities, pharmaceutical industries, aquaculture and animal systems. Non-engineered landfills, on-site sanitation, funeral parlours and gravesites constitute under-studied potential hotspot sources. Hydrological processes, wind and vectors mobilize ARGs from sources into aquatic systems. Wastewater treatment processes, the nature of ARGs and environmental conditions control the behaviour and fate of ARGs. Consumption of contaminated food and water, vectors, inhalation and dermal contact transfer ARGs from wastewaters to humans. Health risks include development of antimicrobial resistance, although evidence directly linking ARGs in wastewater to resistance remains weak. Ecological risks include shifts in physiological behaviour, community structure and ecosystem functions, including expression of shock-responses and virulence, biofilm formation and mutations. These shifts could increase colonization ability and survival of pathogenic microbes, thereby posing significant ecological, human and animal health risks. Overall, the behaviour and risks of ARGs are controlled by complex human-environmental interactions, and have far-reaching policy implications, hence ARGs can be considered as a 'super-wicked' problem. To minimize the risks, a conceptual framework entailing a ten-point strategy is highlighted. Under-studied hotspot sources, behaviour and fate, human ecotoxicology and risk assessments warrant further research.

AB The photochemical formation of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) from effluent organic matter (EfOM) was evaluated using three bulk wastewater samples collected at different treatment facilities under simulated sunlight. For the samples studied, the formation rates of HO center dot (R-HO center dot) were obtained from the formation rate of phenol following the hydroxylation of benzene. The values of R-HO center dot ranged from 2.3 to 3.8 x 10(-10) M s(-1) for the samples studied. The formation rate of HO center dot from nitrate photolysis (R-NO3(HO center dot)) was determined to be 3.0 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot M-NO3(-1) s(-1). The HO center dot production rate from EfOM (R-EfOM(HO)) ranged from 0.76 to 1.3 x 10(-10) M s(-1). For the wastewater samples studied, R-EfOM(HO center dot) varied from 1.5 to 2.4 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot M-C(-1) s(-1) on molar carbon basis, which was dose to HO center dot production from nitrate photolysis. The apparent quantum yield for the formation of HO center dot from nitrate (Phi(a)(NO3-HO center dot)) was determined as 0.010 +/- 0.001 for the wavelength range 290-400 nm in ultrapure water. The apparent quantum yield for HO center dot formation in EfOM (Phi(a)(EfOM-HO center dot)) ranged from 6.1 to 9.8 x 10(-5), compared to 2.99 to 4.56 x 10-5 for organic matter (OM) isolates. The results indicate that wastewater effluents could produce significant concentrations of HO center dot, as shown by potential higher nitrate levels and relatively higher quantum yields of HO center dot fori-nation from EfOM.

AB Detection and spatial distribution of 14 drugs of abuse and 17 pharmaceuticals in surface waters was investigated to determine transport hydrological connectivity between urban, agriculture and natural environments. Solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied to all samples. To determine spatial incidence of contaminants, analytical results of target compounds were georeferenced and integrated into a geographical information systems structure together with layers of municipal population, location of sewage water treatment plants and irrigation channels and sectors. The methodology was applied to L'Albufera Natural Park in Valencia (Spain). A total of 9 drugs of abuse were detected at 16 points (76% of the sample sites). Cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, were the most detected substances, being found in 12 and 16 samples, respectively. Maximum concentrations were found in benzoylecgonine (78.71 ng/L) and codeine (51.60 ng/L). Thirteen pharmaceuticals were found at 16 points. The most detected compounds were carbamazepine (15 samples) and ibuprofen (11 samples). Maximum concentrations were detected in acetaminophen (17,699.4 ng/L), ibuprofen (3913.7 ng/L) and codeine (434.0 ng/L). Spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals showed a clear relationship between irrigation areas, high population densities municipalities (above 1000 h/km(2)) and sewage water treatment plants.

TI Occurrence of the antidiabetic drug Metformin and its ultimate

AB In 2030, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 350 million people will be diagnosed with diabetes. Consequently, Metformin - the biguanide drug of choice orally administered for diabetes type II- is anticipated to see a spike in production.
   Unlike many pharmaceutical drugs, Metformin (Met) is not metabolized by humans but passes through the body unchanged. Entering aquatic compartments, such as in sewage, it can be bacterially transformed to the ultimate transformation product Guanylurea (Gua).
   Sampling over one week (n = 5) from a Southern German sewage treatment plant revealed very high average (AV) concentrations in influent (AV(Met) = 111,800 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 1300 ng/L) and effluent samples (AV(Met) = 4800 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 44,000 ng/L).
   To provide a more complete picture of the distribution and potential persistence of these compounds in the German water cycle, a new, efficient and highly sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method with direct injection was used for the measurement of Metformin and Guanylurea in drinking, surface, sewage and seawater. Limits of quantification (LOQ) ranging from 2-10 ng/L allowed the detection of Metformin and Guanylurea in different locations such as: Lake Constance (n = 11: AV(Met) = 102 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 16 ng/L), river Elbe (n = 12: AV(Met) = 472 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 9 ng/L), river Weser (n = 6: AV(Met) = 349 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 137 ng/L) and for the first time in marine North Sea water (n = 14: AV(Met) = 13 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 11 ng/L). Based on daily water discharges, Metformin loads of 15.2 kg/d (Elbe) and 6.4 kg/d (Weser) into the North Sea were calculated. Lake Constance is used to abstract potable water which is further purified to be used as drinking water. A first screening of two tap water samples contained 2 ng/L and 61 ng/L of Metformin, respectively. The results of this study suggest that Metformin and Guanylurea could be distributed over a large fraction of the world's potable water sources and oceans. With no natural degradation processes, these compounds can be easily reintroduced to humans as they enter the food chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are released daily into surface water, and their recalcitrant properties often require tertiary treatment. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is often used as an alternative way to eliminate these compounds from water, although the literature barely addresses the neurotoxic effects of residual by-products. Therefore, this study investigated the performance of EO in the removal of five CECs (alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and carbamazepine) and performed neurotoxicity evaluations of residual EO by-products in Wistar rat brain hippocampal slices. Platinum-coated titanium (Ti/Pt) and boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes were studied as anodes. Different current densities (13-75 A m(-2)), pH values (3-10), electrolyte dosages (NaCl), and matrix effects were assessed using municipal wastewater (MWW). The drugs were successfully degraded after 5 min of reaction for both the Ti/Pt and BDD electrodes when a current density of 75 A m(-2) was applied. For Ti/Pt and BDD, neutral and acidic pH demonstrated better CEC removal performance, respectively. Compound degradation using MWW achieved 40% removal after 120 min for Ti/Pt and ranged between 33 and 52% for the BDD anode. For Ti/Pt, neurotoxicity studies using MWW indicated a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. However, when an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) medium was reapplied, the signal recovered and increased to a value above the baseline, indicating that cells recovered part of their normal activity but remained in a different condition. For the BDD anode, the treated MWW did not cause significant ROS production variations, suggesting that he EO was effective in eliminating the toxicity of the treated solution.

AB Many studies have quantified pharmaceuticals in the environment, few however, have incorporated detailed temporal and spatial variability due to associated costs in terms of time and materials. Here, we target 33 physico-chemically diverse pharmaceuticals in a spatiotemporal exposure study into the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater system and the Rivers Ouse and Foss (two diverse river systems) in the city of York, UK. Removal rates in two of the WWTPs sampled (a conventional activated sludge (CAS) and trickling filter plant) ranged from not eliminated (carbamazepine) to >99% (paracetamol). Data comparisons indicate that pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally, in part due to variability in prescribing practices, hydrology, wastewater management, and urbanisation and that select annual median pharmaceutical concentrations observed in this study were higher than those previously observed in the European Union and Asia thus far. Significant spatial variability was found between all sites in both river systems, while seasonal variability was significant for 86% and 50% of compounds in the River Foss and Ouse, respectively. Seasonal variations in flow, in-stream attenuation, usage and septic effluent releases are suspected drivers behind some of the observed temporal exposure variability. When the data were used to evaluate a simple environmental exposure model for pharmaceuticals, mean ratios of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), obtained using the model, to measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were 0.51 and 0.04 for the River Foss and River Ouse, respectively. Such PEC/MEC ratios indicate that the model underestimates actual concentrations in both river systems, but to a much greater extent in the larger River Ouse. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, estrogens or pesticides enter the environment continuously through the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Enhanced treatment of wastewater (WW) by ozone (O-3) is probably one of the simplest measures for abatement of organic micropollutants to avoid their discharge to the aquatic environment. During zonation most organic micropollutants present in treated WW are oxidized either by a direct reaction with O-3 or by secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot). However, undesired oxidation by-products from the oxidative transformation of matrix components can also be formed. A modular laboratory decision tool based on the findings of previous investigations is presented to test the feasibility of zonation as an option to upgrade specific WWTPs. These modules consist of investigations to assess (i) the matrix effects on ozone stability, (ii) the efficiency of micropollutant removal, (iii) the oxidation by-product formation, as well as (iv) bioassays to measure specific and unspecific toxicity of the treated WWs.
   Matrix effects on ozone stability (quantified as O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures) can give first indications on the suitability of an ozonation step. Ozonation of WWs yielding O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures and micropollutant abatement similar to reference values evoked a significant improvement of the water quality as indicated by a broad range of bioassays. Irregular behavior of the ozonation points towards unknown compounds, possibly leading to the formation of undesired degradation products. It has been observed that in such WWs ozonation partly enhanced toxicity. In summary, the presented tiered laboratory test procedure represents a relatively cheap and straight-forward methodology to evaluate the feasibility of ozonation to upgrade specific WWTPs for micropollutant removal based on chemical and biological measurements.

AB N-Fe co-doped titania was anchored on the functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (NFeTFC) through two-step sol-gel and ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal synthesis and integrated with LED visible light (LED) and ultrasonic (US) waves as a sono-photocatalyst. The properties of fabricated catalysts were investigated via XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, PL, EIS, TGA, BET, TEM, FESEM, EDX, EDS-Dot-Mapping, and UV-vis techniques. These analyses demonstrated the successive deposition of N and Fe atoms on the FSWCNT surfaces covered by TiO2. FESEM and TEM micrographs showed uniform coverage of FSWCNT with TiO2 nanoclusters. The PL results indicated that the introduction of dopants and FSWCNT into the TiO2 structure, acts as electrons traps and/or electron sink which prevents the electron/hole recombination and also enables TiO2 to be active in a visible light region. The investigation of effective sono-photocatalytic operational parameters confirmed that the complete removal of sulfathiazole (SUTZ:40 mg/L) can be accomplished at pH:7.0, NFeTFC: 0.7 g/L, US power: 250 W and light intensity: 150 W/m(2), over 90 min reaction time. SUTZ sono-photocatalytic decontamination kinetic was followed by pseudo-first order kinetic model. Trapping studies illustrated that O-2 and OH radicals are the main reactive species through decontamination process. The as-prepared composite could be recovered and reused after seven consecutive-cycles of SUTZ decontamination with an insignificant reduction in performance. For a typical real wastewater, over 88 and 79 % of COD and TOC, respectively were eliminated by NFeTFC/LED/US within 225 min treatment. A great enhancement was observed by integrating US to the photocatalysis process and also a great positive synergy index of 0.54 was achieved for coupling individual of processes of photolysis, sonolysis and adsorption.

AB According to the World Health Organization, >360 million people worldwide suffer from mental diseases such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder, for which psychotropic drugs are frequently prescribed. Despite being highly metabolized in the human organism, non-metabolized portions of these drugs are excreted, subsequently reaching wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where they may be incompletely removed during treatment, leading to the contamination of surface waters. In this work, ten psychotropic drugs widely consumed in Brazil (alprazolam, amitriptyline, bupropion, carbamazepine, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluoxetine, nortriptyline, sertraline, and trazadone) were monitored at five WWTPs located in the metropolitan region of Campinas (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). The drugs were determined in the influents, at different stages of the treatments, and in the effluents. Surface waters from the Atibaia River and the Anhumas Creek were also monitored. Quantitation of the pharmaceuticalswas carried out by online solid-phase extraction coupledwith ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated and presented a limit of quantitation of 50 ng L-1 for all the drugs assessed. Six of the substances monitored were quantified in the samples collected from the different treatment processes employed at theWWTPs. These technologies were unable to act as barriers for these psychotropics drugs. The concentrations ranged from 50 to 3000 ng L-1 in the WWTP effluents, while the main contaminants were found in surface waters at concentrations from 25 to 3530 ng L-1. The levels of the psychotropic detected in this work did not appear to present risks to the aquatic biota. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, two new composite membranes with antifouling and anti-biofouling properties were prepared through the modification of commercial polyamide (PA) discs using combination of in-situ polymerization of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and grafting of two synthesized bi-plasmonic Au-Ag and Ag-Au photocatalysts. The synthesis and characterization of the photocatalysts in batch mode were discussed in details as primary studies. Two intense 405-nm and 532-nm lasers for Ag-Au and Au-Ag photocatalysts, respectively and a solar-simulated xenon lamp for both photocatalysts were applied for photodegradation studies and the results were compared. In addition, the effect of other parameters such as type and amount of photocatalysts, and initial concentration of pollutants on the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin (OFX) and methylene blue (MB) as the model pollutant drug and dye were comprehensively investigated and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption model was used for evaluation of kinetics, degradation rate and half-life time of the reactions. After selection of xenon lamp as the optimum light source, the photodegradation of OFX and MB was evaluated in a dead-end membrane reactor (MR) and flux performance, antifouling property and pollutant removal of the membranes were evaluated using pharmaceutical and textile wastewater samples. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated using Gram-negative E. coli bacteria as the model microorganism using thin film assay and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion methods to examine the anti-biofouling potential of the constructed reactors. It was demonstrated that the prepared MR is able to produce cleaner water with more stable flux performance and good membrane fouling/biofouling properties in energy saving manner with respect to the unmodified ones.

AB UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been widely explored to remove organic contaminants from water streams. In this lab-scale study, the removal of 17 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) by UV/H2O2, UV/ PDS and UV/Chlorine was investigated at equimolar radical promoter concentrations in municipal wastewater. Direct comparison of the UV-AOPs was conducted with eight TOrCs being resistant to direct oxidation by H2O2, PDS and chlorine and revealed a general oxidation performance following the order of UV/Chlorine > UV/ H2O2 approximate to UV/PDS while UV/PDS and UV/Chlorine exhibited higher compound selectivity than UV/H2O2. However, although oxidation performance of UV/Chlorine is outstanding in comparison of the three UV-AOPs, it has to be noted that oxidation by-product (OBP) formation potential might be substantially higher during both UV/PDS and UV/Chlorine compared to UV/H2O2 which was not investigated in this study. Evaluating potential optical surrogates to predict trace organic chemical (TOrCs) removal in UV-AOPs, nine parameters were selected representing chromophore and fluorophore features of DOM including components derived by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation-emission matrices. UV absorbance (UVA), total fluorescence (TF) and the selected fluorescence peak P_IV revealed highest linear correlation coefficients and were therefore identified as surrogates representing underlying mechanistic reactions of each UV-AOP. As none of the surrogates directly reacted with UV irradiation, slopes of surrogate-indicator correlations for photo-susceptible TOrCs decreased towards higher oxidant dosages. Correlations for these compounds should therefore only be determined for a limited range of oxidant dosage.

AB In this work, the combination of membrane bioreactor (MBR) and electro-oxidation (EC)) process was studied for the treatment of a synthetic hospital wastewater fortified with four pharmaceutical pollutants namely carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBU), estradiol (E-E) at a concentration of 10 mu g L-1 venlafaxine (VEN) at 0.2 mu g L-1. Two treatment configurations were studied: EC) process as pre-treatment and post-treatment. Wastewater treatment with MBR alone shows high removal percentages of IBU and E-E (similar to 90%). Unlikely for CBZ and VEN, a low elimination percentage (similar to 10%) was observed. The hydraulic and the solid retention times (HRT and SRT) were 18 h and 140 d respectively, while the biomass concentration in the MBR was 16.5 g L-1. To enhance pharmaceuticals elimination, an ED pretreatment was conducted during 40 min at 2 A. This configuration allowed a 92% removal for VEN, which was far greater than both treatments alone, with lower than 30% and 50% for MBR and E0, respectively. The MBR-EO coupling (EC) as post-treatment) allows high removal percentages (similar to 97%) of the four pharmaceutical pollutants after 40 min of treatment at a current intensity of 0.5 A with Nb/BDO as electrodes. This configuration appears to be very effective compared to the first configuration (EO-MBR) where ED process is used as a pre-treatment. Toxicity assessment showed that the treated effluent of this configuration is not toxic to Daphnia magna except at 100% v/v. The MBR-EO coupling appears to be a promising treatment for contaminated hospital effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large number of emerging contaminants (ECs) are known to persist in surface waters, and create pressure on wastewater treatment works (WWTW) for their effective removal. Although a large database for the levels of these pollutants in water systems exist globally, there is still a lack in the correlation of the levels of these pollutants with possible long-term adverse health effects in wildlife and humans, such as endocrine disruption. The current study detected a total of 55 ECs in WWTW influent surface water, 41 ECs in effluent, and 40 ECs in environmental waters located upstream and downstream of the plant. A list of ECs persisted through the WWTW process, with 28% of all detected ECs removed by less than 50%, and 18% of all ECs were removed by less than 25%. Negative mass balances of some pharmaceuticals and metabolites were observed within the WWTW, suggesting possible back -transformation of ECs during wastewater treatment. Three parental illicit drug compounds were detected within the influent of the WWTW, with concentrations ranging between 27.6 and 147.0 ng L-1 for cocaine, 35.6-120.6 ng L-1 for mephedrone, and 270.9-450.2 ng L-1 for methamphetamine. The related environmental risks are also discussed for some ECs, with particular reference to their ability to disrupt endocrine systems. The current study propose the potential of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen to be regarded as priority ECs for environmental monitoring due to their regular detection andpersistence in environmental waters and their possible contribution towards adverse health effects in humans and wildlife.

AB This work studies the sonochemical degradation of a penicillinic antibiotic (oxacillin) in simulated pharmaceutical wastewater. High frequency ultrasound was applied to water containing the antibiotic combined with mannitol or calcium carbonate. In the presence of additives, oxacillin was efficiently removed through sonochemical action. For comparative purposes, the photo-Fenton, TiO2 photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation processes were also tested. Therefore, the evolution of the antibiotic and its associated antimicrobial activity (AA) were monitored. A high inhibition was found for the other three oxidation processes in the elimination of the antimicrobial activity caused by the additives; while for the ultrasonic treatment, a negligible effect was observed. The sonochemical process was able to completely degrade the antibiotic, generating solutions without AA. In fact, the elimination of antimicrobial activity showed an excellent performance adjusted to exponential kinetic-type decay. The main sonogenerated organic by-products were determined by means of HPLC-MS. Four intermediaries were identified and they have modified the penicillinic structure, which is the moiety responsible for the antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the possible oxacillin sonodegradation mechanism was proposed based on the evolution of the by-products and their chemical structure. Furthermore, the high-frequency ultrasound action over 120 min readily removed oxacillin and eliminated its antimicrobial activity. However, the pollutant was not mineralized even after a long period of ultrasonic irradiation (360 min). Interestingly, the previously sonicated water containing oxacillin and both additives was completely mineralized using non-adapted microorganisms from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. These results show that the sonochemical treatment transformed the initial pollutant into substances that are biotreatable with a typical aerobic biological system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Freshwater mussels are frequently found in rivers receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), and there is strong evidence that poor water quality is deleterious to freshwater mussel populations. WWTPs are among the main sources of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters. We monitored 145 PPCPs in wild and caged mussels both upstream and downstream of the Kitchener WWTP in the Grand River, Ontario, as well as 118 PPCPs in water samples. Our objectives were to characterize the seasonal changes in PPCP concentrations in water, to calculate bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PPCPs in mussels, and to determine the chemical and physical properties of PPCPs driving the bioaccumulation. Seventy PPCPs were detected in water, and concentrations were highest in the summer or early fall, which corresponded to low river flow. Forty-three PPCPs from many pharmaceutical classes were detected in mussel tissues, including stimulants, a contrasting agent, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-bacterial agents, antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, progestins, and illicit drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. The BAFs ranged from 0.66 for metformin to 32 022 for sertraline. Using partial least squares to predict BAFs based upon chemical properties, log K-OC, Log K-OW, and fugacity ratio (sediment) all had similar and positive loadings with BAFs ((RX)-X-2 = 0.70; caged mussels). BAFs of PPCPs in mussels were predictable from fugacity models that estimate bioconcentration factors using log K-OW. Our study demonstrated that mussels readily bioaccumulate PPCPs, in a manner consistent with expectations based upon BCF models and the chemical characteristics of each compound.

AB Wetlands are a popular tool to treat/polish wastewater by reducing nutrient loading into the environment. In addition to nutrients, organic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), are commonly detected in treated wastewater. Treatment wetlands may reduce concentrations of PPCPs before the treated effluent enters rivers and streams. Oxygen status may greatly affect the attenuation of PPCPs in wetland sediments by influencing microbial makeup and activity. An understanding of the effect of redox conditions on the degradation of PPCPs and the factors influencing PPCP sorption to wetland sediments is needed to maximize PPCP removal in treatment wetlands.
   Three wetland sediments from the San Diego Creek and Newport Bay watershed in Southern California, USA, were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to assess the degradation of several regularly occurring PPCPs and their phase distribution as a function of time.
   Under aerobic conditions, ibuprofen, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and gemfibrozil generally had half-life values around 20 days, while the half-life of carbamazepine was substantially longer (between 165 and 264 days). The anaerobic half-lives of gemfibrozil and ibuprofen increased by factors of 11-34 and carbamazepine increased by factors of 1.5-2.5. There was no detectable anaerobic degradation of DEET. The apparent phase distribution coefficient increased over time for DEET, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, indicating that sorption of PPCPs to wetland sediments may be more limited than that predicted using equilibrium sorption coefficient values.
   Knowledge of the capacity of wetland sediments for degrading and sorbing PPCPs is vital to the design of treatment wetlands. Degradation of the selected PPCPs was enhanced under aerobic conditions as compared to anaerobic conditions. Sorption to sediments increased with contact time, indicating that longer hydraulic retention will increase wetland capabilities for removing PPCPs.

AB Antiviral drugs have been used to treat the ever-growing number of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19 treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based on drug consumption, physical-chemical property, and ecotoxicological and pharmacological data for the drugs, with the aid of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling. Our results suggest that the removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low (<20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g. 7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters. Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient >1) by a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk quotient >0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin, while the risk will remain low (risk quotient <0.1) for dexamethasone and oseltamivir. The potential of wild animals acquiring antiviral drug resistance was estimated to be low. Our prediction suggests a pressing need for proper usage and waste management of antiviral drugs as well as for improving removal efficiencies of drug residues in wastewater.

AB This study investigated the transformation of secondary amine pharmaceuticals in UV-C/NO3- and in nitrate-rich wastewater at 254 nm by taking diclofenac, diphenylamine, mefenamic acid and furosemide as probe compounds. The degradation of targeted compounds were positively related to nitrate concentration and mainly caused by the formation of peroxynitrite and related reactive nitrogen species (e.g., nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide radicals). Major transformation products were identified to provide fundamental understanding of the selective oxidation of secondary amine with reactive nitrogen species. UV photolysis, hydroxyl radical oxidation, nitration and nitrosation processes were found to be the most significant transformation pathways. In case of diphenylamine, for which most of the identified intermediates were available as standard, the relative significance of each transformation route could be established, highlighting for the first time the important role of N-nitrosation processes in UV/NO3- treatment followed by the decomposition of the resulting N-nitroso compounds by an alpha hydroxylation mechanism. This specific transformation pathway was of concern because it constitutes the molecular basis of N-nitrosamine carcinogenicity and may contribute to the increase in effluent genotoxicity under UV-C treatment in addition to the formation of nitrophenols. Hydrogenocarbonate ions at concentration values higher than 300 mg/L appeared to be a protective specie against nitrosation processes due to the formation of carbamate adducts but H2O2 in UV-C/H2O2 could be responsible for an exacerbation of the N-nitrosation pathway due to an addition source of hydroxyl radical in the system. The occurrence of major transformation products of diclofenac was confirmed in nitrate-rich wastewater under UV-C treatment at pilot-scale operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat the symptoms of pain and inflammation. Diclofenac and its metabolites enter to the ecosystem mainly due to the ineffective treatment in wastewater treatment plants and lead to toxic effects on the environmental ecology. Emerging contaminants such as diclofenac can be degraded to a large extent in anaerobic digestion unit of wastewater treatment plants. Thus, it is important to assess the fate of diclofenac under anaerobic conditions. Biodegradation potential of diclofenac under anaerobic conditions was investigated with a fermentative/methanogenic culture enriched from anaerobic digestion sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. An anaerobic lab-scale semi-continuous reactor was operated at 35 degrees C in the dark. The culture was amended with glucose, yeast extract and diclofenac dissolved in methanol (10 mu g/L) providing 343 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (COD). A constant biogas production in the culture at the end of each feeding cycle was observed after 20 days incubation period (320 mL) which is in accordance with the theoretically calculated gas production. Although diclofenac removal was not achieved at the initial days of the acclimation period, after 70 days acclimation period partial diclofenac degradation (21%) was observed in the reactor. A batch experiment was conducted to assess diclofenac removal efficiency as well as the effect of diclofenac on methane and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production for one feeding cycle. Although only 19% diclofenac removal was observed in the batch culture amended with 10 mu g/L of diclofenac, a negative effect was not observed in terms of gas production, VFAs production and consumption during the incubation period. The results indicate the importance of the further investigation to achieve complete degradation of the diclofenac under anaerobic conditions.

AB The Joao Mendes River - an important contributor to the Piratininga/Itaipu lagoon system in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil - receives untreated sewage from the population occupying the drainage basin with no proper sanitation infrastructure. The present study assessed the ecological risk resulting from the presence of five organic micropollutants (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, ibuprofen, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol A) based on four monitoring campaigns which included three sampling points and one reference area. Chronic ecotoxicity assays were conducted with the bioindicators R. subcapitata, C. dubia and O. niloticus. Estrogenicity was assessed with genetically modified S. cerevisiae based on YES protocol. The Ecological Risk Assessment was conducted based on the Chemical and the Ecotoxicological Lines of Evidence (LoE). In order to analyse the results from different sampling points, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using a correlation matrix. Micropollutants below limit of detection or in very low concentrations were detected in the reference area; no significant differences were observed when samples from the reference area were compared to the negative controls for the ecotoxicity assays. A PCA including selected variables revealed the latent relationships among the three sampling points (not verified for the reference area), which confirmed the analytical results. An extreme ecological risk index was estimated for all sampling points in all campaigns. The extreme ecological risk index was mostly associated to the high concentrations of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole.

AB Global concern about the persistence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in the freshwater environment is more evident due to their possible disruptive effects. Even at nanogram levels these compounds increase the risk of cancer, decrease egg and sperm production, reduce gamete quality and tend complete feminization of the male fish. The present study demonstrated the potential of activated charcoal as adsorbent in removing synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) from aqueous phase by sorption process employing both agitated batch and column adsorption experiments. Batch sorption studies showed good removal of EE2 and dependent on the concentration loaded. Equilibrium data of EE2-charcoal sorption system showed a reasonably good fit with pseudo first-order kinetic plot. Intra-particle diffusion plot indicated the complex nature of EE2-charcoal sorption system involving both boundary layer and intra-particle diffusions. Experimental data confirmed to linear Langmuir's isotherm model. Highest EE2 sorption capacity of activated charcoal was observed at neutral conditions. Fixed bed column studies were performed with EE2 spiked untreated domestic sewage. Based on the data derived by fixed bed column studies, rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) methodology was used to design full-scale GAC system. Total EE2 concentration was quantitatively estimated by direct competitive immuno-enzymatic colorimetric method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The presence of pharmaceutical substances and their residual in water resources is an important environmental concern. Azithromycin, an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of infectious diseases, is a pollutant agent in the wastewater. The aim of this study was to investigate azithromycin degradation in aqueous solution through ultrasonic process in the presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles as catalysts.
   Methods: Sonocatalytic experiments were performed at variable conditions including pH (38), temperature (20-60 degrees C), time (3-21 minutes), catalyst dosage (0.25-2 g/L), hydrogen peroxide concentration (15-100 mg/L) and initial azithromycin concentration (10-100 mg/L).
   Results: The optimum values for pH (3), temperature (40 degrees C), time (15 minutes), catalyst dosage (1 g/L), H2O2 concentration (50 mg/L) and initial azithromycin concentration (20 mg/L) were determined. The highest degradation efficiency of 98.4% was achieved after 15 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation under optimum condition.
   Conclusion: According to the results, ultrasonic irradiation is able to degrade azithromycin. In addition, ZnO and hydroxyl radical can successfully accelerate the reaction process in the shortest possible time.

AB Application ofmesoporous C- and C,N-codoped TiO2 in the removal of diclofenac from water was studied. The sol-gelmethod was used for the preparation of the photocatalysts. The physicochemical properties of studied materials were characterized by BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. XPS confirmed the incorporation of nitrogen and carbon atoms into TiO2 lattice. The synthesized catalysts were effective in the removal of the studied pollutant from water and enabled reduction of the COD (chemical oxygen demand) value of the wastewater by at least 60%. The process of diclofenac photooxidation over the C, N-codoped and C-doped TiO2 photocatalysts proceeded similarly and was followed by pseudo-first order kinetics. The increase in calcination temperature resulted in the rutile fraction (5%) slightly lowering the effectiveness of treatment. The results over pure anatase structures confirmed that anatase has usually a better photocatalytic activity than rutile. The best changes in the water quality were observed during the first 50 min of treatment, but mineralization of pollutant did not lead to complete.

AB Catalytic ozonation of three selected pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac, DCF, sulfamethoxazole, SMX, and 17 alpha-ethynylstradiol. ETOL) in the presence of a commercial gamma-Al2O3 and a synthesized Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst has been studied. Experiments were carried out with the pharmaceuticals spiked in both, ultrapure water (Milli Q Millipore) and an actual secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). Regardless of the water matrix and the presence or absence of any catalyst, the removal of the three pharmaceutical compounds developed through fast direct reactions with ozone (i.e., the compounds were totally removed in less than 10 min). In terms of COD and TOC removals, catalytic ozonation, especially in the presence of the Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst, clearly enhanced the results obtained when the single ozonation process was applied. The stability and reusability of the Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst was demonstrated by carrying repetitive experiments reusing a catalyst sample. Finally, a kinetic model that accounts for two reaction stages has been proposed and apparent rate constants have been computed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the impact of glutaraldehyde (glut) concentration and molecular weight (MW) of six commercially available, highly deacetylated chitosans (Chi) on nanoparticle (Chi-NP) formation by emulsion crosslinking technique and their use as potential adsorber for diclofenac (DCL) and carbamazepine (CBZ). With a glut: primary amine ratio of 1: 1 and NaCl as a hydrophile, it was possible to reproducibly synthesize narrowly distributed, spherical Chi-NPs over a broad range of chitosan MW with a high yield. Increasing Chi MW resulted in larger particle sizes ranging from 109.9 nm, for lowest MW, up to 200.3 nm for the highest MW, measured by DLS. To evaluate the static adsorption behavior of the Chi-NPs, CBZ and DCL were used in single point adsorption experiments. An adsorption capacity of up to 351.8 mg g(-1) DCL for low MW Chi-NPs was observed and all Chi-NPs showed superior adsorptions when compared to untreated Chi.

AB The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is an invasive bivalve that has recently spread in Europe and currently represents a large portion of the aquatic biomass in specific areas. Because of the impacts that the species may have in invaded ecosystems, increased knowledge on the physiologic features of the species life-cycle under different environmental scenarios (e.g., contamination events) is critical to understand the dynamics of the invasion and resulting ecosystem imbalance. The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment has recently received great attention since high levels of contamination have been found, not only in sewage treatment plant effluents, but also in open waters. The present article reports toxicological biochemical effects of paracetamol to Corbicula fluminea following short- and long-term exposures. Oxidative stress parameters were specially focused namely catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and glutathione reductase (GRed). The effect of tested substances on lipid peroxidation was also investigated. Paracetamol did not induce alterations on CAT activity, caused a significant decrease of GSTs activity following short- and long-term exposure (LOEC values of 532.78 mg L-1 and 30.98 g L-1, respectively), and was responsible for a significant and dose-dependent decrease of GRed activity in short- and long-term exposures. These results indicate that exposure to paracetamol can provoke significant alterations on the cellular redox status of C. fluminea. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 29: 74-83, 2014.

AB A simple model was set up to predict estrogen concentrations and endocrine disruption risk in the Yodo River, Japan. This catchment spans the conurbations of Kyoto and Osaka and is the main source of drinking water for Osaka City, Japan. From the river survey data (5 separate occasions between 2005 and 2008), a maximum of 32 g per day estrone (E1) load was observed in the most downstream site of the river. Predicted E1 concentrations were in reasonable agreement with the measurements taken at several points within the basin from a series of sampling campaigns. The predicted concentrations exceeded a net estradiol (E2) equivalent of 1 ng L-1 on only a few occasions, suggesting that only limited endocrine disruption phenomena in fish along the Yodo River is likely. The model was then used to examine the impact on estrogen concentrations and endocrine disruption of a number of different scenarios. It was found that in-river biodegradation had little effect on predicted concentrations and the outcome of endocrine disruption along the catchment. However, reduced sewage treatment removal, as can be experienced in winter in Japan, led to levels of 3.1 ng L-1 E2 equivalents being possible. The reduced river flow in winter in Japan exacerbates the situation as it offers less dilution. It was found that the application of the ozonation process as a tertiary sewage treatment in winter could prevent this higher risk endocrine disruption situation.

AB The occurrence of five pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and bezafibrate) in the influent and effluent water of a sewage treatment plant (STP) in the recipient river water and in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) located downstream from the STP was followed during three seasons: winter, spring, and summer. In the STP, the elimination of the pharmaceuticals decreased significantly (an average of 25% compared to spring and summer) in wintertime leading to increased concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluent water. The total concentration of all the studied pharmaceuticals in the effluent water was 3-5 times higher in wintertime (about 2500 ng L-1) than during the other seasons (about 500-900 ng L-1). Accordingly, the highest concentrations (up to 129 ng L-1) in the recipient river were measured in the wintertime. Pharmaceuticals were carried longer distances downstream from the STP when the river was covered by ice and snow. During a drastic increase in water flow rate (i.e., during snowmelting), a fast transportation of the pharmaceuticals was observed. The DWTP located downstream from the STP produced water that contained about 8 ng L-1 of ibuprofen and ketoprofen in the winter sample, whereas in spring and summer the studied pharmaceuticals could not be detected in the drinking water. The results show that cold seasons in boreal areas can severely increase the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals and the risk for contamination of drinking water.

AB Two different methods are proposed to perform the mass balance calculations of micropollutants in sewage treatment plants (STPs). The first method uses the measured data in both liquid and sludge phase and the second one uses the solid-water distribution coefficient NJ to calculate the concentrations in the sludge from those measured in the liquid phase. The proposed methodologies facilitate the identification of the main mechanisms involved in the elimination of micropollutants. Both methods are applied for determining mass balances of selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and their results are discussed. In that way, the fate of 2 musks (galaxolide and tonalide), 3 pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole), and 2 natural estrogens (estrone and 17 beta-estradiol) has been investigated along the different water and sludge treatment units of a STP. Ibuprofen, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole are biologically degraded in the aeration tank (50-70%), while musks are equally sorbed to the sludge and degraded. In contrast, estrogens are not removed in the STP studied. About 40% of the initial load of pharmaceuticals passes through the plant unaltered, with the fraction associated to sludge lower than 0.5%. In contrast, between 20 and 40% of the initial load of musks leaves the plant associated to solids, with less than 10% present in the final effluent. The results obtained show that the conclusions concerning the efficiency of micropollutants removal in a particular STP may be seriously affected by the calculation method used.

AB The performance of electrocoagulation (EC) process, a non-specific electrochemical technology, was investigated for the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, from water. Experiments were carried out in synthetic wastewater in a batch cell. The respective influences of some key process parameters were studied, such as mixing conditions, initial pH, and current on aluminium electrodes. Experimental results showed that a CBZ removal efficiency of 62% was observed under slightly acidic initial conditions (pH 4) with a current density as high as 44 mA cm(-2) (I= 4.5 A) using Al electrode. This clearly indicates that CBZ removal proceeds through an electrochemical mechanism, while the adsorption of CBZ onto the aluminum hydroxide flocs was shown to be negligible. Furthermore, the increase of initial pH to alkaline values was shown to decrease the drug elimination efficiency. Conversely, as expected, an increase of current intensity improved the removal of CBZ. As a result, low initial pH 4 coupled with high current elevates the electrochemical elimination of CBZ: in this case, one metabolite could also be detected.

AB On-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs or septic systems) are designed to treat and dispose effluents on the same property that produces the wastewater. Approximately 25% of the U.S. population is served by such facilities. Nevertheless, studies on the treatment efficiency and discharge of organic contaminants through septic effluents are lacking. This pilot study showed the occurrence of organic contaminants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), perfluoroalkyl surfactants (PFASs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in septic effluents, adjacent lake water samples, household drinking water in homes that use lake water or a well adjacent to the lake as a source of drinking water, and offshore lake water samples. Septic effluent as well as lake and tap water samples were collected from several households with OWTSs around Skaneateles Lake located in central New York. The advanced on-site systems were installed in some households for the purpose of limiting nutrient levels in the effluent to protect the local surface water. Additionally, because many of these systems serve homes with limited land, advanced treatment systems were needed. The median concentrations of ten PPCPs (ranged from 0.45 to 388 ng/L) and eleven PFASs (ranged from 0.20 to 14.6 ng/L) in septic water were significantly higher (p <= 0.01) than in lake water samples. The Median concentrations of PPCPs and PFASs in lake and tap water samples were not significantly different (p >= 0.65). The median concentrations of Sigma PBDEs in septic, lake, and tap water samples were 7.47, 3.49, and 2.22 ng/L, respectively, and those for Sigma PCBs were 33.1, 29.2, and 28.6 ng/L, respectively. The mass flux of PPCPs (i.e. the mass flow of PPCPs per unit area per unit time) through the disposal of treated septic effluent from textile biofilter and aerobic treatments to the dispersal unit ranged from 12 (carbamazepine) to 66900 mu g/m(2)/day (caffeine) whereas that for PFASs ranged from 7.0 (perfluorobutanesulfonate) to 833 mu g/m(2)/day (perfluorooctanoic acid). Based on the ratio of measured concentrations and method detection limit, triclocarban, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctanesulfonate have the potential to be used as chemical tracers of septic water contamination in Skaneateles Lake. The median concentrations of atenolol, a beta-blocker drug, in septic water were significantly (rho = 0.86, p = 0.01) correlated with enterococci counts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics can adsorb chemical pollutants such as metals or pharmaceuticals, and transferred them along the food chain. In this work, an investigation of the adsorption of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by five different types of microplastics was performed in Milli-Q water and natural waters (seawater, urban wastewater and irrigation water) via a series of batch adsorption experiments. The effects of concentration of metals and physicochemical characteristics of polymers were particularly studied. Results revealed a significant adsorption of lead, chromium and zinc on microplastics, especially on polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride. In the case of polyethylene terephthalate, it showed little adsorption capacity. Specific surface, porosity and morphology are characteristics that affect the molecular interactions. The adsorption isotherms were better described by Langmuir model, which indicates that the main adsorption mechanism might be chemical adsorption. Finally, results obtained in natural waters indicated that dissolved organic matter may play a major role on metal adsorption on microplastics. Results showed an enhancement of metal adsorption in waters with high chemical and biological oxygen demands as urban wastewater and irrigation water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, the investigations were firstly focused on the effect of microwave on the species distribution of ferric hydrolysates. as well as the effect of hydrolysates speciation on the treatment efficiency of organic compounds in the process of coagulation. A ferron-complexation timed spectrophotometric method was used to classify the Fe(III) speciation under different reaction conditions. Effects of microwave power, initial pH and reaction temperature on species distribution were intensively investigated. When microwave power and initial pH were 300W and 5, respectively, the amount of high polymeric ferric species, so-called Fe(c), reached its maximum. The increment of reaction temperature resulted in an increasing formation of Fe(c), and microwave was able to generate more Fe(c) than that of thermostatic method at the same temperature. Comparing with the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, the results indicated that Fe(c) facilitated the net rolling-sweep action for organic molecules in coagulation process, which enhanced the removal efficiency of entire reaction system.

AB Recent evidence has revealed that cities with pharmaceutical manufacturers have elevated concentrations of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in their receiving water bodies. The purpose of this study was to gather information on direct sewer discharges of APIs during their manufacturing and processing from five pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canada. Drug classes and maximum reported concentrations (ng/L) for which APIs were directly discharged included: antidepressants (paroxetine - 3380 and sertraline - 5100); mood stabilizer (carbamazepine - 575,000); antibiotics (penicillin - 14,300); analgesics (acetaminophen 461,000; codeine - 49,200; ibuprofen - 344,000; naproxen - 253,000 and oxycodone 21,000); cardiovascular drugs (atorvastatin - 893 and metoprolol - 7,333,600) and those drugs used for blood pressure control (amlodipine - 22,900; diltiazem - 1,160,000; furosemide - 1,200,000 and verapamil - 7340). Based on flow and water usage data from the individual facilities, the maximum concentrations for acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, diltiazem and metoprolol correlate to approximately 200, 220, 390, 420 and 14,200 g respectively, of lost product being directly discharged to the sewers daily during active manufacturing. This survey demonstrates that direct point source discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturers represent a key source of pharmaceutical pollution to receiving sewersheds. Onsite recovery of product or treatment at pharmaceutical manufacturing or processing facilities to reduce the sewage loadings to receiving treatment plants, product loss and potential environmental loadings is strongly recommended.

AB The polypyrrole (PPy) was used as an adsorbent material for efficient removal of pharmaceutical metronidazole from aqueous solutions. The physiochemical parameters influencing the adsorption process such as adsorbent dose, temperature, pH, initial concentration and contact time were systematically investigated. The optimum adsorption efficiency is achieved at pH 6.17 after 120 min of contact time. In addition, the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order models were found to explain the metronidazole adsorption process on the PPy. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption of metronidazole on the PPy is a spontaneous and exothermic process. The quantum calculations using density functional theory (DFT) was used to confirm the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the PPy. The obtained results of the interaction energy indicate that the adsorption was a physical process. The metronidazole was adsorbed by its oxygen atoms on the amine groups of PPy. Finally, the PPy polymer can be used as an efficient adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) throughout the Netherlands contain significant concentrations of pharmaceuticals (25-65 mu g/L) and about 10-20 mg C/L dissolved non-biodegradable organic matter. By means of IEX mainly the humic acid fraction of the effluent organic matter can be removed, whereas O-3/biofiltration mainly removes the hydrophobic fraction. For the first time the combination of these processes with O-3/H2O2, UV/H2O2 or UV/O-3 was tested for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluent. Based on initial laboratory experiments, a pilot installation was built in which IEX followed by UV/H2O2 was applied to real WWTP effluent. The process appeared to be very robust, and able to remove a very broad range of different pharmaceuticals. The additional costs for this treatment are estimated at approximately (sic)0.34/m(3)-treated effluent, which is in the same order of magnitude as estimated for other additional, but less versatile, treatment processes.

AB Seasonal variations of caffeine and antibiotic concentrations were investigated along the selected sites of the Danube using solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The potential risks on the aquatic organisms were evaluated. HPLC methods for caffeine and antibiotic determination were modified and validated showing good accuracy, repeatability, selectivity, and robustness. The obtained results confirmed the presence of caffeine at four sampling points, near the wastewater discharges. The mean caffeine concentrations for summer, autumn, winter, and spring were 24.78, 26.83, 24.61, and 86.29 ng/L, respectively. The analyzed antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and tiamuline) were under the limit of detection in all tested samples taken from the Danube. The maximum risk indexes (MaxRIs) were calculated for caffeine at each sampling site. Four out of seven selected sampling sites showed sublethal effects on the aquatic organisms with 10 < MaxRI < 100 (class II), while the other three had no potential risk for aquatic organisms. The highest potential risk was calculated for the sampling site in the vicinity of one of the biggest wastewater discharges.

AB The state of the art of microalgae biotechnology, particularly focusing on new culture techniques and actual and potential uses of microalgae in human and animal nutrition, in cosmetics and pharmaceutics, and for environmental applications, is described. Some examples of the world's largest commercial plants in the field are presented. For the future, it is possible to foresee a huge increase in the demand for cultured algae, in terms of both quantity and diversity. For example, aquaculture will require new animal species and, consequently, new microalgae to fulfil their nutritional needs will be necessary. The production of algae for high-value markets ( aquaculture, food supplements, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals) will be developed through the search for, isolation and cultivation of new algal strains endowed with the activity of interest. Algal biomass might become an important source of biofuels, especially if its production will be carried out in low-cost photobioreactors and associated with wastewater treatment and greenhouse gas abatement.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) belongs to the fluoroquinolones group and is widely applied in therapeutics. The presence of fluorine in CIP increases its stability in the environment. Advanced oxidation processes are among the most effective methods used to remove hazardous and resistant pollutants in the environment. This study aimed to determine the efficiency of the ozonation process with calcium peroxide for the removal of CIP from aqueous solutions. The removal efficiency of CIP and chemical oxygen demand under optimal conditions, that is, pH = 3, CIP concentration = 5 mg/L, concentration of CaO2 = 0.025 mg/L, temperature = 25 degrees C, ozonation rate = 1 g/min and contact time = 50 min, was obtained 95.6% and 80.1% as well as 85.4% and 73.6%, in synthetic and simulated wastewater samples (municipal wastewater + CIP), respectively. Thermodynamic studies have shown that CIP decomposition with ozonation and CaO2 is an endothermic process. The kinetics of CIP decomposition followed the pseudo-first-order equation. The use of the ozonation process with calcium peroxide is an efficient method for CIP removal.

AB A new acid-resistant bacterium Acinetobacter sp. JR1 was isolated, and its feasibility in nitrogen removal was investigated under acidic condition. Results show that JR1 indicated excellent ammonium and nitrate removal abilities with no accumulation of intermediates, and the maximum ammonium and nitrate removal efficiencies were 98.5% and 91.1%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrated that JR1 preferred to use ammonium with ammonium and nitrate as the mixed N-sources. For JR1, ammonium was assimilated directly as nutrients into cells and also converted into N-2 through heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification. Under acidic condition, JR1 performed comparable nitrogen removal abilities to other strains under neutral or weak alkaline environment, and the efficient removal of ammonium occurred at pH 4.5-10, C/N 12-24, 20-40 degrees C, DO >= 4.72 mg/L, 0-1.5% of salinity, 10 mg/L Zn2+ or 20 mg/L Mn2+. All these make JR1 a promising candidate for treating acidic wastewater containing nitrogen.

AB In this study, three-phase fluidized bed equipment for the solar photocatalysis-membrane separation (E-SPME), comprising solar photocatalytic degradation and membrane separation zones, was first introduced, and the photocatalytic degradation of acid red B wastewater (ARBW) with a TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated using the E-SPME. The experimental results indicated the circulating flow of wastewater between the two zones and the increase in the ARBW photocatalytic degradation efficiency with decreasing membrane flux. The same experimental phenomenon was observed with the change in the aeration rate in the lower water tank from 0.10 to 0.40m(3)h(-1), but the degradation efficiency started to decrease with further increase in the aeration rate to 0.50m(3)h(-1). The degradation efficiency on a clear day was greater than that on a cloudy day; however, it was significantly improved with the opened UV lamps on a cloudy day. The steady operation of the E-SPME was still possible by the opening of the UV lamps on completely cloudy and clear days with a solar light intensity of <13.0Wm(-2).

AB This study investigated the powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption of 13 pharmaceuticals from the primary (and secondary) effluents of a wastewater treatment plant. In addition to fresh PAC, PAC that was previously used for pharmaceutical elimination from the secondary effluent was also examined for its reuse potential in the primary effluent. The results showed a comparably negligible pharmaceutical uptake by fresh and used PACs in the primary effluent, in contrast to a substantial uptake by both PACs in the secondary effluent. This result indicated a severe adsorption competition induced from the primary effluent organic matter, i.e. the considerably higher constituents of low molecular and hydrophobic components. Furthermore, the competition effect even resulted in a desorption of the negatively charged pharmaceuticals from the used PAC into the primary effluent. It was concluded that adding fresh PAC to the secondary effluent is preferred and that recycling the used PAC into the activated sludge tank could not offer an additional pharmaceutical adsorption.

AB Microbial kinetics of a hybrid upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor were investigated when treating chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. Mathematical kinetics models have been tested with strong wastewater to reveal the relationship between substrate utilization rate and microbial population dynamics, depending on the hydraulic structure of the reactor. The data were collected for use in these models by operating at mesophilic temperature (37 +/- 1 degrees C), pH 6.8-7.2, at different HRT (3-0.17 days) at high OLR values from hybrid UASB. Monod, First-order, Grau second-order, Modified Stover-Kincannon, kinetic models were applied to the hybrid reactor. Grau second-order model and Modified Stover-Kincannon were found to be the most appropriate models for the hybrid UASB (R-2 =0.99) and offers the best description of the process. The substrate removal rate constant (k(2s)) was found to be 3.43 d(-1) for Grau ve maximum substrate consumption rate (R-max) 1.016 g l(-1)-day for Modified Stover-Kincannon.

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants are growing aquatic-health concerns and largely attributed to wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) discharges. Five biweekly water samples from 59 small Piedmont (United States) streams were analyzed for 108 pharmaceuticals and degradates using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The antidiabetic metformin was detected in 89% of samples and at 97% of sites. At least one pharmaceutical was detected at every site (median of 6, maximum of 45), and several were detected at >10% of sites at concentrations reported to affect multiple aquatic end points. Maximal cumulative (all detected compounds) concentrations per site ranged from 17 to 16000 ng L-1. Watershed urbanization, water table depth, soil thickness, and WWTF metrics correlated significantly with in-stream pharmaceutical contamination. Comparable pharmaceutical concentrations and detections at sites with and without permitted wastewater discharges demonstrate the importance of non-WWTF sources and the need for broad-scale mitigation. The results highlight a fundamental biochemical link between global human-health crises like diabetes and aquatic ecosystem health.

AB The aims of this study are to investigate the fate of tetracycline (TC) and degradation products (DPs) in municipal biological wastewater treatment plant (MBWWTP) located in Elazig City (Turkey) and to determine the occurrence and transport of TC and DPs in surface water (SW) (Kehli Stream) which the effluents of the plant discharged. The aqueous phase removal of TC, 4-epitetracycline (ETC), 4-epianhydrotetracycline (EATC), and anhydrotetracycline (ATC) in the studied treatment plant was 39.4 +/- 1.9, 31.8 +/- 1.5, 15.1 +/- 0.7, and 16.9 +/- 0.8 %, respectively. According to the analyses' results of SW samples taken from downstream at every 500-m distance, TC and DPs decreased by the increase in the distance. In downstream, at 2000 m, TC, ETC, EATC, and ATC were 4.12 +/- 0.20, 6.70 +/- 0.33, 8.31 +/- 0.41, and 3.57 +/- 0.17 mu g/L, respectively. As a result, antibiotic pollution in the SW that takes the effluent of MBWWTP exists.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in the aquatic ecosystem, despite the high removal rate that occurs in wastewater treatment plants. Phytoremediation represents a technology to improve the performance of existing wastewater treatment. This study was conducted under hydroponics to evaluate the ability of Salicaceae plants to tolerate and reduce IBU concentration in contaminated water. To this end, we combined growth, physiological and biochemical data to study the effects of different IBU concentrations on two clones of Salix alba L Data demonstrated that clone SS5 was more tolerant and showed a higher ability to reduce IBU concentration in the solution than clone SP3. The high tolerance to IBU shown by SS5 was likely due to several mechanisms including the capacity to maintain an elevated photosynthetic activity and an efficient antioxidative defence. These results illustrate the remarkable potential of willow to phytoremediate IBU-contaminated waters in natural and constructed wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are widely detected in surface waters. So far, the removal processes of these compounds in situ in river systems are not yet totally revealed. In this study, a combined monitoring and modelling approach was applied to determine the behaviour of 1-H benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and galaxolide in a small river system. Sewage treatment plant effluents and the receiving waters of the river Swist were monitored in 9 dry weather sampling campaigns (precipitation < 1 mm on the sampling day itself and <5 mm total precipitation two days before the sampling) during different seasons over a period of 3 years. With the results gained through monitoring, mass balances have been calculated to assess fate in the river. With the DWA Water Quality Model, OMP concentrations in the river were successfully simulated with OMP characteristics gained through literature studies. No removal was determined for 1-H benzotriazole and carbamazepine, whereas diclofenac showed removal that coincided with light intensity. Moreover, modelling based on light sensitivity of diclofenac also suggested relevant degradation at natural light conditions. These two approaches suggest removal by photodegradation. The highest removal in the river was detected for galaxolide, presumably due to volatilisation, sorption and biodegradation. Furthermore, short-term concentration variability in the river was determined, showing that daily concentration patterns are influenced by dynamics of sewage treatment plant effluent volumes and removal processes in the river.

AB Water from six points from the Riachuelo-Matanza basin was analyzed in order to assess ibuprofen biodegradability. In four of them biodegradation of ibuprofen was proved and degrading bacterial communities were isolated. Biodegradation in each point could not be correlated with sewage pollution. The indigenous bacterial community isolated from the point localized in the La Noria Bridge showed the highest degradative capacity and was selected to perform batch and continuous degradation assays. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the community consisted of Comamonas aquatica and Bacillus sp. In batch assays the community was capable of degrading 100mgL(-1) of ibuprofen in 33h, with a specific growth rate () of 0.21h(-1). The removal of the compound, as determined by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), exceeded 99% of the initial concentration, with a 92.3% removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). In a down-flow fixed-bed continuous reactor, the community shows a removal efficiency of 95.9% of ibuprofen and 92.3% of COD for an average inlet concentration of 110.4mg. The reactor was kept in operation for 70 days. The maximal removal rate for the compound was 17.4gm(-3)d(-1). Scanning electron microscopy was employed to observe biofilm development in the reactor. The ability of the isolated indigenous community can be exploited to improve the treatment of wastewaters containing ibuprofen.

AB We investigated two commonly used antimicrobial agents triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) in the Pearl River system in China (i.e., Liuxi, Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers) and four sewage effluents during dry and wet seasons. The median values for TCS and TCC were the highest in the surface water and sediments of the Shijing River, followed by the Zhujiang River and Liuxi River. Screening level risk assessment using the risk quotient (RQ) method showed that TCS and TCC in surface water posed median risks in the Zhujiang and Liuxi Rivers (RQs: 0.28-0.62 for TCS, and 0.15-0.80 for TCC) and high risks in the Shijing River (RQs: 5.15-9.55 for TCS, and 3.32-5.83 for TCC). Higher risks (RQs: 3.63-28.47 for TCS, and 3.13-24.54 for TCC) were found in the sediments than in surface water of the Pearl River system. The four sewage effluents and Shijing River as well as other urban streams in Guangzhou metropolitan area were identified as the sources of the two compounds in the main river Zhujiang River. The mass inventories of TCS and TCC in the Pearl River system indicate that the sediments are not only an important sink but also a potential source for the two compounds in surface water.

AB A study was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of secondary effluent additional treatment, using a combination of pre-treatments ( ring filter, physico- chemical and infiltration-percolation) followed by disinfection methods ( chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid and ultraviolet light). Three different indicator microorganisms were determined: E. coli, total coliforms and somatic bacteriophages. The results show better efficiency of physico- chemical and infiltration-percolation processes. Bacteriophages were eliminated to a lesser extent than bacterial indicators in all the treatment systems. Chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid seems to be more efficient in disinfection than ultraviolet light when a ring filter is the pre-treatment used. For the same doses and contact times, the efficiency of the disinfection methods is higher when the pre-treatment used is the physico- chemical or the infiltration-percolation system. The final effluent quality from the physicochemical treatment train and the infiltration-percolation treatment train, followed by the disinfectants, achieves an E. coli content that allows the reuse in most of the uses described in the Spanish legislation for wastewater reuse.

AB This study investigated the removal efficiency and mechanisms of water contaminants (mainly N-nitrosamines) during municipal wastewater reclamation by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) hybrid system. The removal of bulk water contaminants was governed by the microbial activities in the MBR and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the NF membranes. The removal of N-nitrosamines by the MBR was primarily attributed to biodegradation by aerobic bacteria, which can be determined by the reactivity of the amine functional groups with the catabolic enzymes (removal efficiency = 45-84%). Adsorption and formation of membrane fouling can enhance the removal of N-nitrosamines by the NF membranes. However, size-exclusion is found to play a major role in the removal of N-nitrosamines by the NF membranes since the removal efficiencies of N-nitrosamines varied significantly depending on molecular weight of the N-nitrosamines and MWCO of the NF membranes (removal efficiency: NE90 > NE70).

AB The electrochemical degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in both synthetic solutions (CBZo = 12 mg/L) and enriched municipal effluents (CBZo = 60-70 mu g/L) was investigated using an electro-Fenton (EF) process. Different operating parameters were investigated, including current intensity, pH, reaction time, ferrous ion concentration, and the type of anode material. The current intensity, the type of anode material, and the concentration of ferrous ions played an important role in the CBZ degradation efficiency. The degradation was mainly attributed to direct anodic oxidation. The best operating conditions for the synthetic sample were obtained at a current density of 0.2 A, a pH of 3.0, and 120 min of treatment using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode in the presence of 0.25 mM of Fe2+. Under these conditions, 52 % of total organic carbon (TOC) and 73 % of CBZ were removed. The process was also tested as tertiary treatment for a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, and CBZ was completely removed.

AB Studies have shown the detection of emerging contaminants (ECs), of which pharmaceuticals are a subset, in surface waters across the United States. The objective of this study was to develop methods, and apply them, to evaluate the potential for food chain transfer when EC-containing waters are used for crop irrigation. Greenhouse experiments were performed in which select food crops were irrigated with water spiked with three antibiotics. Field experiments, at two different sites, were conducted. Select crops were irrigated with wastewater effluent known to contain ECs, EC-free well water, and Colorado River water containing trace-level ECs. The results of the greenhouse studies show the potential for uptake of one or more of the antibiotics evaluated, albeit at very low levels. In those food crops watered with wastewater effluent, only an industrial flavoring agent, N,N'-dimethylphenethylamine (DMPEA), was consistently found. None of the evaluated contaminants were found in crops irrigated with Colorado River water.

AB Mesoporous Fe-doped MgO nanoparticles were synthesized using a facile sol-gel method and utilized for photoFenton-like degradation of salicylic acid (SA). The MgO surface dissolution facilitated an increase in the pH under the reaction conditions that allowed the Fe-MgO catalyst to be active without detectable iron leaching. Under simulated solar radiation, SA was completely degraded with an initial rate constant of 0.048 min(-1) at the optimal reaction conditions of 500 ppm loading of 5% Fe-MgO, 20 mM H2O2 concentration, and 50 ppm SA concentration. The catalyst was stable over 5 reaction cycles. The Fe-MgO catalyst was shown to have a surface area up to 171 m(2)/g and contain hematite (Fe2O3) nanoparticles with octahedrally coordinated iron catalytic centers, as inferred from diffuse reflectance UV-vis measurements. Post-reaction catalyst characterization showed that some Fe2+ was present in the catalyst due to the redox cycle during the chain initiation and propagation steps of the reaction.

AB A facile photoluminescent probe for picric acid (PA) detection was developed using photoluminescent carbon nanodots (C-dots), which was obtained from a traditional Chinese medicinal material Sichuan Bergamot via a one-step hydrothermal method for the first time. The as-prepared photoluminescent C-dots show favorable blue color photoluminescence with the maximum emission at 440 nm. It has been successfully applied as a photoluminescent probe for the detection of PA. This photoluminescent probe exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity toward PA from 0.4 mu M to 80 mu M with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9987. The limit of detection (LOD) for PA is 82 nM. Furthermore, the proposed C-dots for photoluminescent probe detection of PA in real water samples (river water, refinery wastewater and pharmaceutical factory wastewater) by adding 5 mu M and 20 mu M PA with satisfactory recoveries from 99.5% to 101.5%. These novel photoluminescent C-dots is promising in environmental analysis of PA.

AB Four emerging micropollutants ibuprofen, diclofenac, estrone (E1) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were studied in large laboratory-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with high nitrifying activity. Activated sludge (AS) with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 12 days and 14 days in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) and 30 days, 60 days and 90 days in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were examined at 8 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals and their main metabolites were analysed in liquid phase and solid phase of AS by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A remarkable amount of contaminants were detected in solids of AS, meaning the accumulation of micropollutants in bacterial cells. The biodegradation rate constants (K-biol) were affected by SRT and temperature. MBR with a 90-day SRT showed the best results of removal. Conventional SBR process was inefficient at 8 degrees C showing K-biol values lower than 0.5 l gSS(-1)d(-1) for studied micropollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of C-14-labeled sulfamethoxazole and ace tyl-sulfamethoxazole in soil has been investigated with special respect to possible entry routes of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals into soil environments. Therefore, the stability of the test substances was monitored first in sewage sludge and bovine manure. Within the incubation period of 72 d, 1% at maximum of the initially applied radiotracers was released as C-14-carbon dioxide while 22 75% was transferred to non-extractable residues that were operationally defined by the ethyl acetate extraction. Test-sludge and test-manure samples with defined aged residues were prepared and, supplementary to standard solutions, applied to silty-clay soil samples. After standard and test-sludge application, soil/water distribution coefficients of Kd < 5 L kg(-1) were determined revealing both test substances as potential leachers. In contrast, the sorption of sulfamethoxazole increased after test-manure application (K-d > 10 L kg(-1)). In the long-term degradability tests, the metabolic fate of both test substances was characterized by the continuous decrease of extractable residues, resulting in disappearance times of DT90 <= 33 d, and the increase of non-extractable residues. Mineralization reached 11% at maximum. Thereby, the dynamics of these processes differed whether the test substances were applied via standard, test-sludge or test-manure application. This fact emphasized the relevance of entry route specific matrix effects on the fate of both test substances in soil.

AB The consumption of nootropic drugs has increased tremendously in the last decade, though the studies on their environmental fate are still scarce. Nootropics are bioactive compounds designed to alter human's physiology therefore the adverse effects towards wildlife can be expected. In order to understand their environmental impact, the knowledge on their transformation pathways is necessary.
   Methylphenidate belongs to the most prescribed neuro-enhancers and is among the most favored smart drugs used in non-medical situations. It is metabolized in human liver and excreted as ritalinic acid. Here, we showed for the first time that ritalinic acid can be biodegraded and used as a sole carbon and nitrogen source by various microbial strains originating from different environmental samples. Five axenic strains were isolated and identified as: Arthrobacter sp. strain MW1, MW2 and MW3, Phycicoccus sp. strain MW4 and Nocardioides sp. strain MW5. Our research provides the first insight into the metabolism of ritalinic acid and suggests that it may differ depending on the strain and growth conditions, especially on availability of nitrogen. The isolates obtained in this study can serve as model organisms in further studies on the catabolism of ritalinic acid and methylphenidate but potentially also other compounds with similar structures. Our findings have important implication for the sewage epidemiology. We demonstrated that ritalinic acid is subject to quick and efficient biodegradation thus its use as a stable biomarker should be reconsidered.

AB Biological treatment of antibiotic production effluents is an economical approach; however, there are still difficulties to overcome because of the recalcitrant characteristics of these compounds to biodegradation. This study aims to reveal that anaerobic treatment technology can be an option as pretreatment before the activated sludge system treatment to treat antibiotic production effluents. The ISO 8192 method was chosen to test the inhibitory effect of raw and treated antibiotic production effluents in this work. Inhibition tests, which were applied according to ISO 8192, highlighted that the anaerobic treatment effluent is less inhibitory than antibiotic production effluent for activated sludge system. Early EC50 concentrations (30-min values) of raw and treated wastewaters were lower than 180-min values. Also, triple effects (sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline) of antibiotics are more toxic than dual effects (sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline). In light of the experimental results obtained and their evaluation, it can be concluded that anaerobic digestion can be applied as a biological pretreatment method for pharmaceutical industry wastewater including antibiotic mixtures prior to aerobic treatment.

SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL

DE urban groundwater protection; pollution; water management; waste reuse
ID NOTTINGHAM; UK; RECHARGE; AQUIFER
AB Various human activities threaten the groundwater quality and resource under urban areas, and yet residents increasingly depend on it for their livelihood. The anticipated expansion of the world's urban population from 3 to 6 billion in the coming 50 years does not only pose a large water management threat but also provides an opportunity to conserve groundwater in a better way than up to now. The authors argue for a new way to manage urban activities in order to conserve the precious groundwater resource. The focus is on the quality of the discharged water after use in households. Restrictions on what is added to water while using it, e.g. detergents, excreta, paint residues, oils, and pharmaceuticals, are important to simplify the treatment and reuse of used water. Avoiding mixing different wastewater flows has the same positive effect. If increased volumes of wastewater can be treated and reused, the demand on the groundwater resource is reduced, as also occurs with demand management measures. Reduced discharge of polluted water to the environment from households and utilities also conserves the quality of groundwater and reduces sophisticated treatment costs.

AB Aquatic organisms can be affected not only via polluted water but also via their food. In the present study, we examined bioaccumulation of seventy pharmaceuticals in two benthic organisms, Hydropsyche sp. and Erpobdella octoculata in a small stream affected by the effluent from a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Prachatice (South Bohemia region, Czech Republic).
   Furthermore, water samples from similar locations were analyzed for all seventy pharmaceuticals. In water samples from a control locality situated upstream of the STP, ten of the seventy pharmaceuticals were found with average total concentrations of 200 ng L-1. In water samples collected at STP-affected sites (downstream the STP's effluent), twenty-nine, twenty-seven and twenty-nine pharmaceuticals were determined at average total concentrations of 2000, 2100 and 1700 ng L-1, respectively.
   Six of the seventy pharmaceuticals (azithromycin, citalopram, clarithromycin, clotrimazole, sertraline, and verapamil) were found in Hydropsyche. Four pharmaceuticals (clotrimazole, diclofenac, sertraline, and valsartan) were detected in Erpobdella. Using evaluation criterion bioconcentration factor (BCF) is higher than 2000 we can assign azithromycin and sertraline as bioaccumulative pharmaceuticals. Even pharmaceuticals present at low levels in water were found in benthic organisms at relatively high concentrations (up to 85 ng g(-1) w.w. for azithromycin). Consequently, the uptake of pharmaceuticals via the food web could be an important exposure pathway for the wild fish population. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To evaluate the quality of reclaimed water, the estrogenicity of effluent from a sewage treatment plant and of reclaimed water treated with coagulation-sedimentation-filtration using the effluent as raw water was assessed using vitellogenin (VTG) as a biomarker. After a three-week exposure, significant (p < 0.05) induction of VTG occurred in female crucian carp (Carassius carassius) exposed continuously to the secondary effluent and reclaimed water with different dilutions (12.5, 25, 50, and 100% for secondary effluent; 50 and 100% for reclaimed water); no induction of VTG was detected when exposed to 12.5 and 25% reclaimed water. For male fish, however, only 100% secondary effluent induced the production of VTG (mean +/- standard deviation, 38.6 +/- 9.8 mu g/ml). When the exposure time was prolonged to three months, VTG was induced significantly in both females and males at all gradient concentrations of secondary effluent and at 50 and 100% reclaimed water. The results indicated that no obvious VTG was detected in fish exposed to reclaimed water diluted more than fourfold. Ozonation of the secondary effluent under an ozone consumption dose of 8.5 mg/L resulted in a VTG level equal to that of 12.5% secondary effluent or 50% reclaimed water. Furthermore, VTG induction reflects the cumulative effects of estrogenic activity in the secondary effluent and reclaimed water compared with the in vitro assays, in which estrogenic activities in effluent changed markedly during the experiment.

AB The objective of this work was to assess and compare the removal efficiency of paracetamol and salicylic acid from aqueous medium by a microalgae-based treatment, using either Chlorella vulgaris or Tetradesmus obliquus. Moreover, considering microalgae application in wastewater treatment, the influence of these pharmaceuticals in the algal nutrient removal capacity was evaluated. The removal of paracetamol by T. obliquus (> 40 %) was larger than by C. vulgaris (> 21 %) in batch culture, and this was also observed for salicylic acid (> 93 % by T. obliquus and > 25 % by C. vulgaris). Both strains removed nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) almost completely by the end of the batch culture, but T. obliquus showed the highest efficiency at the steady state conditions of the semicontinuous culture. In spite of this, under the flocculants here tested, the efficiency in the recovery of biomass was much higher for C. vulgaris. These results highlight the importance of strain selection in the application of microalgae for wastewater treatment and, particularly, for the removal of pharmaceuticals.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are increasingly considered for de-centralized wastewater treatment. As MBR can be operated with higher sludge retention time and total suspended solids than conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) the elimination of micropollutants is slightly better for MBR than for WWTP. However to be able to use the MBR filtrate for artificial ground water recharge it is necessary to further improve elimination of micropollutants. In this study, the MBR process has therefore been combined with the adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC). PAC was dosed to the MBR filtrate of a pilot plant and removed again after a contact time of 30 min. PAC was recycled to the MBR process tank to use the residual adsorption capacity. The process was operated continuously for a period of 110 d. With 5-10 mg l(-1) PAC dosage a 50-80% improved elimination of carbamazepine and diclofenac could be achieved compared to the process without PAC.

AB Onsite wastewater disposal systems (OWDS) can introduce bacterial and chemical contaminants, via groundwater, into aquifers and adjacent waterways. We evaluated the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the shallow groundwater of Eastern Long Island, New York, down-gradient of OWDS using cultivation approaches and analysis of 16S rRNA genes. While FIB and ARB were detected in 80% and 67% of groundwater samples, respectively, concentrations were low, suggesting that, at least at the time of sampling, groundwater was not a large-scale source of fecal bacterial contamination to adjacent embayments. ARB isolates did not include common fecal associated genera and the concentration of FIB and ARB did not correlate well with the concentration of pharmaceutical contaminants, suggesting that bacterial contaminants were poorly linked to OWDS discharge. Concentrations of FIB in the studied embayments were significantly greater in nearshore compared to mid-channel environments, suggesting that land-based sources are likely to be the major contributors of bacterial contamination.

AB Membrane application in water reclamation is challenged by fouling which deteriorates membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and solute rejection. Several studies focusing on antifouling membranes incorporated with nanoparticles have been carried out, but these membranes are not yet a viable solution due to their high energy requirements and inability to completely remove or degrade trace organic compounds (TOrCs). Therefore, this study aims at fabricating polyethersulfone (PES) membranes for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by using a unique membrane synthesis approach. PES membranes were synthesised by casting two different solutions before coagulation. Therefore, the synthesis technique was called 'double-casting phase inversion'. The membranes were impregnated with nanohybrid graphene oxide-zinc oxide (GO-ZnO) to increase their hydrophilicity, rejection of pharmaceuticals (by decreasing membrane-solute hydrophobic interactions), resistance to organic fouling and photodegradation properties. The addition of GO-ZnO increased membrane hydrophilicity and pure water permeability. The rejection of TOrCs and antifouling properties were also improved due to a reduction in membrane-solute and membrane-foulant hydrophobic interactions, respectively. In addition to improved TOrC rejection properties and resistance to fouling, GO-ZnO/PES membranes degraded Brilliant Black.

AB Sucralose is one of the most popular artificial sweeteners worldwide. Due to its high stability, persistence and low removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants, sucralose has been used as an indicator of wastewater intrusion into aquatic systems. However, its stability has also been a reason for discussion whether sucralose's presence in surface water could indicate a recent anthropogenic input. Caffeine and acetaminophen have been considered as tracers in human impacted aquatic ecosystems and potentially good indicators of recent anthropogenic inputs into the environment due to their short half-lives in water. Here, a novel, high throughput and sensitive method based on online SPE-LC-HRMS for the determination of caffeine, sucralose and acetaminophen was developed and validated for both fresh and seawater samples and applied to environmental water samples to evaluate the efficiency of these compounds as tracers of aquatic pollution. Caffeine and sucralose were detected in > 70% of samples, while acetaminophen was only detected in 3% of samples above the MDL, demonstrating its limited environmental applicability.

AB A pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 435 days in this study, aiming to treat pharmaceutical solvent wastewater containing m-Cresol (MC), isopropanol (IPA) and N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) pollutants at different temperatures of 35 +/- 3 degrees C, 25 +/- 3 degrees C, 15 +/- 3 degrees C and 25 +/- 3 degrees C, respectively. The reactor reached average total removal efficiencies of about 96%, 97.2% and 98% of MC, IPA and DMF at psychrophilic condition (15 +/- 3 degrees C). Higher physical removal rate was obtained at 15 +/- 3 degrees C due to the important contribution of membrane filtration. At this stage, the biogas production, methane content and specific methanogenic activity and extracellular polymeric substances of suspended sludge were observed with the lowest level. Moreover, the kinetic models for solvent degradation were established at different temperatures, results showed the smaller maximum specific substrate degradation rate of MC and IPA, besides, the lowest degradation rate of three solvents were obtained at 15 +/- 3 degrees C.

AB Understanding the sources, transport, and spatiotemporal variability of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is important for understanding risks and developing monitoring and mitigation strategies. This study used mass balances to compare wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and upstream sources of 16 CECs to a mixed-use watershed in Minnesota, under different seasonal and hydrological conditions. Three distinct CEC groups emerged with respect to their source proportionality and instream behavior. Agricultural herbicides and daidzein inputs were primarily via upstream routes with the greatest loadings and concentrations during high flows. Trimethoprim, mecoprop, nonprescription pharmaceuticals, and personal care products entered the system via balanced/mixed pathways with peak loadings and concentrations in high flows. Carbaryl, 4-nonylphenol, and the remaining prescription pharmaceuticals entered the system via WWTP effluent with relatively stable loadings across sampling events. Mass balance analysis based on multiple sampling events and sites facilitated CEC source comparisons and may therefore prove to be a powerful tool for apportioning sources and exploring mitigation strategies.

These drugs were clofibric acid, phenazone, propyphenazone, diclofenac, ibuprofen and fenofibrate. Additionally, two metabolites N-methylphenacetin probably originating from phenacetin and also a derivative of clofibric acid were detected. These contaminants leach from the neighboring sewage contaminated surface water by bank filtration through the subsoil into the ground water of the water works.

AB This study compared the removal of fifteen trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors, denoted as AeMBR and AnMBR, respectively. Results show that the removal of TrOCs by either AeMBR or AnMBR was determined largely by their hydrophobicity. Almost all hydrophobic TrOCs were effectively removed (>60%) while the removal of hydrophilic compounds varied (3.6%-98.7%). AeMBR was more effective than AnMBR for the removal of all TrOCs investigated with a few exceptions. Compared to AeMBR, the removal of compounds containing nitrogen in their molecular structures (e.g. amitriptyline, carbamazepine, and atrazine) was higher by AnMBR. Of all TrOCs investigated, considerable accumulation in biosolids only occurred to amitriptyline, 4-tert-octyphenol and triclosan, particularly during AnMBR treatment. Nevertheless, biodegradation and/or biotransformation was the main mechanism for TrOC removal by both AeMBR and AnMBR. Moreover, removal of bulk organic matter indicated by total organic carbon and nitrogen was comparable for these two systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Results reported here highlight the potential and several challenges in the development of a novel osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Following the initial gradual decline, a stable permeate flux value was obtained after approximately four days of continuous operation. There was evidence of continuous deterioration of biological activity of the OMBR system, possibly due to the build-up of salinity in the reactor. The removal of 25 out of 27 trace organic compounds with molecular weight higher than 266 g/mol was above 80% and was possibly governed by the interplay between physical separation of the FO membrane and biodegradation. In contrast, the removal efficiency values of the other 23 trace organic compounds with molecular weight less than 266 g/mol were very scattered. The removal efficiency of these low molecular weight compounds by OMBR treatment appears to depend mostly on biological degradation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Limited studies focus on the occurrence, removal rate and seasonal variation of substituted diphenyl-amine antioxidants (SDPAs) in surface water and wastewater in China. In this paper, the detection method of SDPAs was established by the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Daily variations suggested that significant variations were found for the concentrations of some SDPAs in the influent. It was found that the SDPAs could be detected in all the effluent samples and C8/C8-DPA was the predominant compound in two WWTPs. The levels of most SDPAs in the effluent were much lower than that of influent, with the removal efficiencies of total SDPAs ranged from 57.9% to 84.2%. There were significant differences with the SDPA concentrations in the influent between different seasons. Higher concentrations of SDPAs were found at downstream than those of upstream. The results of this study provide more environmental occurrence data and new insights into the research on the environmental fate of these compounds. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microalgae are aquatic photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms which cultivation for the fixation of CO2 and the production of biofuels has received large attention. However, the sustainable development of an algal biorefinery is still a challenge. In this context, the valorization of microalgae biomass for a wastewater adsorptive treatment may be an option to explore. Recently, the presence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in natural waters and the associated risks have led to a great concern, especially in the case of pharmaceuticals. In the present work, the elimination of paracetamol from water by biosorption onto microalgae, namely Synechocystis sp., has been studied. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters have been determined and compared with those obtained when using a commercial activated carbon under the same experimental conditions. Although the adsorption kinetics are very similar onto both materials, at the equilibrium, the Langmuir maximum capacity of the activated carbon (278 mg g(-1)) is five times higher than that of Synechocystis sp. (53 mg g(-1)). In any case, it must be considered that the utilization of microalgae may be considered an environmentally friendly process with important associated savings.

AB To detect site-specific, suspected and formerly unknown contaminants in a wastewater treatment plant effluent, we established a screening procedure based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with stepwise identification schemes. Based on automated substructure searches a list of 2160 suspected site-specific and documented water contaminants was reduced to those amenable to LC-HRMS. After searching chromatograms for exact masses of suspects, presumably false positive detections were stepwise excluded by retention time prediction, the evaluation of isotope patterns, ionization behavior, and HRMS/MS spectra. In nontarget analysis, peaks for identification were selected based on distinctive isotope patterns and intensity. The stepwise identification of nontarget compounds was automated by a plausibility check of molecular formulas using the Seven Golden Rules, an exclusion of compounds with presumably low commercial importance and an automated HRMS/MS evaluation. Six suspected and five nontarget chemicals were identified, of which two have not been previously reported as environmental pollutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the removal of parabens, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and phthalates by ozonation. The second-order rate constants for the reaction between selected compounds with ozone at pH 7 were of (2.2 +0.2) x 10(6) to (2.9 +0.3) x 10(6) M-1/s for parabens, (2.1 +/- 0.3) to (3.9 +/-0.5) M-1/s for phthalates, and (5.2 +/-0.3) M-1/s for DEET. The rate constants for the reaction between selected compounds with hydroxyl radical ranged from (2.49 +/-0.06) x 10(9) to (8.5 +/-0.2) x 10(9) M-1/s. Ozonation of selected compounds in secondary wastewater and surface waters revealed that ozone dose of 1 and 3 mg/L yielded greater than 99% depletion of parabens and greater than 92% DEET and phthalates, respectively. In addition, parabens were found to transform almost exclusively through the reaction with ozone, while DEET and phthalates were transformed almost entirely by hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH).

AB The activated sludge specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) and BOD5/COD ratios of biologically pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater were analyzed and compared to assess relative changes in biotreatability during ozonation at a rate of 7.4 g/(L x h) for 4 h. An appreciable COD removal (41%) was achieved by the initial biological treatment process, whereas ozonation was more effective in reducing the UV-sensitive aromatic compounds present in the pretreated effluent. Sequential treatment using activated sludge + ozonation processes resulted in an average COD removal efficiency of 48%, and a proceeding biotreatment stage increased the overall COD removal to 53%. An optimum ozone dose in the range of 1,8543,708 mg/L corresponding to a specific ozone input rate of 0.23-0.46 mg O-3/mg CODo existed where SOUR (3.7 x 10(-3) mg O-2/[mg MLSS x min] for ozonation at pH 8) and BOD5/COD (0.57) as well as the proceeding biological COD removal yield Y-COD (average 8 mg COD/mg MLSS) exerted maximum values.

AB This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of drugs and endocrine disrupters in water supplies and in water for human consumption. Twelve sampling campaigns were carried out during the rainy and dry season at four sampling points in the Bolonha Complex, in the city of Belem, northern region of Brazil: Bolonha reservoir (catchment) and Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Bolonha (filtered water chamber, treated water tank, and washing water from the filters). The determination of the compounds was performed by solid phase extraction followed by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results confirmed the anthropic influence that the reservoir and WTP-Bolonha have been suffering, as consequence of the discharge of domestic sewage in natura. Among 25 microcontaminants analyzed, 12 were quantified in raw water and 10 in treated water. The antiallergic Loratadine (LRT) was the contaminant that occurred most frequently in all sample points, having been poorly removed (median 12%) in the conventional treatment used. Losartana (LST), 4-octylphenol (4-OP), and Bisphenol A (BPA) also occurred very frequently in raw water with concentrations ranging from 3.7 to 194 ng L-1. Although such contaminants occurred in treated water in concentrations varying from 4.0 to 135 ng L-1, the estimated margin of exposure ranged from 55 to 3333 times which indicates low risk of human exposure to such contaminants through ingestion of treated water.

AB The application of specialized microorganisms to treat dichloromethane (DM) containing process effluents was studied. An aerobic fluidized bed reactor with a working volume of 801 filled with sand particles as carriers for the bacteria was used. Oxygen was introduced into the recycle stream by an injector device. DM was monitored semi-continuously. A processor controlled the feed volume according to the DM effluent concentration. Mineralization rates of 12 kg DM/m(bioreactor)(3).d were reached within about three weeks using synthetic wastewater containing 2000 mg/l DM as single carbon compound. DM from process water of a pharmaceutical plant was reduced from about 2000 mg/l in the feed to below 1 mg/l in the effluent at volumetric loading rates of 3 to 4 kg DM/m(bioreactor)(3).d. Degradation of wastewater components like acetone and isopropanol were favoured, thus making the process less attractive for waste streams containing high amounts of DOC other than of DM. DM concentrations of up to 1000 mg/l were tolerated by the immobilized microorganisms and did not influence their DM degradation capacity. The ability to mineralize DM was lost when no DM was fed to the reactor for 10 days.

AB There is no existing applicable law that regulates compounds of emerging concern (CECs), so they remain a global concern because they are easily taken up by organisms. Because of the current need, different processes have been developed capable of removing CECs. A membrane bioreactor (MBR) system and a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system with a 35% filling ratio were tested on real urban wastewater under 6 and 10 h of hydraulic retention time to remove pharmaceutical compounds. The mixed-liquor suspended solids changed between 5,200 and 5,700 mg/L and the temperature varied between 12.6 degrees C and 28.1 degrees C simulating real conditions. The plant received a shock with the mix of pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin) used to study its behavior. The removal of ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and ciprofloxacin was above 83.7%, 48.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, regardless of the process and the operative variables; these removal rates increased when the temperature increased.

AB Different immunoassays have been developed to monitor sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antibiotic frequently detected in water. The immunoassays were developed and optimized in two different formats: ELISA in polystyrene 96-well plate and microarray on compact disc (CD) support. Competitive microimmunoassays were performed by direct adsorption of immunoreagents on the polycarbonate surface of a low-reflectivity CD. Results were displayed using nanogold-labeled immunoglobulins and silver staining developer. High sensitivity was achieved with both formats: LD 0.001 ng mL(-1) in the ELISA-plate, and 0.09 ng mL(-1) in the CD format. The novel CD methodology presents advantages such as simplicity, sensitivity, portability, analytical capacity (2560 spots per disc), in addition to reductions in immunoreagents required, costs and time for analysis. Both proposed methods were applied to determine SMX at nanograms per litre level in wastewater samples without previous preconcentration. Finally, the determination of several fortified wastewater samples using the CD format protocol showed a mean recovery of 87%, which confirms that this assay format is a good screening tool to detect sulfamethoxazole in water samples rapidly and reliably.

AB This chapter describes the development and use of a geographic information system (GIS) in an environmental health investigation of the application of Class B biosolids (sewage sludge) on agricultural fields. The research project is broad-based including field observations and modeling to investigate the presence of microorganisms, metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in biosolids applied agricultural fields and the associated runoff. These data has been linked with remote sensing imagery and added to GIS layers for Wood, Lucas and Greene Counties in Ohio. Specifically, this project describes the way in which a GIS was developed and utilized with a mailed, epidemiological health survey to investigate the potential impact of biosolids application to agricultural fields in relation to self-reported human health symptoms, acute diseases and chronic diseases among groups of individuals living specified distances from fields where biosolids were permitted and applied. For Wood County, of the 24 symptoms in the survey, six were statistically higher near biosolids permitted fields and of the 29 diseases in the survey, five were statistically higher near biosolids permitted fields. The Lucas and Greene County surveys are still being analyzed. Our future work includes refinement of the spatial analysis and health survey to include the application of biosolids and the constituents of the biosolids to fields, distances to any farm field and to other potential relationships to health effects.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters is an emerging environmental issue. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are recognized as being the main point discharge sources of these substances to the environment. A monitoring campaign of STP effluents was carried out in four European countries (Italy, France, Greece and Sweden). More than 20 individual pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes were found. For six selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, clofibric acid, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and propranolol) present in the STP effluents, the persistence towards abiotic photodegradation was evaluated submitting them to solar experiments at 40degrees N latitude during spring and summer. Based on experimentally measured quantum yields for the direct photolysis in bi-distilled water, half-life times (t(1/2)) at varying seasons and latitude were predicted for each substance. In salt- and organic-free (bi-distilled) water carbamazepine and clofibric acid are characterized by calculated half-life times of the order of 100 days at the highest latitudes (50degrees N) in winter, whereas under the same conditions sulphamethoxazole, diclofenac, ofloxacin and propranolol undergo fast degradation with t(1/2) respectively of 2.4, 5.0, 10.6 and 16.8 days. For almost all studied compounds, except propranolol the presence of nitrate ions in aqueous solutions results in a reduction Of t(1/2). When present, humic acids act as inner filters towards carbamazepine and diclofenac, and as photosensitizers towards sulphamethoxazole, clofibric acid, oflaxocin and propranolol.

AB Remediation of pharmaceutical wastewater, containing nalidixic acid (NXA; 38 mg/L), a quinolone antibacterial agent commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, and characterized as having mainly 725 mg/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 3400 mg/L chemical oxygen demand, and around 4 g/L NaCl, was studied. A prior biodegradability study (Zahn-Wellens test) had demonstrated that the matrix was biodegradable after a rather long biomass adaptation period. After 4 days of treatment in an immobilized biomass reactor (IBR), 96% of the original DOC was removed by the biological treatment; however, more than 50% of NXA was adsorbed on the biomass. As development of chronic toxicity in the IBR is possible after long exposure to NXA, adsorption and biomass stability during continuous exposure to NXA were studied in different cycles for one month. After the biotreatment, the effluent was treated by solar photo-Fenton. Total degradation of NXA and reduction intoxicity were observed. The intermediates formed during degradation by biotreatment and subsequent photo-Fenton were studied by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

AB An artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium was used to remediate a mixture of analgesics (ketoprofen, paracetamol and aspirin) in a stirred-tank photobioreactor. A hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days supported poor treatment because of the formation of p-aminophenol (paracetamol toxic metabolite). Increasing the HRT to 4 days enhanced the bioremediation efficiency. After applying an acclimatization regime, 95% removal of the analgesics mixture, p-aminophenol and COD reduction were achieved. However, shortening the HRT again to 3 days neither improved the COD reduction nor ketoprofen removal. Applying continuous illumination achieved the best analgesics removal results. The harvested biomass contained 50% protein, which included almost all essential amino acids. The detected fatty acid profile suggested the harvested biomass to be a good biodiesel-producing candidate. The water-extractable fraction possessed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. These findings suggest the whole process to be an integrated eco-friendly and cost-efficient strategy for remediating pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The catalyst of cerium supported on activated carbon (Ce/AC) for ozonation was prepared and the catalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA). The results showed that Ce/AC catalyst could not only greatly enhance the degradation of p-TSA but also significantly increase the efficiency of COD removal by ozonation. The COD removal could reach 74.1% with the Ce/AC catalyst at 60 min, while the effects of activated carbon (AC) catalyst and without catalyst were only 62.4% and 50.8%, respectively. The superiority of Ce/AC catalyst was attributed to the fact that cerium increased the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which could react with p-TSA and intermediate to form oxidized products rapidly. Based on the intermediates detected by GC/MS. IC and HPLC, a possible degradation pathway of p-TSA was proposed. Our aim is to provide basic data and theoretical support for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by catalytic ozonation. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Nowadays, due to lack of freshwater resources a sufficient wastewater management is an environmental concern. This global issue is resulting in the rapid growth of technologies for wastewater treatment. In this study a novel rotation generator of hydrodynamic cavitation is presented, which is used as a tool for pharmaceuticals removal in water. On presented machine analysis of hydrodynamics is made, where the extent and aggressiveness of cavitation is evaluated. The study has shown, that for a sufficient treatment, hydrodynamic cavitation with combination of hydrogen peroxide is needed. The removal of four pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac) was considered, where the over 80% effect was achieved. Various operating parameters such as the rotors geometry of the cavitation generator, pressure in the treatment chamber, temperature of the liquid, amount of hydrogen peroxide and time of exposure to the cavitation was investigated. The experimental results show that hydrodynamic cavitation has a good potential for efficient removal of pharmaceuticals what suggests to continue with research in this field and to consider an appropriate design for a commercial use.

AB The aim of this study was to treat the wastewater collected from equalization tank of Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), which was a mixture of waste coming from 525 small-scale industries manufacturing textile and dyestuff intermediate, pigments and pharmaceuticals. Initially a pretreatment using ferric chloride and lime was carried out to increase the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of the effluent, which showed color removal of 74% and COD reduction of 75% at a concentration of 10 and 4 g/L. respectively. The biological treatment system using anaerobic fixed film reactor was investigated as secondary treatment. A mixture of bacterial consortium DMAB and cowdung slurry was used for the formation of biofilm. The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) on the efficiency of treatment of anaerobic reactor was analysed. Subsequent aerobic treatment after anaerobic step using aerobic culture Pseudomonas aeroginosa helped in further removal of COD and color. Formation of aromatic amines during anaerobic treatment was mineralized by sequential aerobic treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sartans are chemical compounds with antagonistic action towards the AT1 receptors of angiotensin II, a multifunctional peptide with vasoconstrictor action and one of the main peptides responsible for regulating blood pressure. Losartan (progenitor of the group), valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, telmisartan and a few other compounds belong to this class. The use of sartans, introduced in the mid-90s of the last century, has quickly spread mainly due to the alleged reduction in the incidence of certain adverse effects of varying severity (cough, angioedema) associated with the intake of ACE inhibitors. Their very strong commercial success together with their low metabolic degradation and high environmental persistence has consecrated them as emerging pollutants in just 20 years. This review presents a complete picture of sartans in relation to their chemical structure, chemical-physical properties and by-products in aqueous solutions as well as under oxidative and photodegradative conditions, their environmental presence and knowledge known to date and their fate in wastewater treatment plants.

AB This study focuses on the application of combining membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment with reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) membrane treatment for removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. Twenty-seven PPCPs were measured in real influent with lowest average concentration being trimethoprim (7.12 ng/L) and the highest being caffeine (18.4 ng/L). The results suggest that the MBR system effectively removes the PPCPs with an efficiency of between 41.08% and 95.41%, and that the integrated membrane systems, MBR-RO/NF, can achieve even higher removal rates of above 95% for most of them. The results also suggest that, due to the differences in removal mechanisms of NF/RO membrane, differences of removal rates exist. In this study, the combination of MBR-NF resulted in the removal of 13 compounds to below detection limits and MBR-RO achieved even better results with removal of 20 compounds to below detection limits.

AB The application of a boron-doped diamond electrode in electrochemical water disinfection was investigated with respect to its inactivation potential of three indicator microorganisms. Drinking water and the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant spiked with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were electrolysed under different conditions in a batch reactor. All three bacteria species could be successfully inactivated in drinking water. The disinfection rate depended on the applied charge, with far more efficiency at high current densities (208 and 333 mA/cm(2)) under high ozone concentrations measured in contrast to low current densities (42 mA/cm(2)) where bacterial inactivation was rather driven by hydroxyl radicals. When oxidising a target pharmaceutical compound in the wastewater treatment plant effluent, the water matrix exhibited an ozone scavenging effect. The resulting decrease in the efficiency could not be detected for the disinfection experiments in the complex water matrix compared to drinking water, which indicates a different disinfection mechanism, probably due to reactive chlorine species.

AB The effluents of wastewater treatment plants, usually directly emitted to the environment, often contain the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF). The paper investigates DCF elimination using irradiation technology. Hydroxyl radical and hydrated electron reactive intermediates resulting from water radiolysis effectively degrade DCF and strongly reduce the toxicity of the solutions. (OH)-O-center dot attaches to one of the rings of DCF, and hydroxylated molecules, 2,6-dichloroaniline and quinoid type compounds are the products. Hydrated electron adds to the chlorine atom containing ring, in the reaction quinoid type compounds and 4-chloroacridine form. At a 0.1 mM DCF concentration, a similar to 1 kGy absorbed dose is needed for the degradation of DCF molecules, but for mineralization of the products (in presence of O-2) an order of magnitude higher dose is required.
   For irradiation of wastewater after biological treatment a similar to 1 kGy dose is suggested. At this dose DCF and other drugs or metabolites present at mu g L-1 level are eliminated together with microorganism deactivation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The existence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the water environment is an emerging problem. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of eleven PPCPs through bioassays on bacteria, algae, crustaceans, amphibians and protozoa, and compared the toxicology indexes with the concentration of PPCPs in river water for ecotoxiclogical risk evaluation. Toxicity of the eleven PPCPs was observed and the values of EC50 or LC50 were in the order of mg/L. A distinctive finding is that antibacterial triclosan affected all aquatic lives tested. The effects of PPCPs varied according to species of lives. Contamination from PPCPs was detected at observation stations on the river, and the range of concentration was in the order of ng/L far lower than the values of toxicity indexes EC50 or LC50. Ecotoxicological risks posed by PPCPs at the observation stations was evaluated using the concentration in the river water and the NOEC examined by AGI tests. The results revealed that three PPCPs, triclosan, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, posed an ecotoxiclogical risk in rivers where wastewater treatment systems are not yet well developed.

AB Phenol and its derivatives are among the dangerous pollutants usually found in the wastewater of petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Photodegradation is one of the most promising techniques to treat phenol-polluted wastewater. The lack of reusability of the photocatalyst and their high agglomeration tendency have reduced its stability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a binary nanocomposite of Fe3O4@SiO2 was synthesized in this study to be used as an active photocatalyst for the photodegradation of phenol under UV irradiation. Numerous physicochemical characterizations were performed to study the morphology, crystallinity, thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposite. These techniques confirmed the effective fusion of the two entities in the newly formed nanocomposite. The efficiency of the photocatalysts was steadily enhanced over the period investigated in this study. The phenol degradation efficacy of 84% was accomplished using Fe3O4@SiO2 composite, which was higher as compared to that of single Fe3O4 (59%). The newly prepared materials can be effectively recycled by facile magnetic separation method.

AB An adsorptive differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry method has been developed for determining the presence of sulfadiazine drugs. The method is based upon the adsorptive collection of the drug on a hanging mercury dropping electrode at -1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Factors affecting the stripping performance such as, pH, accumulation time and potential, sweep rate were critically studied. The optimum conditions were achieved in a Britton-Robinson buffer of pH 5-6. At the optimal conditions, the cathodic stripping current of the drug at -1.0 V versus concentrations was linear in the concentration range -. The lower limit of detection and quantification of the drug were and , respectively. The method was successfully applied for the determination of industrial wastewater, pure form ( %) and drug formulations ( %). The method was validated by comparison with the standard HPLC and the reported methods. The method offers a simple system, coupled with good reproducibility, accuracy, ruggedness, and cost-effectiveness.

AB The fabrication of novel ZnSnO3 hollow nanospheres/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid nanocomposite is reported for the first time. The nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile route, and were well characterized with the aid of XRD, FUR, SEM, TEM, BET, UV-vis, and PL techniques. Moreover, the synthesized nanocomposites were used as photocatalysts in the application of the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this study, ZnSnO3 hollow nanospheres showed high efficiency in photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. More interestingly, the photocatalytic activities of these nanospheres could be enhanced by coupling with RGO, where a large improvement (approx. 30.4% increase compared with pure ZnSnO3) in photodegradation of metronidazole was observed on the prepared ZnSnO3/RGO hybrid nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. This improvement might be attributed to the advanced adsorption efficiency of molecules and enhanced visible light absorption within the hybrid nanocomposites by the introduction of RGO. Such study might pave the way toward designing novel photocatalyst systems for efficient degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The plant uptake of emerging organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is receiving increased attention. Biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment have been previously identified as a major source for PPCPs. Thus, plant uptake of PPCPs from biosolids applied soils needs to be understood. In the present study, the uptake of carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and triclocarban by five vegetable crop plants was examined in a field experiment. At the time of harvest, three compounds were detected in all plants grown in biosolids-treated soils. Calculated root concentration factor (RCF) and shoot concentration factor (SCF) are the highest for carbamazepine followed by triclocarban and diphenhydramine. Positive correlation between RCF and root lipid content was observed for carbamazepine but not for diphenhydramine and triclocarban. The results demonstrate the ability of crop plants to accumulate PPCPs from contaminated soils. The plant uptake processes of PPCPs are likely affected by their physico-chemical properties, and their interaction with soil. The difference uptake behavior between plant species could not solely be attributed to the root lipid content. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are increasingly considered for decentralized waste water treatment. In this study, the operation parameters on a pilot MBR were optimized, and the removal of organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues was studied. During the first phase of the research project, two membrane materials (polyethersulfone, polysulfonamide) were chosen for the manufacturing of plate modules and operation in a pilot plant, which was installed in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (20.000 p.e.).
   Operation conditions were optimized with regard to flux, filtration time, aeration rate, sludge age, total suspended solids, etc. Both membranes were ultrafiltration membranes and therefore achieved a very good retention with regard to particles (microorganisms and turbidity). In comparison to the conventional wastewater treatment process the system performance with regard to COD removal was higher in the MBR. Analysis of samples taken from the MBR process tank and the filtrate of both membrane types showed an improved elimination of some specific organic pollutants. Due to the promising results, more process based MBR studies are encouraged.

AB Various species of amoebas belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in many parts of the world. Some strains of these protozoans may exist as parasites and pose risks to human health as causative agents of serious human diseases. Currently in China there IS a lack of information about the distribution of Acanthamoeba strains in the environment. Accordingly, 261 environmental water samples taken from rivers, sewage, and pharmaceutical factory drains were collected in Qinghai Province, China. The material was filtered and then analysed with both LAMP and PCR assays. Of the samples examined, Acanthamoeba DNA was found in 32 (14.68%) samples with the use of LAMP; in 13 of these samples, DNA from this amoeba was also detected using PCR. Sequencing of selected positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the Acanthamoeba 18S rRNA gene and that isolates represent the T4 genotype, known as the Most common strain related to AK cases. The results indicate that surface water, as well as water taken from sewage And pharmaceutical drains, may be a source of acanthamoebic strains potentially pathogenic for humans in China. It has been also demonstrated that LAMP assays is more sensitive than PCR and can be regarded as useful tool for screening the environment for Acanthamoeba spp. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics. SMX degradation in sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge systems has not been reported so far. This research investigated the SMX degradation using SRB sludge in a sulfate-reducing up-flow sludge bed reactor. Moreover, the mechanisms and kinetics of SMX removal were also investigated using SRB sludge via a series of batch experiments. The results showed that SMX removal was characterized by a rapid sorption onto SRB sludge, and desorption from SRB sludge to aqueous phase until achieving equilibrium, and then followed by slow biodegradation. Biodegradation was the dominant route for SMX removal. The sorption process conformed well to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, meaning that the sorption occurred primarily via a chemical sorption process. The removal of SMX followed the pseudo-zero-order kinetic model with a specific removal rate of 13.2 +/- 0.1 mu g/L/d at initial SMX concentration 100 mu g/L in batch tests. Based on the analysis of metabolites, most of the SMX biotransformation products' structures altered in the isoxazole ring, which were significantly different from that produced by aerobic and anaerobic sludge systems. Thus, SRB sludge system could play an important role in SMX biodegradation, especially in Sulfate-reduction Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI) process for sewage treatment.

DE Heavy metals; leaching; nanoparticles; water; wastewater treatment
AB With the rapid increase in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for diverse applications and to contribute to the understanding of suitability of nanoparticles (NPs) in pharmaceutical effluent treatment, this study was conceptualized. Here, we profiled the concentration of selected heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu and Ni) in pharmaceutical effluent samples over three sampling periods using atomic absorption spectroscopy and evaluated the effectiveness of B. sapida synthesized copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) in pharmaceutical effluent treatment. The results showed that there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the heavy metals concentration of the pharmaceutical effluents across the three sampling periods. This observation could be attributed to the low environmental concentration of the metals that prevented significant leaching into the company's water source through rainfall or the highly effective water treatment pathways that successfully reduced the metals concentration. Despite the observed increase in Cu ions in the treated samples due to the synthesized NPs, its concentration still conforms to the internationally accepted admissible limit in drinkable water. Studies seeking to understand the suitability and toxicological implications of use of the NP-treated effluents are highly encouraged and efforts are underway in this direction.

AB An electrocoagulation flotation (ECF) process was used to remove selected nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, from water. A cationic surfactant, cethyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), was added to the solution as a collector and frother. Without the addition of the cationic surfactant, the removal of NSAIDs in a single-NSAID solution was in the range of 10-45%; it decreased to approximately 10% in multiple-NSAID systems. However, after adding a stoichiometric amount of CTAB, the removal of NSAIDs significantly improved in single-NSAID systems. For multiple-NSAID removal, the concentration of CTAB required to achieve ideal removal was equal to the sum of the molar concentrations of all the NSAIDs. In addition, a high current density produced smaller bubbles, thus enhanced the electro-flotation and achieved better removal performance. Removal of multiple-NSAIDs in actual hospital wastewater was significantly lower due to interference by oils and other hydrophobic substances. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We look at the most important issues of the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and conclude that the nutrients from human metabolism are of no importance for the global nitrogen cycle and of minor. importance for the global phosphorus cycle. However, for water pollution control, N and P from the human metabolism are of extreme importance. Nitrogen is mainly an issue for coastal waters, whereas P is an issue for freshwater and coastal areas alike. It is by now generally recognised that coastal ecosystems a re exceedingly important for human well-being and at the same time highly endangered. The recycling issue is of high importance in areas where nutrient application is low due to economic constraints. NoMix technology (urine source separation) holds a large promise to become an efficient mainstream technology. The largest short-term potential is found in densely populated areas in coastal areas without existing infrastructure and in areas with nutrient deficiency, especially in urban areas with a large nutrient potential. We believe, however, that these technologies will, with time, also become competitive in Europe.

AB Recently, a new type of organic pollution derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is gradually on the rise. Wastewater treatment to remove PPCPs was investigated using an aerobic granular sludge sequencing bioreactor (GSBR). After optimization of influent organic load, hydraulic shear stress, sludge settling time, etc., aerobic granular sludge was analyzed for its physiological and biochemical characteristics and tested for its efficacy to remove PPCPs wastewater. The granular sludge effectively removed some but not all of the PPCPs tested; removal correlated with the microbial profiles in the granules, as assessed using Solexa sequencing technology. Sequencing revealed the presence of five phylogenetic groups: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, an unclassified genus, and Zoogloea. The results demonstrated changes in the microbial profiles with time in response to the presence of PPCPs. The effects of PPCPs on microbial communities in granular sludge process are discussed.

AB The degradation of chlortetracycline in synthetic solution and in municipal effluent was investigated using a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process under visible irradiation. The N-doped TiO2 used as photoanode with 3.4 at.% of nitrogen content was prepared by means of a radiofrequency magnetron sputtering (RF-MS) process. Under visible irradiation, higher photoelectrocatalytic removal efficiency of CTC was recorded using N-doped TiO2 compared to the conventional electrochemical oxidation, direct photolysis and photocatalysis processes. The photoelectrocataIytic process operated at 0.6 A of current intensity during 180 min of treatment time promotes the degradation of 99.1 +/- 0.1% of CTC. Under these conditions, removal rates of 85.4 +/- 3.6%, 87.4 +/- 3.1% and 55.7 +/- 2.9% of TOC, TN and NH4+ have been recorded. During the treatment, CTC was mainly transformed into CO2 and H2O. The process was also found to be effective in removing indicator of pathogens such as fecal coliform (log-inactivation was higher than 1.2 units). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rejection of steroid hormone estrone by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes in treated sewage effluent was investigated Four NF/RO membranes with different materials and interfacial characteristics were utilized To better understand hormone removal mechanisms in treated effluent, effluent organic matters (EfOM) were fractionated using column chromatographic method with resins XAD-8, AG MP-50 and IRA-96 The results indicate that the presence of EfOM in feed solution could enhance estrone rejection significantly Hydrophobic acid (HpoA) organic fraction made a crucial contribution to this "enhancement effect" Hydrophobic base (HpoB) could also improve estrone rejection while hydrophobic neutral (HpoN) and hydrophilic acid (HpoA) with low aromaticity had little effects. The increment in estrone rejection was predominantly attributed to the binding of estrone by EfOM in feed solutions, which led to an increase in molecular weight and appearance of negative charge (for the HpoA case) and thus an increased level of estrone rejection However, the improvement of estrone rejection by HpoA decreased with increasing calcium ion concentration The important conclusion of this study is, first, hydrophobic acid macromolecules are recommended to be added into feed water to improve the rejection of trace hormone during NF/RO membrane process, and, second, removal of calcium ions via pretreatment and application of membrane with more negative charge at its interface can greatly intensify this "enhancement effect" (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB The increase in the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in the environmental compartments is becoming emerging concern as it reflects their inefficient treatment in the wastewater treatment plants which are the main sources of these micropollutants. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed and frequently detected pain medications in wastewater treatment plants. A lab scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for seven months and acute inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on activated sludge was tested with respirometry. Culture amendment with different concentrations of NSAIDs in the presence as well as absence of nitrification inhibitor resulted in considerable variation in the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) profiles. The decrease in OUR and nitrate production rate governed with reduced heterotrophic and nitrification activity. The kinetics of half saturation for growth and maximum autotrophic growth rates are determined to be affected negatively by the acute impact of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals even at the environmentally relevant concentrations. High removal of tested NSAIDs was observed even for the first time introduce with these compounds.

AB Pharmaceuticals and antibiotics have taken relatively little attention as contaminants in the natural environments. Ciprofloxacin (CP) as a second-generation fluoroquinolone is found in the wastewater generated from pharmaceutical product and industry. This research has assessed the efficacy of the next generation carbon family adsorbent, graphene nanosheet (GNS) to remove the CP from the water samples. Both adsorption experiments and the first principles of calculations (DFT) were applied to explore the molecular interaction between CP and GNS. The effects of initial concentration of CP, pH, shaking time and temperature of solution on adsorption content were investigated. In the neutral pH region (pH 6.0), the adsorption process was desirable. The shaking time to obtain equilibrium condition was 220 min and the experimental kinetic data were fitted with Elovich model. The equilibrium data were perfectly fitted to both Sips and Hill models. Ab-initio calculations demonstrated that CP could be adsorbed onto GNS by an electrostatic interaction being in good compromise with the experimental results.

AB Models for predicting the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been developed to provide engineers and decision-makers with tools that they can use to improve their understanding of, and evaluate how to optimize, the removal of MPs and determine their impact on the receiving waters. This paper provides an overview of such models, and discusses the impact of regulation, engineering practice and research on model development. A review of the current status of MP models reveals that a single model cannot represent the wide range of MPs that are present in wastewaters today, and that it is important to start considering classes of MPs based on their chemical structure or ecotoxicological effect, rather than the individual molecules. This paper identifies potential future research areas that comprise (i) considering transformation products in MP removal analysis, (ii) addressing advancements in WWTP treatment technologies, (iii) making use of common approaches to data acquisition for model calibration and (iv) integrating ecotoxicological effects of MPs in receiving waters.

AB The industrial chemical melamine is often detected in surface water used for drinking water production, due to its wide application and insufficient removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Melamine can be removed from water by adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC), nevertheless, GAC needs periodic reactivation in costly and energy intense processes. As an alternative method, GAC can also be regenerated using biomass capable of degrading melamine in a process called bioregeneration. We assessed melamine biodegradation in batch experiments in fully oxic and anoxic, as well as in alternating oxic and anoxic conditions. Additionally, we studied the effect of an additional carbon source on the biodegradation. The most favourable conditions for melamine biodegradation were applied to bioregenerate GAC loaded with melamine. We demonstrate that melamine can be biodegraded in either oxic or anoxic conditions and that melamine degrading biomass can restore at least 28% of the original GAC adsorption capacity. Furthermore, our results indicate that bioregeneration occurs mainly in the largest pore fraction of GAC, impacting adsorption kinetics. Overall, we show that bioregeneration has a large potential for restoring GAC adsorption capacity in industrial wastewater.

AB An Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor combined with a two-stage membrane bioreactor were operated for 193 days in order to evaluate the biological removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) from low-strength municipal wastewater. The system worked in three different organic load stages (0.7 +/- 0.1 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1), 0.4 +/- 0.1 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1) and 0.1 +/- 0.0 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1)) to assess the impact of the influent OLR on operational parameters such as anaerobic and aerobic sludge retention time (SRT), acidity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biomass activity or biogas production. The highest carbamazepine removals were achieved during the anaerobic stage (UASB reactor), reaching averages of 48.9%, 48.0% and 38.2% operating at high, medium and low OLR, respectively. The aerobic treatment (MBR) served as post-treatment, improving the removals, and the global UASB-MBR system reached averages of 70.0%, 59.6% and 49.8% when the influent was at medium and low OLR, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of combined biological systems on the removal of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals.

AB A recently developed, staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (SAF-MBR) system has demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional activated sludge systems at similar hydraulic residence times. The low biosolid generation rate, small footprint, and energy-positive potential (from captured methane) suggest the possible advantages of using the SAF-MBR upstream of advanced treatment for decentralized water reuse. Previous research conducted on laboratory-scale systems indicated that the SAF-MBR system is capable of removing pharmaceutical compounds. The purpose of this study was to compare the removals of disinfection byproduct precursors as well as pharmaceuticals by parallel pilot-scale SAF-MBR and full-scale aerobic systems treating municipal wastewater. Significantly better removals of antivirals (acyclovir and lamivudine), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol), a beta-blocker aerobic biotransformation product (metoprolol acid), an anticonvulsant (carbamazepine), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim), N-nitrosomorpholine, and the precursors of N-nitrosodimethylamine were obtained by the SAF-MBR system. Concentrations of trihalomethane precursors were lower in the SAF-MBR effluent in two of the three samplings.

AB In this study, a total of 52 pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in the receiving waters were quantified with an analytical method using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry. 36 out of the 52 pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent and effluent of the STPs at quantifiable levels; influent and effluent concentrations ranged 1 ng L-1 to 30 mu g L-1 and 3 ng (L-1) to 3 mu g L-1, respectively. They were also detected from the receiving waters (both tributaries and main river); their concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng L-1. A simple mass balance model was applied for the pharmaceutical data measured for the STPs, tributaries, and the main river to demonstrate the contribution of the STP5 to the pollution of the streams and the main river. The average ratio of the model estimations and the measured concentrations was calculated 97% for the downstream of the STPs, while that for the main river was 89%. This modeling result clearly demonstrates that many pharmaceuticals flowing into an STP are not degraded and discharged to a nearby river, affecting the whole water body, and that the SIP is the only source of the pollutants. While their discharge into STPs should be avoided. In addition, development of new technologies capable of completely degrading them is desirable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the current analytical processes that are not able to measure all the pharmaceutical molecules and to the high costs and the consumption of time to sample and analyze PhACs, models to calculate Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs) have been developed. However a comparison between MECs and PECs, taking into account the methods of calculations and peculiarly the parameters included in the calculation (consumption data, pharmacokinetic parameters, elimination rate in STPs and in the environment), is necessary to assess the validity of PECs. MEC variations of sixteen target PhACs [acetaminophen (ACE), amlodipine (AML), atenolol (ATE), caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CAR), doxycycline (DOX), epoxycarbamazepine (EPO), fluvoxamine (FLU), furosemide (FUR), hydrochlorothiazide (HYD), ifosfamide (WO), losartan (LOS), pravastatin (PRA), progesterone (PROG), ramipril (RAM), trimetazidine (TRI)] have been evaluated during one hydrological cycle, from October 2011 to October 2012 and compared to PECs calculated by using an adaptation of the models proposed by Heberer and Feldmann (2005) and EMEA (2006). Comparison of PECs and MECS has been achieved for six molecules: ATE, CAR, DOX, FUR, HYD and PRA DOX, FUR and HYD present differences between PECs and MECs on an annual basis but their temporal evolutions follow the same trends. PEC evaluation for these PhACs could then be possible but need some adjustments of consumption patterns, pharmacokinetic parameters and/or mechanisms of (bio)degradation. ATE, CAR and PRA are well modeled; PECs can then be used as reliable estimation of concentrations without any reserve. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work investigated the presence of 21 emerging contaminants of various chemical groups (7 estrogens, 3 progestogens, 6 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and 5 acidic pesticides) in the Llobregat river basin (NE Spain). Waters from the outlet of various sewage treatment plants (STP) and waterworks located along the river basin, as well as water samples from the river or its tributaries upstream and downstream of these plants were analysed in two pilot monitoring studies. Chemical analyses were performed by means of on-line or off-line solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. Methods detection limits (in ng/L) were <= 0.85 for estrogens, <= 3.94 for progestogens, <= 30 for PPCPs, and <= 0.99 for pesticides. Of the estrogens and progestogens analysed, only estrone-3-sulfate, estrone, estriol and progesterone were found to be present in the low nanogram per liter range in some of the samples investigated. Except for atenolol, all PPCPs studied (ibuprofen, diclofenac, clofibric acid, salicylic acid, and triclosan) could be identified at levels usually tower than 250 ng/L and up to 1200 ng/l (diclofenac). Of the various pesticides investigated (2,4-D, bentazone; MCPA, mecoprop and propanil) MCPA and 2,4-D were the most ubiquitous and abundant and bentazone the only one not detected. Individual concentrations were most often below 100 ng/L and never surpassed the EU limits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 41 pharmaceuticals and phytochemicals (PPs) including their metabolites was surveyed in hospital effluent in an urban area of Japan. A detailed survey of sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent, and river water was also conducted. Finally, mass balances with mass fluxes of the target PPs through the water flow were evaluated and the degree of contribution of hospital effluent to the environmental discharge was estimated. The results indicate that 38 compounds were detectable in hospital effluent over a wide concentration range from ng/L to mu g/L, with a maximum of 92 mu g/L. The contributions of PPs in the hospital effluent to STP influent varied widely from < 0.1% to 14.8%. Although almost all of the remaining components could be removed below 1.0 ng/L at STPs by the addition of ozone treatment, a number of PPs still remained above 10 ng/L in STP effluent. These findings suggest the importance of applying highly developed treatments to hospital effluents and at STPs in the future to reduce the environmental risks posed by PPs. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the presence of two conjugated metabolites of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide and acetaminophen sulfate, as well as of loxoprofen and loxoprofen alcohol, in hospital effluent, STP, and river waters.

AB This study characterized changes in biomarker responses in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) upon exposure to effluent water discharged from a sewage treatment plant (STP) under real conditions. Fish were exposed to contamination in Cezarka pond, which receives all of its water input from the STP in the town of Vodnany, Czech Republic. Five sampling events were performed at day 0, 30, 90, 180, and 360 starting in April 2015. In total, 62 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were detected in the polar organic chemical integrative sampler. Compared to a control pond, the total concentration of PPCPs was 45, 16, 7, and 7 times higher in Cezarka pond at day 30, 90, 180, and 360, respectively. The result of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme biomarkers indicated alterations in the liver and intestine tissues of fish from Cezarka pond at day 30 and 360, respectively. High plasma vitellogenin levels were observed in both exposed females (180 and 360 days) and males (360 days) compared with their respective controls. However, only exposed female fish had higher vitellogenin mRNA expression than the control fish in these periods. Exposed female fish showed irregular structure of the ovary with scattered oocytes, which further developed to a vitellogenic stage at day 360. Low white blood cell levels were indicated in all exposed fish. Despite numerous alterations in exposed fish, favorable ecological conditions including high availability of food resulted in a better overall condition of the exposed fish after 1 year of exposure compared to the controls.

AB This is the first nationwide survey of emerging contaminants in Brazilian waters. One hundred drinking water samples were investigated in 22 Brazilian state capitals. In addition, seven source water samples from two of the most populous regions of the country were evaluated. Samples were collected from June to September of 2011 and again during the same period in 2012. The study covered emerging contaminants of different classes, including hormones, plasticizers, herbicides, triclosan and caffeine. The analytical method for the determination of the compounds was based on solid-phase extraction followed by analysis via liquid chromatography electrospray triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Caffeine, triclosan, atrazine, phenolphthalein and bisphenol A were found in at least one of the samples collected in the two sampling campaigns. Caffeine and atrazine were the most frequently detected substances in both drinking and source water. Caffeine concentrations in drinking water ranged from 1.8 ng L-1 to values above 2.0 mu g L-1 while source-water concentrations varied from 40 ng L-1 to about 19 mu g L-1. For atrazine, concentrations were found in the range from 2.0 to 6.0 ng L-1 in drinking water and at concentrations of up to 15 ng L-1 in source water. The wide spread presence of caffeine in samples of treated water is an indication of the presence of domestic sewage in the sourcewater, considering that caffeine is a compound of anthropogenic origin.

AB Over the years, pervaporation has been widely investigated as a technique for separation of liquid mixtures and recovery of organic compounds from diluted solutions. So far, the research has focused on applications in wastewater treatment, in pharmaceutical industry, for removing the products from fermentation broth in bioreactors and for aroma recovery. When it comes to pervaporation of aroma compounds, this technique has shown potential to concentrate these compounds up to several hundreds times their original concentration.

AB Over the last ten years there have been reports of pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) residuals in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The principle goal of this study was specifically to expand and in some cases establish a Canadian database for the presence of selected acidic drugs, triclosan, polycyclic musks, and selected estrogens in MWWTP influent and effluent. The impact of treatment configuration (e.g. lagoons, conventional activated sludge (CAS), and CAS followed by media filtration (CAS +filtration)) was also examined. For CAS systems, the most prevalent treatment type, the effect of operating temperature and SRT was evaluated. Selected PPCPs included ten acidic pharmaceuticals (i.e. a group of pharmaceuticals that are extractable at a pH of 2 or less), triclosan, five polycyclic musks and two estrogens. The pharmaceuticals and musks were selected on the basis of levels of use in Canada; reported aquatic toxicity effects; and the ability to analyze for the compounds at low levels. Twelve MWWTPs discharging into the Thames River, the second largest river in southwestem Ontario, were surveyed.
   The only common characteristic of acidic drugs is their extraction pH as they differ in their intended biological function and chemical structure. Many organics degraded by WWTP processes benefit from warm temperatures and long SRTs so the impact of these variables warranted additional attention.
   Influent concentrations and reductions for acidic drugs reported by this study were compared to other Canadian studies, when available, and European investigations. The data of this study seems consistent with other reports. Ten acidic drugs were considered by this study. Three were consistently present at non-quantifiable levels (e.g. CLF, FNP and FNF). Additionally, one analyte, SYL, presented results that were so inconsistent that the values were not analysed.
   The remaining six acidic pharmaceuticals were placed into three categories. IBU and NPX members of the first category had consistently high reductions. At the level of reduction achieved (i.e. median reduction of greater than 93%) and any effect of treatment type or operating characteristics would be subtle and non-discemable given the analytical noise. In the second group are KTP and IND, and definitive comments are difficult to make on the impact of treatment type and operational considerations due to a sparse data set (i.e. many influent values were at non-quantifiable concentrations). Median reductions were in the 23% to 44% range. In the last category are GMF and DCF which have median reductions of 66% and -34%, respectively. Several negative reduction values in the data set (i.e. twelve of twenty six sampling events) suggest that DCF may be deconjugated under certain conditions. This warrants further evaluation when analytical methods for measuring human metabolites of DCF are available. For both GMF and DCF, reduction does not appear to be strongly influenced by SRTs up to 15 days, while SRTs over 30 days were associated with more frequent non-quantifiable effluent levels of DCF. This would suggest that better treatment would be provided by lagoons and CAS systems with extended aeration. Preliminary data suggests that temperature does not play a strong role in the reduction of these compounds.
   Triclosan (TCL) was detected at concentrations of 0.01-4.01 mu g/L in influent samples and 0.01-0.324 mu g/L in effluent samples. Reduction of TCL ranged from 74% to 98%. Lagoon treatment seems to be the best TCL reduction as it was present in the influent and effluent at quantifiable and non-quantifiable concentrations, respectively, on nine of nine sampling occasions.
   Influent and reduction values of five polycyclic musks (e.g. ADBI, AHMI, ATII, HHCB, and AHTN) were examined over the course of this study. AJIMI was predominantly present at non-quantifiable concentrations. HHCB and AHTN were present at the highest concentrations. A comparison between Canadian values and those of European studies indicate that in general polycyclic musk concentrations in Canadian MWWTP effluents are 5-10 times lower. More extensive European and Canadian databases would be useful in confirming this initial observation.
   Median reductions for the five remaining musks range between 37% and 65% in CAS systems. CAS+filtration systems would be expected to have higher reductions if musks were bound to the effluent solids. This trend is not apparent but this may be due to the small size of the data set. In lagoon systems, musk reduction for HHCB and AHTN are approximately 98-99%. For ADBI and ATH musk, there are no numerical reduction values as most often the effluent concentration was non-quantifiable. In some instances, both the influent and effluent concentrations were non-quantifiable.
   The hormones 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were detected at concentrations of 0.006 to 0.0 14 and 0.0 16 to 0.049 mu g/L, respectively. E2 was not detected in any effluent samples (< 0.005 gg/L) whereas El was detected in effluent samples from CAS treatment plants (median of 0.008 mu g/L), and in one sample from lagoons.
   These data demonstrate that there are detectable levels of PPCPs entering Canadian waterways at trace levels, and that only some of these compounds are being reduced in a significant proportion by municipal wastewater treatment processes.

AB The extraction and preconcentration of chiral beta-blockers in environmental water was evaluated by solidphase extraction (SPE) employing an SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silica functionalised with alkyl chains of different length. The materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements and elemental analysis. Important parameters influencing extraction efficiency, including the type and amount of sorbent and the breakthrough volume, were optimised. The results obtained showed that the organic chain length played an important role in the behaviour of these sorbents. Under optimised conditions, using 200 mg SBA-15-C8 as sorbent, a simple analytical method based on off-line SPE coupled to chiral capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection (SPE-chiral CE-DAD) was developed. Method detection and quantification limits were lower than 0.6 and 1.9 mu g L-1 respectively for all enantiomers, with a preconcentration factor of 500-fold. The method was successfully applied to the chiral analysis of atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol in river and sewage water samples. Satisfactory recoveries (between 86 +/- 2 and 98 +/- 1 %) and repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 9 %, n = 3) were obtained. Metoprolol was detected in sewage water at a concentration of 10.7 and 9.9 mu g L-1 and an enantiomeric fraction of 0.52 and 0.48 for the first- and the second-migrating enantiomers respectively. These results emphasise the importance of enantioselective analysis for environmental risk assessment.

AB Agricultural application of sewage sludge has been emotionally discussed in the last decades, because the latter contains organic micropollutants with unknown fate and risk potential. In this work, the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. More specifically, the potential impacts of emerging micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, present in the sludge have been quantified. Four scenarios were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (mesophilic or thermophilic) and the sludge retention time (20 or 10 d), and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge.
   From an environmental point of view, the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative, except for global warming due to the dominance (65-85%) of the indirect emissions associated to the electricity use. Nutrient-related direct emissions dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenarios (>71.4%), although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertilisers production is also quantified (up to 6.7%). In terms of human and terrestrial toxicity, the direct emissions of heavy metals to soil dominate these two impact categories (>70%), and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal. Moreover, only six (Galaxolide, Tonalide, Diazepam, Ibuprofen, Sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol) out of the 13 substances considered are really significant since they account for more than 95% of the overall micropollutants impact.

AB The occurrence of 12 selected pharmaceutical compounds and pharmaceutical compound metabolites in sewage treatment works (STW) effluents and surface waters was investigated. The substances selected for the monitoring programme were identified by a risk ranking procedure to identify those substances with the greatest potential to pose a risk to the aquatic environment. STW final effluent and surface water samples were collected from Corby, Great Billing, East Hyde, Harpenden and Ryemeads STWs. Ten of the 12 pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the STW effluent samples: propranolol (100%, median = 76 ng/l), diclofenac (86%, median = 424 ng/l), ibuprofen (84%, median = 3086 ng/l), mefenamic acid (81%, median = 133 ng/l), dextropropoxyphene (74%, median= 195 ng/l), trimethoprim (65%, 70 ng/l), erythromycin (44%, <10 ng/l), acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (33%, median = <50 ng/l), sulfamethoxazole (9%, median = <50 ng/l), tamoxifen (4%, median = <10 ng/l). In the corresponding receiving streams, fewer compounds and lower concentrations were found: propranolol (87%, median = 29 ng/l), ibuprofen (69%, median = 826 ng/l), mefenamic acid (60%, median = 62 ng/l), dextropropoxyphene (53%, median = 58 ng/l), diclofenac (47%, median = <20 ng/l), erythromycin (38%, median = <10 ng/l), trimethoprim, (38%, median = <10 ng/l), acetyl sulfamethoxazole (38%, median = <50 ng/l). Four human pharmaceutical compounds were detected in samples upstream of the STWs sampled: ibuprofen (57%, median = 181 ng/l), trimethoprim (36%, median <10 ng/l), erythromycin (17%, median = <10 ng/l), propranolol (14%, median = <10 ng/l), suggesting that longer range stream transport of some compounds is possible.
   The particular STW that was sampled and the month that it was sampled significantly influenced the measured concentrations of several, but not all, substances. There was no significant relationship between usage data and the overall frequency with which different substances were detected. There was however, some evidence to suggest that usage data are positively associated with concentrations of pharmaceuticals in effluent and, particularly, with concentrations measured in surface waters below STWs.
   These results suggest that most sewage treatment works in England and Wales are likely to be routinely discharging small quantities of pharmaceuticals into UK rivers. None of the pharmaceuticals were found at concentrations that were high enough to cause acute toxic impacts to aquatic organisms. However, insufficient data were available to be able to comment on whether the concentrations measured have the potential to result in more subtle long-term effects on aquatic organisms (e.g. effects on growth, ability to reproduce).

AB A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing new in vitro and in vivo methods to identify and classify endocrine disrupting chemicals that have been identified in environmental samples. In this study an in vitro test based on recombinant yeast strains transfected with genes for the human estrogen receptor alpha was adapted to examine the presence of estrogenic and antiestrogenic substances in six Swedish landfill leachates. Antiestrogenic effects were measured as inhibition of the estradiol induced response with the human estrogen receptor alpha, and quantified by comparison with the corresponding inhibitory effects of a known antiestrogen, hydroxytamoxifen. The estrogenicity was within the range of that determined in domestic sewage effluents, from below the limit of detection to 29 ng estradiol units L(-1). Antiestrogenicity was detected in some of the investigated landfill leachates, ranging between < 38 and 3800 mu g hydroxytamoxifen equivalents L(-1). There was no apparent relation between the type of waste deposited on the landfills and the antiestrogenic effect. Fractionation of a landfill leachate showed that estrogenic compounds were located in two dominant fractions. Three estrogenic compounds were found that accounted for the estrogenic activity in extracts of leachates: bisphenol A, estradiol, and ethinylestradiol. The bisphenol may have been released from decomposing plastic waste and the estrogenic steroids from earlier deposits of municipal sewage sludge and pharmaceutical waste. Fractionation of leachates from three parts of a landfill showed that the antiestrogenic activity was distributed in at least four fractions and somewhat different in different flows of leachate. This indicated a heterogeneous mixture of antiestrogenic substances. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 26:233-239, 2011.

AB The photolysis of the antibiotic sulphamethoxazole (SMX) using a low pressure ultraviolet (UV) lamp with emission of monochromatic wavelength at 254 nm was evaluated in Milli-Q water and the effluent from a real sewage treatment plant (STP). The effects of various parameters including initial SMX concentration, solution pH, a variety of inorganic anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and HCO3-) and humic acid (HA) have been assessed. The results showed that 10 mg L-1 of SMX was removed within 30 min of irradiation in Milli-Q water. The removal of SMX fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model with the rate constants in the range of 0.170 to 0.932 min(-1) for initial SMX concentrations of 1.0 to 10 mg L-1. Solution pHs of 2.0-5.5 were more favourable for SMX degradation, compared with caustic conditions. On the other hand, slight improvements in SMX degradation in water matrixes with Cl-, SO42- and NO3- anions at 1.0 mM concentration and HA (when used at 5 mg L-1) were observed. However, HCO3- (used at 1.0 mM) and HA (when used at concentrations of 20, 50 and 100 mg L-1) slowed down the degradation rate. The complete degradation of SMX was almost achieved in STP effluent spiked with 10 mg L-1 of SMX after 60 min of irradiation, and the rate constants showed that the turbidity in STP effluent had no significant adverse effect on SMX removal. Total organic carbon was hardly changed even after 8 h of irradiation, showing negligible mineralization of its intermediates under UV254 irradiation.

AB This study attempted to clarify the long-term pharmaceutical removal mechanism from sewage treatment plant effluent during the cyclical adsorption-regeneration operation of 5 commercial resin-based fixed-bed reactors with the simultaneous occurrence of electrostatic interactions and complex non electrostatic interactions. It examined 12 pharmaceuticals belonging to 10 therapeutic classes with different predominant existing forms and hydrophobicities. Furthermore, the effect of the resin charged functional group (strong-base vs. strong-acid vs. non-ionic), porosity (macroporous vs. gel), and chemical matrix (polystyrenic vs. polyacrylic) on the mechanism was investigated to optimize resin properties and achieve higher pharmaceutical removal. The results reported herein indicate the importance of non electrostatic interactions between pharmaceuticals and the resin backbone during short-term cyclical operation (i.e., the 1st adsorption-regeneration cycle). With the development of cyclical operation, however, non-electrostatic interaction-induced pharmaceutical removal generally decreased and even disappeared when equilibrium was achieved between the influent and the resin. Despite pharmaceutical therapeutic class or hydrophilicity, anion (or cation) exchange resin preferentially removed those pharmaceuticals that were predominantly present as organic anions (or cations) by ion exchange process during long-term cyclical operation (i.e., >= 6 adsorption-regeneration cycles). Besides pharmaceuticals predominantly present as undissociated molecules, some amphoteric pharmaceuticals containing large amounts of zwitterions were also difficult to remove by ion exchange resin. Additionally, neither resin porosity nor chemical matrix had any significant effect on the long-term pharmaceutical removal mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land application of coal combustion by-products (CCBs) mixed with solid organic wastes (SOWs), such as municipal sewage sludge, has become increasingly popular as a means of productively using what were once considered waste products. Although bulk chemical and physical properties of several of these CCB-SOW materials have been reported, detailed information about their synthesis and mineralogy of the CCB-SOW materials has not been reported. In this paper, chemical and mineralogical properties of a soil-like material obtained from composting a mixture of CCBs with a pharmaceutical fermentation by-product (FB) were investigated at the laboratory and field scale. All starting materials and products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and elemental analyses. The results showed that the FB was strongly bound to the CCBs and could not be removed by washing. Within 2 wit of the start of a composting study, there was a rapid drop in pH from 12 to 8, an increase in temperature to 70 degreesC, and a reduction in the dissolved oxygen content. attributed to the rapid establishment of a highly active microbial population. Composting produced a soil-like material with high levels of plant nutrients, a high nutrient retention capacity, and metal contents similar to median levels of those metals reported for soils. The levels of boron and soluble salts are such that sensitive plants may initially show toxicity symptoms. However, with adequate rainfall, leaching should rapidly remove most of the B and soluble salts. With care, the material produced is safe for use as a synthetic topsoil.

AB Transfer of bioactive organic compounds from soil to plants might represent animal and human health risks. Sewage sludge and manure are potential sources for bioactive compounds such as human- and veterinary drugs. In the present study, uptake of the anti-diabetic compound, metformin, the antibiotic agent ciprofloxacin and the anti-coccidial narasin in carrot (Daucus carota ssp. sativus cvs. Napoli) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were investigated. The pharmaceuticals were selected in order to cover various chemical properties, in addition to their presence in relevant environmental matrixes. The root concentration factors (RCF) found in the present study were higher than the corresponding leaf concentration factors (LCF) for the three test pharmaceuticals. The uptake of metformin was higher compared with ciprofloxacin and narasin for all plant compartments analyzed. Metformin was studied more explicitly with regard to uptake and translocation in meadow fescue (Festuca pratense), three other carrot cultivars (D. carota ssp. sativus cvs. Amager, Rothild and Nutri Red), wheat cereal (Triticum aestivum) and turnip rape seed (Brassica campestris). Uptake of metformin in meadow fescue was comparable with uptake in the four carrot cultivars (RCF 2-10, LCF approximately 1.5), uptake in wheat cereals were comparable with barley cereals (seed concentration factors, SCF, 0.02-0.04) while the accumulation in turnip rape seeds was as high as 1.5. All three pharmaceuticals produced negative effects on growth and development of carrots when grown in soil concentration of 6-10 mg kg(-1) dry weight. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical (EC) residual disinfection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence and absence of primary sludge particulates (PSPs) was studied. The kinetics followed a first-order rate law. When PSPs were absent, the EC residual disinfection rate coefficient (k) increased linearly with EC pretreatment energy (E-C, 0-0.63 kWh/m(3)). However, with 143 mg PSPs/L, Is first increased linearly with E-C (0-0.28 kWh/m(3)) and then decreased linearly with E-C (0.28-0.42 kWh/m(3)). H2O2 was detected during EC pretreatment in PSPs-free samples and the H2O2. concentration (C-H) increased with E-C (0-0.83 kWh/m(3)) linearly. Chloride was detected in PSPs aqueous samples (143 mg PSPs/L) and its concentration (C-C) changed during EC pretreatment: initially, a decrease of C-C was observed when E-C increased from 0 to 0.28 kWh/m(3), followed by an increase of C-C when E-C increased 0.28-0.42 kWh/m(3). In both cases, k correlated to the initial post-EC chloride concentration (C-CI) in an inverse linear relationship. This two-stage change of C-C and k was caused by a combination of two reactions: anodic oxidation of chloride and the reaction of chloramines with excess chlorine. This paper explains the mechanisms underlying EC residual disinfection in the presence and absence of PSPs, and proposes a feasible strategy for EC disinfection when PSPs are present, an approach that could be useful in the treatment of combined sewage overflow (CSO).

AB Occurrence of eight selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs; caffeine, carbamazepine, triclosan, gemfibrozil, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) were investigated in effluents from fifteen sewage treatment plants (STPs) across South Australia. In addition, a detailed investigation into the removal of these compounds was also carried out in four STPs with different technologies (Plant A: conventional activated sludge; plant B: two oxidation ditches; plant C: three bioreactors; and plant D: ten lagoons in series). The concentrations of these compounds in the effluents from the fifteen STPs showed substantial variations among the STPs, with their median concentrations ranging from 26 ng/L for caffeine to 710 ng/L for carbamazepine. Risk assessment based on the "worst case scenario'' of the monitoring data from the present study suggested potential toxic risks to aquatic organisms posed by carbamazepine, triclosan and diclofenac associated with such effluent discharge. With the exception of carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, significant concentration decreases between influent and effluent were observed in the four STPs studied in more detail. Biodegradation was found to be the main mechanism for removing concentrations from the liquid waste stream for the PhACs within the four STPs, while adsorption onto sludge appeared to be a minor process for all target PhACs except for triclosan. Some compounds (e.g. gemfibrozil) exhibited variable removal efficiencies within the four STPs. Plant D (10 lagoons in series) was least efficient in the removal of the target PhACs; significant biodegradation of these compounds only occurred from the sixth or seventh lagoon.

AB Water quality is currently a subject of increasing concern, especially because of the emerging pollutants contaminating aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of emerging pollutants in the IguaScu River, from source to mouth, such as: pharmaceuticals, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid, ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), gemfibrozil and fenofibrate; female sex hormones, including estradiol (E1), ethinylestradiol (EET) and estrone (E2); UV filters, including 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octylmethoxycinnamate; and caffeine (CAF). The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

AB Six boreholes were drilled during the course of a year to a depth of 2 m beneath the water table, located at a depth of about 28 m, under agricultural land sprinkler irrigated with treated sewage effluents in the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel to determine the extent of penetration of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into the unsaturated zone. The fields were planted to turf and had different histories of effluent irrigation. From each borehole, 7 to 21 samples were taken for analysis of PPCPs, as was the underlying groundwater. Nine PPCPs (carbamazepine and its metabolite 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine, acridone and acridine, venlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, oxcarbazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and caffeine) were detected in the vadose zone of the study area to a depth of 27 m. For example, the detected concentrations of carbamazepine were up to 109 ng/kg, of caffeine up to 36,700 ng/kg, and of venlafaxine up to 50 ng/kg. Only five of the compounds (carbamazepine, acridone, venlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, and caffeine) were found in the underlying groundwater with concentrations in the nanogram per liter range. The results of this work show that significant amounts of PPCPs can penetrate even a thick vadose zone of 27 m with sections containing up to 50% clay and up to 0.40% soil organic C. Venlafaxine, for example, penetrated the vadose zone at an average velocity of 2.8 to 4 m/yr. Irrigation with treated sewage effluents or contaminated water should be carefully considered if the penetration of PPCPs into groundwater is undesirable.

AB Crystal violet (CV) and leucocrystal violet (LCV) were found in the tissues of wild eels caught from surface waters under the influence of effluents discharged by municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). LCV was the dominant residue detected with total concentrations up to 6.7 mu g kg(-1) fresh weight in tissues of eels caught from lakes, rivers and a canal in Berlin, Germany. The occurrence of the residues found in 35 out of 45 samples could directly be linked to the presence of discharges by municipal STPs into the receiving surface waters. CV is a multiple-use compound that is also used as a biological stain and to colour materials such as textiles, paints and printing inks. Thus, it seems very likely that the residues of CV found in the eel samples originate from such uses and from legal uses of CV as a veterinary drug for the treatment of ornamental fish. The results obtained from this study are the first report of background contamination by CV found in samples of fish not intentionally treated with this agent. Although the residues of CV and LCV measured in the tissues of the eels were very low, an oral exposure to residues of CV or LCV should be avoided with regard to their mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. According to European Union law, zero tolerance applies to all residues of CV and LCV found in food for human consumption, as CV is not registered for use as a veterinary drug.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin can be found in soils receiving exogenous organic matter (EOM). Their long-term behavior in EOM-amended soils and their level of biodegradability are not well understood partly due to a lack of methods to estimate their environmental availability. We performed different aqueous extractions to quantify the available fraction of C-14-ciprofloxacin in soils amended with a compost of sewage sludge and green wastes or a farmyard manure contaminated at relevant environmental concentrations.
   After minimizing C-14-ciprofloxacin losses by adsorption on laboratory vessel tubes, three out of eleven different aqueous solutions were selected, i.e., Borax, Na(2)EDTA and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. During 28 d of incubation, the non-extractable fractions were very high in all samples, i.e., 57-67% of the initial C-14-activity, and the availability of the antibiotic was very low, explaining its low biodegradation. A maximum of 6.3% of the initial C-14-activity was extracted from soil/compost mixtures with the Na(2)EDTA solution, and 7.2% from soil/manure mixtures with the Borax solution. The available fraction level was stable over the incubation in soil/compost mixtures but slightly varied in soil/manure mixtures following the organic matter decomposition.
   The choice of different soft extractants highlighted different sorption mechanisms controlling the environmental availability of ciprofloxacin, where the pH and the quality of the applied EOM appeared to be determinant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac, a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is considered for regulation under the European water framework directive. This is because effects on fish have been reported at concentrations around those regularly found in treated sewage effluents (similar to 1 mu g/L). However, a recent publication reports no effects on fish at 320 mu g/L. In this study, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to 0, 4.6, 22, 82 and 271 mu g/L diclofenac in flow-through systems for 28 days using triplicate aquaria per concentration. At the highest concentration, significant mortalities were observed already after 21 days (no mortalities found up to 22 mu g/L). Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of renal hematopoietic tissue (renal hematopoietic hyperplasia) after 28 days at the lowest concentration and at all higher concentrations, following a clear dose-response pattern. Skin ulcerations of the jaw were noted by macroscopic observations, primarily at the two highest concentrations. No histological changes were observed in the liver. There was an increase in the relative hepatic mRNA levels of c7 (complement component 7), a gene involved in the innate immune system, at 22 mu g/L and at all higher concentrations, again following a clear dose-response. The bio-concentration factor was stable across concentrations, but lower than reported for rainbow trout, suggesting lower internal exposure to the drug in the stickleback. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that diclofenac causes histological changes in the three-spined stickleback at low mu g/L concentrations, which cause concern for fish populations exposed to treated sewage effluents.

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac are two examples of drugs with widespread geographical and environmental media proliferation that are poorly removed by traditional wastewater treatment processes. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed as alternative methods to remove these compounds in solution. AOPs are based on a wide class of powerful technologies, including UV radiation, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, Fenton process, catalytic wet peroxide oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, electrochemical oxidation and their combinations, sonolysis, and microwaves applicable to both water and wastewater. Moreover, processes rely on the production of oxidizing radicals (center dot OH and others) in a solution to decompose present pollutants. Water radiolysis-based processes, which are an alternative to the former, involve the use of concentrated energy (beams of accelerated electrons or -rays) to split water molecules, generating strong oxidants and reductants (radicals) at the same time. In this paper, the degradation of carbamazepine and diclofenac by means of all these processes is discussed and compared. Energy and byproduct generation issues are also addressed.

AB Chemically activated and carbonized adsorbents were prepared from Moringa oleifera pod husks (MOP), characterized and evaluated for their ability to remove a common antibiotic - ofloxacin (OFX) from aqueous solution. The pulverized precursor was steeped in a saturated ammonium chloride solution for a day to give the chemically activated adsorbent (AMOP). A portion of AMOP was pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace at 623 K for 30 min to furnish its carbonized analogue (CMOP). The adsorbents showed favorable physicochemical attributes. The effects of operational parameters such as initial OFX solution pH and concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature and contact time on OFX removal were investigated. At equilibrium, optimal removal efficiencies of 90.98% and 99.84% were achieved at solution pH 5 for AMOP and CMOP, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption data fitted into both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(o)), enthalpy change (Delta H-o) and entropy change (Delta S-o) indicated that the adsorption of OFX was feasible, spontaneous, exothermic and occurred via the physisorption mode. Adsorption kinetics obeyed the Blanchard pseudo-second-order model. The results may find applications in the adsorptive removal of micro-contaminants of pharmaceutical origin from wastewater.

AB The growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to public health has raised interest in the proper treatment of discharged pharmaceutical wastewater before entering surface waters. In this study, adsorption was highlighted as a low cost and effective pathway to remove amoxicillin and ampicillin from aqueous solutions. Montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and myristyltrimethylammonium (MTA)-intercalated montmorillonite (O-MMT) were employed as the adsorbing solids. Static adsorption experiments were performed at three temperatures (303.15 K, 313.15 K and 323.15 K) for single antibiotic systems. The adsorption isotherm curves at all temperatures exhibited an L2-type isotherm. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were applied to analyze single adsorption isotherm data. The maximum sorption capacity of 0.124-0.133 mmol g(-1) for amoxicillin and 0.143-0.157 mmol g(-1) for ampicillin was estimated for O-MMT sorbent from Langmuir fitting. A modified extended-Langmuir model with the inclusion of surface coverage (theta) was proposed for analysis of binary adsorption isotherm data. The fitness of the modified extended-Langmuir model was superior to the original model. Batch adsorption tests on real pharmaceutical wastewater demonstrated the feasibility of the O-MMT sorbent for practical applications.

AB The pretreatment of synthetic penicillin formulation effluent containing Procain Penicillin G (PPG) with the O-3/H2O2 process (applied ozone dose = 1440 mg h(-1) treatment time = 60 minutes; pH 7; H2O2 = 10 mM) was investigated. The effect of chemical pretreatment was assessed on the basis of acute toxicity and biodegradability with activated sludge using water flea Daphnia magna toxicity and activated sludge inhibition tests. Biological treatability studies were performed with a mixture of untreated or pretreated PPG effluent (25% on volume basis) and synthetic domestic wastewater simulating readily biodegradable organic substrate to simulate the characteristics of domestic wastewater (75% on volume basis). Pretreatment of PPG effluent the O-3/H2O2 process resulted in more than 70% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and a 50% decrease in the acute toxicity towards Daphnia magna . On the other hand, biodegradation of untreated PPG effluent needed prolonged acclimation periods to obtain a significant biological COD removal (= 80%). Pretreatment employing the O-3/H2O2 process not only decreased the ultimate biodegradability of PPG effluent but also increased its inhibitory effects on activated sludge treatment speculatively due to the formation of less biodegradable oxidation by-products.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) compounds are a form of intravenous radiocontrast containing iodine, which are rapidly eliminated via urine or feces. The issue with the accumulation of ICM has received considerable critical attention since they are ubiquitously distributed in municipal wastewater effluents and in the aquatic environment and are not significantly eliminated by most biological sewage treatment processes. Among the methods that have been tested to eliminate ICM, electrochemical methods have significant advantages, since they can selectively cut the carbon-iodine bonds that are suspected to decrease their biodegradability. On the production sites, the recovery of iodine ions due to the carbon-iodine cleavage can be envisaged, which is particularly interesting to reduce the cost of the ICM production process. The coupling of an electrochemical process and a biological treatment can be carried out to mineralize the organic part of the formed by-products, allowing the recovery of the iodide ions. Therefore, the degradation of diatrizoate, a typical ionic ICM compound, by an electrochemical process was the purpose of this study. The electrochemical reduction of diatrizoate was performed using a flow cell with a graphite felt electrode at different potentials. The removal yield of diatrizoate reached similar to 100% in 2 h and the main product, 3,5-diacetamidobenzoic acid, was quantitatively formed, showing that diatrizoate was almost completely deiodinated. According to the BOD5/COD ratio, the biodegradability of diatrizoate after electrolysis was considerably improved. Cyclic voltammetry analysis of the electroreduced solution showed several oxidation peaks. The electrochemical oxidation of the by-products formed after the first treatment by electroreduction was then performed at three different potentials to study the influence of electrochemical oxidation on biodegradability. Results showed that the degradation yield of the deiodinated by-products increased with the potential and reached 100% at 1.3 V/SCE. Four different biological treatments were implemented during 21 days in stirred flasks with fresh activated sludge. The evolution of the mineralization during the biological treatment highlighted the biorecalcitrance of diatrizoate as previously estimated by the BOD5/COD ratio. Interestingly, the mineralization yield increased from 41 to 60% when electrochemical oxidation at 1.3 V/SCE was implemented after electroreduction.

AB Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production has been broadly considered as a promising approach to generate renewable energy, while photocatalysis-enabled pollutant degradation is regarded as a sustainable technique for wastewater treatment. Herein, we are aiming to construct a dual-functional photocatalyst system which can degrade pollutants and simultaneously split water to generate hydrogen. We construct the Co3O4 modified {001}/{101}-TiO2 (TC) nanosheets as the efficient dual-functional photocatalyst system. As a p-type semiconductor, Co3O4 construct a p-n junction with TiO2 (n-type). And, the {001}/{101} facet of TiO2 forms an intrinsic surface heterojunction. The unique dual (p-n/surface) heterojunction structure enables the spatial separation of the charge carriers. The holes primarily accumulated on Co3O4 nanoparticles efficiently oxidize the pharmaceutical pollutants including enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ibuprofen, while the electrons accumulated on {101} facets of TiO2 nanosheet can simultaneously reduce water molecules to generate hydrogen. The effects of Co3O4 loading, catalyst dosage, initial pollutant concentrations, pH values, and coexisting ions on the photocatalytic activities were systematically investigated. In addition, the photocatalysis mechanism is insightfully investigated. This study offers a novel strategy to recover energy stored in wastewater.

AB A mixture of eight contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), most of them of pharmaceutical origin: acetaminophen, antipyrine, caffeine, hydrochlorothiazide, sulfamethoxazole, ketorolac, metoprolol and diclofenac, has been treated with some advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) involving ozone, visible LED radiation and a graphene oxide/titania catalyst (GO/TiO2). Variables that affect the process rate: visible LED radiation fluence, catalyst concentration and percentage of graphene oxide on the catalyst, were optimized through a factorial design taking TOC as an objective function. These variables were found to be: 303 W m(-2), 0.4 g L-1, 1.5% GO loading, respectively, and tested in CEC doped wastewater. Application of gas-liquid absorption kinetics allows the kinetic regime of ozone reactions and the relative importance of mass transfer and chemical reactions to be determined. Two reaction periods were observed: an initial one of less than 20 minutes, where contaminants are removed mainly through direct reactions with ozone, and a second one, where free radical oxidation predominates. In this second period, hydroxyl radical concentrations for ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation were found to be 1.1 and 3.2 x 10(-13)M, respectively.

AB Two sonochemical processes were compared for the removal of ibuprofen in different water matrixes (distilled water and effluent from wastewater treatment plant). The effect of various operating parameters, such as pH (2.6-8.0), ultrasound power density (25-100 W/L), sonication frequency (12-862 kHz), addition of radical promoters (H2O2 and Fenton's reagent) or scavengers (n-butanol and acetic acid), was evaluated.
   Sono-degradation of ibuprofen followed a first-order kinetic trend, whose rate constant increased with ultrasound density and frequency. For this hydrophobic and low volatile molecule, a free-radical mechanism at the bubble interface was established. Coupling ultrasound with Fenton reaction showed a positive synergy, especially in terms of mineralization yield, while adding H2O2 alone had no significant beneficial effect. Dedicated experiments proved this synergy to be due to the enhanced regeneration of ferrous ions by ultrasound.
   Efficacy of the sonolysis process was hampered in wastewater matrix, mainly as the consequence of higher pH increasing the molecule solubility. However, after convenient acidification, sono-Fenton oxidation results remained almost unchanged, indicating no significant radical scavenging effects from the effluent compounds.

AB Although there is a growing interest in emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), most research is focused on wastewater treatment, the occurrence of EOCs, and their fate in the aquatic environment. There is limited information about their behavior in agricultural soils, where they can be introduced via irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW). In this study, the degradation in an agricultural soil of eight EOCs (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, diethyl phthalate, ethyl paraben, 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, primidone, Surfynol 104, and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate) with a broad range of physical-chemical properties was monitored for 40 days. Two types of soil treatments were performed: non-sterilization and sterilization. In the non-sterilized soil, by the end of the incubation period, degradation was greater than 70% for all the target compounds except carbamazepine, Surfynol 104, and primidone (<50%). In contrast, in the sterilized soil, the degradation of most of the compounds was less than 50%, except ethyl paraben, 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, and diethyl phthalate (>70%). These findings indicate that soil sterilization reduces overall degradation rates, which suggests that microbial activity plays an important role in the degradation of most of the EOCs studied in soil.

AB A multitude of pharmaceuticals enter surface waters via discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and many raise environmental and health concerns. Chemical fate models predict their concentrations using estimates of mass loading, dilution and in-stream attenuation. However, current comprehension of the attenuation rates remains a limiting factor for predictive models. We assessed in-stream attenuation of 75 pharmaceuticals in 4 river segments, aiming to characterize in-stream attenuation variability among different pharmaceutical compounds, as well as among river segments differing in environmental conditions. Our study revealed that in-stream attenuation was highly variable among pharmaceuticals and river segments and that none of the considered pharmaceutical physicochemical and molecular properties proved to be relevant in determining the mean attenuation rates. Instead, the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) influenced the variability of rates among river segments, likely due to its effect on sorption to sediments and suspended particles, and therefore influencing the balance between the different attenuation mechanisms (biotransformation, photolysis, sorption, and volatilization). The magnitude of the measured attenuation rates urges scientists to consider them as important as dilution when aiming to predict concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A Gram-negative benzoic acid degrading bacterial strain Bz was isolated from the wastewater treatment plant of Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in Zibo city, China. It could utilize benzoic acid as the sole carbon and energy source for growth. Under the optimum temperature of 30 degrees C and pH value of 7.5, the benzoic acid degradation rate reached 94% in the basal medium in 96 h. Besides, it could utilize salicylic acid or phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. Physiological and biochemical experiments revealed that the bacterium shared common characters with Pseudomoas putida not only in cytochrome oxidase positive, but also in the substrates assimilation profile tested. These properties supported the bacterium to be a member of P. putida. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterium was obtained and sequenced (JN542509). The resulting phylogenetic analysis, based on the sequence and the relatives indicated that the bacterium shared 98 to 99% homologies with the members of P. putida. Therefore, strain Bz was identified to be a member of P. putida. This study presented valuable resources for the biodegradation and biotreatment of aromatic waste.

AB Since the European Union banned disposal of sewage sludge (SS) at sea in 1998 the application rate of SS to land has risen significantly. Land application is thus possibly an important transport route for SS-associated organic chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, to soils and perhaps also to plants. The potential for the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Fluoxetine HCl, to undergo uptake into Brassicaceae tissues was therefore investigated in a tissue culture study under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks. From growth medium containing 280 ng Fluoxetine HCl mL(-1), translocation into Brassica oleracea var. botrytis (cauliflower) stems (5% mean uptake of applied burden; 0.49 mu g g wet weight(-1)) and leaves (3% mean uptake; 0.26 mu g g wet weight(-1)) was confirmed, but no evidence of uptake into the curd was found; other possible explanations of the observations are also discussed. Although the data for individual plants were highly variable, as was the recovery of spiked internal standard (deuterated Fluoxetine HCl), the results nonetheless suggest uptake of Fluoxetine may indeed be a potential transport route to plants. A similar study of uptake from soils rather than from an artificial medium should now be undertaken, with greater numbers of replicates and improved analytical methods. Such studies have already demonstrated uptake of some antibiotics from manured soils by a variety of plants including Brassicaceae, suggesting that the uptake mechanisms may be more general.

AB The dataset provides information on Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) detected in the Albufera Natural Park (Valencia, Spain), a typical Mediterranean coastal wetland. These PPCPs constitute an important group of organic pollutants highly representative of the human impact.
   The concentrations values measured in soil, sediment and water and the statistical relationship of contaminants between them and with the environmental parameters could help to understand their fate in different compartments. The data also reported the occurrence and removal efficiency (%) for each contaminant in ten wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), located in the surrounding area. This dataset could provide an idea on the effectiveness of WWTP treatments and the capacity of released PPCPs to affect the ecosystem.
   The extraction of analytes was based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) for water and solvent extraction followed by the previous SPE as clean-up for soil and sediment. Determination was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) with a triple-quadrupole.

AB Compared to the incineration and composting, landfill was an ordinary technology which is often used in the solid waste disposal. Landfill leachate is highly loaded, toxic, and harmful to the sanitation of wastewater. In past 20 years, technologies such as advanced oxidation processes had been developed for the treatment of wastewater which is contaminated by the hazardous and recalcitrant organic compounds, such as pesticides, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals, but so far there is little information about the application of fluidized-beds Fenton process in the oxidation treatment of organic compounds from the municipal landfill leachate. In this paper, the effects of different treatments to the municipal landfill leachate from Shaoxing landfill by gas-liquid fluidized bed with Fenton reagent were examined and evaluated. The effects of various operating conditions, such as treatment time, initial COD strength, initial pH value, initial [H2O2], initial [Fe2+], and ventilation volume were examined. After evaluation, several optimal operating conditions (COD = 2500 mg/L, reaction time of 30 min, pH=2.5, [Fe2+](0) = 0.05 mmol/L, [H2O2](0) = 0.075 mmol/L, ventilation volume of 0.12 m(3)/h, and temperature = 60 degrees C) were found under which the maximum COD removal rate (61.4%) was obtained.

AB Endocrine-disruptive potential and concentrations of polar organic contaminants were measured in seven headwaters flowing through relatively unpolluted areas of the Czech Republic. Towns with Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) discharges were the first known sources of anthropogenic pollution in the areas. River water was sampled several kilometers upstream (US) and several tens of meters downstream (DS) of the WWTP discharges, by use of Pesticide and Pharmaceutical Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS-Pest, POCIS-Pharm). Extracts of passive samplers were tested by use of a battery of in vitro bioassays to determine overall non-specific cytotoxicity, endocrine-disruptive (ED) potential and dioxin-like toxicity. The extracts were also used for quantification of polar organics. There was little toxicity to cells caused by most extracts of POCIS. Estrogenicity was detected in all types of samples even though US locations are considered to be background. At US locations, concentrations of estrogen equivalents (EEq) ranged from less than the detection limits (LOD) to 0.5 ng EEq/POCIS. Downstream concentrations of EEqs ranged from less than LOD to 4.8 ng EEq/POCIS. Concentrations of EEq in POCIS extracts from all DS locations were 1 to 14 times greater than those at US locations. Concentrations of EEq measured in extracts of POCIS-Pest and POCIS-Pharm were in a good agreement. Neither antiestrogenic nor anti/androgenic activities were detected. Concentrations of 2.3.7.8-TCDD equivalents (TEq(bio)) were detected in both types of POCIS at Concentrations ranging from less than the LOD to 0.39 ng TEq(bio)/POCIS. Nearly all extracts of POCIS-Pharm contained greater concentrations of TEq(bio) activity than extracts of POCIS-Pest. Concentrations of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in extracts of POCIS were generally small at all sampling sites, but levels of some pharmaceuticals were significantly greater in both types of POCIS from DS locations. Chemical analyses along with the results of bioassays documented impacts of small towns with WWTPs on headwaters. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information on the partitioning of chemicals between particulate matter and water in sewage treatment plants (STP5) can be used to predict their subsequent environmental fate. However, this information can be challenging to acquire, especially for pharmaceuticals that are frequently present in ionized forms. This study investigated the relationship between the ionization state of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their partitioning between water and sludge in STPs. We also investigated the underlying mechanisms of sludge sorption by using chemical descriptors based on ionized structures, and evaluated the usefulness of these descriptors in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling. K-D values were collected for 110 APIs, which were classified as neutral, positive, or negative at pH 7. The models with the highest performance had the (RY)-Y-2 and Q(2) values of above 0.75 and 0.65, respectively. We found that the dominant intermolecular forces governing the interactions of neutral and positively charged APIs with sludge are hydrophobic, pi-pi, and dipole-dipole interactions, whereas the interactions of negatively charged APIs with sludge were mainly governed by covalent bonding as well as ion-ion, ion-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions; hydrophobicity-driven interactions were rather unimportant. Including charge-related descriptors improved the models' performance by 5-10%, underlining the importance of electrostatic interactions. The use of descriptors calculated for ionized structures did not improve the model statistics for positive and negative APIs, but slightly increased model performance for neutral APIs. We attribute this to a better description of neutral zwitterions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepilectic drug, has been reported in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents as a result of its low biodegradability. In the present work, the persistence of CBZ in aquatic environment with respect to abiotic transformation processes along with its toxicity and capability of accumulating in single aquatic organisms (algae) are evaluated. The possibility of removing CBZ from STP effluents is studied by characterizing its ozonation process through the assessment of kinetics and the distribution of oxidation products.

AB The effective aridity in riparian areas is increasing from climate change and from human water consumption, which exacerbates the impacts of effluents from wastewater-treatment plants and from catchment run-off in rivers. The potential of natural riparian areas to act as 'green filters' has long been recognized, but the possible ecological benefits of natural riparian areas over large-scale environmental gradients on fish have not been explored in detail. Using an extensive data-set from northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites), ours is the first study to ask whether natural riparian vegetation can mitigate the effects of pollution on fish in rivers experiencing water scarcity. We used multimodel inference to explore the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation with nutrient pollution and water conductivity, which are among the world's worst river stressors, on multiple fish guilds, including widely distributed species and highly invasive alien fish species. Most models (54%) supported the additive effects of water-quality factors on fish, after having accounted for the influence of geography and hydrological alterations. Although many fewer models (7%) included riparian vegetation as an important predictor, riparian vegetation modulated the forms of the associations between fish and pollution. The relationship of nutrient pollution with native and alien fish richness changed from negative to positive with greater riparian structure or species richness. However, we found the opposite effect for the mean body size of sedentary fish, and only positive additive effects of riparian richness for the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish. Ammonium and nitrite concentrations adversely affected fish in these rivers up to 10 years after the enforcement of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive by the European Union. High conductivity also much affects fish, having negatives associations with migratory, pelagic, invertivorous and native fish, and positive associations with sedentary, benthic, omnivorous and alien fish. Therefore, the current status of natural riparian areas is unlikely to fully mitigate water-quality impacts on fish. The conservation of freshwater resources in semi-arid regions, such as north-eastern Spain, requires improved waste-water treatments and better agriculture practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Antibiotics are composed of high molecular weight aromatic compounds with persistent characteristic and potentially inhibitor to bacterial growth in biological treatment. While on the contrary, the electrocatalytic process is suitable for highly stable pollutant treatment. Reactor was set by regulating the performance of anode and cathode into their optimum efficiencies and called as Hybrid Advanced Oxidation Process (HAOP). Cylinder cathode made of carbon cloth was put vertically inside the tube and circled around Ti/PtIr plate anode. A mixer was installed to enhance the diffusion flow of pollutants towards oxidants generated on the electrode surface. EAOP, EFRP, and EFP were the main mechanisms for pollutant removal. A 100% COD removal indicating complete degradation of pollutant into CO2 and H2O. UV-VIS spectra peaks at lambda 470, 340 and 240 nm detected in raw wastewater were no longer found in treated water. The result of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) analysis supported those findings, in which four peaks at m/z 821, m/z 759, m/z 700 and m/z 144 were not detected after treatment.

AB Concentration polarization is a phenomenon inherent to membrane separation operations and as a precursor of membrane fouling is frequently related to the decrease in the performance of these operations. In the present work, a case-specific mass transfer correlation was developed to assess the concentration polarization when nanofiltration, in different operating conditions, was applied to treat a pharmaceutical wastewater containing atenolol. NF runs with two membranes, two atenolol concentrations and three feed circulating velocities were conducted, and the corresponding experimental mass transfer coefficients were determined using film theory to describe the concentration polarization phenomenon. Higher velocities led to higher mass transfer coefficients and, consequently, lower concentration polarization. These mass transfer coefficients were correlated with the circulating velocity (Re), the solute diffusivity (Sc) and the membrane permeability (L-P(+)) (the membrane is a permeable interface with effect on the concentration profiles developed from the interface towards the bulk feed), yielding the following correlation Sh = 1.98 x 10(4)Re(0.5)Sc(0.33)L(P)(+0.32). The good agreement between the calculated and the experimental results makes this correlation a valuable tool for water practitioners to predict and control the concentration polarization during atenolol-rich wastewater treatment by nanofiltration, thereby increasing its productivity and selectivity.

AB We propose to investigate the effect of recovery rates ranging from 50 to 90% on rejection of selected Pharmaceutical actives compounds wastewater (PhACs) by nanofiltration (NF) and the further treatment of NF concentrate by photocatalysis. In agreement with the literature, our results indicate that the chemical properties and composition of the effluent depend on the volume reduction factor. Then, the study focuses on the photocatalytic degradation of the selected molecules. The efficiency of photocatalytic treatment according to incident radiant flux density and the volumetric reduction factor (VRF) have been done to evaluate the global TOC destruction and the degradation of each contaminant. The degradation of target molecules in the concentrate (VRF = 2) by photocatalysis ranged from 20% to 80%. However, for higher VRF, competition with organic matter and alkalinity effects led to low degradation yields. The study of the influence of incident radiant flux density on degradation rate confirmed results already obtained by the authors and, this time, generalizes them for a complex matrix. Results show that coupling photocatalysis with a membrane process seems to be a complementary processes to classical waste water treatment in order to oxidized persistent molecules.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation has great potential in wastewater treatment. However, the role of ozone and the contribution of photogenerated hole in this process have not been fully understood. Here three WO3 materials are synthesized and used as model catalysts in visible-light photocatalytic ozonation for the mineralization of pharmaceutical pollutants. A dual role of ozone in this process has been confirmed: (i) direct oxidation of the pollutant till formation of refractory intermediates, (ii) efficient trapping of photoelectron that cannot be captured by O-2. The latter is crucial because it not only induces the center dot O-3(-)-mediated pathway for hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) formation but also separates the hole which has proven to be capable of oxidizing water into center dot OH. Evidenced by photoluminescence results, the intrinsic charge separation ability of WO3 in photocatalytic ozonation is no more as important as that in photocatalysis with O-2. Finally, this process is more applicable under acidic condition. This work contributes to a better understanding of the significance of ozone in WO3 photo catalytic ozonation and provides us an insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic ozonation.

AB Since sorption is an essential process with regard to attenuation of organic pollutants during subsurface flow, information on the sorption properties of each pollutant are essential for assessing their environmental fate and transport behavior. In the present study, the sorption behavior of 20 wastewater originated organic micropollutants was assessed by means of sediment column experiments, since experimentally determined data for these compounds are not or sparsely represented in the literature. Compounds investigated include various psychoactive drugs, phenazone-type pharmaceuticals and beta-blockers, as well as phenacetine, N-methylphenacetine, tolyltriazole and para-toluenesulfonamide. While for most of the compounds no or only a low sorption affinity was observed, an elevated tendency to sorb onto aquifer sand was obtained for the beta-blockers atenolol, propranolol and metoprolol. A comparison between experimental data and data estimated based on the octanol/water partition coefficient following the QSAR approach demonstrated the limitations of the latter to predict the adsorption behavior in natural systems for the studied compounds.

AB Stream flow in urban aquatic ecosystems often is maintained by water-reclamation plant (WRP) effluents that contain mixtures of natural and anthropogenic chemicals that persist through the treatment processes. In effluent-impacted streams, aquatic organisms such as fish are continuously exposed to biologically-active chemicals throughout their life cycles. The North Shore Channel of the Chicago River (Chicago, Illinois) is part of an urban ecosystem in which >80% of the annual flow consists of effluent from the North Side WRP. In this study, multiple samplings of the effluent and stream water were conducted and fish (largemouth bass and carp) were collected on 2 occasions from the North Shore Channel. Fish also were collected once from the Outer Chicago Harbor in Lake Michigan, a reference site not impacted by WRP discharges. Over 100 organic chemicals with differing behaviors and biological effects were measured, and 23 compounds were detected in all of the water samples analyzed. The most frequently detected and highest concentration (>100 mu g/L) compounds were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 4-nonylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxycarboxylic acids. Other biologically-active chemicals including bisphenol A. 4-nonylphenol, 4-nonylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxylates, 4-tert-octylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxylates were detected at lower concentrations (<5 mu g/L). The biogenic steroidal hormones 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, testosterone, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, and cis-androsterone were detected at even lower concentrations (<0.005 mu g/L). There were slight differences in concentrations between the North Side WRP effluent and the North Shore Channel, indicating minimal in-stream attenuation. Fish populations are continuously exposed to mixtures of biologically-active chemicals because of the relative persistency of the chemicals with respect to stream hydraulic residence time, and the lack of a fresh water source for dilution. The majority of male fish exhibited vitellogenin induction, a physiological response consistent with exposure to estrogenic compounds. Tissue-level signs of reproductive disruption, such as ovatestis, were not observed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, twenty-three endocrine disrupting compounds have been monitored in sludge from different stages of four sludge stabilization treatments (anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, composting and anaerobic stabilization ponds). Their occurrence and fate in sludge stabilization plants and their potential environmental risk in treated sludge and in treated sludge-amended soils have been evaluated. Monitored compounds were six perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFC), four anionic surfactants (sodium alkylsulfates), a plasticiser (bisphenol A (BPA)), four preservatives (parabens), six UV-filters (benzophenones) and two biocides (triclosan and triclocarban). Only two of the UV-filters were not detected in any of the 141 analysed samples. Anionic surfactants (mean concentrations up to 1673 ng/g dry matter (dm) for the sum of surfactants) were the compounds at the highest concentration levels followed by biocides (up to 512 ng/g dm) and UV-filters (up to 662 ng/g dm). The concentrations of anionic surfactants, preservatives and UV-filters decreased 78, 25 and 80%, respectively, after anaerobic digestion. The concentration of perfluorinated carboxylic acids only decreased after composting (80% reduction) whereas biocides and BPA were not affected by any of the studied treatments. Environmental risks (risk quotients > 1) were obtained for all compounds, except for triclocarban and sodium octadecylsulfate, in treated sludge. In treated sludge-amended soils, risk quotients were lower than 1 for all compounds except for triclosan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 13 target compounds, including eight parabens, four chlorinated parabens and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), were detected in surface water samples at 35 sampling sites in the Beijing River system, China. The surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that parabens were ubiquitous in the surface water of Beijing. PHBA was the predominant compound in the surface water samples, with the average concentration of 239 ng L-1,followed by the total amount of chlorinated parabens (average 50.1 ng/L) and parabens (average 443 ng/L). It is noteworthy that octylparaben with longer chain was firstly detected in the surface water. Significant difference was observed for paraben concentrations from different sampling sites, and the highest level of parabens was found in the Xiaotaihou River, which was mainly due to the untreated sewage discharge. Seasonal variation of target compounds in the urban surface water was also studied, and parabens exhibited a different temporal variation from chlorinated derivatives. A combination of factors including high residual chlorine level and water temperature as well as intense ultraviolet radiation might enhance the persistence of chlorinated parabens in chlorinated water during the wet season. Risk assessment showed that parabens and their chlorinated derivatives are not likely to produce biological effects on aquatic ecosystems at current levels in the surface water of Beijing.

AB The efficiency of UV- and VUV-based processes (UV, VUV, UV/H2O2, and VUV/H2O2) for removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in Milli-Q water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent was investigated at 20A degrees C. The investigated factors included initial pH, variety of inorganic anions (NO (3) (-) and HCO (3) (-) ), and humic acid (HA). The results showed that the degradation of SMX in Milli-Q water at both two pH (5.5 and 7.0) followed the order of VUV/H2O2 > VUV > UV/H2O2 > UV. All the experimental data well fitted the pseudo-first order kinetic model and the rate constant (k) and half-life time (t (1/2)) were determined accordingly. Indirect oxidation of SMX by generated (OH)-O-aEuro cent was the main degradation mechanism in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2, while direct photolysis predominated in UV processes. The quenching tests showed that some other reactive species along with (OH)-O-aEuro cent radicals were responsible to the SMX degradation under VUV process. The addition of 20 mg L-1 HA significantly inhibited SMX degradation, whereas, the inhibitive effects of NO (3) (-) and HCO (3) (-) (0.1 mol L-1) were observed as well in all processes except in UV irradiation for NO (3) (-) . The removal rate decreased 1.7-3.6 times when applying these processes to STP effluent due to the complex constituents, suggesting that from the application point of view the constituents of these complexes in real STP effluent should be considered carefully prior to the use of UV-based processes for SMX degradation.

AB In recent years pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been detected in increasing concentrations in hospital effluents, sewage treatment plants (STP) as well as in different environmental compartments such as surface water, groundwater and soil. Little is known about the elimination of these substances during sewage treatment or about the formation of potential metabolites in the environment caused by bacterial biotransformation. To assess the biodegradability of the popular cardiovascular drug verapamil and the possible formation of potential microbial degradation products, two tests from the OECD series were used in the present study: the widely used Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B).
   In the Closed Bottle test, a screening test that simulates the conditions of an environmental surface water compartment, no biological degradation was observed for verapamil at concentrations of 2.33 mg l(-1). In the Zahn-Wellens test, a test for inherent biodegradability which allows evaluation of aerobic degradation at high bacterial density, only a partial biological degradation was found. Analysis of test samples by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to multiple stage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS '') revealed 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl-5-(methylamino)pentane nitrile, already known as D617 (Knoll nomenclature), a metabolite of mammalian metabolism, which is the major degradation product and dead-end transformation product of aerobic degradation of verapamil.

AB In recent years there has been growing interest on the occurrence and the fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, few data are available covering the fate of the pharmaceuticals in the water/ sediment compartment. In this study, the environmental fate of 10 selected pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites was investigated in water/sediment systems including both the analysis of water and sediment. The experiments covered the application of four C-14-labeled pharmaceuticals (diazepam, ibuprofen, iopromide, and paracetamol) for which radio-TLC analysis was used as well as six nonlabeled compounds (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, ivermectin, and oxazepam), which were analyzed via LC-tandem MS. Ibuprofen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, and paracetamol displayed a low persistence with DT50 values in the water/sediment system <= 20 d. The sediment played a key role in the elimination of paracetamol due to the rapid and extensive formation of bound residues. A moderate persistence was found for ivermectin and oxazepam with DT50 values of 15 and 54 d, respectively. lopromide, for which no corresponding DT50 values could be calculated, also exhibited a moderate persistence and was transformed into at least four transformation products. For diazepam, carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine, and clofibric acid, system DT90 values of > 365 d were found,which exhibit their high persistence in the water/sediment system. An elevated level of sorption onto the sediment was observed for ivermectin, diazepam, oxazepam, and carbamazepine. Respective K-OC values calculated from the experimental data ranged from 1172 L(.)kg(-1) for ivermectin down to 83 L(.)kg(-1) for carbamazepine.

AB This study was performed to investigate the ability of three different types of activated carbon to remove paroxetine from wastewater through adsorption. These types were extruded activated carbon (EAC), granular-activated carbon (GAC), and powdered-activated carbon (PAC). The three adsorbents were investigated using atomic force microscope, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the adsorption was dependent on the pH, and the removal efficiency of paroxetine increased with a decrease in pH value. The maximum removal efficiencies were 34, 40, and 86.5% for EAC, GAC, and PAC, respectively, at a pH of 4.5. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of paroxetine onto the three adsorbents can be expressed by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The intra-particle adsorption model showed that the adsorption mechanism of paroxetine using these adsorbents was controlled by a multistep mechanism. The Boyd kinetic model indicated that the liquid film diffusion may be involved in controlling the adsorption of paroxetine on the three adsorbents. Equilibrium studies showed that the adsorption isotherms could be expressed by the Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms for EAC, GAC, and PAC, respectively. The change in morphologies of adsorbents confirmed the occurrence of adsorption.

AB A simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week's period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full-scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance. Independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full-scale elimination rate determinations. As opposed to common assumptions, this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times - read: higher active biomass - showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases. Multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to SRT drove the grouping. The dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants. The application of WWTP balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in-depth analysis of degradation pathways.

AB This work is aimed at assessing the effects of pretreated aqueous wastes stream-fed to a biological nutrient removal (BNR)-activated sludge plant. Aqueous wastes (mainly landfill leachate and liquid residues from chemical and pharmaceutical factories) are pretreated by means of a traditional coagulation-flocculation stage and subsequently sent to the BNR stage together with municipal wastewater. Pretreated aqueous wastes contribute up to about 75% of the influent load, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD; average concentration 23,000 mg/L). The resilience of the system, that is, the capacity to maintain high and stable performances despite sudden perturbations of the input conditions, was evaluated by interrupting the aqueous waste dosage and then progressively restoring the initial condition. The consequent variation of the influent load and composition caused a reduction of the biomass activity, which led to a decrease of the nitrogen removal efficiency (from 89% down to 73%). More than 30 days were required for restoring typical working conditions (in terms of influent load, process performance, and biomass activity), the sludge retention time (SRT) being 23 days.

AB Oxygen in air is an eco-friendly and economical oxidant, and catalytic air oxidation technology have a great potential to sustain effective wastewater treatment. Here we report a novel cathodic air oxidation process under the catalysis of a nickel@nickel oxide composite loaded on a porous graphite felt. Such a process demonstrates extensive and stable effectiveness in oxidizing a variety of dyes, pharmaceuticals and personal care products at high mineralization efficiencies under room condition. Mechanistic study indicates organic pollutants are oxidized by oxygen at cathodic nickel@nickel oxide/graphite felt through a non-free radical pathway, in which oxygen atom is transferred from oxygen molecule to organic molecules via lattice oxygen species in nickel oxide. The nickel oxide is reduced in the cathodic electric field, liberating and activating lattice oxygen species as the oxidizer of organic pollutants. Then, oxygen re-oxidizes nickel into nickel oxide to replenish lattice oxygen species. Such an oxygen activation pattern through nickel/nickel oxide redox cycle enables pollutant degradation at low energy cost, thus endowing the cathodic air oxidation process with a great potential in practical wastewater treatment.

AB Amine-containing pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen, diclofenac, and sulfamethoxazole are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and other aquatic environments. Amine-containing pharmaceuticals can be effectively removed by chlorination. These drugs, however, may coexist in wastewater. Thus, they may compete with each other, and their chlorinated products may react with each other to form new products. In this study, competitive effects of the above three amine-containing pharmaceuticals by chlorination and their products were investigated. The priority of chlorination of these compounds was dependent upon the pH of the solution, due to the dissociation of the compounds and hypochlorite. It followed the order of sulfamethoxazole > diclofenac > acetaminophen in an acidic condition, the order of sulfamethoxazole > acetaminophen > diclofenac in a neutral condition, and the order of sulfamethoxazole approximate to acetaminophen > diclofenac in an alkaline condition. Some of the chlorinated products in single- and multiple-compound systems were the same. Dimers of sulfamethoxazole and its chlorinated products, however, were not found, but dimers of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen or diclofenac were found in multiple-compound systems. This finding is important because it means that new products may be produced if different amine-containing pharmaceuticals react with free chlorine simultaneously. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Analysis of earthworms offers potential for assessing the transfer of organic anthropogenic waste indicators (AWIs) derived from land-applied biosolid or manure to biota. Earthworms and soil samples were collected from three Midwest agricultural fields to measure the presence and potential for transfer of 77 AWIs from land-applied biosolids and livestock manure to earthworms. The sites consisted of a soybean field with no amendments of human or livestock waste (Site 1), a soybean field amended with biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Site. 2), and a cornfield amended with swine manure (Site 3). The biosolid applied to Site 2 contained a diverse composition of 28 AWIs, reflecting the presence of human use compounds. The swine manure contained 12 AWIs, and was dominated by biogenic sterols. Soil and earthworm samples were collected in the spring (about 30 days after soil amendment) and fall (140-155 days after soil amendment) at all field sites. Soils from Site I contained 21 AWIs and soil from Sites 2 and 3 contained 19 AWIs. The AWI profiles at Sites 2 and 3 generally reflected the relative composition of AWIs present in waste material applied. There were 20 AWIs detected in earthworms from Site I (three compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/kg), 25 AWIs in earthworms from Site 2 (seven compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/ kg), and 21 AWIs in earthworms from Site 3 (five compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/kg). A number of compounds that were present in the earthworm tissue were at concentrations less than reporting levels in the corresponding soil samples. The AWIs detected in earthworm tissue from the three field sites included pharmaceuticals, synthetic fragrances, detergent metabolites, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), biogenic sterols, disinfectants, and pesticides, reflecting a wide range of physicochemical properties. For those contaminants detected in earthworm tissue and soil, bioaccumulation factors (BAF) ranged from 0.05 (galaxolide)to 27 (triclosan). This study documents that when AWIs are present in source materials that are land applied, such as biosolids and swine manure, AWIs can be transferred to earthworms.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed as tertiary treatments for municipal WWTP effluents. UV-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are viable technological alternatives for treating secondary WWTP effluent containing PhACs. This article examines the feasibility of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS technologies at pilot scale, assessing their energy and cost requirements. In addition, life cycle assessment (LCA) impacts associated with the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater with an effective average pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) removal of 80% has also been evaluated. Photolysis (UV) treatment alone was not capable of degrading PhACs to a sufficient extent in WWTP secondary effluent. The addition of 0.4 mmol of PDS or PMS, applying 416 mJ/cm(2 )of UV fluence, resulted in average removals of 84% and 85% for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. The electrical energy (kWh) required to degrade the mix of PhACs by one order of magnitude in 1 m(3) of contaminated water was calculated as 0.9 kWh/m(3)/order and 0.8 kWh/m(3)/order 4 for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. However, the overall cost, including operation, materials and maintenance, of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS, based on an average PhAC removal of 80%, was 0.088 (sic)/m(3) and 0.280 (sic)/m(3), respectively. From the sustainability assessment, the factors with the greatest environmental footprint for the UV/PDS process were chemical production (PDS: 52.9%, PMS: 85%) and electricity consumption (UV/PDS: 33.4%, UV/PMS: 11.2). Finally, the normalized environmental impact analysis showed that UV/PDS was associated with an environmental footprint three times lower than UV/PMS. The overall assessment revealed that UV/PDS is preferable to UV/PMS to remove PhACs in secondary effluents of municipal WWTPs having a lower economic and environmental impact. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Health care waste includes all the waste generated by health care establishments, research facilities, and laboratories. This constitutes a variety of chemical substances, such as pharmaceuticals, radionuclides, solvents, and disinfectants. Recently, scientists and environmentalists have discovered that wastewater produced by hospitals possesses toxic properties due to various toxic chemicals and pharmaceuticals capable of causing environmental impacts and even lethal effects to organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Many of these compounds resist normal wastewater treatment and end up in surface waters. Besides aquatic organisms, humans can be exposed through drinking water produced from contaminated surface water. Indeed, some of the substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be potential contributors to certain cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of wastewaters from two hospitals and three clinical diagnostic centers located in Jaipur (Rajasthan State), India using the prokaryotic Salmonella mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and the eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae respiration inhibition assay. In the Ames assay, untreated wastewaters from both of the health care sectors resulted in significantly increased numbers of revertant colonies up to 1,000-4,050 as measured by the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains (with and without metabolic activation) after exposure to undiluted samples, which indicated the highly genotoxic nature of these wastewaters. Furthermore, both hospital and diagnostic samples were found to be highly cytotoxic. Effective concentrations at which 20 % (EC20) and 50 % (EC50) inhibition of the respiration rate of the cells occurred ranged between similar to 0.00 and 0.52 % and between 0.005 and 41.30 % (calculated with the help of the MS excel software XLSTAT 2012.1.01; Addinsoft), respectively, as determined by the S. cerevisiae assay. The results indicated that hospital wastewaters contain genotoxic and cytotoxic components. In addition, diagnostic centers also represent small but significant sources of genotoxic and cytotoxic wastes.

AB Background, aim, and scope The European Union banned disposal of sewage sludge (SS) at sea in Europe in 1998. Since that time, the application rate of SS to land has risen significantly and is set to rise further. Fifty-two percent of SS was disposed to land in the UK in 2000. Land application is, thus, possibly an important transport route for SS-associated organic chemicals into the environment. There are now over 3,000 different pharmaceutical ingredients in use in the EU and many enter sewage systems. Possibly as a result, the last decade has seen an increase in reports of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment (e. g. in watercourses, open ocean and soils). Surprisingly, there is still a significant lack of knowledge of the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment, particularly in soils. The present project, therefore, investigated the susceptibility to microbial degradation of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Prozac(R) (fluoxetine HCl), and the 1,4-benzodiazepine, Valium(R) (Diazepam) and their major human metabolites (norfluoxetine HCl, temazepam and oxazepam) in short-term (60 day) bacterial liquid cultures derived from UK SS-amended soil and of fluoxetine HCl in a longer-term (270 day) SS-amended soil culture.
   Methodology Recently developed extraction techniques, including solid phase extraction, allowed all analytes to be isolated from the biodegradation cultures (aqueous and soil matrices), and subsequently analysed using novel high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-multistage mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MSn) techniques. Ratio calibration using deuterated internal standards allowed the generation of quantitative data. A simple basified tautomerism experiment was also performed to aid in the identification of a bacterial transformation product. Alongside the biodegradation studies, HPLC-APCI-MSn profiling of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs; bacterial membrane marker chemicals) allowed assessment of the microbial community structure in the SS-amended soils.
   Results The pharmaceuticals were found to be resistant to biodegradation in liquid culture studies (60 days), and even after prolonged exposure in SS-amended soil (> 200 days; fluoxetine HCl only). Oxazepam was the only 1,4-benzodiazepine studied which underwent biotic transformation (similar to 40%) in liquid culture studies. Evidence to support the theory that the transformation product was a 1,4-benzodiazepine tautomer, is presented. BHP profiles of eight different SS-amended soils suggested that the restricted bacterial community of the soil used as a culture source in these biodegradation studies was typical of SS-amended soils.
   Discussion The lack of substantial degradation of all target analytes except oxazepam under simulated, but realistic, SS-amended soil conditions indicates their likely persistent nature. Although oxazepam did undergo significant biotic (and abiotic) losses, the metabolite formed under biotic influences was hypothesised to be another bioactive 1,4-benzodiazepine (either 2-enol or 3-enol nordiazepam) which is likely to be resistant to further change. The bacterial communities in SS-amended soils may be unable to degrade such compounds.
   Recommendations and perspectives With such pharmaceuticals as tested here, there is a potential for accumulation within environments such as field soil to which SS is regularly added both as a disposal mechanism and as a fertiliser. When compounds undergo accumulation, the risk of transport to other environmental components becomes more likely. From field soils, these may include potential exposure to flora and fauna and possible bioaccumulation or effects on terrestrial organisms and accumulation in plants, including crops grown on the SS-treated soils. The fate and subsequent impact of many pharmaceuticals within the terrestrial environment is still largely unknown and further research is required before the risks, if any, of SS-associated pharmaceuticals can be fully assessed.

AB Vegetable crops irrigated with treated wastewater can take up the environmentally persistent pharmaceuticals diclofenac and lamotrigine. This study aimed at quantifying the uptake and translocation of the two pharmaceuticals in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as well as on the elucidation of the molecular and physiological changes triggered by them. Therefore, plants were cultivated in a phytochamber in hydroponic systems under controlled conditions and treated independently with diclofenac (20 mu g L-1) and lamotrigine (60 mu g L-1) for 48 h. A low translocation of lamotrigine but not of diclofenac or its metabolite 4'-hydroxydiclofenac to leaves was observed, which corresponded with the expression of stress related genes only in roots of diclofenac treated plants. We observed an oxidative burst in roots and leaves occurring around the same time point when lamotrigine was detected in leaves. This could be responsible for the significantly changed gene expression pattern in both tissues. Our results showed for the first time that pharmaceuticals like lamotrigine or diclofenac might act as signals or zeitgebers, affecting the circadian expression of stress related genes in lettuce possibly causing a repressed physiological status of the plant.

AB De facto potable reuse occurs when treated wastewater is discharged upstream of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and can lead to contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) occurring in potable water. Our prior research, focusing on larger communities that each serve >10,000 people across the USA, indicates that elevated de facto reuse (DFR) occurs in Texas, and thus we added to our model DWTPs serving smaller communities to understand their vulnerability to CECs. Here, we show that two-thirds of all surface water intakes in Texas were impacted by DFR at levels exceeding 90% during even mild droughts, and under average streamflow DFR levels range between 1 and 20%. DWTPs serving lower population communities (<10,000 people) have higher DFR levels, and fewer than 2% of these communities have advanced technologies (e.g., ozone, activated carbon) at DWTPs to remove CECs. Efforts to improve water quality in these less populated communities are an important priority. The model approach and results can be used to identify prioritization for monitoring and treatment of CECs, including in underserved communities, which normally lack knowledge of their impacts from DFR occurring within their watersheds.

AB In this study, the removal and recovery of bisphenol F (BPF) by multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were investigated. MWCNT has shown the great potential as a kind of effective adsorbents for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)-BPF in wastewater treatment. The results indicated that the removal percentages of BPF could reach up to 96.2% within 4 min under pH 4-10. BPF adsorption kinetics was found to be very fast and the equilibrium was attained within 4.0 min following the pseudo-second-order model with observed rate constants (k) 0.707-3.175 g mg(-1) min(-1) (at varied temperatures). The adsorption mechanisms were the non-electrostatic dispersion interaction, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction between BPF and MWCNT and the overall rate process mainly governed by the external mass transfer. Most of the co-existing ions which were studied have negligible effect on the sorption BPF by MWCNT. Furthermore, MWCNT was of high stability in eight times removal-regeneration recycles. In summary, MWCNT is an excellent adsorbent which can be used for BPF removal in contaminated water treatment process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the presence of human-use compounds in the aquatic environment has been recognized as an important issue in environmental chemistry. Among them, illicit drugs have been described as a new unexpected group of water contaminants with potent psychoactive properties and unknown effects to the aquatic environment.
   The presence of these drugs in water resources is of rising concern and several studies are being conducted all over the world estimating discharged levels of drugs of abuse. In this chapter, a summary of the last works studying and reporting the occurrence of illicit drugs in water resources is performed. Up to now, drugs of abuse have been already detected in wastewaters and surface waters in the USA, Italy, Germany, the UK and Spain. These drugs reach wastewater treatment plants either unaltered or in their main metabolite form. Depending on the removal efficiencies, they can persist through wastewater treatment and be detected in receiving waters, which in some cases are used for drinking water production. The presence of these compounds in raw waters and their elimination through the drinking water treatment must be considered as an issue with regard to the quality of water supplies.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) and acetaminophen (analgesic) are classed as common Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC) that have been detected in significant quantities in sewage treatment plants in Malaysia and other countries. Unfortunately, the conventional sewage treatment plants are not effective to reduce the concentrations of these compounds. Therefore, this study introduces a novel Contaminant Emerging Remover (COATER) to face the pollution caused by these CECs. This COATER was formulated using epoxidized neutral rubber (ENR-50) and poly(vinyl) chloride (PVC) as binders besides activated carbon as an adsorbent, which was coated on white cotton fabric (substrate) via brushing technique. Characterization analysis of this COATER was performed using SEM-EDX, FTIR and BET quantifications to study the surface chemistry and to obtain insights about the adsorption mechanism. Results of surface morphology analysis showed a good distribution of activated carbon onto the substrate where the surface area and pore volume of the COATER were 64.3 m(2)/g and 0.07 cm(3)/g, respectively. Adsorption isotherms of tested CECs on COATER were experimentally quantified at different temperatures. A monolayer adsorption model based on statistical physics was used to understand the adsorption mechanism. Modelling results showed that the adsorption orientation of tested molecules was similar but it could occur a change in the interaction of these pollutants with the adsorption sites of COATER surface during the removal process since this adsorbent contained a variety of functional groups. It was concluded that the adsorption mechanism of tested adsorbates on COATER included pore interaction, chemical bonding and electrostatic forces.

AB This study examined the distribution of pharmaceuticals in Yeongsan River and at point sources (PSs) in the associated water system, and performed a risk assessment based on our findings. The samples included effluents collected from three sewage treatment plants (PS1, PS2, and PS3) and two industrial complexes (PS4 and PS5) as well as surface water collected from seven mainstreams and 11 tributaries of the river. The target pharmaceuticals were acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, naproxen, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole, and trimethoprim, which were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All pharmaceuticals except acetylsalicylic acid and sulfathiazole were found in PS1, PS2, and PS3 samples, whereas acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole were found in PS4, most of the pharmaceuticals were not present in PS5. The rank order of pharmaceutical concentration in surface water was carbamazepine (97.2%, 0.2067 mu g/L) > sulfamethoxazole (88.9%, 0.1132 mu g/L) > naproxen (51.4%, 0.0516 mu g/L) > clarithromycin (43.1%, 0.0427 mu g/L). The distribution of pharmaceuticals in the Yeongsan River at PSs and non-PSs differed, and higher concentrations of human pharmaceuticals were detected in upstream and midstream areas whereas higher concentrations of animal pharmaceuticals were found downstream. Hazard quotients (HQs) evaluated at each sites based on mean concentration and 95% upper confidence limits (95% UCLs) were all less than one, indicating a low risk of toxicity. The findings of this study are expected to be useful for risk assessment of aquatic ecosystems.

AB In consideration of the serious environmental issues caused by heavy metals, novel nanomaterials have been developed and applied as highly selective adsorbents with the capacity to eliminate heavy metal ions in ambient ecosystems. Ionic covalent organic frameworks (I-COFs) serve as an emerging species of functional nanomaterials that inherently possess ionic interfaces that interact strongly with oppositely charged ionic species. In this work, a guanidinium-based COF with a beta-ketoenamine linkage (Tp-DGCl) was synthesized using a solvothermal method. The obtained Tp-DGCl colligated four advantages, namely easy synthesis, high selectivity (for Cr (VI)), excellent adsorption (360.02 mg/g calculated by Langmuir model), and good recyclability (five cycles), which enables it to serve as a reliable sorbent for wastewater treatment. Owing to the stable and selective binding affinities between tetrahedral oxoanions and diiminoguanidinium groups, Tp-DGCl exhibited an outstanding adsorption capacity for Cr (VI). Subsequent to five cycles, the adsorption performance of Tp-DGCl remained at a high level (85%), which demonstrated an excellent regenerative capacity by supplementing Cl- to the Tp-DGCl after adsorption. Consequently, Tp-DGCl revealed a strong potential for broad applications in wastewater remediation.

AB Binary solvent dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (BSDLLME) was combined with liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of selected drug active compounds with high accuracy and precision. Optimization studies for the extraction parameters were carried out to lower the detection limits of seven drug active compounds. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) values were calculated in the range of 0.01-6.1 and 0.05-20 ng mL(-1), respectively. Recovery studies were also carried out with wastewater matrix to check the applicability of the developed method. The percent recovery values ranged between 95-105 and 90-116% for 75 and 125 ng mL(-1) spiked samples, respectively. The recovery results obtained established the applicability of the developed method for the quantification of all analytes in the selected matrix. Thus, the developed method can be used for the simultaneous determination of analytes with high accuracy and precision.

AB In the present study, sole adsorption, Fenton's oxidation, ozone treatment and biochemical treatment by Alcaligenes feacalis (A. feacalis) and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum (E. aurantiacum) and combination of the above treatments have been studied. It was observed that Fenton's treatment is efficient for degradation of Pantoprazole in any concentration pantaprazole. In Fenton's process, the degradation obtained 56.77% at pH 3.5 in an hour and in ozone treatment, 36% removal was achieved in 8 min for 600 ppm concentration. The microbial treatment is proved to be a good one but in the lower range of pantoprazole about 200 mg/L. The degradation of pantoprazole was achieved 58.40% and 60.08% by using A. feacalis and E. aurantiacum respectively in 72 h. Combination treatment has been designed, and the system worked efficiently. In the first step either Fenton's treatment, activated carbon or ozone treatment were performed followed by biochemical treatment. The maximum percentage removal of pantoprozole was observed 90.17%, 81.57%, and 71.07% respectively. The process also proves that it is partially cost effective, energy saving and environmentally safe operation.

AB In this study, a direct contact membrane distillation (MD) unit was integrated with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) to simultaneously recover energy and produce high quality water for reuse from wastewater. Results show that AnMBR could produce 03-0.5 L/g CODadded biogas with a stable methane content of approximately 65%. By integrating MD with AnMBR, bulk organic matter and phosphate were almost completely removed. The removal of the 26 selected trace organic contaminants by AnMBR was compound specific, but the MD process could complement AnMBR removal, leading to an overall efficiency from 76% to complete removal by the integrated system. The results also show that, due to complete retention, organic matter (such as humic-like and protein-like substances) and inorganic salts accumulated in the MD feed solution and therefore resulted in significant fouling of the MD unit. As a result, the water flux of the MD process decreased continuously. Nevertheless, membrane pore wetting was not observed throughout the operation.

AB The work is focused on spontaneous colonization of fungal mycelium by invading microorganisms in a trickle-bed fungal bioreactor operating under semi-sterile conditions. Pleurotus ostreatus was grown under the flow of synthetic wastewater containing activated sludge bacteria and the microbial consortium developed in the reactor was characterized. Genotype and phenotype profile of the reactor-invading, bacterial consortium was clearly distinctive from that of the original activated sludge. The bacterial consortium from the reactor contained a higher portion of bacteria capable of cellobiose utilization and a small amount of bacteria with the ability to utilize benzoic acids. The invading bacteria had no effect on the dye decolorization performance of the fungal reactor. Five bacterial strains colonizing P. ostreatus reactor cultures were isolated and identified as species of the genera Pseudomonas and Bacillus. Except for Bacillus cereus all strains displayed a potential to inhibit fungal growth on solid media (14 to 51 % inhibition) which was comparable or higher than that of the reference bacterial strains. The pH- and media composition-dependence of the growth inhibition was demonstrated.

AB Contaminant such as pesticides, veterinary products, industrial compounds, food additives, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals may cause a negative effect when comes into contact with the environment. The presence of these compounds can be generated toxic effects in the aquatic system and cause an irreparable ecological alteration. Antibiotic compounds are one of the main pollutants found in the aquatic systems, because they are often inadequately prescribed and as a part of antibiotics is not completely consumed or degraded in human and animal bodies. Their residues can be entered in aquatic systems by wastewater treatment plants. The presences of antibiotics in aquatic systems have been linked to increasing microorganism antibiotic resistance through different mutations. Advanced oxidation processes have been proposed for the treatment of antibiotic in aqueous systems, including solar photocatalysis. Several parameters are necessary to take into account in solar photocatalysis treatment to eliminate antibiotics, since these compounds display different physicochemical and biological properties. This chapter discusses the effect of parameters and pathways (transformation products) of solar photocatalysis of antibiotic groups usually found in aquatic systems as macrolides, sulfones, lincosamides, and quinolone.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is a membrane separation technology that has been studied in recent years for application in water treatment and desalination. It can best be utilized as an advanced pretreatment for desalination processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) to protect the membranes from scaling and fouling. In the current study the rejection of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, plasticizers, and flame-retardants by FO and a hybrid FOR() system was investigated at both the bench- and pilot-scales. More than 30 compounds were analyzed, of which 23 nonionic and ionic TOrCs were identified and quantified in the studied wastewater effluent. Results revealed that almost all TOrCs were highly rejected by the FO membrane at the pilot scale while rejection at the bench scale was generally lower. Membrane fouling, especially under field conditions when wastewater effluent is the FO feed solution, plays a substantial role in increasing the rejection of TOrCs in FO. The hybrid FO-RO process demonstrated that the dual barrier treatment of impaired water could lead to more than 99% rejection of almost all TOrCs that were identified in reclaimed water.

AB A new enzymatic assay method that uses deconjugation enzymes was developed to evaluate the presence and extent of conjugated pharmaceuticals in the form of glucuronide conjugates or sulphate conjugates in river environments. First, acetaminophen glucuronide (Ace Glu) and acetaminophen sulphate (Ace Sul) were used as model conjugated pharmaceuticals to determine the appropriate combination of deconjugation enzymes and reaction conditions, including temperature, duration and pH. Next, we applied the defined method to 19 pharmaceuticals grouped into nine therapeutic classes that were chosen based on previously detected levels and frequencies in sewage and river water. The enzymatic decomposition profile varied widely depending upon the enzyme preparations available. The effect of the water reaction temperature was small between 5 and 40 degrees C, and the reaction proceeded in for both glucuronide conjugates and sulphate conjugates at an approximately neutral pH (corresponding to usual river water conditions) within 1 h. Application of the method to environmental samples showed that some pharmaceuticals were present in both glucuronide conjugate and sulphate conjugated forms, although glucuronide conjugates were the primary forms in the river water environment. Water treatment systems at sewage treatment plants were found to be effective for the removal of these conjugated compounds. The present results should be valuable in the environmental risk assessment of conjugated pharmaceuticals and in keeping river environments clean. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that enables the evaluation of the pharmaceutical deconjugation potential in a river environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin are very important in human and animal medicine, and can be entrained onto agricultural ground through application of sewage sludge or manures. In the present study, a series of replicated field plots were left untreated or received up to five annual spring applications of a mixture of three drugs to achieve a nominal concentration for each of 10 or 0.1 mg kg(-1) soil; the latter an environmentally relevant concentration. Soil samples were incubated in the laboratory, and supplemented with antibiotics to establish the dissipation kinetics of erythromycin and clarithromycin using radioisotope methods, and azithromycin using HPLC-MS/MS. All three drugs were dissipated significantly more rapidly in soils with a history of field exposure to 10 mg kg(-1) macrolides, and erythromycin and clarithromycinwere also degraded more rapidly in field soil exposed to 0.1 mg kg(-1) macrolides. Rapid mineralization of C-14-labelled erythromycin and clarithromycin are consistent with biodegradation. Analysis of field soils revealed no carryover of parent compound from year to year. Azithromycin transformation products were detected consistent with removal of the desosamine and cladinose moieties. Overall, these results have revealed that following several years of exposure to macrolide antibiotics these are amenable to accelerated degradation. The potential accelerated degradation of these drugs in soils amended with manure and sewage sludge should be investigated as this phenomenon would attenuate environmental exposure and selection pressure for clinically relevant resistance.

AB Passive sampling is proposed as an alternative to traditional grab- and composite-sampling modes. Investigated here is a novel passive sampler configuration, the Chemcatcher containing an Atlantic HLB disk covered by a 0.2 mu m poly(ether sulfone) membrane, for monitoring polar organic micropollutants (personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and illicit drugs) in wastewater effluent. In situ calibration showed linear uptake for the majority of detected micropollutants over 9 days of deployment. Sampling rates (R-s) were determined for 59 compounds and were generally in the range of 0.01-0.10 L day(-1). The Chemcatcher was also suitable for collecting chiral micropollutants and maintaining their enantiomeric distribution during deployment. This is essential for their future use in developing more accurate environmental risk assessments at the enantiomeric level. Application of calibration data in a subsequent monitoring study showed that the concentration estimated for 92% of micropollutants was within a factor of 2 of the known concentration. However, their application in a legislative context will require further understanding of the properties and mechanisms controlling micropollutant uptake to improve the accuracy of reported concentrations.

AB Pharmaceuticals, newly recognized classes of environmental pollutants, are becoming increasingly problematic contaminants of either surface water or ground water around industrial and residential communities. Pharmaceuticals are constantly released into aquatic environments, mainly due to their widespread consumption and complicated removal in wastewater treatment plants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis appear to be one of the most destructive advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for organic contaminants and are possible to obtain complete mineralization of organic pollutants into eco-friendly end products under visible and solar light irradiation. In this study, flower-like In S-2(3) hierarchical nanostructures were successfully prepared via a facile solution-phase route, using thioacetamide as both sulfur source and capping agent. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the flowers revealed that the cubic structure of In2S3; morphological studies examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the synthesized In2S3 nanostructure was flowerlike hierarchitecture assembled from nanoscale flakes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the stoichiometry of In2S3 nanoflowers. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity studies revealed that the prepared indium(III) sulfide(In2S3) nanoflowers exhibit an excellent photocatalytic performance, degrading rapidly the aqueous pharmaceutical solution of Lisinopril under visible light irradiation. These results suggest that In2S3 nanoflowers will be a promising candidate of photocatalyst working in thevisible light range.

Due to their small molecular weight and concentration their effective control is a challenge. In this study magnetic ion exchange(MIEX (R)), which was developed to remove natural organic matter (NOM) from surface water, was investigated for such a micropollutant, estrone. The interaction of estrone with the resin occurs as a side effect when NOM is removed. This interaction results in some degree of removal. However, the accumulation of those hazardous materials on the resin, which can be associated with accidental release, as well Lis the concentration in the regeneration brine of the process, is environmentally more significant. For this reason a thorough investigation of interaction phenomena was undertaken. Estrone and polymeric materials (such as ion exchange resins or membranes) interact through a number of mechanisms including specific and non-specific interactions. Sorption and desorption of estrone were studied as a function of pH, temperature, natural organic matter concentration, sulfate concentration and ionic strength to elucidate possible mechanisms. The results demonstrated that the resin removed around 70% estrone at high pH conditions (>10.4) when estrone was predominantly negatively charged. However, below pH 10.4, when estrone was neutral, approximately 40% of estrone still sorbed due to hydrogen bonding. The optimum temperature for estrone sorption was observed to be in the 15 to 35 degrees C range, while the presence of other anions, including natural organic matter reduced estrone removal due to competition for anion exchange sites. Desorption of estrone was most effective with 2 M NaCl regeneration brine concentration when estrone was negatively charged (98% desorption). However, when estrone was neutral there was no significant difference between 1 M and 2 M NaCl. The results presented in this Study indicate that polar non-ionic micropollutants were removed by magnetic ion exchange resin due to sorption to the resin polymer. This has implications for treatment, however, the accumulation of micropollutants on polymeric materials in water treatment as well as the abundance of such micropollutants in the regeneration brine are risks that warrant monitoring.

AB Pharmaceuticals are constantly dispersed into the environment and little is known of the effects on non-target organisms. This is an issue of growing concern. In this study, Baltic Sea blue mussels, Mytilus edulis trossulus, were exposed to diclofenac, ibuprofen and propranolol, three pharmaceuticals that are produced and sold in large quantities and have a widespread occurrence in aquatic environments. The mussels were exposed to pharmaceuticals in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10,000 mu g l(-1). The pharmaceuticals were added both separately and in combination. Mussels exposed to high concentrations of pharmaceuticals showed a clear response compared to controls. Firstly, they had a significantly lower scope for growth, which indicates that the organisms had a smaller part of their energy available for normal metabolism, and secondly, they had lower byssus strength and lower abundance of byssus threads, resulting in reduced ability to attach to the underlying substrate. Mussels exposed to lower concentrations showed tendencies of the same results. The concentration of diclofenac and propranolol was quantified in the mussels using both liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The measurements showed a significantly higher concentration in the organisms as compared to the water the mussels were exposed to; the uptake reached concentrations two orders of magnitudes higher than found in sewage treatment plant effluents. This study showed that common pharmaceuticals are taken up and negatively affect the physiology of a non-target species at levels of two to three orders of magnitudes higher than found in sewage treatment plant effluents.

AB We examined whether exposure to municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) compromised the stress performance of laboratory-reared fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in a field setting. Adult minnows were caged at two sites upstream and three sites downstream of wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) discharging MWWE into the Bow River, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. At each site one group of fish was sampled after a 26 day exposure to MWWE, while another group was subjected to 1-min air exposure followed by 60-min confinement and then sampled. Fish morphometrics and proximate composition were measured, and whole-body cortisol, glucose and lactate levels assessed as markers of the stress response. The whole-body protein, glycogen and lipid content were higher at the site closest to a WWTP outfall relative to the other downstream and upstream sites. There were no significant differences in whole-body cortisol levels in minnows sampled at sites either upstream or downstream of WWTPs. Acute stressor exposure significantly elevated whole-body cortisol levels in all groups, and this response was not modified by the location of the sampling sites. The whole-body metabolite profile, including glucose and lactate levels, were significantly higher in fish caged immediately downstream from WWTP inputs relative to upstream sites. There was an acute-stressor-mediated increase in whole-body lactate, but not glucose, levels and this response was independent of sampling site. The results reveal that the capacity to evoke an acute stress response was not compromised in fathead minnows caged for 26 days downstream of WWTPs in the Bow River. However, there were changes in the whole-body proximate composition and metabolite levels immediately downstream from the WWTP outfall suggesting greater accumulation of energy stores in these fish. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental factors in addition to contaminants, including higher water temperature and nutrient availability, influence the impact of MWWEs on fish stress performance.

AB Lake Tegel (Berlin, Germany) is controlled by two main inflows: inflow #1 (River Havel) is heavily phosphorus-laden, whereas inflow #2 is an artificial confluence that includes discharge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant distinguished by high levels of phosphorus and pharmaceuticals. To reduce the phosphorus load on the lake, a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP) is situated at inflow #2. Moreover, the two inflows are short-circuited by a pipeline that transfers part of the inflow #1 water to the PEP and finally releases it into inflow #2. The pipeline and the PEP have contributed to a continuous reduction in the total phosphorus concentration of Lake Tegel in the past 25 years. We investigate the question of whether the existing lake pipeline can also be used to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals in Lake Tegel originating from inflow #2 by dilution with water from River Havel, by diverting part of inflow #2 around the lake, or by a combination of both strategies. The circulation pattern of Lake Tegel is complicated by complex bathymetry and numerous islands and is therefore highly sensitive to winds. We tested seven different management scenarios by hydrodynamic modeling for a period of 16 years with the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). None of the scenarios provided a strategy optimal for both pharmaceuticals and phosphorus. Nonetheless, compound regimes, such as alternating the pipe flow direction or adding another pipeline, allowed the most abundant pharmaceutical (carbamazepine) to be reduced while maintaining the current phosphorus level. This study demonstrates the ability of immediate lake regulation measures to maintain water quality. In the case of Lake Tegel, the pipeline can be fully effective with regard to pharmaceuticals only in combination with additional efforts such as advanced pharmaceutical treatment of wastewater and/or phosphorus reduction in the River Havel catchment.

AB Cytostatic drugs represents a category of pharmaceutical products used in cancer treatment, and among em 5-fluorouracil is the most common. Drugs used in cancer treatment are inhibiting and even destroying the cells, acting in a non-selective manner and therefore being considered to present carcinogenic, genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic potential. About 15% of the administered 5-fluorouracil is eliminated from human body without any transformation and therefore ends up in the wastewater system. Due to the fact that removal of 5-Buoruracil and other pharmaceutical products using conventional wastewater treatment is incomplete and inefficient, there is a need for more performant degradation technologies such as advanced oxidation processes. Among them, photocatalytic oxidation using titanium dioxide represents one of the most efficient removal technology for hazardous organic compounds. UV/TiO2 degradation of 5-fluorouracil was investigated in the aim to optimize process operational parameters: pH = 7, photocatalyst dose = 100 mg/L, irradiation time = 180 min. The degradation kinetic of 5-fluorouracil was found to follow Langmuir - Hinshelwood model and degradation rate constant k(r) = 3.74 x 10(6) M min(-1) and equilibrium constant of 5-fluorouracil adsorption on photocatalyst particles K-ad = 9505 M-1 were determined.

AB This work is focused on the use of TiO2-WO3 photocatalysts for the removal of a mixture of emerging contaminants through photocatalytic ozonation using simulated solar light as radiation source. Own-made TiO2-WO3 catalysts with WO3 content around 4 wt% were synthesized using P25 and titanate nanotubes as TiO2 starting materials. Photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by means of ICP-OES, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, TEM, Raman, XPS and DR-UV-Vis spectroscopy. Photocatalytic ozonation using WO3 based titanate nanotubes composite gave place to complete removal of emerging contaminants (caffeine, metoprolol and ibuprofen in a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant effluent aqueous matrix) in less than 40 min with TOC removal up to 64% after 2 h. The highest catalytic activity of this material in the reaction under study compared to bare TiO2 is due to several effects such as higher activity under visible light radiation joined to an increase in adsorption capacity of organic compounds and catalytic ozonation ability caused by the presence of WO3.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical micropollutants in water and wastewater is considered a serious environmental issue. To eliminate these pollutants, biodegradation of pharmaceuticals using enzymes such as laccase, is proposed as a green method. In this study, immobilized laccase was used for the removal of two model pharmaceutical compounds, carbamazepine and diclofenac. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized as a tailor-made support for enzyme immobilization. Covalently immobilized laccase from Trametes hirsuta exhibited remarkable activity and activity recovery of 4.47 U/cm(2) and 38.31%, respectively. The results also indicated improvement in the operational and thermal stability of the immobilized laccase compared to free laccase. Finally, by using immobilized laccase in a mini-membrane reactor, removal efficiencies of 27% in 48 h and 95% in 4 h were obtained for carbamazepine and diclofenac, respectively. The findings suggest that immobilized laccase on PVDF/MWCNT membranes is a promising catalyst for large-scale water and wastewater treatment which is also compatible with existing treatment facilities.

AB The proper choice of dissolved oxygen (DO) is important in aerobic treatment. In this paper, a multi-stage vertical variable diameter membrane bioreactor was developed to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and ceftriaxone sodium. In the 180 days of operation, the performance of COD, BOD5, 6-APA, ceftriaxone sodium removal, sludge index, and microbial enzyme activity under different DOs (from 0.5 to 6.0 mg/L) were investigated. The results showed that the optimal range of DO was 1.5-2.1 mg/L, and the highest removal rates of COD and BOD5 were observed 87.3% +/- 2.4% and 95.3% +/- 1.8%, the corresponding effluent COD and BOD5 were 189 mg/L and 24 mg/L, respectively. To reduce the energy consumption and ensure stability of DO in the reactor, a control strategy based on an improved differential evolution BP fuzzy neural network was built and found that the performance and cost of the controlled DO were improved effectively than that of uncontrolled DO.

AB This study investigates the effect of low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on photo-oxidation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) present in secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Experiments were conducted using two types of flow-through reactor systems: (1)three ultraviolet light (UV) reactors connected in series without a H2O2 addition, and (2)a UV reactor with a H2O2 addition. In the first part of this study, 38 PPCPs detected in secondary effluent were examined based on their degradability by UV in the presence and absence of H2O2. For the PPCPs that were not degraded to or below their detection level, the pseudo first-order photo-oxidation rate constants, k (s-1), were determined using a mathematical model developed for three continuously stirred tank reactors in series. The second part of the study investigated the kinetics of the selected PPCPs in the UV/H2O2 reactor. The effect of low concentrations of H2O2 on the photo-oxidation rate of PPCPs was quantified by the power function expression.

AB Adverse effects of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on sediment quality at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain) were evaluated by a battery of acute bioassays and chemical contamination. Five sites directly affected by WWTPs effluents and one control site were chosen. Results evidenced clear deterioration of ecological sediment quality parameters and possible effects on aquatic communities towards WWTPs areas. Acute toxicity and chemical contamination varied significantly across the studied sites and differed between winter and summer seasons. The Bay of Cadiz is contaminated by PAHs, metals, detergents (SAS) and pharmaceutical products. Principal Component Analyses indicated metals, SAS and pharmaceutical products as the major environmental stresses. Sea-urchin embryo-larval and microalgae growth rate were the most sensitive bioassays to evaluate resuspension of contaminants (elutriate) from bulk sediment. Amphipods mortality and Microtox (R) solid phase test bioassays were recommended to evaluate bulk sediment quality. Therefore, the use of multiple-bioassays, sensitive to sediment pollution, may provide complementary information to diagnose environmental factors that can impair aquatic communities. The battery of bioassays is recommended to assess and monitor marine sediments directly affected by a mixture of contaminants released from WWTPs.

AB Little information is available on pharmaceutical trace compounds degradation pathways in wastewater. The potential of the proteomics approach has been evaluated to extract information on activated sludge microbial metabolism in degrading a trace concentration of a pharmaceutical compound (ibuprofen). Ibuprofen is one of the most consumed pharmaceuticals, measured in wastewater at very high concentrations and, despite its high removal rates, found in different environmental compartments. Aerated and completely mixed activated sludge batch tests were spiked with ibuprofen at 10 and 1,000 mu g L-1. Ibuprofen concentrations were determined in the liquid phase: 100% removal was observed and the kinetics were estimated. The solid phase was sampled for proteomics purposes. The first objective was to apply proteomics to evaluate protein profile variations in a complex matrix such as activated sludge. The second objective was to determine, at different ibuprofen concentrations, which proteins followed pre-defined trends. No newly expressed proteins were found. Nonetheless, the obtained results suggest that proteomics itself is a promising methodology to be applied in this field. Statistical and comparative studies analyses provided, in fact, useful information on biological reproducibility and permitted us to detect 62 proteins following coherent and plausible expected trends in terms of presence and intensity change.

AB To respond to concerns associated with wastewater-derived contaminants water utilities are looking for new approaches for monitoring trace organic chemicals in conventional and advanced water treatment processes. This study examines the use of a combination of surrogate parameters and indicator Compounds tailored to monitor the removal efficiency of advanced oxidation processes employed by treatment plants engaged in indirect potable water reuse programs. Potential surrogate parameters and indicator compounds, identified by reviewing previous publications and classified by their structural properties, were tested in pilot- and full-scale treatment systems. Dilantin, DEET, meprobamate, and iopromide are good indicators to assess optimized oxidation conditions while ozonating tertiary-treated wastewaters. UVA reduction, ozone byproduct formation, such as simple organic acids, and ozone exposure correlated with "sweet spot" compounds, where ozone exposure correlated with trace organic removal across five tertiary-treated wastewaters. Findings indicate that the proposed framework can serve as a conservative monitoring approach for advanced oxidation processes as well as other indirect potable reuse processes to ensure proper removal of identified and unidentified wastewater-derived organic contaminants, to detect failures in system performance, and is protective of public health.

AB Ramat Hovav is a major chemical industrial park manufacturing pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and various aliphatic and aromatic halogens. All wastewater streams are collected in large evaporation ponds. Salinity in the evaporation ponds fluctuates between 3% (w/v) and saturation and pH values range between 2.0 and 10.0. We looked for microorganisms surviving in these extreme environmental conditions and found that 2 yeast strains dominate this biotope. 18S rDNA sequence analysis identified the isolates as Pichia guilliermondii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Both isolates grew in NaCl concentrations ranging up to 3.5 M and 2.5 M, respectively, and at a pH range of 2-10. There was a distinct difference between the Rhodotorula and Pichia strains and S. cerevisiae RS16 that served as a control strain with respect to accumulation of osmoregulators and internal ion concentrations when exposed to osmotic stress. The Pichia and Rhodotorula strains maintained high glycerol concentration also in media low in NaCl. Utilization of various carbon sources was examined. Using a tetrazolium-based assay we show that the Rhodotorula and Pichia strains are capable of utilizing a wide range of different carbon sources including anthracene, phenanthrene, and other cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water has been barely studied in Latin America. This work aimed to i) develop a multi-residue liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs); ii) monitor 70 PhACs in three urban-influenced rivers in San Jose, Costa Rica; and iii) perform the risk assessment of detected compounds and ecotoxicological evaluation on water samples. Caffeine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, naproxen, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen were the most frequent among 23 detected compounds. Concentrations ranged from 0.013 mu g/L to 53.8 mu g/L (62 % detections between 0.1 mu g/L-1 mu g/L), and the highest values corresponded to caffeine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, ofloxacin, gemfibrozil and cephalexin. The environmental risk estimated using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach, revealed four and eleven compounds with medium and high risk, respectively. The highest risk (HQ >10) was determined for diphenhydramine, risperidone, fluoxetine, trimethoprim, ofloxacin and azithromycin; nonetheless, high risk (HQ >1) was also estimated for caffeine, diclofenac, clarithromycin, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. Total HQ sample values (EHQ), calculated as the sum of individual HQs for each detected compound, revealed the highest hazard in surface water near wastewater treatment plant discharges, followed by the locations of higher urban influence (in the Virilla river). Ecotoxicological evaluation showed no acute toxicity towards Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri in surface water samples; on the contrary, toxicity towards Lactuca sativa (germination tests) showed a similar pattern to that determined with the EHQ, although the highest toxicity was observed downstream with respect to the urban influence of the metropolitan area. These findings help to visualize the importance of pharmaceutical residues in the overall toxicity of surface water samples, and remark the relevance of monitoring these compounds, as an input for the implementation of future mitigation actions.

TI Hypoxia and the pharmaceutical diclofenac influence the circadian

AB Pollution with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, especially when combined with low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia), is a threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is commonly detected in wastewater effluents, and has potential to accumulate in the bile of fish. Diclofenac has been shown to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which induces transcription in the metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450 1a (cyp1a). Previously, crosstalk has been shown to occur between AHR and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). In addition, both of these transcription factors interact with the proteins regulating circadian (24-h) rhythms in vertebrates. Yet little is known about the significance of these interactions during simultaneous exposure to chemicals and hypoxia in fish in vivo. We exposed wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to diclofenac (1 mu g/L, 14 days), hypoxia (2.0 mg/L, up to 24 h) and the combination of both. We then analyzed markers of chemical biotransformation (EROD activity, cyp1a and ahr mRNA levels), glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity, ldh and enolase la mRNA levels), and the transcription of core circadian clock genes clock and period 1 in liver tissue. Samples were taken at three time points during the light period in order to address disturbances in the circadian variation of metabolic processes. The results show that mRNA levels and LDH activity tended to be lowest before the dark period, but this pattern was disturbed by hypoxia and diclofenac. Diclofenac and hypoxia co-exposure induced EROD activity more strongly than diclofenac exposure alone, while cypla mRNA level was increased also by hypoxia and diclofenac alone. LDH activity and mRNA expression showed a clear time-dependent response during hypoxia, which is consistent with the previously suggested decreased accumulation of HIF-1 during the dark period. Furthermore, LDH activity and transcription was disturbed by diclofenac, indicating important effects of environmental pollutants in disturbing natural acclimation. This study demonstrates the need for more studies to understand the potential disturbances in endogenous rhythms caused by environmental pollution in natural populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A recent surge in the use and abuse of diverse prescribed psychotic and illicit drugs necessitates the surveillance of drug residues in source water and the associated ecological impacts of chronic exposure to the aquatic organism. Thirty-six psychotic and illicit drug residues were determined in discharged wastewater from two centralized municipal wastewater treatment facilities and two wastewater receiving creeks for seven consecutive days in Kentucky. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae were exposed to the environmental relevant mixtures of all drug residues, all illicit drugs, and all prescribed psychotic drugs. The extracted RNA from fish homogenates was sequenced, and differentially expressed sequences were analyzed for known or predicted nervous system expression, and screened annotated protein-coding genes to the true environmental cocktail mixture. Illicit stimulant (cocaine and one metabo-lite), opioids (methadone, methadone metabolite, and oxycodone), hallucinogen (MDA), benzodiazepine (oxazepam and temazepam), carbamazepine, and all target selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including sertraline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, and citalopram were quantified in 100% of collected samples from both creeks. The high dose cocktail mixture exposure group revealed the largest group of differ-entially expressed genes: 100 upregulated and 77 downregulated (p < 0.05; q < 0.05). The top 20 differentially expressed sequences in each exposure group comprise 82 unique transcripts corresponding to 74% annotated genes, 7% non-coding sequences, and 19% uncharacterized sequences. Among 61 differentially expressed sequences that corresponded to annotated protein-coding genes, 23 (38%) genes or their homologs are known to be expressed in the nervous system of fish or other organisms. Several of the differentially expressed sequences are associated primarily with the immune system, including several major histocompatibility complex class I and interferon-induced proteins. Interleukin-1 beta (downregulated in this study) abnormalities are considered a risk factor for psychosis. This is the first study to assess the contributions of multiple classes of psychotic and illicit drugs in combination with developmental gene expression.

AB Two full-scale biological nutrient removal systems upgraded with three physico-chemical processes (coagulation, chemical precipitation, and neutral Fenton) were evaluated in order to determine the removal of emerging pollutants (EPs) present in municipal wastewater from Mexico. Between 41 and 55 EPs were detected in the influents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), including personal care products (PPCPs), antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics, antihypertensives, antiseptics, stimulants, and hormones. Emerging pollutants were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.69 ng/L to 94,600 ng/L. High concentrations of emerging pollutants were found during dry season. WWTP 1, integrated by oxidation ditches and UV light lamps, showed removal efficiencies of EPs between 20% and 22%. On the other hand, WWTP 2 consisted of anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic tanks coupled with two disinfection processes; chlorine dioxide and UV light lamps, for which the removal of EPs was significant (up to 80%). The concentrations of emerging pollutants in WWTP 1 effluent was found within a range < limit of quantification (LOQ) to 3770 ng/L. For WWTP 2, the concentrations of the emerging pollutants in the effluent were below 210 ng/L WWTP 2 showed high emerging pollutant removals, compared to those of WWTP 1, due to a greater activity of the simultaneous nitrification-denitrification process: es, hydraulic retention time, and solids retention time. The compounds that were more persistent with removals below 50% in both effluents were: carbamazepine, dehydronifedipine, meprobamate, sertraline, propranolol, propoxyphene, norverapamil, diazepam, alprazolam, sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, fluoxetine, erythromycin-H2O, diphenhydramine, dehydronifedipine, clarithromycin, hydrochlorothiazide, and albuterol. The application of neutral Fenton reaction as post-treatment for the two effluents from the WWTPs is promising for the removal of emerging pollutants (up to 100%) and for assuring high quality of treated water.

AB This study includes an environmental analysis of a membrane bioreactor (MBR), the objective being to quantitatively define the inventory of the resources consumed and estimate the emissions produced during its construction, operation and end-of-life deconstruction. The environmental analysis was done by the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, in order to establish with a broad perspective and in a rigorous and objective way the environmental footprint and the main environmental hotspots of the examined technology. Raw materials, equipment, transportation, energy use, as well as air- and waterborne emissions were quantified using as a functional unit, 1 m(3) of urban wastewater. SimaPro 8.0.3.14 was used as the LCA analysis tool, and two impact assessment methods, i.e. IPCC 2013 version 1.00 and ReCiPe version 1.10, were employed. The main environmental hotspots of the MBR pilot unit were identified to be the following: (i) the energy demand, which is by far the most crucial parameter that affects the sustainability of the whole process, and (ii) the material of the membrane units. Overall, the MBR technology was found to be a sustainable solution for urban wastewater treatment, with the construction phase having a minimal environmental impact, compared to the operational phase. Moreover, several alternative scenarios and areas of potential improvement, such as the diversification of the electricity mix and the material of the membrane units, were examined, in order to minimize as much as possible the overall environmental footprint of this MBR system. It was shown that the energy mix can significantly affect the overall sustainability of the MBR pilot unit (i.e. up to 95% reduction of the total greenhouse gas emissions was achieved with the use of an environmentally friendly energy mix), and the contribution of the construction and operational phase to the overall environmental footprint of the system.

AB The use of marginal water, such as reclaimed wastewater or effluent, for irrigation can reduce the pressure on existing freshwater resources. However, this can cause contaminants to accumulate in compartments such as the soil, crop, air, surface- and groundwater, which may harm the public health and the environment. Environmental quality standards for these compartments are generally considered separately. However, the compartments are related to each other by the fluxes between them, and the concept of sustainability should hold for all compartments simultaneously. An integrated approach is therefore required for the sustainability assessment of irrigation with marginal water. Since such an approach has not been provided yet, we develop an integrated framework in this study. We provide sustainability indicators by comparing the long-term contaminant concentration and fluxes with quality standards for each environmental compartment. These indicators give comprehensible information on which contaminants will cause problems, which environmental compartments are threatened, and on what timescale this will occur. This allows for the prioritization of mitigation and preventive measures for better sustainability management. We illustrate the use of the framework by means of a case study.

AB This research provides a baseline tool to detect, predict and scientifically evaluate the toxic environmental impact generated by chemical substances that are categorized as emerging contaminants (ECs) with endocrine disruptive action. The present study was carried out in five effluents of wastewater produced by urban and rural settlements of the coastal zone of Cihuatlan, Jalisco. Five compounds, considered ECs and that act as endocrine disruptors, were analyzed: Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, Pentachlorophenol (PCP), and Estradiol. The toxicity level (TEQ) of the ECs is estimated by a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis, evaluating their concentration and assessing the risk involved in the incorporation of each one into the environment. The presence of the ECs was confirmed in all the studied sites. It was attested that the concentrations of pollutants Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, and Pentachlorophenol were within the toxic range, whereas the compound Estradiol was found in concentrations that represent a high toxicity in the same effluents. This research recognizes that the analysis of the physicochemical properties of substances allows for predicting whether a contaminant is likely to act and persist in the environment and, in turn, bioaccumulate in organisms.

AB A waste load allocation method was developed for industrial wastewater management based on unfairness factors, an industrial allocation factor and pollution reduction discounts. Three unfairness factors were defined to assess the relative efficiencies of energy consumption, pollution discharge and waste treatment costs for different industries. The overall effect of these factors was described by an industrial allocation factor. Based on the values of these factors, industries were classified into three types, after which waste load allocation proportions among different industries were determined using different pollution reduction discounts. This waste load allocation method was then applied in the Zhangweinan Watershed, which is one of the most seriously polluted watersheds in northern China. The results revealed that extractive, mechanical and food industries comprise the type I industries, which had the lowest pollution reduction discounts of 0, 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. The metallurgical industry and other industries were characterized as type II and discounts of 0.5 and 0.6 were given to their primary reductions. Textile, pharmaceutical, oil and pyrogenic, chemical and paper industries were classified as type III industries and had a waste load reduction of more than 80% of the pollution discharge in 2004.

AB Pharmaceutical industry effluents are complex and highly variable in time. Assessing the efficiency of a pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the resulting decrease in effluent toxicity and ecological risk is thus not straightforward. We set up an original in situ pilot directly connected to a pharmaceutical WWTP to monitor the chronic toxicity of successive effluents using natural periphytic biofilms. Their structural and functional responses to effluent exposure were assessed by combining (i) a molecular approach to characterize the bacterial and diatom diversity and (ii) functional measurements of photosynthetic and enzyme activities. Effluent contamination by pharmaceuticals strongly decreased after the quaternary treatment (activated carbon). Most of the structural biological characteristics improved with cumulative WWTP treatment (bacterial diversity, microbial genetic structure, and biological diatom index), showing community recovery along the treatment process. However, functional parameters did not show clear links with treatment steps, suggesting that microbial activities were not solely driven by pharmaceuticals produced during the experimental period. Operationally, this type of pilot system offers a useful tool for biomonitoring approaches and offers new approaches for industrial managers to assess the ecological risk of production effluents in receiving water.

AB This study aims to address organic micropollutants in secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by first identification of micropollutants in different treatment units, and second by evaluating an advanced treatment process for removals of micropollutants. In secondary effluents, 28 types of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), 5 types of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 3 types of odorous compounds are detected with total concentrations of 513 +/- 57.8 ng/L, 991 +/- 36.5 ng/L, 553 +/- 48.3 ng/ L, respectively. An integrated process consisting of in-situ ozonation, ceramic membrane filtration (CMF) and biological active carbon (BAC) filtration is investigated in a pilot scale (1000 m(3)/d) for removal of micro pollutants in secondary effluents. The total removal efficiencies of PPCPs, EDCs and odorous compounds are 98.5%, 95.4%, and 91.1%, respectively. Removal mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and odorous compounds are discussed based on their physicochemical properties. The remarkable removal efficiencies of micropollutants by the pilot system is attributed to synergistic effects of combining ozonation, ceramic membrane filtration and BAC filtration. This study provides a cost-effective and robust technology with the capability of treating secondary effluents for reuse applications.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation is an attractive advanced oxidation process for wastewater treatment, but highly active catalysts with strong response to visible light are urgently needed to push forward its practical application. In this study, a hierarchical biomimetic monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with leaves morphology was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and employed as catalyst for oxalic acid and penicillin degradation in photocatalytic ozonation. The results show that the organics degradation was more efficient using leaves shaped BiVO4 as catalyst than the bulk shaped one in photocatalytic ozonation and the synergy index is ranged from 2.8 to 3.3, indicating a superior positive synergistic effect between photocatalysis and ozonation. The higher activity of the leaves shaped BiVO4 was probably attributed to the distinctive biomimetic morphology and preferable band structure with more negative CB potential. Mechanism studies suggested that the main reactive species were h(+) and center dot OH for the degradation of persistent oxalic acid in photocatalytic ozonation. In addition, the effect of ozone concentration and inorganic ions and reusability of the material were also intensively investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent organic matter (EfOM) including micropollutants present in the concentrate streams generated from reverse osmosis (RO) based municipal wastewater reclamation processes entails environmental and health risks on its disposal to the receiving environment. The suitability of a biological activated carbon (BAC) process to treat municipal wastewater RO concentrate was evaluated at lab scale during 320 days of operation. BAC alone and combined UV/H2O2 BAC and ozone BAC were performed. The combination of both advanced oxidation processes with the BAC filter improved considerably the water quality parameters. Overall eliminations for dissolved organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm ranged between 50-66%, 48-66% and 73-87%, respectively, improving considerably the removals obtained without pretreatment step (28%, 19% and 37%, respectively). Moreover, although some pharmaceuticals were partially removed by the BAC filter, the integration of the UV/H2O2 or the ozone step was necessary to achieve the total removal of those micropollutants. Finally, biomass assessment techniques allowed determining the diversity of different BAC filter scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel method was developed to measure acidic and basic drugs in biological and wastewater samples. The method used magnetic nanoparticles based on Vortex-Assisted Dispersive Micro-Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and then identifying with HPLC-UV. The magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4@SiO2@Kit-6@NH2) has been used as an efficient adsorbent for the extraction of acidic and basic drugs ibuprofen (IFB), fenoprofen calcium (FPC), methocarbamol (MTC), and clonazepam (CZP). The magnetic nanoparticle was characterized by techniques including SEM, XRD, EDX, and FT-IR. The effect of various parameters in the V-D-mu-SPE method was studied completely through the design of the response surface methodology (RSM) of the Box-Behnken design (BBD) based response method and the utility function. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized including sample pH, adsorbent amount, absorption time, the salt concentration in the sample solution, CTAB of concentration, desorption time, and the volume of an eluent. After optimization, the limit of detection and calibration curve in the linear range were obtained 0.062-0.32 mu g L-1 and 0.1-800 mu g L-1, respectively. Its linear correlation was R-2 > 0.9951. The relative standard deviation (n = 5) was between 2.4% and 5.1%. Finally, this method was used to determine target analytes in human serum, urine, and wastewater.

AB Micropollutants of emerging concern such as pharmaceuticals can significantly affect the performance of secondary biological processes in wastewater treatment plants. The present study is aimed to evaluate the toxicity and inhibition of three pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) on two cultures of microbial consortia enriched from wastewater aerobic activated sludge. One of them was acclimated to pharmaceuticals and the other was non-acclimated as control bioassay. The toxic and inhibitory effects on these cultures were assessed by respirometric tests through the oxygen uptake rate as an indicator of their capacity to degrade a readily available carbon source. Higher values of toxicity and inhibition of pharmaceutical compounds were observed for the control culture as compared to the acclimated one. Sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine exhibited higher toxicity and inhibition effects than caffeine in both acclimated and control cultures. The microbial diversity of the two cultures was also studied. The composition of microbial community of acclimated and control cultures, was determined by targeting the 165 ribosomal RNA gene. It was observed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, with Gammaproteobacteria dominating both cultures. Control culture was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and mostly by the genera Pseudomonas and Sodatis, which belong to common families present in wastewater. Results suggested that the acclimated culture to the three pharmaceuticals was mostly comprised of the extremely multiresistant genera Escherichia-Shigella (38%) of Gammaproteobacteria, resulting to higher resistance as compared to the control culture (Escherichia-Shigella, 7%). Finally, the microbial structure of the microorganisms present in a real bioreactor, which was initially seeded with the acclimated culture and fed in a continuous mode with the selected pharmaceuticals, was also analyzed. The continuous loading of pharmaceuticals in the bioreactor affected its microbial diversity, leading to the dominance of wetaproteobacteria and to the resistant genus Rhizobium of Alphaproteobacteria.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of eleven selected organic micropollutants (OMPs) occurring in municipal wastewater in a 1-100 mu g L-1 concentration range during the treatment in two( planted and unplanted) pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in order to elucidate (i) the role of plants on the mass removal and (ii) to understand the removal behavior of the micropollutants at different sampling locations along the flow path. The research was conducted in Langenreichenbach (Saxony), Germany, over a period of one year. The high organic load was chosen for both constructed wetlands (CWs) to study the removal of OMPs, because it is often occurring in the "real" world, but seldom investigated as a research objective.
   The concentration of the OMPs in the treated inflow wastewater varied more strongly (by a factor of 10) than the total organic and nitrogen loads (by a factor of 4). A wide range of removal efficiencies were found. Higher removals were observed in the pilot-scale CW planted with Phragmites australis than in the unplanted one. The stimulant caffeine was the investigated OMP which showed the highest removal with an average efficiency of 66%. The average removal efficiency of the other OMPs was below 30%. The plants in the CWs supported not only the removal of the fragrances galaxolide and tonalide but also the removal of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, even under the conditions of high organic load. The endocrine disruptors bisphenol A and nonylphenol, and the antibacterial triclosan showed on average the lowest removal efficiencies. Under the studied operating conditions of high load, a positive correlation between the internal removal behavior of naproxen and diclofenac and concentration of sulfide was found.

AB CoP nanoparticle-loaded N-doped graphitic C3N4 nanosheets (CoP/N-g-C3N4) were fabricated via a facile three-step method to degrade pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) via a visible-light-driven (VLD) peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation system. 2 ppm carbamazepine (CBZ) can be removed completely within 10 min by the VLD-PMS system with a kinetic constant of k = 0.29128 min(-1), as 25.8 times compared to that under dark conditions (k = 0.01128 min(-1)). The experimental and theoretical results showed that the doped graphitic N atoms could modulate the electronic properties of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. Subsequently, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) explained that CoP showed preference to bonding with the nitrogen atoms involved in the newly formed (NN)-N-= bond, and the Co-N bond dramatically enhanced the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the N-g-C3N4 nanosheets. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests show that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) plays a leading role in this case. Moreover, PMS molecules are also tended to be absorbed onto the electron-deficient carbon atoms near the newly formed (NN)-N-= bonds for PMS reduction, synergistically enhancing the degradation efficiency for CBZ and benzophenone-3 (BZP). The newly established VLD-PMS activation system was shown to treat the actual sewage in Hong Kong sewage treatment plants (STPs) very well. This work supplements the fundamental theory of radical and non-radical pathways in the sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation process (SR-AOP) for environmental cleanup purposes.

AB Diclofenac has been of environmental concern due to the potential harmful effects on non-target organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, we evaluated the transformation kinetics of diclofenac and its two major metabolites in two laboratory-scale experiments: the transformation of diclofenac in the presence of rat liver S9 fraction with co-factors, and the transformation of diclofenac, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac and diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide in the inoculum used for the OECD 301C ready-biodegradability test. 4'-Hydroxy-diclofenac was identified as the major phase I metabolite and diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide was identified as the major phase II metabolite in the S9 assay. Transformation of diclofenac in the microbial degradation test did not occur significantly for 28 d, whereas 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac degraded slowly, indicating that the biological removal of diclofenac is not likely to occur in conventional STPs unless sorptive removal is significant. However, diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide deconjugated to form equimolar diclofenac within 7 d, in the microbial degradation test. The mixture of diclofenac and its two metabolites, formed after incubating diclofenac in S9 medium for 2 h, was spiked in the inoculum to link both assays. The concentrations of diclofenac and its metabolites, measured over time, agreed well with predicted values, using rate parameters obtained from independent experiments. The results show that phase II metabolites generated in mammals may deconjugate easily in conventional STPs to form a parent compound and that these processes should be considered during the environmental monitoring and risk assessment of diclofenac.

AB Fragrances such as OTNE (marketed as lso-E-Super (R)) and bactericides such as triclosan (marketed as lgrasan) are present in waste water and thus finally sorbed to sewage sludge. With that sludge they can reach agricultural fields where they potentially can undergo photodegradation processes. In this study the photodegradation of OTNE and triclosan on dried loamy sand was measured under artificial sunlight conditions in laboratory experiments. These compounds were artificially added with concentrations of 1 mu g g(-1) on pre-rinsed dried loamy sand. The decrease in concentration with light irradiation was measured for 32 d in comparison to soil samples without light irradiation. The estimated light source intensity was 27 W m(-2). Within the experiment, the apparent half-life was 7 and 17 d for OTNE and triclosan respectively. The decrease did not simply follow first-order kinetics. The apparent rate constant decreased in the latter stage of reaction, suggesting that part of the chemicals were inaccessible for degradation. Two models, i.e., a diffusion-limited model, and a light penetration-limited model, were used in comparison to the measured data to explain the observed degradation limitations in the latter stages of the experiments. Comparing the hereby obtained model parameters with estimated physico-chemical parameters for the soil and the two chemical compounds, the light penetration-limited model, in which the degradation in the soil surface layer is assumed to be limited due to the shading effect of light in the upper thin soil layer, showed to be the most realistic in describing the photodegradation.

AB The removal of 4 typical pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in sewage sludge, i.e. diclofenac (DCF), clofibric acid (CFA), carbamazepine (CBM), and triclosan (TCS), was evaluated during 3 integrated processes of anaerobic digestions (ADs). The integrated processes included ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses (MEADS), ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses together with ultrasonic irradiation pre-treatment (MEUADs), and ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses together with mechanical rotary disc post-treatment (MEADRDs). The SRTs were set at 15 d. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) following solid-phase extraction was used to analyze and detect the target compounds. Under the mesophilic condition, the highest removal during MEAD and MEUAD was 67.6% and 77.1% of CFA, and 78.1% of CBZ during MEADRD. There was little differences between the removals of 4 PhAC5 during MEADRD, and all the removal rates were higher than 70%. Especially the removal of DCF increased from 40.6% during MEAD to 71.7% during MEADRD. The overall removal during MEADRD was highest with the increase by about 20.9% from that during MEAD. The highest removal during MEAD, MEUAD and MEADRD was 81.1%, 70.7% and 71.8%, respectively, of CFA under the thermophilic condition. MEADRD could realize the highest overall removal, up to 69.4% with the increase by 11.0% compared with MEUAD. The results showed that the integrated process, MEADRD, under both mesophilic and thermophilic condition was suitable for the effective removal of PhACs, and MEADRD under the mesophilic condition was a preferable choice from the energy-saving perspective.

AB The goal of this study was to assess the bioavailable concentrations of analgesics, psycholeptics, antidepressants and illicit drugs in the surface waters of the Czech Republic. All of the sampling sites are located within the most important water quality monitoring profiles at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. The total concentrations of the compounds ranged from 463 to 6447 ng POCIS-1 (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler). Carbamazepine (196-2690 ng POCIS-1) and tramadol (160-2250 ng POCIS-1) were the most abundant compounds at every site. The most polluted sites were those that received communal wastewater effluent and had a low dilution factor (ratio of wastewater effluent and river flow). The aqueous concentrations of the target compounds were estimated using sampling rate values obtained during a field calibration experiment. Patterns in the aqueous concentrations of the compounds (after back calculation from POCIS extracts) and the POCIS concentrations are different, possibly leading to discrepancies between the toxicity assessments conducted using POCIS extracts and those conducted using grab samples of water from the same location.

AB In the last years many papers have reported about the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in the surface waters and their undesirable effects upon the aquatic life. Most of pharmaceuticals pass through the wastewater treatment plants unchanged because they are biorefractory compounds and as a result they enter the water bodies. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals effluents (PhEs) before their discharge in the sewerage systems. The aim of this paper was the use of Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA) to improve the biodegradability of PhE containing diclofenac (DCF) as pharmaceutically active compound. The refractory character of PhE was found based on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio (R) value of 0.05. The DSA electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition of the appropriate precursors and had the composition Ti/RuO2-TiO2. Besides electrochemical experiments, photoassisted electrochemical, and combined photocatalytic and electrochemical experiments were carried out. The three DSA-based methods were effective for the biodegradability improvement of the PhE. The best result for R was 0.62, which was obtained for the combined photocatalytic and electrochemical method. These promising results regarding the biodegradability improvement of PhE should constitute the base for future detailed researches involving the DSA use for the wastewater treatment.

AB Azo dyes constitute the largest and most versatile class of synthetic dyes used in the textile, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries and represent major components in wastewater from these industrial dying processes. Biological decolorization of azo dyes occurs efficiently under low oxygen to anaerobic conditions. However, this process results in the formation of toxic and carcinogenic amines that are resistant to further detoxification under low oxygen conditions. Moreover, the ability to detoxify these amines under aerobic conditions is not a wide spread metabolic activity. In this study we describe the use of Brevibacterium sp. strain VN-15, isolated from an activated sludge process of a textile company, for the sequential decolorization and detoxification of the azo dyes Reactive Yellow 107 (RY107), Reactive Black 5 (RB5), Reactive Red 198 (RR198) and Direct Blue 71 (DB71). Tyrosinase activity was observed during the biotreatment process suggesting the role of this enzyme in the decolorization and degradation process, but no-activity was observed for laccase and peroxidase. Toxicity, measured using Daphnia magna, was completely eliminated.

AB BACKGROUND In the recent years, photocatalytic membrane process has gained interest in wastewater treatment applications. In this study, the ability of advanced oxidation technology coupled membrane process was evaluated during chloramphenicol (CAP) filtration. Titanium dioxide doped hydroxyapatite (TiO2-HAP) based photocatalytic membrane for chloramphenicol (CAP) degradation was investigated. The TiO2-HAP photocatalyst was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal technique and characterized by the transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and FTIR spectroscopy. Varying concentrations of TiO2-HAP photocatalyst incorporated polysulfone (PSf) membranes were fabricated to enhance the photocatalytic activity and antifouling propensity. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2-HAP incorporated PSf membranes was evaluated by a low-pressure cross-flow lab-scale photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) for degradation of chloramphenicol in water. These results were compared with pristine PSf membrane.
   RESULTS The degradation of chloramphenicol was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The photocatalytic degradation experiments revealed that the highest degradation of 61.59% was observed for the PSf/4 wt% TiO2-HAP nanocomposite membrane.
   CONCLUSION This study highlights the advantages of applying the photocatalytic TiO2-HAP incorporated PSf composite membranes for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment applications. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis can be a suitable add-on process to conventional wastewater treatment methods aiming to the full degradation of emerging contaminants contributing to water pollution. This work examines the photo-degradation of two frequently detected emerging contaminants (caffeine and salicylic acid) using titanium dioxide nanotubular films (TNTs) so as commercial TiO2 nanoparticulate films (Evonik P25) for comparison. The TNT films were prepared by electrochemical anodization of titanium metal and reached lengths of 20 pm, with a high growth rate (10 mu m/h). They present an open porous structure with large specific surface area suitable for efficient adsorption of the contaminants and formation of a large number of photocatalytic active sites. After calcination at 450 degrees C, TNT films obtain the anatase crystal structure, absorb well in the UV range and present significant photocatalytic activity with high degradation rates for both examined emerging pollutants. Furthermore, they present small variability of their photocatalytic efficiency in a big range of the solutions pH values and under consecutive photocatalytic cycles, rendering them suitable at various wastewater treatment conditions.

DE microbial fuel cell; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen limitation
ID ELECTRICITY; GROWTH
AB We describe the operation of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) system operating on a synthetic wastewater (acetic acid), under conditions of increasing nitrogen limitation. Two MFCs were operated under feed conditions which spanned a range of TKN/COD values of 1.6-28 mg/g. Stable operation was observed in all cases, even when no ammoniacal nitrogen was added to the cell. Improved electrochemical performance (measured as power density, W/m(2)) was observed as nitrogen limitation was imposed on the cells. Even with no ammonium addition, continuous function of the cell was maintained, at levels consistent with operation at balanced nutrient supplementation. The work has implicated biological nitrogen fixation as a potential source of nitrogen within the MFC. Whilst this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed, the work highlights the opportunity for continuous operation of microbial fuel cells utilising wastewaters with extremely low nitrogen levels, present in pulp and paper, pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries. Further, the described increases in some of the electrochemical indices (e. g. power density) under application of nitrogen limitation may provide a new approach to increasing fuel cell performance. Finally, the lack of any need to add supplemental nitrogen to a MFC-based wastewater treatment technology holds potential for significant financial and environmental savings.

AB In this study, co-precipitation was used to prepare Fe3O4 magnetic powder activated carbon (PAC) (Fe3O4-PAC) and MnFe2O4 magnetic PAC (MnFe2O4-PAC) for the in-depth treatment of glyphosate pesticide wastewater. Magnetic adsorbent characterization results indicate that MnFe2O4 was successfully loaded on the activated carbon powder. Adsorption experiment results show that the maximum adsorption capacity of MnFe2O4-PAC for glyphosate is two to three times that of the original PAC. The adsorption of glyphosate by using magnetic PAC conforms to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adsorption kinetics is consistent with the quasi-second adsorption kinetic model. The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4-PAC and MnFe2O4-PAC showed the same trend effect with the change in pH, temperature, and adsorbent dosage. The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4-PAC and MnFe2O4-PAC for glyphosate decreased with the increase in pH and magnetic PAC and rises with temperature. Regeneration experiment results showed that the order of the regeneration method of MnFe2O4-PAC is: microwave combined Fenton reagent regeneration > wet microwave regeneration > microwave combined hydrogen peroxide regeneration. MnFe2O4-PAC after regeneration still exhibited good magnetic properties and adsorption capacity.

Under such conditions, losartan was eliminated in a higher percentage than valsartan, which was associated to differences in their hydrophobicities. Additionally, degradations in presence of isopropanol and ferrous ions confirmed that losartan was closer to cavitation bubble than valsartan. The structures of primary products indicated that sonogenerated hydroxyl radical attacked biphenyl tetrazole moiety (common nucleus of both pharmaceuticals). Then, theoretical calculations were applied to the products to estimate the toxicity, degree of oxidation and probable routes of aerobic biodegradation suggesting a beneficial action of sonodegradation. Finally, the sonochemical degradation of the antihypertensives was carried out in two simulated complex matrices (i.e., seawater and hospital wastewater) and an actual wastewater. Interestingly, the losartan and valsartan eliminations in such waters were similar to the observed in distilled water. This fact indicates the high potentiality of ultrasound to degrade losartan or valsartan in waters containing other substances, even at higher concentrations than these pollutants.

AB The economic crisis plaguing Greece was expected to impact consumption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs a priori to an unknown extent. We quantified the change of use for various classes of licit and illicit drugs by monitoring Athens' wastewater from 2010 to 2014. A high increase in the use of psychoactive drugs was detected between 2010 and 2014, especially for antipsychotics (35-fold), benzodiazepines (19-fold), and antidepressants (11-fold). This directly reflects the perceived increase of incidences associated with mental illnesses in the population, as a consequence of severe socioeconomic changes. Other therapeutic classes, like antiepileptics, hypertensives, and gastric and ulcer drugs also showed an increase in use (from 2-fold increase for antiepileptics to 13-fold for hypertensives). In contrast, the overall use of antibiotics and NSAIDs decreased. For mefenamic acid, an almost 28-fold decrease was observed. This finding is likely related to the reduction in drug expenditure applied in public health. A 2-fold increase of methamphetamine use was detected, associated with a cheap street drug called "sisa" (related to marginal conducts), which is a health concern. MDMA (5-fold) and methadone (7-fold) use showed also an increase, while cocaine and cannabis estimates did not show a clear trend.

AB Land application of municipal biosolids (sewage) is a common farming practice in many parts of the world. There is potential for transport of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from agricultural fields to adjacent surface waters via tile drainage systems. In this study, liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) (total solids=11,933 mg L-1), supplemented with selected PPCPs and the fluorescent dye tracer rhodamine WT (RWT), were applied to tile drained fields using two land application approaches. Objectives included evaluating the relative benefits of land application practices with respect to reducing PPCP loadings to tile drains, evaluating PPCP persistence in tile water, and determining whether rhodamine WT can be used to estimate PPCP mass loads in tile. The PPCPs examined included an antibacterial agent used in personal care products (triclosan), a metabolite of nicotine (cotinine), and a variety of drugs including two sulfonamide antimicrobials (sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole), a beta-blocker (atenolol), an anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), an antidepressant (fluoxetine), analgesic/anti-inflammatories (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen), and a lipid-regulator (gemfibrozil). Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in the spiked LMB were about 10(3) ng g(-1) dry weight. PPCPs were shown to move rapidly via soil macropores to tile drains within minutes of the land application. Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in tile effluent associated with the LMB application-induced tile flow event were similar to 10(1) to 10(3) ng L-1. PPCP mass loads, for the application-induced tile-hydrograph event, were significantly (p <0.1) higher for surface spreading over non-tilled soil (incorporation tillage occurring 20 h post-application), relative to aerating soil immediately prior to surface spreading using an AerWay (R) slurry deposition system. PPCP concentrations that were detected above the Emit of quantitation (LOQ) in tile water during several precipitation-induced tile flow events that occurred post-application, included: triclosan (max. similar to 1.5 x 10(2) ng L-1), carbamazepine (max. similar to 7 x 10(1) ng L-1), atenolol (max similar to 4 x 10(1) ng L-1), and cotinine (max similar to 2 x 10(1) ng L-1). In spite of their presence in biosolids, the other PPCPs were not observed above LOQ concentrations during these events. PPCP concentrations were predicted from RWT concentrations over a 40 day study period. Tile mass loads as a percent of PPCP mass applied to soil ranged from 4.2% +/- SD of 9.2% to 7.1% +/- 10.9% for the AerWay (R) system and surface spreading plus incorporation treatments, respectively.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belongs to one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical residues in the environment. Little is known on the interactions of DCF as well as its major biodegradation metabolites 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF with chemical compounds found in wastewater, including antibiotics such as ampicillin and kanamycin. In the present work we examined the potential interactions between DCF, its metabolites 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF and ampicyllin and kanamycin. We also measured the effect of the mixture of DCF with natural compound - amygdalin. We evaluated the following parameters: E. coli K-12 cells viability, growth inhibition of E. coli K-12 culture, genotoxicity, oxidative stress parameters: sodA promoter induction and ROS generation. The reactivity of E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strain in waste-waters matrices contaminated with DCF and kanamycin was also monitored. Obtained results indicated that used antibiotics (ampicyllin, kanamycin) enhanced the toxic effect of DCF used individually and in the mixtures with its metabolites 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF toward E. coli. Similar effect was also obtained in genotoxicity assay. The oxidative stress assays revealed that the highest level of ROS generation and sodA promoter induction were obtained also for the mixtures of DCF, its metabolites with antibiotics. It was also showed that amygdalin influenced the activity of DCF and its biodegradation metabolites. The strongest luminescence response of E. coli SM biosensor strain with recA:luxCDABE genetic construct in filtered treated wastewaters, comparable to control sample was noticed. Obtained results showed that DCF and its biodegradation metabolites 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF can interact with tested antibiotics and compounds of natural origin, i.e. amygdalin to form mixtures showing stronger antimicrobial activity against E. coli than parent chemicals. Moreover the assays in wastewater matrices revealed that E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strains is a good tool for bacteria monitoring in wastewater environments.

AB A new analytical method has been developed for the screening, evaluation and determination of sub mu g/L concentrations of chlorinated chemicals in environmental waters. Ten different compounds included in the European water policy have been considered and determined by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) followed by liquid desorption and negative chemical ionization gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (SBSE-LD-NCI-GC-QqQ-MS). Analyte extraction was performed using SBSE with 100mL sample volume, 5% MeOH, 10% NaCl and an extraction time of 14h of mechanized stirring, which provided best analytical recoveries. Desorption of analytes was carried out using 5mL acetonitrile (ACN) and 5min of two successive sonication steps which resulted best performance without any carry over. The method detection limits (MDL) ranged 3-22ng/L and 7-29ng/L for river waters and wastewaters respectively. The experimental recoveries for all compounds were>60% with<20% deviation in the reproducibility. Pentachloroanisole alone reported a low maximum recovery of 54% under given conditions. Matrix influenced signal enhancement was observed more in case of triclosan, which was managed by using matrix matched calibration standards apart from using double helix injection liner. This method was applied to the analysis of different river waters and wastewater effluent samples collected from Alcala de Henares, Spain. Four compounds namely chloropyriphos-ethyl, triclosan, -endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate were positively identified in river waters and three compounds viz., chloropyriphos-ethyl, -endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate were detected in wastewater effluents. The concentrations of -endosulfan ranged between 11.3-22.9ng/L and 16.3-33.8ng/L in river waters and wastewaters respectively. Almost 40% of the water samples analysed showed much higher concentrations of -endosulfan than prescribed European environmental quality standard limit for surface waters of 5 ng/L.

AB This study investigated the competitive adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals (i.e., naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen) toward the pristine and NaOH-activated biochars from spent coffee wastes (SCW) in lake water and wastewater effluent. The kinetic and isotherm studies revealed that the improved physicochemical characteristics and physically homogenized surfaces of the pristine SCW biochar through the chemical activation with NaOH were beneficial to the adsorption of pharmaceuticals (competitive equilibrium adsorption capacity (Q(e, exp)): NaOH-activated SCW biochar (61.25 -192.07 mu mol/g) > pristine SCW biochar (14.81-20.65 mu mol/g)). The adsorptive removal of naproxen (Q(e,) (exp) = 14.81-18.81 mu mol/g), diclofenac (Q(e, exp) = 15.73-20.00 mu mol/g), and ibuprofen (Q(e, exp) = 16.20 -20.65 mu mol/g) for the pristine SCW biochar showed linear correlations with their hydrophobicity (log D at pH 7.0: ibuprofen (1.71) > diclofenac (1.37) > naproxen (0.25)). However, their Q(e, exp) values for the NaOH-activated SCW biochar (naproxen (176.39-192.07 mu mol/g) > diclofenac (78.44-98.74 mu mol/g) > ibuprofen (61.25-80.02 mmol/g)) were inversely correlated to the order of their log D values. These results suggest that the reinforced aromatic structure of the NaOH-activated SCW biochar facilitated the pi-pi interaction. The calculated thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the competitive adsorption of pharmaceuticals on the NaOH-activated SCW biochar compared to pristine SCW biochar occurred more spontaneously over the entire pH (5.0-11.0) and ionic strength (NaCl: 0-0.125 M) ranges. These observations imply that the NaOH-activated SCW biochar might be potentially applicable for the removal of pharmaceuticals in lake water and wastewater effluent. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, photocatalysts made of Cu-TiO2@functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes were prepared via a newly developed two-step (sol-gel/hydrothermal) process for the catalytic decomposition of sulfamethazine under natural solar irradiation. The properties of the photocatalysts were studied using BET, PL, FT-IR, XRD, TEM, TGA, FESEM, EDS, Raman, DRS, EIS, EDX and SAED tests. The TEM and FESEM images revealed a uniform distribution of Cu-doped TiO2 particles on the surface of the SWCNTs. The EIS and PL analysis indicated that photo-induced electrons were trapped by the SWCNTs and/or Cu oxidation states, which reduced electron-hole recombination. Photodecontamination was performed in a batch reactor, and the investigation of influencing factors indicated that sulfamethazine could be completely degraded at a Cu content of 4%, SWCNT content of 10%, pH of 7, catalyst loading of 0.9 g/L, and initial sulfamethazine concentration of 30 mg/L after 135 min solar irradiation. Kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo first-order kinetic model best fit the degradation of sulfamethazine under selected conditions. Trapping experiments indicated that O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot reactive radicals, rather than h(+), were accountable for the decontamination process. The efficiency with which sulfamethazine was removed was evaluated in the presence of co-existing anions. The results revealed that the removal rate was considerably reduced by the addition of sulfate or chloride anions but only slightly reduced by the addition of phosphate or nitrate anions. A tentative mechanism and pathway for sulfamethazine degradation were formulated. The synthesized photocatalysts could be reused after five consecutive cycles of photodecontamination but with a slight reduction in removal rate (approximately 7%). An experiment involving pharmaceutical wastewater showed that photocatalytic decontamination eliminated 59.3% of TOC and 74.6% of COD after 390 min of solar irradiation.

AB Air and precipitation samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other commercial chemicals within the St. Paul/Minneapolis metropolitan area of Minnesota, U.S. Of the 126 chemicals analyzed, 17 were detected at least once. Bisphenol A, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and cocaine were the most frequently detected; their maximum concentrations in snow were 3.80, 9.49, and 0.171 ng/L and in air were 0.137, 0.370, and 0.033 ng/m(3), respectively. DEET and cocaine were present in samples of rain up to 14.5 and 0.806 ng/L, respectively. Four antibiotics - ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole - were detected at concentrations up to 10.3 ng/L in precipitation, while ofloxacin was the sole antibiotic detected in air at 0.013 ng/m(3). The X-ray contrast agent iopamidol and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen were detected in snow up to 228 ng/L and 3.74 ng/L, respectively, while caffeine was detected only in air at 0.069 and 0.111 ng/m(3). Benzothiazole was present in rain up to 70 ng/L, while derivatives of benzotriazole - 4-methylbenzotriazole, 5-methylbenzotriazole, and 5-chlorobenzotriazole - were detected at concentrations up to 1.5 ng/L in rain and 3.4 ng/L in snow. Nonylphenol and nonylphenol monoethoxylate were detected once in air at 0.165 and 0.032 ng/m(3), respectively. Although the sources of these chemicals to atmosphere are not known, fugacity analysis suggests that wastewater may be a source of nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, DEET, and caffeine to atmosphere. The land-spreading of biosolids is known to generate PM10 that could also account for the presence of these contaminants in air. Micro-pollutant detections in air and precipitation are similar to the profile of contaminants reported previously for surface water. This proof of concept study suggests that atmospheric transport of these chemicals may partially explain the ubiquity of these contaminants in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hospital wastewaters (HWW) contain wider spectrum and higher quantity of pharmaceuticals than urban wastewaters (UWW), but they are generally discharged in sewers without pretreatment. Since traditional urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are not designed to treat HWWs, treated effluents may still contain pollutants that could impair receiving aquatic environments. Hence, a better understanding of the effect of pharmaceuticals in the environment is required. Biofilms are effective "biological sensors" for assessing the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals due to their ability to respond rapidly to physical, chemical and biological fluctuations by changes in their structure and composition.
   This study evaluated the efficiency of biological treatment with conventional activated sludge system performed parallel on HWW and UWW. Furthermore, six successive monthly colonizations of biofilms were done on autoclaved stones, placed in grid-baskets in the hospital treated effluents (HTE) and urban treated effluents (UTE). The biomass of these biofilms as well as the structure and diversity of their bacterial communities were investigated.
   Results showed better treatment efficiency for phosphate and nitrite/nitrate during the treatment of UWW. Pharmaceuticals from all investigated therapeutic classes (beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, analgesics and anticonvulsants) were efficiently removed, except for carbamazepine. The removal efficiency of the antibiotics, NSAIDs and beta-blockers was higher during the treatment of HWW. HTE and UTE shaped the bacterial communities in different ways. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the HTE caused adapted development of the microbial community, leading to less developed biomass and lower bacterial diversity. Seasonal changes in solar irradiance and temperature, caused changes in the community composition of biofilms in both effluents.
   According to the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals, the separate treatment was beneficial. However, their high concentrations in the HTE and the following adaptations of biofilm communities identify the importance of adapting wastewater treatment to specific hospital pollutants.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the changes in microbiological communities present in sewage sludge (SS) when subjected to an electric field. The establishment of these relations is important to design and optimize an electrotechnology that not only promotes a direct degradation of the emerging organic contaminants, through electrodegradation, but also stimulates their biodegradation. Different current intensities were used continuously or by steps, in a two compartment electrodialytic (ED) cell. Samples collected between May and July of 2015 were analysed, prior to ED treatment, and the 35 Taxa identified were divided in 12 groups. Initial samples, collected on May, were mainly constituted by stalked ciliates (86%), followed by shelled amoebae (8%), whereas the samples collected between June and July presented higher number of shelled amoebae, between 52 and 92%. Epistylis, Vorticella and Arcella gibbosa were the most frequent protozoa identified. Samples richness (R) was between 7 and 14, Simpson's biodiversity index (D) between 0.45 and 0.69, and evenness between 0.42 and 0.65. At the end of the ED experiments, a decrease in the number of identified Taxa and individuals was observed and, consequently, SS biodiversity also decreased. This decline was more pronounced in the ED experiments conducted with currents above 50 mA (0.10 mA cm(-2)). In terms of abundance, the final SS was mainly constituted by shelled amoebae that showed to be the most resistant to the conditions within the ED cell. The obtained results showed that the studied conditions within the ED cell were not appropriate to the microbiological communities, which influenced the final SS quality.

AB Background In order to reduce emissions of micropollutants (MPs) via effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), additional treatment steps are suggested and already deployed in selected WWTPs. Next to advanced oxidation processes, the application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) is considered a promising and suitable option as MP removal rates of 80% and more can be achieved. However, this method might also hold a drawback as a complete retention of PAC applied within the WWTP cannot always be guaranteed. Hence, small amounts of MP-loaded PAC can enter receiving waters with potentially negative consequences for aquatic organisms. The present study investigated possible effects of MP-loaded PAC from a WWTP as compared to unloaded, native PAC on the bivalve Corbicula sp. in a 10-week exposure experiment. The PAC types were administered in concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 mg/L in a semi-static sediment-water system. Results Molecular biomarker responses for xenobiotic metabolism (i.e., glutathione-S-transferase (GST)) and oxidative stress (i.e., catalase (CAT) activity and lipid peroxidation) were analyzed and in none of the treatments, significant differences to the control could be detected, except for the CAT activity in the 1 mg/L PAC(WWTP) treatment. Moreover, the filtration rate of individual bivalves was measured after 5 and 10 weeks of exposure and compared to the initial filtration rate with the result that the presence of PAC did not affect the filtration rate of Corbicula sp. In summary, despite the selection of sensitive endpoints and a comparatively long exposure period, no significant effects were detected for unloaded and MP-loaded PAC even at the highest test concentration, which is far away from environmental relevance. Conclusions These results give an auspicious perspective for the application of PAC in WWTPs. Even when small PAC leakages from WWTPs occur, adverse effects for aquatic organisms appear to be neglectable based on our findings.

AB The Fenton process is used as a tertiary treatment to remove organic pollutants from the effluent of bio-treated pharmaceutical wastewater (EBPW). The optimal and most appropriate Fenton conditions were determined by an orthogonal array test and single-factor experiments. The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was influenced by the following factors in a descending order: H2O2/Fe(II) molar ratio > H2O2 dosage > reaction time. Under the most appropriate Fenton conditions (H2O2/Fe(II) molar ratio of 1:1, H2O2 dosage of 120 mg L-1 and reaction time of 10 min), the COD and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed with efficiencies of 62 and 53%, respectively, which met the national discharge standard (GB 21903-2008) for the Lake Tai Basin, China. However, the Fenton treatment was inadequate for removal of N compounds, and the removal of organic nitrogen led to an increment in N-NH3 from 3.28 to 19.71 mg L-1. Proteins and polysaccharides were completely removed, and humic acids (HAs) were partly removed with an efficiency of 55%. Three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix spectra (3DEEMs) indicated complete removal of fulvic acid-like substances and 90% reduction in the florescence intensity of humic acid-like substances. Organic pollutants with molecular weights (MW) > 10 kDa were completely removed, MW 5-10 kDa were degraded into smaller MW ones, and some low molecular weight acids (MW 0.1-1 kDa) were mineralized during the Fenton process. Some species, including pharmaceutical intermediates and solvents were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The operational costs of the Fenton's treatment were estimated to be 0.58 yuan RMB/m(3) EBPW based on reagent usage and iron sludge treatment and disposal.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) frequently enter surface waters via discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as from industrial and agricultural activities, creating environmental and health concerns. In this study, selected EDCs were measured in water and sediments along two transboundary streams flowing from the Palestinian Authority (PA) into Israel (the Zomar-Alexander and Hebron-Beer Sheva Streams). We assessed how the complicated conflict situation between Israel and the PA and the absence of a coordinated strategy and joint stream management commission influence effective EDC control. Both streams receive raw Palestinian wastewater in their headwaters, which flows through rural areas and is treated via sediment settling facilities after crossing the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line. Four sampling campaigns were conducted over two years, with concentrations of selected EDCs measured in both the water and the sediments. Results show asymmetrical pollution profiles due to socio-economic differences and contrasting treatment capacities. No in-stream attenuation was observed along the stream and in the sediments within the Palestinian region. After sediment settling in treatment facilities at the Israeli border, however, significant reductions in the EDC concentrations were measured both in the sediments and in the water. Differences in sedimentation technologies had a substantial effect on EDC removal at the treatment location, positively affecting the streams' ability to further remove EDCs downstream. The prevailing approach to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian transboundary wastewater contamination reveals a narrow perspective among water managers who on occasion only take local interests into consideration, with interventions focused solely on improving stream water quality in isolated segments.

AB The presence and fate of 56 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) were investigated in the South Wales region of the UK. Two contrasting rivers: River Taff and River Ely were chosen for this investigation and were monitored for a period of 10 months. The impact of the factors affecting the levels of concentration of PPCPs and illicit drugs in surface water such as surrounding area, proximity to wastewater effluent and weather conditions, mainly rainfall was also investigated.
   Most PPCPs were frequently found in river water at concentrations reaching single mu g L(-1) and their levels depended mainly on the extent of water dilution resulting from rainfall. Discharge of treated wastewater effluent into the river course was found to be the main cause of water contamination with PPCPs. The most frequently detected PPCPs represent the group of pharmaceuticals dispensed at the highest levels in the Welsh community. These were antibacterial drugs (trimethoprim, erythromycin-H(2)O and amoxicillin), anti-inflammatories/analgesics (paracetamol, tramadol, codeine, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Only four PPCPs out of 56 (simvastatin, pravastatin, digoxin and digoxigenin) were not quantified over the course of the study. Several PPCPs were found to be both ubiquitous and persistent in the aqueous environment (e.g. erythromycin-H(2)O, codeine, carbamazepine, gabapentin and valsartan). The calculated average daily loads of PPCPs indicated that in total almost 6 kg of studied PPCPs are discharged daily into the studied rivers.
   The illicit drugs studied were found in rivers at low levels of ng L(-1). Average daily loads of amphetamine, cocaine and its main metabolite benzoylecgonine were as follows: 8, 1.2 and 39 g day(-1), respectively Their frequent occurrence in surface water is primarily associated with their high illegal usage and is strongly associated with the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater effluent.

AB A novel process configuration was designed to increase biofilm growth in tertiary moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) by providing additional substrate from primary treated wastewater in a sidestream reactor under different redox conditions in order to improve micropollutant removal in MBBRs with low substrate availability. This novel recirculating MBBR was operated on pilot scale for 13 months, and a systematic increase was seen in the biomass concentration and the micropollutant degradation rates, compared to a tertiary MBBR without additional substrate. The degradation rates per unit carrier surface area increased in the order of ten times, and for certain micropollutants, such as atenolol, metoprolol, trimethoprim and roxithromycin, the degradation rates increased 20-60 times. Aerobic conditions were critical for maintaining high micropollutant degradation rates. With innovative MBBR configurations it may be possible to improve the biological degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater. It is suggested that degradation rates be normalized to the carrier surface area, in favor of the biomass concentration, as this reflects the diffusion limitations of oxygen, and will facilitate the comparison of different biofilm systems.

AB Recently, contamination of water resources has become a persistent problem to human due to advanced industrialization and rapid population growth. The major causes of water pollution are dye effluents from textile dyeing, pharmaceuticals, and paper printing industries. Therefore, cost-effective technologies, such as membrane filtration, adsorption, coagulation, microbial degradation, and chemical oxidation, are adopted for the removal of pollutants from water effluents. Graphene-based materials have gained much consideration as a novel material for addressing the global environmental issues due their high mechanical strength, excellent electron mobility, large surface area, and high thermal conductivity. Semiconductor photocatalysis has received much interest as a promising technology for water treatment owing to its cost-effective, easy operation, high-efficiency, and convenience. Therefore, the design and fabrication of graphene support with semiconductor photocatalyst are promising as multifunctional catalysts. This book chapter evaluates the recent design of graphene-based materials as adsorbent and photocatalytic materials in environmental remediation. The theoretical outcomes in water treatment using graphene/semiconductor composites are also summarized. A brief outlook on the challenges and new strategies is provided for developing effective water/wastewater treatment techniques using graphene-based materials.

AB In this study, we report removal of Diclofenac (DCF) through heterogeneous Fenton process using Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst. The parent catalyst was prepared by hydrothermal technique. Fe species were introduced by wet impregnation. Characterization of the catalysts was carried out using XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, and acidimetric-alkalimetric titration. The bimetallic catalyst had the high crystallinity (81.2%), specific surface area (291.8 m(2) g(-1)) and uniform spherical morphology. Effect of pH, temperature, catalyst concentration, and H2O2 concentration on DCF removal efficiency was investigated. The results showed that the optimum conditions were reaction temperature of 25 degrees C, H2O2 concentration of 10 mM, pH level of 3, and catalyst concentration of 2 g l(-1) which resulted in the highest DCF removal (97%). No significant change was observed in the catalytic performance when it was applied in the sequence cycles at the optimum reaction conditions. The prepared catalyst showed the high potential for the treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater due to the high efficiency and stability.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging electrocatalytic ozonation process that is enabled by in situ producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from cathodic oxygen reduction during ozonation. The in situ-generated H2O2 can then promote ozone (O-3) transformation to hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and thus enhance the abatement of ozone-refractory pollutants compared to conventional ozonation. In this study, a chemical kinetic model was employed to simulate micropollutant abatement during the E-peroxone treatment of various water matrices (surface water, secondary wastewater effluent, and groundwater). Results show that by following the O-3 and center dot OH exposures during the E-peroxone process, the abatement kinetics of a variety of model micropollutants could be well predicted using the model. In addition, the effect of specific ozone doses on micropollutant abatement efficiencies could be quantitatively evaluated using the model. Therefore, the chemical kinetic model can be used to reveal important information for the design and optimization of the treatment time and ozone doses of the E-peroxone process for cost-effective micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, four one-dimensional flow and transport models based on the data of a field scale experiment in Greece were constructed to investigate the transport behavior of sixteen organic trace pollutants during soil aquifer treatment. At the site, tap water and treated wastewater were intermittently infiltrated into a porous aquifer via a small pilot pond. Electrical conductivity data was used to calibrate the non-reactive transport models. Transport and attenuation of the organic trace pollutants were simulated assuming 1st order degradation and linear adsorption. Sorption was found to be largely insignificant at this site for the compounds under investigation. In contrast flow path averaged first order degradation rate constants were mostly higher compared to the literature and lay between 0.036 d(-1) for clofibric acid and 0.9 d(-1) for ibuprofen, presumably owing to the high temperatures and a well adapted microbial community originating from the wastewater treatment process. The study highlights the necessity to obtain intrinsic attenuation parameters at each site, as findings cannot easily be transferred from one site to another. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of the metabolites of five human pharmaceuticals was investigated in treated wastewater, surface waters and sediments. Metabolites of carbamazepine (carbamazepine epoxide), diclofenac (4'- and 5-hydroxy diclofenac) and atorvastatin (o- and p-hydroxy atorvastatin) were typically detected in flow proportional 24 h composite samples of wastewater effluent collected from the Norwegian cities of Oslo and Tromso at higher concentrations than the parent pharmaceutical. The concentrations determined in discharged effluent were as high as 3700 ng L-1 for 5-hydroxy diclofenac. The overall mean concentration of metabolites being typically higher in the primary treated effluent from the city of Tromso compared to the tertiary treatment performed on the Oslo effluent. Metabolites of carbamazepine (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide), metoprolol (alpha-hydroxy metoprolol) and simvastatin (hydroxy simvastatin) were detected in surface water samples collected from Oslofjord at concentrations of up to 108 ng L-1, whilst alpha-hydroxy metoprolol and simvastatin hydroxy carboxylic acid were also detected in sediments at low ng L-1 concentrations. These screening data show that the metabolites of selected pharmaceuticals are being discharged into the Norwegian coastal environment and that certain metabolites occur in marine surface waters and sediments.

AB Previous field studies utilizing solid-phase microextraction (SPME) predominantly focused on volatile and semivolatile compounds in air or water. Earlier in vivo sampling studies utilizing SPME were limited to the liquid matrix (blood). The present study has expanded the SPME technique to semisolid tissues under laboratory and field conditions through the investigation of both theoretical and applied experimental approaches. Pre-equilibrium extraction and desorption were performed in vivo in two separate animals. Excellent linearity was found between the amounts extracted by SPME from the muscle of living fish and the waterborne concentrations of pharmaceuticals. A simple SPME method is also described to simultaneously determine free and total analyte concentrations in living tissue. The utility of in vivo SPME sampling was evaluated in wild fish collected from a number of different river locations undervarying degrees of influence from municipal wastewater effluents. Diphenhydramine and diltiazem were detected in the muscle of fish downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant. Based on this study, SPME demonstrated several important advantages such as simplicity, sensitivity, and robustness under laboratory and in vivo field sampling conditions.

AB Estrogenic hormones and hormone-mimics are chemical compounds widely used in the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries. They present in the aqueous environment with increasing concern due to their adverse impact on aquatic life, and long-term risk to human health. This study investigates the decomposition of two estrogenic hormones progesterone (P4) and 17? estradiol (E2) and a hormone-mimic bisphenol A (BPA) by ozonation. For the first time, this study reveals the catalytic role of phosphate ions in triggering ozone side reactions with interfering oxidants, reductants, and organic components, resulting in a diminished selectivity of the ozone towards direct reaction with the target compounds. Complete mineralization of the studied compounds was confirmed by GC?MS and TOC measurements. A novel relative activity determination tool was developed and applied to show sequential reduction in the relative estrogenic activity with increasing ozone concentrations, until ultimately achieving near complete inactivation of the studied compounds. The studies of decomposing the targets in wastewater showed that the rate constants and removal efficiencies are moderately reduced, and complete removal is still achieved with higher doses. The findings of this study will provide important insights and directions to water treatment agencies and future large scale studies.

AB Micropollutants removal, such as pharmaceutical substances, during wastewater treatment processes is becoming a greater issue everyday. In order to optimize it, their biodegradation P processes have to be better understood. So far, microcalorimetry has been used worldwide to investigate chemical reactions. For few years now it has also been developed to model and control biological processes. In the case of micropollutants, respirometry is, most of the time, not precise enough to determine biodegradation. That is why, microcalorimetric experiments have been set up. For this purpose, a 2 L Bio-RC1 (Mettler-Toledo) has been modified to reach a resolution of 5-10mW.L-1.
   In this study, the biodegradation rate of standard substrates (Ethanol and Ammonia) by an activated sludge from a full-scale CAS and one from a MBR pilot plant operating in parallel have been compared by means of microcalorimetry. Then few trials to determine the biodegradation of selected pharmaceutical substances, as well as the eventual inhibition induced by them have been made. The first results did not exhibit any biological activity. However, they have displayed inhibition for both studied substances.

AB The efficiency of reduced graphene oxide magnetite (rGOM) to remove selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from wastewater at high concentration was evaluated. Diclofenac sodium (DCS) and aspirin (ASP) were chosen as target pharmaceuticals due to their common persistency in wastewater. rGOM was prepared to form graphene oxide (GO) using a one-step procedure where the reduction of GO and attachment of Fe3O4 particles to the surface of GO was carried out simultaneously. rGOM showed very good efficiency with percent removal of 98.5% and 90.5% at the optimum conditions for ASP and DCS, respectively. The optimum condition for removal of DCS is adsorbent dosage 14 g L-1, the contact time of 40 min, and a pH of 5.0. While the optimum conditions for ASP are adsorbent dosage 16 g L-1, contact time 40 min, and a pH of 3.0. The adsorption process was evaluated through different adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fitting for DCS adsorption with Q(m) and K-L values of 12.95 mg g(-1) and 0.091 L mg(-1), respectively. On the other hand, ASP removal was best described by the Freundlich isotherm model with K-F and n values of 5.95 and 2.49, respectively. Both processes showed fast kinetics. Thermodynamic properties were calculated using the Sips isotherm model. The adsorption of both drugs was found to be spontaneous with a negative value of Gibbs free energy and positive enthalpy change indicating that the adsorption process was endothermic. Continuous fixed-bed column adsorption was performed, and the data were fitted using different isotherm models and it was observed that adsorption of DCS follows Yan model while adsorption of ASP is described by Bohart-Adams model. A regeneration study was carried out which showed that the removal efficiency was still significant for both ASP and DCS even after three cycles.

AB The degradation of 150 mL of 0.561 mM tetracaine hydrochloride at pH 3.0 by electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2) has been studied at a low current density of 33.3 mA cm(2) in three different matrices: 0.050 M Na2SO4, real urban wastewater and a simulated matrix mimicking its electrolyte composition. Comparative trials were performed in an undivided cell with a 3 cm(2) borondoped diamond (BDD), Pt, IrO2-based or RuO2-based anode and a 3 cm(2) air-diffusion cathode that allowed continuous H2O2 electrogeneration. In 0.050 M Na2SO4, much faster and overall removal of tetracaine occurred using BDD because of the large oxidation ability of BDD((OH)-O-center dot) formed from anodic water oxidation. In either simulated matrix or real wastewater, the RuO2-based anode yielded the quickest tetracaine decay due to a large production of active chlorine from anodic oxidation of Cl . For the mineralization of the organic matter content, the BDD/air-diffusion cell was the best choice in all aqueous matrices, always reaching more than 50% of total organic carbon abatement after 360 min of electrolysis, as expected if BDD((OH)-O-center dot) mineralizes more easily the chloroderivatives formed from tetracaine oxidation in the presence of active chlorine. The initial N of tetracaine was partly transformed into NO3, although the total nitrogen of all solutions always decayed by the release of volatile by-products. In the Cl - containing matrices, significant amounts of ClO3 and ClO4 were obtained using BDD, whereas active chlorine was much largely produced using the RuO2-based anode. Five aromatic by-products, one of them being chlorinated, along with low concentrations of oxalic acid were identified. The change in toxicity during EO-H2O2 with BDD in the sulfate and simulated matrices was also assessed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a common antibiotic prescribed for treating infections, which is frequently detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Its degradation and conversion in a laboratory-scale sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification reactor were for the first time investigated through long-term reactor operation and short-term batch experiments. Co-metabolism of SMX and nitrate by autotrophic denitrifiers was observed in this study. The specific SMX removal rate was 3.7 +/- 1.4 mu g/g SS-d, which was higher than those reported in conventional wastewater treatment processes. The removal of SMX by the enriched denitrifying sludge was mainly attributed to biodegradation. Four transformation products (three known with structures and one with unknown structure) were identified, of which the structures of the two transformation products (TPs) were altered in the isoxazole ring. Additionally, the presence of SMX significantly shaped the microbial community structures, leading to the dominant denitrifier shifting from Sulfuritalea to Sulfurimonas to maintain the stability of system. Collectively, the sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification process could effectively remove SMX in addition to efficient nitrate removal, and further polish the effluent from conventional WWTPs.

AB Considering the lack of information on simultaneously removing multiple pharmaceuticals from water or wastewater by electrochemical methods, this study aimed to investigate the removal of multiple pharmaceuticals by electro-coagulation and electro-oxidation based on two types of electrodes (aluminum and graphite). The synthetic wastewater contained a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac), a sulfonamide antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) and a beta-blocker (atenolol). The pharmaceutical removal with electro-oxidation was much higher than those with the electro-coagulation process, which was obtained from a five-cell graphite electrode system, while the removal of pharmaceuticals with aluminum electrodes was about 20% (20 mu M). In the electro-coagulation system, pharmaceutical removal was mainly influenced by the solubility or hydrophilicity of the compound. In the electro-oxidation system, the removal mechanism was influenced by the dissociation status of the compounds, which are attracted to the anode due to electrostatic forces and have a higher mass transformation rate with the electro-oxidation process. Therefore, atenolol, which was undissociated, cannot adequately be eliminated by electro-oxidation, unless the electrode's surface is large enough to increase the mass diffusion rate.

AB The occurrence of organic micropollutants such as pharmaceutical drugs and hormones in the environment reflects the inefficiency of traditional wastewater treatment technologies. Biosorption is a promising alternative from a technical-economic point of view, so understanding the mechanisms of adsorption in new biosorbents is vital for application and process optimization. Within this context, this study aims to evaluate the mechanisms of adsorption and removal of synthetic and natural hormones byPinus elliottiibark biosorbent (PS) compared to commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) through kinetic models, isotherm models, and thermodynamic models. The adsorbents were also characterized by morphology, chemical composition, functional groups, and point of zero charge. Characterization of the adsorbents highlights the heterogeneous and fibrous morphology and broader range of functional groups found for PS. Kinetic adjustments showed high accuracy for pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models, presenting multilinearity and evidencing multi-stage adsorption. The isotherms for PS followed high-affinity models, predominantly chemisorption, while those for GAC followed the Langmuir model, where physisorption predominates. These mechanisms were confirmed by thermodynamic models, which also indicated a higher dependence on temperature in the adsorption process.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely detected in aquatic environments, and their potential risks to aquatic species are of concern because they are designed to be biologically active. Here, we used an in vitro assay, called the transforming growth factor alpha shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-acting pharmaceuticals present in river water and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan from 2014 to 2016. Antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (beta 1), acetylcholine (M1) and histamine (H1) receptors were detected in river water, and were stronger downstream than upstream owing to effluent from WWTPs along the river. Ozonation at one WWTP reduced these activities. Concentrations of sulpiride (D2 antagonist) could explain 73% of antagonistic activities against the D2 receptor; those of metoprolol, atenolol and propranolol (beta 1 antagonists) could explain 16% of activities against the beta 1 receptor; and those of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) could explain 15% of activities against the M1 receptor. Therefore, other receptor antagonists also occur. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be given more attention in environmental monitoring and toxicity testing.

AB Soil and vegetables are the most integral environmental segments for human and animal life. Day by day both of these segments are becoming polluted by anthropogenic resources, and one of the major sources of contamination is pharmaceutical wastewater entering environment. Contamination levels of antibiotics namely ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin (LEV), oxytetracycline (OTC), and doxycycline were determined (found) in soil and vegetables samples in surrounding areas of pharmaceutical industry. HPLC with DAD detector, C-18 column and solid-phase cartridges were used to extract and analyze antibiotic residues in soil, carrot, wheat, and spinach samples. In wheat samples, LEV and OFL in spinach and carrot samples were accumulated highest. OFL, in soil of wheat and spinach samples, and OTC, in soil of carrot samples, were determined as highest level contaminant. In all types of vegetable samples, the contamination of each antibiotic was highest in leaves and lowest in fruits. The order of accumulation was leaves > stem/shoot > root > fruit. The contamination level was higher in soil samples than vegetable samples. Plants and vegetables directly or indirectly are part of human food. From soil, antibiotics accumulates to plants and vegetables, and leach to groundwater.

AB In the present study, a method for prediction of the toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics to microbial communities in anaerobic digestion treatment was developed. Luminescent bacterium assay was carried out with Vibrio fischeri as indicator. The individual and joint toxicities of antibiotics and anaerobic digestion metabolites were investigated by using the 15-min half inhibitory concentration (15 min-IC50) at pH 7.00 +/- 0.05. The results showed that the 15 min-IC50 of Amoxicillin, Kanamycin, Lincomycin and Ciprofloxacin were 3.99, 5.11, 4.32 and 5.63 g L-1 respectively, and the toxicity descended in the order of Amoxicillin, Lincomycin, Kanamycin and Ciprofloxacin. Using equitoxic ratio mixing method, the joint toxicities of four anaerobic digestion intermediates, the four intermediates together with Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Kanamycin or Lincomycin were determined, which displayed that their interactions were additive, additive, synergistic, synergistic and synergistic respectively. Finally the joint effect of all intermediates and antibiotics was synergistic. The method has promising applications in evaluating the joint toxicity of anaerobic digestion intermediates and antibiotics, and has laid the foundations for assessing the feasibility of anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics.

AB The solid phase extraction method has been developed and applied for the simultaneous analysis of the five most commonly used triazine pesticides. The analysis was conducted using a liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector, which was first optimized to improve the limit of quantification and detection. The extraction parameters (conditioning solvent and sample volume) that affect the recovery of the analytes for solid phase extraction were optimized. The recoveries obtained were between 107 and 111%. The limit of detection ranged between 0.668 and 1.16 mu g/L and the limit of quantification ranged between 2.01 and 3.54 mu g/L. Good precision with a relative standard deviation of less than 8% in all compounds was achieved. The developed and validated method was then applied to river water, wastewater and sludge samples from around KwaZulu-Natal. The quantified concentrations ranged from 8.35 to 2820 mu g/L, 2.41-48.7 mu g/L and 3.20-65.0 mu g/L in sludge, wastewater, and river water respectively.

AB The thermal reactivation of granular activated carbon is a substantial ecological and economic benefit in the process of drinking water treatment. A significant amount of abraded carbon, which is similar to powdered activated carbon (PAC), is produced that can be brought to application at wastewater treatment plant level for the removal of micropollutants in a powdered activated carbon-activated sludge (PAC-AS) system. This excess carbon derived as a by-product from the reactivation process in a waterworks was applied directly into the activated sludge tank and has been elevated in this study by monitoring the removal efficiencies for benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole in the effluent of a semi-technical wastewater treatment plant of 39 m(3). A simulation-derived sampling strategy was applied to optimize the recovery rates of the micropollutants. Flow-proportional, 72-hour composite sampling was considered best. The elimination rates obtained for a 10 g PAC.m(-3) dosage were 73% for benzotriazole, 59% for carbamazepine, 60% for diclofenac, 67% for metoprolol and 48% for sulfamethoxazole. The obtained results underline the importance of appropriate sampling strategies, which can be derived from hydraulic modeling.

AB Selected pharmaceutical chemicals, steroids and xenoestrogens (PCSXs) consisting of 29 endocrine modulators, therapeutic drugs, pesticides, detergents, plastics, and active ingredients in household products were measured in water, riverbed sediments and fish collected in a tributary embayment of the Potomac River (Hunting Creek, Alexandria, VA, USA) in the vicinity of wastewater discharge. A total of 17 PCSXs were found in the Hunting Creek samples, with steroid hormones (e.g., progesterone and 17-ethinylestradiol), triclosan, dextromethorphan and bisphenol A being the most prominent micropollutants detected.The geospatial distribution of the PCSXs in Hunting Creek indicated that the steroids correlated with wastewater treatment plant discharge in all matrices, but such an association is tentative in Hunting Creek given the complex nature of urban sources of PCSXs and hydrodynamics in an urban tidal river. The sediment PCSX concentrations correlated with sediment total organic carbon content at all sampling sites. For the most part, the PCSXs showed an enrichment in fish tissue relative to sediments when concentrations were normalized to lipids and sediment organic carbon contents, but the influence of endogenous steroids is also an important consideration for these chemicals.

ID RAY CONTRAST-MEDIA; PHARMACEUTICALS; DECHLORINATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM), as derivatives of 2, 4, 6-triiodo benzoic acid, are applied in high doses to humans and are excreted unchanged via urine within 24 h. Common as well as advanced wastewater treatment is not able to remove the iodinated compounds leading to an environmental pollution. A specific treatment of contaminated urine or hospital wastewater could minimise the emission. For that reason the deiodination of iopromide, the most commonly used ICM, was investigated using zero-valent iron. Initial experiments carried out in stirred batch reactors with an initial pH of 2 using iron powder and iopromide dissolved in ultra pure water showed that iopromide can be deiodinated by zero- valent iron. Even in contaminated urine collected in a hospital a deiodination of ICM was possible. Further experiments at different constant pH values, temperatures and stirring speeds were performed. The kinetic studies at constant pH showed that the deiodination can be described by pseudo-first order for equal iopromide and iron concentrations. In general, the reaction depends strongly on the pH, the temperature and the stirring speed. The observed rate constant K(obs) has an optimum at pH 3 and rises with increasing temperature and stirring speed.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in open water streams has become an alarming concern over the couple of years due to their adverse effect on the environment, especially the emergence of multidrug resistance. Hence, their removal is quite essential from the open water streams. In this regard, the present work reports a novel approach that involves UV-C irradiation for the degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic present in a highly alkaline environment. It is observed that the UVC/NaOH based degradation of ciprofloxacin follows almost zero- order reaction kinetics. Here, the process degradation efficiency is about 83% for an initial concentration of C-0 = 10 ppm, NaOH = 0.15 M, UV-C fluence rate = 1.03 mW/cm(2), irradiation time = 6 h, reaction volume = 25 ml. Moreover, this process has also shown a remarkable characteristic of negative CO2 emission technologies. Therefore, not similar to other AOPs, this UV- C/NaOH based pollutant degradation approach has strong potential for the treatment of diverse alkaline cum industrial wastewater streams with simultaneous CO2 sequestration.

AB It is widely believed that constructed wetlands (CWs) own great potentiality as polishing wastewater treatment methods for removing carbamazepine (CBZ). Although the typical CBZ removal efficiencies in CWs are quite low, the CBZ removal performance could be improved to some extend by optimizing the CW design parameters. A comparison of current relevant studies indicates that horizontal sub-surface flow CWs (HSSF-CWs) and hybrid wetlands are attracting more interest for the treatment of CBZ wastewater. According to CBZ's physicochemical properties, substrate adsorption (25.70-57.30%) and macrophyte uptake (22.30-51.00%) are the two main CBZ removal pathways in CWs. The CBZ removal efficiency of CWs employing light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) as a substrate could reach values higher than 90%, and the most favorable macrophyte species is Iris sibirica, which has shown the highest total CBZ assimilation capacity. Several methods for enhancement have been proposed to optimize CBZ removal in CWs, including development of hydraulic models for optimization of CW operation, introduction of extra new CBZ removal ways into CW through substrate modification, design of combined/integrated CW, etc.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of shallow groundwater is a substantial concern in effluent-dominated streams, due to high aqueous mobility, designed bioactivity, and effluent-driven hydraulic gradients. In October and December 2012, effluent contributed approximately 99% and 71%, respectively, to downstream flow in Fourmile Creek, Iowa, USA. Strong hydrologic connectivity was observed between surface-water and shallow-groundwater. Carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and immunologically-related compounds were detected in groundwater at greater than 0.02 mu g L-1 at distances up to 6 m from the stream bank. Direct aqueous-injection HPLC-MS/MS revealed 43% and 55% of 110 total pharmaceutical analytes in surface-water samples in October and December, respectively, with 16% and 6%, respectively, detected in groundwater approximately 20 m from the stream bank. The results demonstrate the importance of effluent discharge as a driver of local hydrologic conditions in an effluent-impacted stream and thus as a fundamental control on surface-water to groundwater transport of effluent-derived pharmaceutical contaminants.

AB This work makes a comparison between electrocoagulation (EC), photoelectrocoagulation, peroxi-electrocoagulation and peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation processes to investigate the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of operational parameters such as initial pH, current density, applied voltage, amount of hydrogen peroxide and electrolysis time on COD removal efficiency were investigated and the optimum operating range for each of these operating variables was experimentally determined. In electrocoagulation process, the optimum values of pH and voltage were determined to be 7 and 40V, respectively. Desired pH and hydrogen peroxide concentration in the Fenton-based processes were found to be 3 and 300 mg/L, respectively. The amounts of COD, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature and total dissolved solids (TDS) were on-line monitored.
   Results indicated that under the optimum operating range for each process, the COD removal efficiency was in order of peroxi-electrocoagulation > peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation > photoelectrocoagulation > electrocoagulation. Finally, a kinetic study was carried out using the linear pseudo-second-order model and results showed that the pseudo-second-order equation provided the best correlation for the COD removal rate.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical that has been identified by some jurisdictions as an environmental concern. In 2010, Canada concluded that this substance posed a risk to the environment and human health, and implemented actions to reduce its concentrations in the environment. To support these activities, a multimedia analysis of BPA in the Canadian environment was conducted to evaluate spatial and temporal trends, and to infer mechanisms influencing the patterns. BPA was consistently detected in wastewater and biosolids across Canadian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in landfill leachate. In addition, BPA concentrations were significantly higher in surface water downstream compared to upstream of WWTPs in three of five urban areas evaluated. However, application of biosolids to Canadian agricultural fields did not contribute to elevated BPA concentrations in soil, earthworms, and European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) plasma one and two years post-treatment. Spatial trends of BPA concentrations in surface water and sediment are influenced by human activity, with higher concentrations typically found downstream of industrial sources and WWTPs in urban areas. BPA was detected in bird plasma at locations impacted by WWTPs and landfills. However, spatial trends in birds were less clear and may have been confounded by metabolic biotransformation. In terms of temporal trends, BPA concentrations in surface water decreased significantly at 10 of 16 monitoring sites evaluated between 2008 and 2018. In contrast, recent temporal trends of BPA in six sediment cores were variable, which may be a result of biotransformation of the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A to BPA. Overall, our study provides evidence that Government of Canada actions have been generally successful in reducing BPA concentrations in the Canadian environment. Our results indicate that long-term monitoring programs using surface water are more effective than other media for tracking and understanding future environmental trends of BPA.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are not specially designed to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), since these substances are toxic and bio-refractory. This paper aims to investigate and optimize the performance of the Trisep TS80 nanofiltration (NF) membrane for the removal of a mixture of two of the most detected PhACs in municipal wastewaters worldwide, sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac. Several NF tests were carried out to study the rejections of these contaminants both spiked in demineralized water, filtrated water taken from Mondego River and secondary effluent coming from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Among the several studied operating variables, pH was the one that most affected the contaminant rejection and membrane permeability. In the case of synthetic effluent, an applied pressure of 10 bar and pH 7 were determined as the best operating conditions, which allowed almost total chemical oxygen demand retention and a global contaminant rejection of 96.3% to be achieved. The application of different water matrices (river water and secondary municipal effluent) had no relevant impact on process efficiency. Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition tests revealed that treatment by nanofiltration reduced acute toxicity of all studied effluents.

AB Like many insects, mosquitoes, rely on endosymbionts to grow and develop. These can be acquired from the environment. We used next generation 454 pyrosequencing to discern the whole-body microbiome of the mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus in various larval stadia and following exposure to common pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) found in wastewater. PPCP treatments included environmentally-relevant concentrations; 1) a combination of common antibiotics, 2) a combination of mammalian hormones, 3) a mixture of the antibiotic and hormone treatments plus acetaminophen and caffeine and, 4) an untreated control. Within control groups, the predominant families of bacterial symbionts change with each larval instar despite consistent diets and rearing conditions. This trend was also seen in hormone treatments but not in the antibiotic or the mixture treatments. Richness and evenness were reduced in both antibiotic and mixture treatments, suggesting that antibiotics remove certain bacteria or inhibit them from increasing to proportions seen in the control treatment. Interestingly, the mixture treatments had greater richness and evenness compared to antibiotic alone treatments, possibly due to the other contaminants facilitating growth of different bacteria. These findings illuminate the complexity of the microbiome of C. quinquefasciatus and may have implications for more effective control strategies.

Pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol, ethenyloestradiol, oestriol) were removed completely from urine. NF-separation also has some disadvantages: losses of urea, and lowering the conductivity in the product (permeate). The retentates (concentrates) received have to be treated further by oxidation to destroy the "problem" compounds. The results showed that electrochemical oxidation is more suitable than gamma radiation. Gamma-radiation with intensities higher than 10 kGy has to be applied for efficiently destroying of ibuprofen, and especially diclofenac. A high quantity of intermediate "problem" substances with oestrone structure was formed during the gamma oxidation of hormone containing urine samples. The electrochemical oxidation can be successfully applied for elimination of pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac, and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol) from yellow wastewater without loss of urea (nitrogen fertiliser).

AB In this work, flax shives and oat hulls representative of cellulosic materials of agricultural byproducts were used to develop hydrochars and steam-activated hydrochar adsorbents. They were used to adsorb carbamazepine (CBZ) as a model pharmaceutical pollutant from artificially contaminated water. The adsorbents were characterized by surface properties and composition. CBZ equilibrium adsorption was investigated at various temperatures (20-40 degrees C) and solution pH (2-10). Steam-activation enhanced the CBZ equilibrium uptake of hydrochars made from either flax shives or oat hulls; however, both the hydrochars with or without steamactivation demonstrated effective CBZ adsorption in comparison with numerous adsorbents reported in the literature. The achieved CBZ uptake was insignificantly affected by solution pH, indicating that the adsorbents developed in this work could be applied to remove CBZ and similar pharmaceutical pollutants from water/ wastewater with a wide range of pH values. The CBZ adsorption was effective at room temperature which was enhanced at a higher temperature, showing the adsorption was endothermic in nature. The results demonstrated that flax shives and oat hulls were a promising feedstocks for making into adsorbents for water treatment.

AB In order to evaluate the effect of anaerobic digestion intermediates and antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewaters on anaerobic digestion process, their acute toxicities were tested using the 15 mm median inhibitory concentration (IC50) at pH 7.00 +/- 0.05. The results showed that the IC50 of ethanol, acetate, propionate and butyrate were 19.40, 20.71, 10.47 and 12.17 g L-1 respectively, which suggested the toxicity descended in the order of propionate, butyrate, ethanol and acetate. The IC50 of aureomycin, polymyxin and chloromycetin were 12.06, 6.24 and 429.90 mg L-1 respectively, which indicated the toxicity descended in the order of polymyxin, aureomycin and chloromycetin. Using equitoxic ratio mixing method, the joint toxicities of five groups referred by A (four anaerobic digestion intermediates), B (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and aureomycin), C (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and polymyxin), D (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and chloromycetin) and E (four anaerobic digestion intermediates, aureomycin, polymyxin and chloromycetin) were investigated respectively. Their interactions were additive (A), synergistic (B), additive (C), synergistic (D) and synergistic (E). The investigation would lay a basis for the optimization of anaerobic biotechnology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous release of pharmaceuticals from WWTP effluents to freshwater is a matter of concern, due to their potential effects on non-target organisms. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs and their associated hazard have been scarcely studied in Latin American countries. This study aimed at monitoring for the first time the occurrence of 70 pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in WWTPs across Costa Rica; the application of the hazard quotient (HQ) approach coupled to ecotoxicological determinations permitted to identify the hazard posed by specific pharmaceuticals and toxicity of the effluents, respectively. Thirty-three PhACs were found, with 1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and gemfibrozil being the most frequently detected (influents/effluents). HQ for specific pharmaceuticals revealed 24 compounds with high/medium hazard in influents, while the amount only decreased to 21 in effluents. The top HQ values were obtained for risperidone, lovastatin, diphenhydramine and fluoxetine (influent/effluent samples), plus caffeine (influent) and trimethoprim (effluent). Likewise, the estimation of overall hazard in WWTP samples (sum of individual HQ, Sigma HQ) demonstrated that every influent and 96% of the effluents presented high hazard towards aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological analysis (Daphnia magna, Lactuca sativa and Microtox test) revealed that 16.7% of the effluents presented toxicity towards all benchmark organisms; the phytotoxicity was particularly frequent, as inhibition values >= 20% in the germination index for L. sativa were obtained for all the effluents. The Sigma HQ approach estimated the highest hazard in urban wastewater, while the ecotoxicological results showed the highest toxicity in hospital and landfill wastewater. Likewise, ecotoxicological results and Sigma HQ values showed a rather poor correlation; instead, better correlations were obtained between ecotoxicological parameters and HQ values for some individual pharmaceuticals such as cephalexin and diphenhydramine. Findings from this study provide novel information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and the performance of WWTPs in the tropical region of Central America. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant drug used for epilepsy and other disorders. Prescription of CBZ during pregnancy increases the risk for congenital malformations. CBZ is ubiquitous in effluents and persistent during wastewater treatment. Thus, it is re-introduced into agricultural ecosystems upon irrigation with reclaimed wastewater. People consuming produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater were found to be exposed to CBZ. However, environmental concentrations of CBZ (mu g L-1) are magnitudes lower than its therapeutic levels (mu g ml(-1)), raising the question of whether and how environmental levels of CBZ affect embryonic development.
   The chick embryo is a powerful and highly sensitive amniotic model system that enables to assess environmental contaminants in the living organism. Since the chick embryonic development is highly similar to mammalians, yet, it develops in an egg, toxic effects can be directly analyzed in a well-controlled system without maternal influences. This research utilized the chick embryo to WA whether CBZ is embryo-toxic by using morphological, cellular, molecular and imaging strategies. Three key embryonic stages were monitored: after blastulation (st.1HH), gastrulation/neurulation (st.8HH) and organogenesis (st.15HH).
   Here we demonstrate that environmental relevant concentrations of CBZ impair morphogenesis in a dose- and stage- dependent manner. Effects on gastrulation, neural tube closure, differentiation and proliferation were exhibited in early stages by exposing embryos to CBZ dose as low as 0.1 mu g L-1. Quantification of developmental progression revealed a significant difference in the total score obtained by CBZ-treated embryos compared to controls (up to 5-fold difference, p < 0.05). Yet, defects were unnoticed as embryos passed gastrulation/neurulation.
   This study provides the first evidence for teratogenic effect of environmental-relevant concentrations of CBZ in amniotic embryos that impair early but not late stages of development. These findings call for in-depth risk analysis to ensure that the environmental presence of CBZ and other drugs is not causing irreversible ecological and public-health damages.

AB BackgroundPythium irregulare is an oleaginous Oomycete able to accumulate large amounts of lipids, including Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is an important and expensive dietary supplement with a promising and very competitive market, which is dependent on fish-oil extraction. This has prompted several research groups to study biotechnological routes to obtain specific fatty acids rather than a mixture of various lipids. Moreover, microorganisms can use low cost carbon sources for lipid production, thus reducing production costs. Previous studies have highlighted the production of EPA by P. irregulare, exploiting diverse low cost carbon sources that are produced in large amounts, such as vinasse, glycerol, and food wastewater. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about its biosynthetic pathways, because no functional annotation of any Pythium sp. exists yet. The goal of this work was to identify key genes and pathways related to EPA biosynthesis, in P. irregulare CBS 494.86, by sequencing and performing an unprecedented annotation of its genome, considering the possibility of using wastewater as a carbon source.ResultsGenome sequencing provided 17,727 candidate genes, with 3809 of them associated with enzyme code and 945 with membrane transporter proteins. The functional annotation was compared with curated information of oleaginous organisms, understanding amino acids and fatty acids production, and consumption of carbon and nitrogen sources, present in the wastewater. The main features include the presence of genes related to the consumption of several sugars and candidate genes of unsaturated fatty acids production.ConclusionsThe whole metabolic genome presented, which is an unprecedented reconstruction of P. irregulare CBS 494.86, shows its potential to produce value-added products, in special EPA, for food and pharmaceutical industries, moreover it infers metabolic capabilities of the microorganism by incorporating information obtained from literature and genomic data, supplying information of great importance to future work.

AB The area of Cebala-Borj-Touil, located in northeastern Tunisia, is irrigated with treated wastewater (TWW) for over 26years. The objectives of this study were to investigate the state of the hydrochemical characteristics and the heavy metals content and their spatial and seasonal variability. This area is affected by a shallow saline groundwater. Depth of this groundwater has been measured and water samples from 16 sites have been collected during two periods, September 2014 and March 2015, which correspond, respectively, to the post-irrigation period and before new cycle of irrigation, after the rainy season. Water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major ions as well as the trace elements Zn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Mn. Concerning the hydrological condition, the depth average was 1.31m in the summer and 0.70m in the winter and a maximum 2.01m at the end of the summer and a coefficient of variability (CV) about 35% in the summer and 78% in the winter indicating more high variability in the winter than in the summer. These values highlight bad drainage condition of the area. For chemical parameters, the water from both sampling periods is characterized by abundance of the major ions in the following order: Na+>>Mg2+>Ca2+>K+ and Cl->SO42->HCO3-. The mineral content of the groundwater is controlled by different factors: the water source, dilution in the wet season (March), and evaporation in the dry season (September). Spatially, the northeast and the southwest of the sector are more affected due to their relative low altitude. The content of heavy metals exceeds in some sites the values of the Tunisian standards of reuse. During both campaigns, the content of Cobalt (Co), Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe) exceeds the limits in the groundwater. For lead (Pb), the exceeding varies between September 2014 and March 2015. Cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) did not exceed Tunisian standards.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 27 pharmaceuticals with diverse physicochemical properties in a year-long monitoring campaign in the Chaobai River, China. The correlation between the distribution of pharmaceuticals in the river and the adjacent sources was elucidated. The results indicate that the agriculture area was the most polluted area with a median summed pharmaceutical concentration of 225.3 ng L-1, followed by the urban area and the mountain area with the corresponding values of 136.9 and 29.9 ng L-1, respectively. In terms of individual compounds, 22 out of 27 compounds were detected with concentrations ranging from <1 to 1972 ng L-1. Caffeine, carbamazepine, azithromycin, bezafibrate, metoprolol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and trimethoprim were pharmaceuticals with relatively high levels, with median concentrations ranging from 3.3 to 25.6 ng L-1 and detection frequencies ranging from 40% to 97%. Higher concentrations were mainly observed during cold seasons, with mean concentrations 1 to 52 times as high as those during warm seasons. Spatial analysis reveals that the pharmaceutical concentrations in different areas were impacted by different sources. A wastewater treatment plant was an important source in the urban area, while the agriculture area was impacted by various treated and untreated wastewater sources. The species sensitivity distribution model and risk quotient (RQ) method were combined in the ecological risk assessment. The results indicate that the multi-substance potentially affected fraction (msPAF) values of the sampling sites were below 0.04%, whereas nearly half of RQ values were higher than 1. Caffeine was proposed as a priority compound due to its high contribution rate (i.e., 79%) to the cumulative msPAF value, which implies that increased control and management of untreated wastewater sources along the Chaobai River is necessary.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products and drugs of abuse (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) indicates discharge of the effluent may not be suitable for the ecological balance of water ecosystems, such as wetlands. These PPCPs degrade water quality, considered as an ecosystem service (ES), provoking serious environmental impacts. Assessing the monetary value of PPCPs can be used as a proxy for environmental status of the ES of water quality (ESWQ). Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs of WWTPs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using directional distance function to measure the environmental avoided cost of removing salicylic acid (SA), methylparaben (MP), and THCOOH from WWTPs effluents discharged to Albufera Natural Park (Spain). The SA shows the highest shadow price (138.16 (sic)/mu g), followed by THCOOH (48.15 (sic)/mu g), and MP (30.66 (sic)/mu g). These values are interpreted as the environmental cost that would be avoided if SA, MP, and THCOOH were removed from WWTPs effluents. The non-parametric tests show that wastewater treatment technology, together with population equivalent (as a proxy of the size of urban areas) and seasonality are factors that influence shadow prices obtained. The approach used in this study highlights the use of PPCPs as status indicators of ESWQ quantified in monetary units. As a way to synthesize the essential concepts to implement the shadow prices approach, this study proposes a flow diagram to represent the relationship between all the factors involved in this work. The use of shadow prices methodology proves that removing SA, MP, and THCOOH is associated with a measurable improvement in the ESWQ of Albufera Natural Park. The findings of this study will be useful for plant managers in order to make decisions about the removal of PPCPs in WWTPs effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation can be used as a polishing treatment for degrading low-concentration pharmaceutical compounds recalcitrant to biological treatment, when large amounts of biodegradable organics have been previously removed by biological processes. Nevertheless, a systematic investigation has not yet been carried out for the coupled MBR + O-3 process through an experimental design approach. Thereby, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of different processes (membrane bioreactor-MBR, ozonation; and integrated MBR + O-3) for removing the antibiotic sulfadiazine (SDZ) from a synthetic wastewater matrix of industrial interest. The MBR behavior was monitored over seven months for different parameters (pH, temperature, permeate flow, transmembrane pressure, biological oxygen demand-BOD5, chemical oxygen demand-COD, total organic carbon-TOC, solids, and SDZ concentration). Additionally, the amount of SDZ sorbed onto the sludge was characterized, an issue which is scarcely addressed in most research works. Ozonation experiments were conducted in batch mode in a 2-L glass reactor provided with openings for gas flow. For the MBR + O-3 process, the effects of gas flow rate (0.1-1.5 L min(-1)) and inlet ozone concentration (4-12 mg L-1) on SDZ removal from the MBR permeate were systematically assessed using a Doehlert experimental design and response surface methodology. The results indicated that the MBR system showed good performance regarding organic matter removal efficiency, evaluated in terms of BOD5 (91.5%), COD (93.1%) and TOC (96.3%). In contrast, SDZ was partially removed (33%) by the MBR; in that case, the results indicated that the antibiotic was moderately removed with the sludge and partially biodegraded. In turn, the MBR + O-3 system showed excellent performance for removing SDZ (100%), TOC (97%), BOD5 (94%) and COD (97%). The statistical analysis confirmed that the influence of ozone gas flow rate upon the SDZ removal rate was more important than that exhibited by inlet ozone concentration. Therefore, coupling MBR and ozone can be considered a promising alternative for point source treatment of antibiotic production wastewater.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal of five pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the influent and effluent from both a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Samsun, Turkey was investigated. The concentrations of five pharmaceuticals, namely carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and triclosan, were reported in different seasons from autumn 2016 to summer 2017. The targeted PPCPs were analysed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS-MS). Results of the analysis of samples from influent of the DWTP show that the average concentrations of carbamazepine, ibuprofen and triclosan in different seasons were 0.385 mu g/L, 0.038 mu g/L and 0.342 mu g/L, respectively. The maximum concentration of carbamazepine was recorded in spring (0.84 mu g/L), while in summer, triclosan and ibuprofen with values of 0.155 mu g/L and 0.735 mu g/L were highest. However, the concentrations of other selected drugs were below the limit of detection (LOD) or were not detected at all. In the effluent of the DWTP, only triclosan was detected with a concentration 0.565 mu g/L in summer. Similarly, the average concentrations of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and triclosan in the influent of the WWTP in different seasons were 78.76 mu g/L, 2.77 mu g/L, 2.31 mu g/L and 0.58 mu g/L, respectively. Concentrations in the influent of the WWTP were also not negligible, where the maximum concentration of carbamazepine was observed in autumn, ibuprofen and triclosan in winter, paracetamol in spring, and diclofenac in summer. However, in the effluent of the WWTP, only carbamazepine was detected with an average concentration of 2.30 mu g/L. Seasonal variations in the presence/detection of PPCPs in both treatment plants were observed. Statistical tools were applied to verify the obtained results.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges, including the need to provide a cost-effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater, as well as adapting to the effects of climate change. The horizontal levee is a multi-benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes. The wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise, while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent. To assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions, a 0.7-ha experimental system was studied over a two-year period. The removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology; rapid and near complete removal (>97%) of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface, whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal. Removal of Fthorn coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology, with up to 99% removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow. For phosphate, removal was not as sensitive to hydrology, but significant removal (>83%) was still observed when overland flow was eliminated. Although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations, parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows, which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings. Rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints (i.e., the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow) and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface.

AB It has been recognized that numerous synthetic compounds like Bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenols (NP) are present in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) at levels of parts per billion (mu g L-1) or even parts per trillion (ng L-1) with a high potential to cause endocrine disruption in the aquatic environment. Constructed wetlands (CW) are a cost-effective wastewater treatment alternative with promising performance to treat these afore mentioned compounds. This research was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CW treatment of WWTP effluent for mitigating the effects endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). This research goal was accomplished by (1) quantifying the removal of BPA and NP in CWs; (2) isolating CW fungal strains and testing for laccase production; and (3) performing endocrine disruption (reproduction) bioassays using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Three pilot scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF-CW) were operated for eight weeks: one planted with Phragmites australis; one planted with Heliconia psitacorum; and one unplanted. The Heliconia CW showed a removal efficiency of 73.3(+/- 19%) and 62.8(+/- 20.1%) for BPA and NP, respectively; while the Phragmites CW demonstrated a similar removal for BPA (70.2 +/- 27%) and lower removal efficiency for NP 52.1(+/- 37.1%). The unplanted CW achieved 62.2 (+/- 33%) removal for BPA and 25.3(+/- 37%) removal for NP. Four of the eleven fungal strains isolated from the Heliconia-CW showed the capacity to produce laccase. Even though complete removal of EDCs was not achieved by the CWs, the bioassay confirmed a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in fly viability for all CWs, with Heliconia sp. being the most effective at mitigating adverse effects on first and second generational reproduction. This study showed that a CW planted with a native Heliconia sp. CW demonstrated a higher removal of endocrine disrupting compounds and better mitigation of reproductive disruption in the bioassay.

AB This study investigates the presence of the different classes of micro-pollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) (20 antibiotics, 8 analgesics and anti-inflammatories, 5 cytostatic agents, 7 beta-blockers, 4 lipid regulators, 13 psychiatrics, 1 antidiabetic, 1 receptor antagonist, 1 local anaesthetic, 1 antihypertensive and their 5 metabolites), hormones (8 compounds), X-ray contrast agents (6 compounds), benzotriazoles (3 compounds) and pesticides (6 compounds), and antibiotic resistance in hospital wastewater (HWW) of a medical faculty in Istanbul, Turkey. In addition, the seasonal variations of the selected PhACs and X-ray contrast agents and antibiotic resistance were evaluated for 2 years in a total of eight samples. In the PhACs, sulfamethoxazole and its metabolite (4 N-acethyl-sulfamethoxazole) in the antibiotic group and paracetamol in the analgesic and anti-inflammatory group were found at 100% of frequency and the highest concentrations as 35, 43 and 210 mu g/L, respectively. The mean concentrations of psychiatric compounds were found less than 0.25 mu g/L except carbamazepine (1.36 mu g/L). Bisphenol A in hormone group had the highest concentration up to 14 mu g/L. In the hormone group compounds, 17-alpha-Ethinylestradiol and 17-beta-Estradiol were detected at lower mean concentrations of 0.2 and 0.05 mu g/L, respectively. 1H-benzotriazole had the highest concentration with the mean concentration of 24.8 mu g/L in benzotriazole group compounds. The compounds in X-ray contrast agents group were noted as compounds detected at the highest concentration in HWW up to 3000 mu g/L. Antibiotic resistance against azithromycin, clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotics was observed around 50% in the winter period. The seasonal variation was detected for the most of the investigated PhACs, especially in antibiotic group which was in line with those significant differences in antibiotic resistance rates in the studied antibiotics between winter and summer seasons.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) contains a large number of pathogenic microorganisms; therefore disinfection is an indispensable unit for its treatment. This study compared the formation and formation potential of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and assessed the variations of acute toxicity for both of first physical treatment effluent (FPTE) and second biological treatment effluent (SBTE) of HWW under five different disinfection processes, including free chlorine (Cl-2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), ozone (O-3), ultraviolet (UV) and ultraviolet/chlorine (UV/Cl-2). Firstly, the optimal parameters of each disinfection process for FPTE and SBTE were determined respectively based on the required disinfection efficiency (i.e., controlling the concentration of fecal coliforms). The amounts of total DBPs in different disinfection processes under the optimal disinfectants dosage followed the order of Cl-2 > UV/Cl-2 > ClO2 > UV approximate to O-3, which demonstrated that the amount of DBPs formation was closely related to the dosage of chlorine. Meanwhile, the amounts of total disinfection by-products formation potential (DBPFP) under the optimal disinfectants dosage followed the order of UV/Cl-2 > UV approximate to Cl-2 > O-3 > ClO2. Besides, it was found that with the reduction of chlorine dosage, the formed DBPs in UV/Cl-2 disinfection process decreased. However, UV/Cl-2 disinfection process might degrade organic compounds into more DBPs precursors, leading to higher DBPFP than that in Cl-2 disinfection process. Significantly, some specific DBPFPs such as haloketones-FP (HKFP), chloral hydrate-FP (CHFP) and tri-chloronitromethane-FP (TCNMFP) in O-3 disinfection process were found higher than that in Cl-2 disinfection process, which could be attributed to the formation of O-3 oxidation by-products, for instance aldehydes, methyl ketones and trivalent nitrogen compounds. Additionally, apart from O-3, the growth inhibition rate of Chlorella vulgaris increased in all the other disinfection processes and the order of the acute toxicity in each disinfected effluent was consistent with that of DBPs formation.

AB Treated wastewater is increasingly used to meet agriculture's water needs; however, treated wastewater contains numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). With exposure and uptake of CECs, phytotoxicity and health of crop plants is of concern, but is poorly understood. This study evaluated the effect of low-dose, chronic exposure to a mixture of 10 CECs, including 4 antibiotics, 3 anti-inflammatory drugs, 1 antiepileptic, 1 beta-blocker, and 1 antimicrobial, on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cucumber (Cucumis sativa L.) plants. The CEC mixture was added in nutrient media at 1 to 20X of their typical levels in treated wastewater effluents. Biological endpoints including germination, growth, phytohormone homeostasis, and CEC bioaccumulation were determined. Exposure to the CEC mixture did not affect the germination rate of lettuce seeds, but stimulated root elongation and increased the root-to-shoot biomass ratio during a 7 d cultivation. A dose-dependent decrease in biomass was observed in cucumber seedling after a 30 d exposure, with the highest rate CEC treatment resulting in decreases of 51.2 +/- 20.9, 26.3 +/- 34.1, and 33.2 +/- 41.7% in the below-ground, above-ground, and total biomass, respectively. Levels of abscisic acid were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in the leaves, but decreased (p < 0.05) in the roots. The dose-response of auxin was characterized by a hormesis effect. A significant 6-fold increase in the stem auxin level was observed at the 1X CEC rate, followed by a decrease to 2-fold the control at the 20X rate. Leaf auxin concentrations also significantly increased at the 1X CEC rate to 16-fold, followed by a decrease at the highest CEC rate. The results of this study suggeste that chronic exposure to low levels of CEC mixtures may compromise the fitness of plants, and the impairments are underlined by alterations in hormone balances.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are mainly generated by chemical-synthetic industries and usually contain high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxicity. A novel lab-scale anaerobic bio-entrapped membrane reactor (AnBEMR) packed with bio-ball carriers was constructed and compared with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The aims of this study are to investigate the treatment performances and evaluate the stability of the membrane filtration of the AnBEMR and AnMBR under the conditions of a high organic loading rate (OLR), ranging from 8.0 to 36.7 kgCOD/m(3) d, and high total dissolved solids (TDS), ranging from 18,411 to 25,925 mg/L, in the treatment of chemical synthetic-based pharmaceutical wastewater. Four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 10.6, 14.1, 21.3, and 42.6 h were studied. Total COD (TCOD) removal efficiency of the AnBEMR ranged from 36.7% to 50.8% at an OLR of 8.7 +/- 0.7 kgCOD/m(3) d, while the highest OLR (34.0 +/- 2.7 kgCOD/m(3) d) only led to TCOD removal efficiency of 10.1-20.7%. The AnBEMR achieved approximately 5-10% higher TCOD removal efficiency than the AnMBR. The influences of HRT and TDS (salinity) were also studied. The results show an increase of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) with decreasing HRT in both MBRs, where extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), soluble microbial products (SMP) and suspended biomass concentration were significantly higher at the shortest HRT of 10.6 h, resulting in faster membrane fouling. Membrane fouling was improved in the AnBEMR (i.e., longer membrane filtration operating periods) due to the production of lower concentrations of EPS and SMP (protein and carbohydrate contents). Proteins, rather than carbohydrates, were the major component of EPS and SMP in both reactors. The study concludes that the application of the AnBEMR could achieve better treatment performance and reduced membrane fouling by producing lesser EPS, SMP, and suspended biomass concentration.

AB The sorption of various antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products in water onto didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB)-modified montmorillonite organoclay was studied. The extent of their sorption onto the organoclay was largely dependent on the DDAB content; the effect of DDAB modification on the sorption was also influenced by the hydrophobicity and/or net charge of the pharmaceutical. The binding constants of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined from their interaction with the DDAB molecules on the organoclay and were correlated with their aqueous-octanol distribution coefficients. Additionally, they were influenced by the net charge of the antibiotic. A wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin- and cephalosporin-type antibiotics, were sorbed on the organoclay and rapidly degraded under mild conditions (pH 7, 25 degrees C). The continuous sorption and degradation of penicillin G in a buffer solution and in synthesized hospital wastewater using an organoclay-packed column were demonstrated. The resulting effluent was free of penicillin, and contained only penicillin degradation products, suggesting the usefulness of DDAB-MT organoclay as a barrier material for controlling the diffusion of antibiotics.

AB Distilleries are among the most polluting industries because ethanol fermentation results in the discharge of large quantities of high-strength liquid effluents with high concentrations of organic matter and nitrogen compounds, low pH, high temperature, dark brown color, and high salinity. The most common method of managing this wastewater (distillery stillage) is to use it for soil conditioning, but this requires thickening the wastewater and may cause soil pollution due to its high nitrogen content. Therefore, treatment of distillery stillage is preferable. This review discusses individual biological and physico-chemical treatment methods and combined technologies. In addition, special attention is paid to valorization of distillery stillage, which is a valuable source of polysaccharides and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), as well as natural antioxidants, including polyphenols and other bioactive compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. New directions in improvement of valorization technologies are highlighted, including the search for new eutectic solvents for extracting these compounds. Such technologies are essential for sustainable development, which requires the use of management and valorization strategies for recovery of valuable compounds with minimal disposal of waste streams.

AB A pilot study for wastewater treatment in Exir pharmaceutical Co. (Borojerd, Iran) was conducted using a RO system with the capacity of 14.38 m(3)/d. A Filmtec TW30HP-4641 RO element (polyamide, thin-film composite) was used in this study. The pilot plant consists of two spiral-wound RO elements. The RO train was configured in series. Trial runs were conducted at different operating conditions including pressures, temperature and concentration.
   The pilot results showed that flux of water containing nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and sulfite was about 58 l/m(2) h. Taguchi method was employed for flux optimization. Analysis of the experiments indicated that the temperature of feed solution and transmembrane pressure have the most contribution in water flux. The flux was improved to 69 l/m(2) h by setting the control factors according to the Taguchi method. The technique showed that concentration of feed solution has the highest contribution in rejection of a solution containing nitrate, nitrite, sulfite and phosphate. After setting the control factor according to the Taguchi method rejection was enhanced to 99.9% for this case study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), wastewater indicators (WWIs), and pesticides (herein, Contaminants of Emerging Concern [CECs]) have been documented in surface waters throughout the world and have associated risks to aquatic life. While much research has focused on temperate and urbanized watersheds, less is known about CEC presence in semi-arid landscapes, where water availability is limited and populations are low. CEC presence in water and sediment is reported tot 21 sites in eight U.S. national parks in the northern Colorado Plateau region. From 2012 to 2016, at least one PPCP and/or WWI was detected at most sites on over half of sampling visits, indicating that CECs are not uncommon even in isolated areas. CEC detections were generally fewer and at lower concentrations than in urbanized or agricultural watersheds. Consistent with studies from other U.S. regions, the most frequently detected CECs in this study include DEET, caffeine, organophosphorus flame retardants, and bisphenol A in water and fecal indicators and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediment. Maximum concentrations in this study were generally below available water quality benchmarks, sediment quality guidelines, and risk assessment thresholds associated with vertebrates. Additional work is needed to assess the potential activity of hormones, which had high reporting limits in our study, and potential bioactivity of environmental concentrations for invertebrates, microbial communities, and algae. Potential sources of CEC contamination include upstream wastewater effluent discharges and National Park Service invasive-plant-control herbicide applications. CEC occurrence patterns and similarities between continuous and isolated flow locations suggest that direct contamination from individual visitors may also occur. While our data indicate there is little aquatic health risk associated with CECs at our sites, our results demonstrate the ubiquity of CECs on the landscape and a continued need for public outreach concerning resource-use ethics and the potential effects of upstream development.

AB Micropollutants have been linked to freshwater and human toxicity. Their occurrence in water bodies arises from different causes, including the discharge of effluents from conventional urban wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed for their removal. The addition of an advanced treatment process for this purpose will allow a toxicity reduction; however, such will also imply further resources and energy use resulting in other environmental impacts. Energy use is a particularly relevant hotspot of the environmental impacts associated with advanced treatments; therefore, solar-based treatments have great potential in this field. The present study assessed the environmental impacts via life cycle assessment (LCA) of five solar-based treatments - solar photolysis (with and without H2O2), photocatalysis using TiO2 (with and without H2O2) and circumneutral photo-Fenton - using a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector photoreactor to select the most suitable option for the removal of micropollutants (carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole; 5 mu g/L) from a secondary-treated wastewater. The ranking of solar treatments per highest generated impacts is, overall, as follows: circumneutral photo-Fenton > TiO2-P25/H2O2 > TiO2-P25 > solar/H2O2 > solar. While solar photolysis uses fewer resources and energy, thus generating lower environmental impacts, the common incomplete mineralization of the parent micropollutants implies that toxicity reduction cannot be guaranteed in this case. Aiming for a balance between ecotoxicity reduction and the impacts caused by the application of each technology, the solar TiO2-P25 treatment, which was here investigated by LCA for the first time to remove organic micropollutants from secondary-treated urban wastewater, appears to be the most suitable option at the studied conditions (and when TiO2 is reused at least 5 times). One of the environmental downfalls of the assessed treatments is the energy required to produce the chemicals, and so the importance of minimizing external energy use during the application of advanced treatment processes is reinforced.

AB The use of phosphate rock (PR), porcelanite (PC) and granite (GR) as natural locally abundant adsorbents compared with adsorption by granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing pharmaceuticals including sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfapyridine (SP) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from simulated wastewater was examined. The removal efficiency of the three pharmaceuticals was found to follow the consequences as: PC?GAC?PR?GR. The uptake efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was 91.51, 86.69, 69.51 and 53.97% onto PC, GAC, PR and GR, respectively, at initial concentration, pH, dosage and temperature of 50mg/L, 4, 0.5g/100mL and 30 degrees C, respectively. The removal efficiency of sulfapyridine was 84.71, 81.97, 63.25 and 49.71%, respectively. However, for carbamazepine it was 80.46, 79.61, 54.10 and 43.44%, respectively. Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) was carried out for PC before and after adsorption to determine the type of functional groups. Carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of PC were the major groups responsible for adsorption process. The effect of pH (5, 7 and 9), agitation speed (50-300rpm), dosage (0.1-1.4g/100mL), contact time (30-360min), temperature (10-60 degrees C) and initial concentration (25-100mg/L) are studied to find out the optimum conditions for removing the selected pharmaceuticals using PC. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic models had been used to fit the experimental data. From which Langmuir and pseudo-second order models were found to be more represented to the experiments with high correlation coefficient for the three pharmaceuticals. Article HighlightsThe demand for pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has nearly paralleled the escalating population.The prolonged use of PPCPs has led to evident emergence in the environment, creating the potential for adverse consequences to ecosystems and human health.Current water and wastewater treatment processes, such as advanced oxidation, photolysis, and adsorption have shown some success in the removal of SMX, SP, and CBZ.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) effluents represent an important source of contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds and their human metabolites. To better evaluate dedicated treatment of hospital effluents for pollutant mitigation, not only the parent compounds should be considered but also the intermediates generated during treatment. The metabolite metoprolol acid (MTPA) has been found in urban wastewaters at higher concentration than its parent compound metoprolol (MTP), being more recalcitrant to biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate degradation, transformation and sorption of the beta-blocker MTP, and its recalcitrant metabolite MTPA, during water treatment based on the fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus. Fourteen intermediates were identified in MTP biotransformation while five of them also attributed to MTPA biodegradation and two to MTPA only. Their identification allowed their correlation in separate biotransformation pathways suggested. The highest degradation rate of metoprolol (up to 51%) and metoprolol acid (almost 77%) was found after 15-days treatment with Ganoderma lucidum, with an increase in toxicity up to 29% and 4%, respectively. This fungus was further selected for treating real HWW in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor (FBB). Treated wastewater and fungal biomass samples were used to evaluate the distribution of the target compounds and the intermediates identified between solid and liquid phases. While similar elimination capabilities were observed for the removal of metoprolol, and even higher for its persistent metabolite metoprolol acid, the extent on compound transformation diminished considerably compared with the study treating purified water: a high level of the persistent alpha-HMTP and TP240 were still present in effluent samples (15% and 6%, respectively), being both TPs present at high proportion (up to 28%) in fungal biomass. This is the first time that pharmaceutical TPs have been investigated in the fungal biomass. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biotransformation of diclofenac during wastewater treatment was investigated. Attached growth biomass from a carrier-filled compartment of a hybrid-MBBR at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland was used to test the biotransformation. Laboratory-scale incubation experiments were performed with diclofenac and carriers and high-resolution LC-QTof-MS was implemented to monitor the biotransformation. Up to 20 diclofenac transformation products (TPs) were detected. Tentative structures were proposed for 16 of the TPs after characterization by MS2 fragmentation and/or inferring the structure from the transformation pathway and the molecular formula given by the high resolution ionic mass. The remaining four TPs were unambiguously identified via analytical reference standards. The postulated reactions forming the TPs were: hydroxylation, decarboxylation, oxidation, amide formation, ring-opening and reductive dechlorination. Incubation experiments of individual TPs, those which were available as reference standards, provided a deeper look into the transformation pathways. It was found that the transformation consists of four main pathways but no pathway accounted for a clear majority of the transformation. A 10-day monitoring campaign of the full-scale plant confirmed an, 88% removal of diclofenac (from approximately 1.6 mu g/L in WWTP influent) and the formation of TPs as found in the laboratory was observed. One of the TPs, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-indolinone detected at concentrations of around 0.25 mu g/L in WWTP effluent, accounting for 16% of the influent diclofenac concentration. The biotransformation of carriers was compared, to a second WWTP not utilising carriers. It was found that, in contact with activated sludge, similar hydroxylation and decarboxylation reactions occurred but at much slower rates, whereas some reactions, e.g. reductive dechlorination, were not detected at all. Finally, incubation experiments were performed with attached growth biomass from a third WWTP with a similar process configuration to Bad Ragaz WWTP. A similarly effective removal of diclofenac was found with a similar presence of TPs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds end up in wastewater treatment plants but little is known on their effect towards the different microbial groups in anaerobic communities. In this work, the effect of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (CIP), the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Diclofenac (DCF) and Ibuprofen (IBP), and the hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), on the activity of acetogens and methanogens in anaerobic communities, was investigated. Microbial communities were more affected by CIP, followed by EE2, DCF and IBP, but the response of the different microbial groups was dissimilar. For concentrations of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/L, the specific methanogenic activity was not affected. Acetogenic bacteria were sensitive to CIP concentrations above 1 mg/L, while DCF and EE2 toxicity was only detected for concentrations higher than 10 mg/L, and IBP had no effect in all concentrations tested. Acetoclastic methanogens showed higher sensitivity to the presence of these micropollutants, being affect by all the tested pharmaceutical compounds although at different degrees. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens were not affected by any concentration, indicating their lower sensitivity to these compounds when compared to acetoclasts and acetogens.

AB Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase, probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main biological removal processes.

AB Recent research has suggested that the fate of biologically active compounds (BACs) originating from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants is fundamentally different from that of similar compounds released from nonpoint sources through runoff from agricultural landscapes. Downstream from wastewater treatment plants, BACs will degrade via a variety of mechanisms; however, their concentration in the water adjacent to the point of discharge may not decrease over time, as the compounds are continually released. In contrast, in agricultural systems, BACs are episodically introduced to surface water during snowmelt and rainstorm events, and under these circumstances, may be found in water for only hours or days after a storm event. Recent research in our laboratories as well as others, has suggested that sediments play an important role in the persistence of herbicides and steroids in watersheds after nonpoint source loading events. Conceptually, the sediment serves as both a sink and a source, equilibrating with BACs during storm events then slowly releasing them back into the water over time, long after the initial pulse of chemicals has moved downstream.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfadiazine (SD), a widely used antibiotic chemical, has been detected in contaminated water and soils. Manganese dioxides are common minerals with a high redox potential and can act as active oxidants for SD degradation in wastewater treatment.
   RESULTS: alpha-MnO2 was used to promote SD oxidative degradation. At pH 4.6 and 25 degrees C, 92.7% of SD (0.02 mmol L-1) was degraded by 1.0 g L-1 alpha-MnO2. SO42- was detected as the inorganic end product from the mineralization of SD. The ecological toxicity index of average well color development (AWCD) in SD solution was 2.01 after the solution was degraded by alpha-MnO2 for 2 h, while the AWCD was 0.48 for the solution without alpha-MnO2 treatment. The degradation rate of SD can be improved by increasing the dosages of alpha-MnO2 and the reaction temperature, but the rate was limited by increased initial SD concentration and reaction pH.
   CONCLUSION: SD can be effectively degraded and mineralized with alpha-MnO2. These results are helpful for removing antibiotics by manganese dioxides in the environment, and also for exploring new technology for wastewater treatment. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The implementation of autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes for the removal of nitrogen from municipal wastewater (known as "mainstream anammox") bears the potential to bring wastewater treatment plants close to energy autarky. The aim of the present work was to assess the long-term stability of partial nitritationianammox (PN/A) processes operating at low temperatures and their reliability in meeting nitrogen concentrations in the range of typical discharge limits below 2 mgNH(4)-(N)center dot L-1 and 10 mg(Ntot)center dot L-1. Two main 12-L sequencing batch reactors were operated in parallel for PN/A on aerobically pre-treated municipal wastewater (21 +/- 5 mg(NH4)-N center dot L-1 and residual 69 +/- 19 Mg-CODtot center dot L-1) for more than one year, including over 5 months at 15 degrees C. The two systems consisted of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and a hybrid MBBR (H-MBBR) with flocculent biomass. Operation at limiting oxygen concentrations (0.15-0.18 mg(O2)center dot L-1) allowed stable suppression of the activity of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria at 15 degrees C with a production of nitrate over ammonium consumed as low as 16% in the MBBR. Promising nitrogen removal rates of 20-40 mg(N)center dot L-1 center dot d(-1) were maintained at hydraulic retention times of 14 h. Stable ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies over 90% and 70% respectively were achieved. Both reactors reached average concentrations of total nitrogen below 10 mg(N)center dot L-1 in their effluents, even down to 6 mg(N)center dot L-1 for the MBBR, with an ammonium concentration of 2 mg(N)center dot L-1 (set as operational threshold to stop aeration). Furthermore, the two PN/A systems performed almost identically with respect to the biological removal of organic micropollutants and, importantly, to a similar extent as conventional treatments. A sudden temperature drop to 11 degrees C resulted in significant suppression of anammox activity, although this was rapidly recovered after the temperature was increased back to 15 degrees C. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing revealed that the anammox guild of the bacterial communities of the two systems was composed of the genus "Candidatus Brocadia". The potential of PN/A systems to compete with conventional treatments for biological nutrients removal both in terms of removal rates and overall effluent quality was proven. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB Antibiotics in water bodies are emerging as an alarming new pollutant because of its persistent and recombinant nature. In recent period of human lifestyle, pharmaceutical products play a vital role in many perspectives. Due to this unpredictable usage of products, the unreacted components release into waterbodies in trace quantities. Eventhough these trace quantities initiate a crisis of developing resistant antibacterial strains which pose health risks to humans and animals. This work reports the batch adsorption of a fluoroquinolone, a fourth-generation antibiotic compound by a biosorbent made by acid-treated tamarind shells. The shells were treated with zinc chloride and hydrochloric acid. The characterization of biosorbent was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The optimized adsorption parameters of time, pH and temperature were 30 minutes, 6 and 60 degrees C. The adsorbent can be reused up to seven times with negligible loss in its adsorption capacity. Adsorption followed by Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin model where used to determine the correlation coefficient. Pseudo first-order, second-order and intra-particle kinetic model were used to fit the experimental data. The results are best described by pseudo second-order denoting chemisorption and Freundlich isotherm model describing multilayer adsorption.Novelty Statement The proposed work is to investigate about improved tamarind shell as biomass used in the removal unreacted PPCP components that have been released into aquatic environment. The novelty of this paper lies in that it puts forward a better resource utilization method for treating PPCP component wastewater, and studies the method theoretically from the perspective of mechanism and proves its feasibility. Identifying the maximum adsorption of antibiotic component from wastewater under different conditions and finding the optimum range. In addition to the existing literatures, this study has compared the adsorption efficiency of raw and treated adsorbent material prepared using Tamarind shell.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) include a variety of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and hormones commonly detected in surfacewaters. Human activities, such as wastewater treatment and discharge, contribute to the distribution of CECs in water, but other sources and pathways are less frequently examined. This study aimed to identify anthropogenic activities and environmental characteristics associated with the presence of CECs, previously determined to be of high priority for further research and mitigation, in rural inland lakes in northeastern Minnesota, United States. The setting for this study consisted of 21 lakes located within both the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and the 1854 Ceded Territory, where subsistence hunting and fishing are important to the cultural heritage of the indigenous community. We used data pertaining to numbers of buildings, healthcare facilities, wastewater treatment plants, impervious surfaces, and wetlands within defined areas surrounding the lakes as potential predictors of the detection of high priority CECs in water, sediment, and fish. Separate models were run for each contaminant detected in each sample media. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models to account for both predictor selection and parameter estimation for CEC detection. Across contaminants and sample media, the percentage of impervious surface was consistently positively associated with CEC detection. Number of buildings in the surrounding area was often negatively associated with CEC detection, though nonsignificant. Surrounding population, presence of wastewater treatment facilities, and percentage of wetlands in surrounding areas were positively, but inconsistently, associated with CECs, while catchment area and healthcare centers were generally not associated. The results of this study highlight human activities and environmental characteristics associated with CEC presence in a rural area, informing future work regarding specific sources and transport pathways. We also demonstrate the utility of LASSO modeling in the identification of these important relationships. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental pollution is increasing day by day due to anthropogenic activities and different types of toxic contaminants such as heavy metals, chemicals, dyes, pesticides etc enter the environment from different sources such as municipal, industries and agricultural. Among wastewater treatment techniques, bioremediation is one of promising techniques, which utilize the inherent biological mechanism of plant and microorganism for the remediation of diverse pollutants. Microalgae have been applied to mitigate the toxic and recalcitrant pollutants in the effluents. Microalgae have the capacity to remove different types of contaminants through different methods such as biosorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation. It has been observed that microalgae can remove the pollutants originated from the domestic effluents, agricultural runoffs, textile, leather, pharmaceutical and electroplating industries etc. Additionally, the microalgae have the ability to mitigate the carbon dioxide in their growth process and utilize the micronutrients in the effluents. This review paper critically analysed the application of microalgae for the remediation of diverse types of pollutants commonly present in the environment through different mechanisms.

AB (1) Background: Environmental contamination with antibiotics is particularly serious because the usual methods used in wastewater treatment plants turn out to be insufficient or ineffective. An interesting idea is to support natural biodegradation processes with physicochemical methods as well as with bioaugmentation with efficient microbial degraders. Hence, the aim of our study is evaluation of the effectiveness of different methods of nitrofurazone (NFZ) degradation: photolysis and photodegradation in the presence of two photocatalysts, the commercial TiO2-P25 and a self-obtained Fe3O4@SiO2/TiO2 magnetic photocatalyst. (2) Methods: The chemical nature of the photocatalysis products was investigated using a spectrometric method, and then, they were subjected to biodegradation using the strain Achromobacter xylosoxidans NFZ2. Additionally, the effects of the photodegradation products on bacterial cell surface properties and membranes were studied. (3) Results: Photocatalysis with TiO2-P25 allowed reduction of NFZ by over 90%, demonstrating that this method is twice as effective as photolysis alone. Moreover, the bacterial strain used proved to be effective in the removal of NFZ, as well as its intermediates. (4) Conclusions: The results indicated that photocatalysis alone or coupled with biodegradation with the strain A. xylosoxidans NFZ2 leads to efficient degradation and almost complete mineralization of NFZ.

AB Etoposide susceptibility to microbiological breakdown was studied in a batch biotransformation system, in the presence or absence of artificial wastewater containing nutrients, salts and activated sludge at two concentration levels. The primary focus of the present study was to study etoposide transformation products by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Data-dependent experiments combining full-scan MS data with product ion spectra were acquired to identify the molecular ions of etoposide transformation products, to propose the molecular formulae and to elucidate their chemical structures. Due to the complexity of the matrix, visual inspection of the chromatograms showed no clear differences between the controls and the treated samples. Therefore, the software package MZmine was used to facilitate the identification of the transformation products and speed up the data analysis. In total, we propose five transformation products; among them, four are described as etoposide transformation products for the first time. Even though the chemical structures of these new compounds cannot be confirmed due to the lack of standards, their molecular formulae can be used to target them in monitoring studies.

AB Individual treatment processes like biological treatment or ozonation have their limitations for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents with high organic matter concentrations (i.e. 17 mg TOC/L). These limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost-effective pharmaceutical removal. A three-step biological-ozone-biological (BO3B) treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent. The first biological step removed 38% of ozone scavenging TOC, thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation. Complementariness between biological and ozone treatment, i.e. targeting different pharmaceuticals, resulted in cost-effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall BO3B process. At a low ozone dose of 0.2 g O-3/g TOC and an HRT of 1.46 h in the biological reactors, the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85%, except for metoprolol (60%). Testing various ozone doses and HRTs revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0.1 g O3/g TOC and an HRT of 0.3 h. At HRTs of 0.47 and 1.46 h easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95% removed by biological treatment. The biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0.4 g O-3/g TOC. Ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17% TOC removal was found. No appreciable acute toxicity towards D. magna, P. subcapitata and Vi fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual BO3B reactors. The BO3B process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the Netherlands by less than 10%. Overall, the BO3B process is a cost-effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The installation of reactive barriers, e.g. with compost or other organic materials at MAR facilities, may improve pollutant removal. To link pollutant transformation processes and microbiology in reactive barriers, we simulated infiltration through different sand-compost mixtures using laboratory columns with depth-specific sampling of water and barrier material. We also evaluated the effect of inoculation with activated sludge. Our focus was on the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and nitrogen species, with parallel monitoring of the development of microbial communities. During 17 weeks of operation, the columns were fed with synthetic wastewater containing five organic micropollutants (1-2 mu g/L each) and ammonium (2 mg N/L). Unique communities developed in the columns in relation to barrier material, with high effects of compost addition and minor effect of inoculation. Removal of the micropollutant paracetamol (acetaminophen) occurred in all columns, while sulfamethoxazole was only removed in columns with 50% compost. By contrast, limited removal was observed for sulfadiazine, carbamazepine and diuron, with the latter two displaying transient removal, attributed sorption. Oxygen was depleted within the top few cm of the columns when compost was present, but this was sufficient to remove all ammonium through nitrification. The fate of accumulated nitrate at deeper layers depended on the fraction of compost, with more compost leading to removal of nitrate by denitrification, but also by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, hampering the overall nitrogen removal efficiency. Introducing compost as reactive barrier in MAR facilities has a large effect on the microbial communities and processes, but whether it will provide overall cleaner water to the underlying aquifer is uncertain and will depend very much on the type of pollutant.

AB Psychoactive pharmaceuticals release into the environment and reach humans through a variety of routes, including sewage, drinking water, contaminated irrigation water, biosolids, soil, and food. It was assumed that these compounds via the environment could induce genetic effects in the etiology of human neurological disorders. With the help of in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches, we demonstrated that psychoactive pharmaceuticals in drinking water can cross maternal biological barriers and alter in vitro molecular and genetic mechanisms that potentially have a key role in the development, growth, and regulation of neuronal systems during embryonic brain development.

AB The aim of this study was to determine effects on methane potential and overall sludge quality from two different sludge pre-treatment technologies (ozonation high/low dosage and thermal treatment 55/70 degrees C). In general both treatments produced increased methane potential. Thermal treatment resulted in higher chemical oxygen demand (COD)-solubilisation, while the highest volatile fatty acids (VFA) increase was obtained with ozonation. Sludges had inhibiting effects in a barley seed germination assay and a yeast oestrogen screen both before and after pre-treatment, but inhibition was reduced by ozone treatment and digestion. No statistical significant reduction in concentrations of included pharmaceuticals could be observed.

The main photoproducts, isolated by chromatographic techniques, have been identified by spectroscopic means. Photoisomerization, photocyclization and, to a lesser extent, photooxygenation appear to be involved in the degradation of the drug. The acute and chronic toxicity of the parent drug and its photoproducts were tested on non-target aquatic organisms (Brachionus calyciflorus, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia). Exposure to all the compounds induced mainly chronic effects without significant differences among the parental and derivative compounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents experimental results on the catalytic effect of volcanic sand on the simultaneous removal of naproxen, ketoprofen, and cimetidine by ozonation. Catalyst characterization included XRD, EDX, XRF, SEM and physisorption analysis. Removal assays at laboratory scale in a semi-batch reactor showed enhanced removal by the presence of the catalyst at pH 4, but no difference was found at higher pH values. Furthermore, the immobilization of different amounts of TiO2 (2.5 % and 5.0 %) on the sand surface revealed that TiO2 exerted an adverse effect on the catalytic activity at pH 4, lowering ketoprofen removal by up to 41.3 %. Likewise, the highest and fastest removal at pH 4 was obtained using a catalyst dose of 1 g/L and dosing ozone at 15 mg/L (72.5 % ketoprofen; 90.7 % total pharmaceuticals), reaching more than 80 % total elimination after only one minute of treatment. Catalyst reusability evaluated over 5 cycles demonstrated efficient elimination of the pharmaceuticals, with only slight decrease in ketoprofen elimination. Finally, heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen was applied in a real wastewater matrix, obtaining a removal of 75.9 % after 40 min of reaction; this represents a similar efficiency to that achieved in synthetic wastewater.

AB Amine-containing pharmaceuticals are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and ambient aquatic environments. They can usually be degraded by manganese oxide (MnO2), which is a common natural oxidant in soils. Surfactants often coexist with pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Some amine-containing pharmaceuticals, such as diclofenac (DIC), are acidic and are thus ionic compounds in neutral conditions. These compounds, therefore, have similar properties to surfactants. Surfactants, thus, may influence the adsorption and degradation processes of DIC by MnO2. The effect of the type of surfactant on the degradation of DIC by MnO(2)was investigated in this study with the addition of two common biodegradable surfactants (cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)). The results indicated that the cationic surfactant (CTAB) significantly increased the degradation rate in neutral and alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the anionic surfactant (SDS) slightly increased the DIC removal rate in an acidic condition but significantly decreased the removal in neutral and alkaline conditions. Coexisting cationic surfactants not only influenced the kinetics but also altered the transformation mechanism of DIC by MnO2. Decarboxylation is the main transformation mechanism of DIC in the presence of CTAB, while both decarboxylation and hydroxylation are the main transformation mechanisms in the absence of CTAB.

AB An integrated anaerobic fluidized-bed membrane bioreactor (IAFMBR) was investigated to treat synthetic high-strength benzothiazole wastewater (50 mg/L) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24, 18, and 12 h. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency (from 93.6% to 90.9%), the methane percentage (from 70.9% to 69.27%), and the methane yield (from 0.309 m(3) CH,/kg.CODremoved to 0.316 m(3) CH4/kg.CODremoved) were not affected by decreasing HRTs. However, it had an adverse effect on membrane fouling (decreasing service period from 5.3 d to 3.2 d) and benzothiazole removal efficiency (reducing it from 97.5% to 82.3%). Three sludge samples that were collected on day 185, day 240, and day 297 were analyzed using an Illumina (R) MiSeq platform. It is striking that the dominant genus of archaea was always Methanosaeta despite of HRTs. The proportions of Methanosaeta were 80.6% (HRT 24), 91.9% (HRT 18), and 91.2% (HRT 12). The dominant bacterial genera were Clostridium in proportions of 23.9% (HRT 24), 16.4% (HRT 18), and 15.3% (HRT 12), respectively.

AB Adsorption mechanism of diclofenac and isoproturon onto activated carbon has been proposed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Adsorption capacity and optimum adsorption isotherms were predicted by nonlinear regression method. Different kinetic equations, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion model and Bangham kinetic model, were applied to study the adsorption kinetics of emerging contaminants on activated carbon in two aqueous matrices.

AB The main objective of the present study is to prioritize those pharmaceuticals that have higher chances to be detected in water due to incomplete removal in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). To do so, the total consumption of pharmaceuticals in Catalonia (NE Spain) were compiled to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in wastewater effluents and in river water. PECs were estimated using publicly available consumption data in the period of 2013-2016 for a suite of 165 compounds. The selected compounds were based on generic pharmaceuticals with emphasis on drugs consumed by people aged 65 or over as they represent the age group with the highest consumption of pharmaceuticals.The mean total consumption of pharmaceuticals in the period studied was of 623 +/- 3 t per year. Paracetamol, metformin and ibuprofen were the most administered drugs although the highest PEC values corresponded to metformin, amoxicillin and metamizole. Finally, predicted environmental levels together with acute and chronic toxicological data allowed estimating the risks of these compounds. Amoxicillin is expected to pose adverse effects for cyanobacteria, whereas metformin and ibuprofen pose a small potential for adverse effects to invertebrates and fish, respectively.

AB We demonstrate the simultaneous extraction of phosphorus and clean water from digested sludge centrate using a forward osmosis (FO)-membrane distillation (MD) hybrid process. In this FO-MD hybrid process, FO concentrates orthophosphate and ammonium for subsequent phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O), while MD is used to recover the draw solution and extract clean water from the digested sludge centrate. A decline in water flux was observed during the FO process, but fouling was largely reversible after a brief, simple membrane flushing using deionized water. The FO process also provides an effective pretreatment capacity to the subsequent MD process, which exhibited stable water flux. The use of MgCl2 as the draw solute for the FO process is another novel aspect of the system. The reverse salt flux of magnesium to the concentrated digested sludge across the FO membrane and the diffusion of protons away from the digested sludge create favorable conditions for the formation of struvite crystals. The precipitates obtained in the hybrid process were verified to be struvite crystals by examining the crystal morphology, element composition, and crystal structure. Results reported here highlight the potential and robustness of the FO-MD hybrid process for extracting phosphorus from wastewater.

AB Urine source separation has been proposed as a more sustainable approach to wastewater management than treating combined wastewater streams. One such benefit of urine source separation is nutrient recovery, which has primarily focused on struvite precipitation for recovery of phosphorus. There is no previous research investigating phosphorus recovery from human urine by ion-exchange. Accordingly, the goal of this research was to provide an improved understanding of phosphate removal by ion-exchange using a hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin. The specific objectives of this research were to evaluate phosphate removal using HAIX resin in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine in terms of (1) kinetic tests, (2) equilibrium tests, (3) sorption models, (4) competition among sulfate, chloride, and phosphate, and (5) pharmaceutical co-removal. Batch experiments were conducted using different compositions of synthetic urine. HAD: resin consisted of a strong-base anion exchange resin impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide nanoparticles. The major results of phosphate removal from urine using HAIX resin were rapid removal in 5 min or less, high removal up to 97%, similar ion-exchange behavior in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine, no affect by sulfate on phosphate removal, and co-removal of pharmaceutical and phosphate.

AB Trimethoprim (TMP), one of the antibacterials most frequently detected in municipal wastewaters and surface waters, reacts readily with free available chlorine (i.e., HOCl) at pH values between 3 and 9 (e.g., the pH-dependent apparent second-order rate constant, k"(app) = 5.6 x 10(1) M-1 s(-1), at pH 7). Solution pH significantly affects the rate of TMP reaction with HOCl. The reaction kinetics in reagent water systems can be well described by a second-order kinetic model incorporating speciation of both reactants and accounting for acid-mediated halogenation of TMP's 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety. Studies with the substructure model compounds 2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene show that TMP reacts with HOCl primarily via its 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety at acidic pH, and with its 2,4-diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at circumneutral and alkaline pH. LC/MS product analyses indicate that the TMP structure is not substantially degraded upon reactions with HOCl. Instead, a wide variety of (multi) chlorinated and hydroxylated products are formed. Experiments with real drinking water and wastewater matrixes confirmed that substantial TMP transformation can be expected for conditions typical of wastewater and drinking water chlorination.

AB In the present work, the effectiveness of switchable hydrophobicity solvents (SHSs) as extraction solvent (N,N-Dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCA), N,N-Diethylethanamine (TEA), and N,N-Benzyldimethylamine (DMBA)) for a variety of emerging pollutants was evaluated. Different pharmaceutical products (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormones, and triclosan) were selected as target analytes, covering a range of hydrophobicity (LogP) of 3.1 to 5.2. The optimized procedure was used for the determination of the target pharmaceutical analytes in wastewater samples as model analytical problem. Absolute extraction recoveries were in the range of 51% to 103%. The presented method permits the determination of the target analytes at the low ng mL(-1) level, ranging from 0.8 to 5.9 (except for Triclosan, 106 ng mL(-1)) with good precision (relative standard deviation lower than 6%) using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with ultraviolet (DAD) and fluorescence (FLR) detection. The microextraction alternative resulted in a fast, simple, and green method for a wide variety of analytes in environmental water sample. The results suggest that this type of solvent turns out to be a great alternative for the determination of different analytes in relatively complex water samples.

AB The potential health effects associated with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have motivated regulatory initiatives and deployment of energy- and chemical-intensive advanced treatment processes for their removal. This study evaluates life cycle environmental and health impacts associated with advanced CEC removal processes, encompassing both the benefits of improved effluent quality as well as emissions from upstream activities. A total of 64 treatment configurations were designed and modeled for treating typical U.S. medium-strength wastewater, covering three policy-relevant representative levels of carbon and nutrient removal, with and without additional tertiary CEC removal. The USEtox model was used to calculate characterization factors of several CECs with missing values. Stochastic uncertainty analysis considered variability in influent water quality and uncertainty in CEC toxicity and associated characterization factors. Results show that advanced tertiary treatment can simultaneously reduce nutrients and CECs in effluents to specified limits, but these direct water quality benefits were outweighed by even greater increases in indirect impacts for the toxicity-related metrics, even when considering order-of-magnitude uncertainties for CEC characterization factors. Future work should consider water quality aspects not currently captured in life cycle impact assessment, such as endocrine disruption, in order to evaluate the full policy implications of the CEC removal.

AB The transport and concentration distribution of sludge in a high performance anaerobic bioreactor, termed spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor (SSSAB), was directly related to its effective retention of the biomass, as well as its stable operation under high loading rate. Therefore, the transport and concentration distribution of sludge in a lab-scale SSSAB were modelled and investigated in comparison with a same-sized upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBR), and two larger scale SSSABs were used for validating and expanding the application field of the model. The results showed that the model established can effectively describe the sludge transport and concentration distribution in the SSSAB. The SSSAB performed relatively low sludge transport factor compared with the UASBR, proving the favorable sludge retention ability of the SSSAB. The sludge transport factor remained constant with the scale-up of the SSSAB. The model could predict the sludge concentration distribution of a 130 L SSSAB treating traditional Chinese pharmaceutical wastewater. Also, the model can be applied to the SSSAB treating other types of wastewater with biogas production fractions in zone 1 and 2 (f(1) and f(2)) at the ranges of 0.19-0.41 and 0.18-0.41, respectively.

AB The reuse of treated municipal wastewater for crop irrigation is a necessity in arid and semiarid regions but a potential entrance for emerging contaminants into the food chain. However, little attention has yet been paid to the detection of micropollutants and possible metabolites in vegetables grown under realistic field conditions. In this study, the uptake of 28 micropollutants and carbamazepine metabolites in 10 different field-grown vegetable species (among them carrot, lettuce, potato, and zucchini) from Jordan was studied. A total of 12 micropollutants and six carbamazepine metabolites, four of which have never been analyzed before in plant-uptake studies, could be detected in all of the samples in concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 216 ng per g of dry weight. In edible tissues, the total concentration of micropollutants decreased in the order of leafy (247-533) > root (73-126) > fruit-bearing (5-76 ng per g of dry weight) vegetables. A preliminary health-risk assessment for nine compounds according to the TTC concept shows no risk for seven of the micropollutats; for ciprofloxacin and 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, however, more-specific toxicity data would be required for a refined risk assessment.

AB Electrochemical degradation of gentamicin was achieved using a laboratory scale electrochemical reactor by optimizing pH, current density and treatment time. A two step statistical optimization was performed as per factorial design and center composite design (CCD). A Pareto chart was used for selecting statistically significant effects and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table indicated significant curvature. Thus adding additional experimental runs improved the model fitting through a second order model. Maximum degradation was predicted at a pH of 6.7, 70 A m(-2) and 45 min. The experimental data fitted well through a reduced quadratic model with R-2 equal to 0.945. The toxicity of degradation products as determined by disc diffusion as say employing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was found to be reduced by 55%. The degradation pathway of gentamicin was studied using mass spectral (MS) analysis. Pure gentamicin showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 478 ([M + 1](+)), and after addition of NaCl as electrolyte, the mass peak was observed at m/z 523. After 15 min of electrochemical treatment, a new peak appeared at m/z 316 due to the loss of one pyran moiety. After 45 min of electrochemical treatment, another peak appeared at m/z of 478 due to loss of two Na+ from gentamicin.

AB Newly observed presence of 'emerging contaminants', defined also Compounds of Emerging Concern, chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are poorly understood has been amply reported in wastewater and aquatic environments. 'Conventional' water pollutants have been described for decades and their impact on human health and the environment are known; effective technologies for their removal are well established. This is not the case for most emerging contaminants: no effective removal technologies have been discovered to date, to simultaneously remove all of the concerned contaminants, even though some techniques have been demonstrated to remove some contaminants to a certain extent. Radiation processing using electron beam (EB) accelerators and gamma irradiators has shown promising results in many water-related applications. Radiation/EB processing is an additive-free process using short lived reactive species formed during radiolysis of water for decomposition of pollutants. Isolated studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of radiation, alone or in combination with other treatments, in the decomposition of refractory organic compounds in aqueous solutions and in the removal or inactivation, of microorganisms and parasites. This review paper on this specific technology summarizes results of reported applications.

AB This study focuses on the fate of pharmaceuticals discharged into an estuarine environment, particularly into the Turbidity Maximum Zone (TMZ). Batch experiments were set up to investigate the factors regulating the degradation of 53 selected pharmaceuticals. Treated effluents from Bordeaux city (France) were mixed with water from the estuarine Garonne River during 4 weeks under 6 characterized conditions in order to assess the influence of suspended particulates, sterilization, untreated wastewater input and dilution on the degradation kinetics. Of the 53 pharmaceuticals monitored, 43 were quantified at the initial time. Only 7 exhibited a persistent behavior (e.g. carbamazepine, meprobamate) while biotic degradation was shown to be the main attenuation process for 38 molecules (e.g. abacavir, ibuprofen highly degradable). Degradation was significantly enhanced by increasing concentrations of suspended solids. A persistence index based on the half-lives of the compounds has been calculated for each of the 43 pharmaceuticals to provide a practical estimate of their relative stability. The stability of pharmaceuticals in estuarine environments is likely to be highly variable and attenuated primarily by changes in suspended solid concentration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Veterinary antibiotics such as sulfonamides were detected in the environment from animal excreta in soils, contaminating soil surface and then groundwaters by percolation. The contaminated waters can enter in this way into drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). On the other hand, direct wastewaters from humans or animals or pharmaceutical industries disposals are discharged in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). These water and wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove highly polar micropollutants like antibiotics. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange constitutes a promising technique for its low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This work studies the removal of sulfamethazine (SMZ). The SMZ retention capacity of an anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP500, was determined. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied and equilibrium constants and diffusivity values were obtained using different models. Load and elution breakthrough curves were plotted to evaluate ion exchange operation in a fixed bed column. In the elution step, 100% SMZ was recovered in all cycles and could be concentrated up to twelve times, thus facilitating its final treatment or removal. Load and elution breakthrough curves were simulated using a fixed bed model in which axial dispersion was considered the parameter model fit.

AB The aims of this work were to isolate a microorganism from the wastewater of pharmaceutical industries, to examine the difference in its growth utilization of 2,4-dichlorophenol as the sole carbon source pre and post-exposure to UV-irradiation and to investigate its efficiency of biodegradation at different temperatures and pH values using a laboratory benchtop bioreactor. Sludge was obtained from the wastewater and standard isolation and identification techniques were used to identify the microorganism. The biodegradability was tested at temperatures of 25, 30, 35 and 40 C and at pH values of 6.5, 7.0 and 8.0. The results indicated that the isolated microorganism was Pseudomonas alcaligenes, the maximum concentration of 2,4-dichlorophenol which bacteria can grow on before UV-irradiation was 220 and 380 mg/l after UV-irradiation. The variation in temperature values resulted in different degradation rates and that the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol increased at a higher pH value. From these results, it is concluded that P. alcaligenes can be used for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol, UV-irradiation can be successfully used for the improvement of P. alcaligenes biodegradability and that the best 2,4-dichlorophenol biodegradation was at 35 degrees C and pH 7.

AB Antibiotics are frequently used in the United States as feed efficiency promoters and medicines for livestock that is destined for human consumption. These antibiotics are released into the environment through the runoff and wastewater streams from animal feedlots and land applications of manure. The exposure of microorganisms to these antibiotics has reportedly resulted in the development of resistant species of microorganisms, which in turn can lead to human health hazards. Phytoremediation of these antibiotics can be a useful tool for countering this problem. Aquatic plants, Myriophyllum aquaticum (parrot feather) and Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), were used for studying phytoremediation of tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from aqueous media. TC and OTC are two of the most commonly used tetracyclines in veterinary medicine. M. aquaticum and P. stratiotes gave high antibiotic modification rates of both antibiotics. Kinetic analyses dismiss direct enzyme catalysis; the modification rates decreased with increasing OTC concentrations. Sterile, cell-free root exudates (filtered through 0.2 mu m membranes) from both species also exhibited comparable antibiotic modification rates. The involvement of root-secreted metabolites in antibiotic modification is suggested. The changes in the UV absorbance spectra of OTC during treatment with the root exudates confirmed the modification.

AB A river along the semi-arid Front Range of Colorado was monitored for antibiotics including five tetracycline and six sulfonamide compounds. Existing analytical methods were adapted to measure these compounds in a surface water matrix at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05mug/L). Natural organic matter present in surface waters was confirmed to significantly impact the low-level analysis of tetracyclines (TCs) necessitating the use of standard addition quantification techniques. Five sites along the Cache la Poudre River were monitored for antibiotics encompassing pristine areas without anthropogenic influence, urban areas impacted by wastewater discharges and agricultural areas susceptible to non-point source contaminant runoff. The only site at which no antibiotics were detected was the pristine site in the mountains before the river had encountered urban or agricultural landscapes. By the time the river had exited the urban area. 6 of the 11 antibiotic compounds that were monitored were found in the samples. At Site 5, which had both urban and agricultural influences all five of the TCs monitored were detected indicating both urban and agricultural influences. The concentration of TCs at Site 5 ranged from 0.08 to 0.30mug/L. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of aqueous oxytetracycline (OTC) from an aqueous solution antibiotic using H2O2/Fe2+ process was studied in one 1 L batch chemical reactor. The extent of OTC degradation (20 mg/ L) was investigated from a known initial pH solution, temperature and the type of catalyst (Fe2+, Fe3+) and for various initial concentrations of OTC, H2O2 and Fe2+. The degradation efficiency achieved was found to be very important (90.82% and 90.63%) at initial pH solution of 3 and 4, respectively. However, the type of catalyst and the reaction temperature had a slight impact on the final degradation of OTC. The results showed that the OTC removal increased with increasing initial H2O2 concentration in the range of 70 to 150 mg/L and initial Fe2+ concentrations in the range of 2 to 5 mg/L. The highest degradation efficiency obtained at ambient temperature was 90.95% with initial concentration of OTC of 10 mg/L, H2O2 = 150 mg/ L and Fe2+ = 5 mg/L. Moreover, biodegradability improved from 0.04 to 0.36 and chemical oxygen demand degradation was 78.35% after 60 min of treatment. This study proved that Fenton process can be used for pretreatment of wastewater contaminated by OTC before a biological treatment.

AB The emerging organic micro-pollutants (EMOPs) cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes. In this paper, the most commonly detected EMOPs in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants, including trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, triclosan and methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, were selected to acclimate activated sludge, to enhance the biodegradation of EMOPs. The results showed that the acclimated activated sludge can significantly enhance the removal of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, triclosan and methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, but slightly improve the degradation of carbamazepine. The distribution of six EMOPs between water and sludge phases demonstrated that biodegradation made a major contribution to their removal. The maximal degradation rate constants were determined to be 0.9028 (sulfamethoxazole), 0.5374 (trimethoprim), 0.4123 (triclosan), 0.3544 (diclofenac), 0.2534 (methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate) and 0.0224 (carbamazepine). Degradation intermediate products were detected in water phase at the end of the acclimation process through the comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography figures before and after the acclimation process, suggesting that degradation products of EMOPs might be in the effluents. In summary, the acclimation of activated sludge could be an option for removing EMOPs, and more attention should be paid to the degradation products of EMOPs in the effluent.

AB A considerable knowledge gap exists with respect to the fate and environmental relevance of transformation products (TPs) of polar organic micropollutants in surface water. To narrow this gap we investigated the fate of 20 parent compounds (PCs) and 11 characteristic TPs in four wastewater-impacted rivers. Samples were obtained from time integrated active sampling as well as passive sampling using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Seventeen out of the 20 PCs were detected in at least one of the rivers. All the PCs except acesulfame, carbamazepine, and fluconazole were attenuated along the studied river stretches, with the largest decrease found in the smallest river which had an intense surface water-pore water exchange. Seven TPs were detected, all of which were already present directly downstream of the WWTP outfall, suggesting that the WWTPs were a major source of TPs to the recipients. For anionic compounds, attenuation was the highest in the two rivers with the lowest discharge, while the pattern was not as clear for neutral or cationic compounds. For most compounds the results obtained from active sampling were not significantly different from those using POCIS, demonstrating that the cost and labor efficient POCIS is suitable to determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.

AB Presence of pharmaceuticals at trace levels in recycled water is an emerging issue impacting the beneficial reuse of treated wastewater, including practices such as irrigation and groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid regions. To assess the environmental risks of irrigation with recycled water containing such micropollutants, in this study we evaluated sorption and degradation of five pharmaceuticals that are antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in two soils collected from arid regions. Naproxen and trimethoprim showed moderate to strong sorption, while the sorption of diclofenac, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole was negligible in both soils. Under aerobic conditions, the studied compounds were susceptible to microbial degradation with half-lives varying from 4.8 to 69.3 d. Apart from sulfamethoxazole, the other compounds were relatively persistent under anaerobic conditions as indicated by a negligible loss over 84 d of incubation or half-lives > 50 d. The degradation of the selected pharmaceuticals was influenced by microbial activities, oxygen status in the soil, soil type and compound characteristics. The poor sorption and relative persistence of diclofenac and ibuprofen under anaerobic conditions suggest that the two chemicals may pose a high leaching risk when using recycled for irrigation or groundwater replenishment.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) have been detected at significant concentrations in various natural and artificial aquatic environments. In this study, electro membrane bioreactor (eMBR) technology was used to treat simulated municipal wastewater containing widely-used pharmaceuticals namely amoxicillin (AMX), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ). The effects of varying current density on the removal of PhACs (AMX, DCF and CBZ) and conventional pollutants (chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic substances, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) species) were examined. High COD and DOC removal efficiencies (similar to 100%) were obtained in all the experimental runs regardless of applied current density. In contrast, enhanced removal efficiencies for AMX, DCFand CBZ were achieved at high current densities. Membrane fouling rate in eMBR with respect to conventional MBR was reduced by 24, 44 and 45% at current densities of 0.3,0.5 and 1.15 mA/cm(2), respectively. The mechanism for pharmaceutical removal in this study proceeded by: (1) charge neutralization between negatively-charged pharmaceutical compounds and positive electro-generated aluminium coagulants to form larger particles and (2) size exclusion by membrane filtration.

AB The monitoring of micropollutants in water compartments, in particular pharmaceuticals and personal care products, has become an issue of increasing concern over the last decade. Their occurrence in surface and groundwater, raw wastewater and treated effluents, along with the removal efficiency achieved by different technologies, have been the subjects of many studies published recently. The concentrations of these contaminants may vary widely over a given time period (day, week, month, or year). In this context, this paper investigates the average concentration and removal efficiency obtained by adopting four different sampling modes: grab sampling, 24-h time proportional, flow proportional and volume proportional composite sampling. This analysis is carried out by considering three ideal micropollutants presenting different concentration curves versus time (day). It compares the percentage deviations between the ideal concentration (and removal efficiencies) and the differently measured concentrations (removal efficiencies) and provides hints as to the best sampling mode to adopt when planning a monitoring campaign depending on the substances under study. It concludes that the flow proportional composite sampling mode is, in general, the approach which leads to the most reliable measurement of concentrations and removal efficiencies even though, in specific cases, the other modes can also be correctly adopted.

AB The emergence of micropollutants into our aquatic resources is regarded as an issue of increasing environmental concern. To protect the aquatic environment against further contamination with micropollutants, treatment with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is put forward as a promising technique. In this work, an innovative AOP based on electrical discharges in a continuous-flow pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with falling water film over activated carbon textile is examined for its potential application in water treatment. The effect of various operational parameters including feed gas type, gas flow rate, water flow rate and power on removal and energy efficiency has been studied. To this end, a synthetic micropollutant mixture containing five pesticides (atrazine, alachlor, diuron, dichlorvos and pentachlorophenol), two pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and 1,7-alpha-ethinylestradiol), and 1 plasticizer (bisphenol A) is used. While working under optimal conditions, energy consumption was situated in the range 2.42-4.25 kW h/m(3), which is about two times lower than the economically viable energy cost of AOPs (5 kW h/m(3)). Hence, the application of non-thermal plasma could be regarded as a promising alternative AOP for (industrial) wastewater remediation.

AB This study examined functional bentonite-supported nanoscale Fe/Ni (B-Fe/Ni) for the simultaneous removal of beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin (AMX), ampicillin (AMP) and penicillin (PEN). The results show only 94.6% of AMX, 80.6% of AMP and 53.7% of PEN were removed in the mixed antibiotic solution, while 97.5% of AMX, 85.1% of AMP and 74.5% of PEN were removed in individual antibiotic solution. The decreased removal in a mixed antibiotic solution was attributed to competition between antibiotics for: firstly, active sites of iron oxide for the adsorption; and secondly, accepted electrons for the degradation in passivation of the nZVI surface. These were confirmed by various characterization techniques. Kinetics studies of mixed antibiotics using B-Fe/Ni confirmed that adsorption and degradation occurred simultaneously as removing of antibiotics in the presence of particles. Furthermore, the stability and durability of B-Fe/Ni applied to remove beta-lactam antibiotics was demonstrated. Finally, B-Fe/Ni was used to reduce the concentration of mixed antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater, which indicated B-Fe/Ni is a promising material for antibiotics wastewater treatment.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) negatively impacts granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption of micro pollutants and is a disinfection byproduct precursor. DOM from surface waters, wastewater effluent, and 1 kDa size fractions were adsorbed by GAC and characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-absorption, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fluorescing DOM was preferentially adsorbed relative to UV-absorbing DOM. Humic-like fluorescence (peaks A and C) was selectively adsorbed relative to polyphenol-like fluorescence (peaks T and B) potentially due to size exclusion effects. In the surface waters and size fractions, peak C was preferentially removed relative to peak A, whereas the reverse was found in wastewater effluent, indicating that humic-like fluorescence is associated with different compounds depending on DOM source. Based on specific UV-absorption (SUVA), aromatic DOM was preferentially adsorbed. The fluorescence index (FI), if interpreted as an indicator of aromaticity, indicated the opposite but exhibited a strong relationship with average molecular weight, suggesting that FI might be a better indicator of DOM size than aromaticity. The influence of DOM intermolecular interactions on adsorption were minimal based on SEC analysis. Fluorescence parameters captured the impact of DOM size on the fouling of 2-methylisoborneol and warfarin adsorption and correlated with direct competition and pore blockage indicators.

AB This work evaluates the biodegradation of the antiviral drug acyclovir by an enriched nitrifying culture during ammonia oxidation and without the addition of ammonium. The study on kinetics was accompanied with the structural elucidation of biotransformation products through batch biodegradation experiments at two different initial levels of acyclovir (15 mg L-1 and 15 mu g L-1). The pseudo first order kinetic studies of acyclovir in the presence of ammonium indicated the higher degradation rates under higher ammonia oxidation rates than those constant degradation rates in the absence of ammonium. The positive correlation was found between acyclovir degradation rate and ammonia oxidation rate, confirming the cometabolism of acyclovir by the enriched nitrifying culture in the presence of ammonium. Formation of the product carboxy-acyclovir (P239) indicated the main biotransformation pathway was aerobic oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group, which was independent on the metabolic type (i.e. cometabolism or metabolism). This enzyme-linked reaction might be catalyzed by monooxygenase from ammonia oxidizing bacteria or heterotrophs. The formation of carboxy-acyclovir was demonstrated to be irrelevant to the acyclovir concentrations applied, indicating the revealed biotransformation pathway might be the dominant removal pathway of acyclovir in wastewater treatment.

AB The continuous release of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the aquatic environment, as a result of the inadequate removal by conventional treatment methods, has prompted research to explore viable solutions to this rising global problem. One promising alternative is the use of electrochemical processes since they represent a simple and highly efficient technology with less footprint. In this paper, the feasibility of treating ECs (i.e., pharmaceuticals) using an intermittent electrocoagulation process, a known electrochemical technology, has been investigated. Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and amoxicillin (AMX) were chosen as being representative of highly consumed drugs that are frequently detected in our water resources and were added in synthetic municipal wastewater. The removal efficiencies of both individual and combined pharmaceuticals were determined under different experimental conditions: hydraulic retention time (HRT) (6, 19 and 38 h), initial concentration (0.01, 4 and 10 mg/L) and intermittent application (5 min ON/20 min OFF) of current density (0.5, 1.15 and 1.8 mA/cm(2)). Results have shown that these parameters have significant effects on pharmaceutical degradation. Maximum removals (DCF = 90%, CBZ = 70% and AMX = 77%) were obtained at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2), an initial concentration of 10 mg/L and HRT of 38 h.

AB Pursuing high-efficiency adsorbents with high stability and ample porosity for environmental remediation has great practical significance but huge challenges still remain. Herein, porous carbons (PCs) were prepared by using covalent organic framework (COF) as self-template. The as-prepared PCs are of high specific surface area and pore volume, which are beneficial for contaminant capture. In contrast to virgin COF, the obtained PCs exhibited a better application potential for tetracycline (TC) removal from water. Notably, 87% of TC can be removed within 10 min and the kinetic data were consistent with the second-order kinetic model (R-2 > 0.998). Moreover, the adsorption isotherm conformed to the Langmuir adsorption model, and the calculated value of saturated adsorption capacity was 285 mg/g. It was speculated that the superior adsorption performance was due to the contribution of pi-pi stacking, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. It is worth noting that the sample prepared from COF heat-treated at 1000 degrees C, denoted as TpPa-1-1000, had good stability and reusability. Excitingly, TC in actual water samples can be efficiently removed by TpPa-1-1000. The results demonstrated that the strategy of utilizing COFs as the precursor for synthesis PC opens a new avenue to develop highly efficient adsorbents for removing pharmaceutical contaminant in wastewater.

AB The growing consumption of pharmaceutical products is taking a heavy toll on conventional wastewater treatment plants, the incomplete or no-removal of pharmaceutical species. Photocatalysis can be implemented as a refining step in treatment trains to mineralize these pharmaceuticals. In this study, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was integrated into boron-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (BCN) to produce visible-light-active vanadium oxide/boron co-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (V2O5-BCN) photocatalysts wherein graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was produced by thermal poly-condensation of urea. The photocatalysts were characterized and their performance under visible light irradiation was evaluated using diclofenac (DCF) as a representative pharmaceutical active compound. The effects of dopant amount, photocatalyst dosage, initial DCF concentration, solution pH and presence of anions on DCF removal were examined. Results showed that DCF adsorption on V2O5-BCN photocatalysts conformed to the pseudo-second order kinetic model while DCF photodegradation followed the pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The photocatalysts were found to be stable and reusable. DCF removals reached 100% in < 105 min under visible light irradiation. Overall, the as-synthesized V2O5-BCN heterojunction proved to be a promising photocatalyst for sustainable and low-cost treatment of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewaters.

AB In this study, the preloading effects of different fractions of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the adsorption of trace-level pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) onto granular activated carbon (GAC) were investigated. A nanofiltration (NF) membrane was employed to separate the EfOM by size, and two GACs with distinct pore structures were chosen for comparison. The results showed that preloading with EfOM substantially decreased PhAC uptake of the GACs; however, comparable PhAC adsorption capacities were achieved on GACs preloaded by feed EfOM and the NF-permeating EfOM. This indicates that: (1) the NF-rejected, larger EfOM molecules with an expectation to block the PhAC adsorption pores exerted little impact on the adsorbability of PhACs; (2) the smaller EfOM molecules present in the NF permeate contributed mainly to the decrease in PhAC uptake, mostly due to site competition. Of the two examined GACs, the wide pore-size-distributed GAC was found to be more susceptible to EfOM preloading than the microporous GAC. Furthermore, among the fourteen investigated PhACs, the negatively charged hydrophilic PhACs were generally subjected to a greater EfOM preloading impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diclofenac is a widely consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used as a painkiller prescribed as pills or ointments and among the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants' effluents. Fermentative/methanogenic cultures were enriched from previously contaminated sediment samples. Although partial biodegradation was achieved in all enrichment cultures, complete degradation was not observed. The results reflected that less than 6% of the diclofenac sorbed on the solid phase and the rest was either biotransformed (25-40%) or remained in the liquid phase (55-70%) at the end of 45-day incubation period. Although partial cometabolic degradation of diclofenac occurred in the presence of glucose, biodegradation was not observed in the presence of readily biodegradable carbon source (i.e., acetate). Diclofenac concentration up to 1000 mu g/L did not affect the methanogenic activity of the enriched culture. The results of this study will have a significant impact in the designation of the permitted concentration limits of diclofenac before the discharge through wastewater treatment plants.

AB Emerging contaminants (EC's) are pollutants of growing concern. They are mainly organic compounds such as: pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, hormones, plasticizers, food additives, wood preservatives, laundry detergents, surfactants, disinfectants, flame retardants, and other organic compounds that were found recently in natural wastewater stream generated by human and industrial activities. A majority of ECs does not have standard regulations and could lead to lethal effects on human and aquatic life even at small concentrations. The conventional primary and secondary water treatment plants do not remove or degrade these toxic pollutants efficiently and hence need cost effective tertiary treatment method. Adsorption is a promising method worldwide for EC removal since it is low initial cost for implementation, highly-efficient and has simple operating design. Research has shown that the application of different adsorbents such as, activated carbons (ACs), modified biochars (BCs), nanoadsorbents (carbon nanotubes and graphene), composite adsorbents, and other are being used for EC's removal from water and wastewater. The current review intends to investigate adsorption process as an efficient method for the treatment of ECs. The mechanism of adsorption has also been discussed.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as units designed for the efficient removal of organic matter and nutrients from polluted wastewaters, avoiding their discharge into the environment. Despite these benefits, they have also been found to be highly energy intensive, with consequent increased emissions in terms of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. Therefore, it has become imperative to monitor thoroughly the overall functioning of WWTPs from an integrated perspective with the aim of understanding how these can improve their eco-efficiency. In this case study, a group of 113 WWTPs located in regions across Spain were analysed using the methodology that combines life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The aim of this work was to determine the operational efficiency of each unit in order to obtain environmental benchmarks for inefficient plants. Thereafter, the environmental gains linked with the inputs reduction proposed for the DEA model for each unit were computed in order to verify eco-efficiency criteria. The operational complexity of WWTPs resulted in several identified factors affecting their efficiency which are discussed in depth, including the size of the facility, the climatic influence, the influent load and the over- or underuse of the plant.

AB Accurate prediction of pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater effluents requires that the specific biochemical processes responsible for pharmaceutical biodegradation be elucidated and integrated within any modeling framework. The fate of three selected beta blockers-atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol-was examined during nitrification using batch experiments to develop and evaluate a new cometabolic process-based (CPB) model. CPB model parameters describe biotransformation during and after ammonia oxidation for specific biomass populations and are designed to be integrated within the Activated Sludge Models framework. Metoprolol and sotalol were not biodegraded by the nitrification enrichment culture employed herein. Biodegradation of atenolol was observed and linked to the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and heterotrophs but not nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Results suggest that the role of AOB in atenolol degradation may be disproportionately more significant than is otherwise suggested by their lower relative abundance in typical biological treatment processes. Atenolol was observed to competitively inhibit AOB growth in our experiments, though model simulations suggest inhibition is most relevant at atenolol concentrations greater than approximately 200 ng.L-1 CPB model parameters were found to be relatively insensitive to biokinetic parameter selection suggesting the model approach may hold utility for describing pharmaceutical biodegradation during biological wastewater treatment.

AB Xenobiotics in urban receiving waters are an emerging problem. A sound knowledge of xenobiotic input, distribution and fate in the aquatic environment is a prerequisite for risk assessments. Methods to assess the impact of xenobiotics on urban receiving waters should address the diverse characteristics of the target compounds and the spatiotemporal variability of concentrations. Here, we present results from a one-year-monitoring program concerning concentrations of pharmaceuticals, additives from personal care products and industrial chemicals in an urban drainage catchment in untreated and treated wastewater, surface water and groundwater. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were applied to characterize the xenobiotic concentrations. Correlation and principal component analysis revealed a pronounced pattern of xenobiotics in the surface water samples. The concentrations of several xenobiotics were characterized by a negative proportionality to the water temperature. Therefore, seasonal attenuation is assumed to be a major process influencing the measured concentrations. Moreover, dilution of xenobiotics the surface water was found to significantly influence the concentrations. These two processes control more the xenobiotic occurrence in the surface water than the less pronounced concentration pattern in the wastewater sources. For the groundwater samples, we assume that foremost attenuation processes lead to the found differentiation of xenobiotics.

AB Biofilters, similar to those already used for, e.g., removing particles from stormwater and combined sewer overflow can remove organic micropollutants from polluted waters. This study investigated the effects on removal of pharmaceuticals with pulse loadings of increased amounts of pre-settled raw wastewater to four individual biofilters containing different materials (sand, filtralite, stonewool, and sand amended with 1% peat). The effect of increasing BOD concentration to the removal rate constants could be divided into two groups; 1) compounds influenced by increasing loading of BOD: atenolol, propranolol, venlafaxine, citalopram, metoprolol, iohexol, and diclofenac 2) compounds only little or not influenced by increasing concentration of BOD: sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, trimethoprim, iomeprol, and carbamazepine. Though BOD clearly had effects on the degradation, no indications towards a complete stop of the degradation were observed under any circumstances. The different biofilter materials influenced (indirectly) the removal of micropollutants: While the overall best performance was seen in the filtralite biofilter, the stonewool biofilter generally had the lowest removal rate constants. Furthermore, we observed different metabolic pathways of metoprolol in the four different biofilters under formation (and removal) of metoprolol acid, a-hydroxymetoprolol, and O-desmethylmetoprolol.

AB This study investigates how wastewater containing 2 mg l(-1) of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and 2 mg l(-1) of diclofenac (DCF) affects the composition of bacterial communities present in the roots and rhizomes of Miscanthus x giganteus plants grown in laboratory-scale constructed wetlands. Bacterial communities in plant roots and rhizomes were identified in treated and control samples by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Moreover, bacterial endophytes were isolated in R2A and 1/10 869 media and screened for their ability to metabolize SMX and DCF in liquid medium by HPLC. Our results show significant changes in the abundance of main genera, namely Sphingobium and Streptomyces between control and treated plants. Around 70% of the strains isolated from exposed plants belonged to the phylum Actinobacteria and were classified as Streptomyces, Microbacterium, and Glycomyces. In non-exposed plants, Proteobacteria represented 43.5% to 63.6% of the total. We identified 17 strains able to remove SMX and DCF in vitro. From those, 76% were isolated from exposed plants. Classified mainly as Streptomyces, they showed the highest SMX (33%) and DCF (41%) removal efficiency. These isolates, alone or in combination, might be used as bio-inoculants in constructed wetlands to enhance the phytoremediation of SMX and DCF during wastewater treatment.

AB An increasing number of organic micropollutants (OMP) is detected in anthropogenically influenced water cycles. Source control and effective natural and technical barriers are essential to maintain a high quality of drinking water resources under these circumstances. Based on the literature and our own research this study proposes a limited number of OMP that can serve as indicator substances for the major sources of OMP, such as wastewater treatment plants, agriculture and surface runoff. Furthermore functional indicators are proposed that allow assessment of the proper function of natural and technical barriers in the aquatic environment, namely conventional municipal wastewater treatment, advanced treatment (ozonation, activated carbon), bank filtration and soil aquifer treatment as well as self-purification in surface water. These indicator substances include the artificial sweetener acesulfame, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole and the herbicide mecoprop among others. The chemical indicator substances are intended to support comparisons between watersheds and technical and natural processes independent of specific water cycles and to reduce efforts and costs of chemical analyses without losing essential information.

AB In this Article, we demonstrate the influence of effluent particles (in the range of <50 mu m) on ozone degradation of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) and effluent-quality parameters. Secondary effluent was filtered through different pore-size filters and ozonated at various ozone doses. Degradation of both ozone-reactive and ozone-refractory contaminants improved following ozonation of effluent filtered with smaller pore size filters, indicating that particles in this range may adversely affect ozonation. The inhibitory effect of particles was attributed to their reaction with ozone, reducing available ozone and HO center dot<bold> </bold>radicals. In addition, increasing filtration level decreased the effluent's (instantaneous) ozone demand and increased removal of effluent UV absorbance (UVA254), further establishing that ozone reacts with effluent particles, in competition with dissolved matter. Moreover, ozone was shown to react with particles even during the first seconds of the process, suggesting a high rate of some ozone-particle reactions, comparable to ozone reaction with highly reactive dissolved organic matter moieties. Particle image analysis revealed that particle formation/aggregation and particle disintegration occurs simultaneously during wastewater (WW) ozonation. Our study implies that particles could affect the efficiency of WW ozonation, by increasing the effluent's ozone demand and decreasing contaminant degradation.

AB Atenolol is a beta-blocker considered to be an emerging contaminant due to its potential risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The removal of atenolol from water was studied using pumice stone, an amorphous, porous, and low-cost adsorbent. The adsorption process was evaluated in ultrapure water by kinetic, pH, and isotherm batch assays; the matrix effect of wastewater and desorption using ultrapure water were evaluated as well. The adsorption of atenolol in pumice stone adjusted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed fast adsorption in the first 2 h and reached final equilibrium after 48 h. The highest removal in ultrapure water was at pH 7.0. The maximum experimental adsorption capacity obtained for ultrapure water and actual waste-water ranged from 0.632 to 0.154 mg/g, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption experiments showed S-shaped isotherms following the Freundlich model and an increase in adsorption capacity as equilibrium concentration increased. Desorption was up to 55%, demonstrating the potential regeneration of the adsorbent, even on site, using ultrapure water. Furthermore, the results for atenolol, a cationic substance (pKa 9.6), suggest the application of negatively charged pumice as an adsorbent for similar substances of concern.

AB A variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including some known to be obesogenic, can be found in household wastewater. Many are only partially treated by wastewater treatment and drinking water purification systems and can enter municipal drinking water supplies. We evaluated drinking water consumption habits in a cohort of obese pediatric patients to determine the percentage that might avoid exposure to EDCs from drinking municipal tap water. Obese (BMI >= 95th percentile) children presenting to an obesity clinic serving a largely poor and rural population were studied. Self-reported race/ethnicity, insurance status, and details concerning type and volume of water consumed were obtained from their medical records. Most homes were supplied with municipal, rather than private well water (90.6% vs. 9.4%, respectively). A majority (76.4%) of patients with municipal water as their water supply only drank bottled water. "Taste" and "Health Concerns" were the most commonly endorsed reasons for eschewing tap water. Bottled water consumption among low socioeconomic status patients may reduce their risk for exposure to EDCs in municipal tap water. Further studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of this observation.

AB To ameliorate adsorbent recovery by an external magnetic field, naturally occurring diatomaceous earth (DE) was modified with iron-oxide, characterized and applied for adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ) from synthetic wastewater using batch equilibration method. The fabricated adsorbent was characterized using XRF, XRD, SEM-EDX, FT-IR, BET surface area analysis, VSM and pH of point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) determination. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo-first-order (PFO) model suggesting a physisorption controlled rate determining step. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to linear and nonlinear isotherm models, viz Langmuir and Freundlich models, and were best described by Freundlich nonlinear equations implying heterogeneous multilayer adsorption. The best-fitting kinetic and isotherm model was determined using four mathematical error functions. The thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy (Delta H = -26.4 kJ mol(-1)), Gibbs free energy (Delta G = -2.22 kJ mol(-1) at 298 K), entropy (Delta S = -34.0 kJ mol(-1)), indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous, exothermic, and physical process. The adsorption mechanism is postulated to involve cation-pi interactions. Modified diatomaceous earth is a potentially excellent, low-cost, and novel sorbent for CBZ adsorption with 88% removal in 180 min and provides a possible alternative adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB This study investigates the removal of selected pharmaceuticals, as recalcitrant organic compounds, from synthetic wastewater using an electro-membrane bioreactor (eMBR). Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ), and amoxicillin (AMX) were selected as representative drugs from three different therapeutic groups such as anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, and antibiotic, respectively. An environmentally relevant concentration (10g/L) of each compound was spiked into the synthetic wastewater, and then, the impact of appending electric field on the control of membrane fouling and the removal of conventional contaminants and pharmaceutical micropollutants were assessed. A conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated as a control test. A reduction of membrane fouling was observed in the eMBR with a 44% decrease of the fouling rate and a reduction of membrane fouling precursors. Humic substances (UV254), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), and orthophosphate (PO4-P) showed in eMBR removal efficiencies up to 90.68 +/- 4.37, 72.10 +/- 13.06, and 100%, respectively, higher than those observed in the MBR. A reduction of DCF, CBZ, and AMX equal to 75.25 +/- 8.79, 73.84 +/- 9.24, and 72.12 +/- 10.11%, respectively, was found in the eMBR due to the enhanced effects brought by electrochemical processes, such as electrocoagulation, electrophoresis, and electrooxidation.

AB An updated version of FATEMOD, a multimedia fugacity model for environmental fate of organic chemicals, was set up to assess environmental behaviour of three pharmaceuticals in northern Lake Paijanne, Finland. Concentrations of ibuprofen, diclofenac, and carbamazepine were estimated at various depths at two sites: near a wastewater treatment plant and 3.5 km downstream the plant. When compared with environmental sampling data from corresponding depths and sites, the predicted concentrations, ranging from nanograms to hundreds of nanograms per litre, were found to be in good agreement. Weather data were utilised with the model to rationalise the effects of various environmental parameters on the sampling results, and, e.g. the roles of various properties of lake dynamics and photodegradation were identified. The new model also enables simultaneous assessment of transformation products. Environmentally formed transformation product concentrations were estimated to be at highest an order of magnitude lower than those of the parent compounds, and unlikely to reach a detectable level. However, a possibility that conjugates of ibuprofen are present at higher levels than the parent compound was identified. Simulation results suggest that environmental degradation half-lives of the inspected contaminants under stratified lake conditions are in the range of some weeks to months.

AB Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) have gained increased notoriety due to their continued detection in environmental media and consequently their threat to human and animal health. The continuing spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the environment is of growing environmental and public health concern, making it difficult to treat harmful resistant diseases. This paper examines the presence of antibiotics, ARB, and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments; the effectiveness of current water treatment strategies to remove them; and risk assessment methods available that can be used to evaluate the risk from antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs have been reported at varying levels in wastewater treatment plants, hospital wastewater, irrigation water, recreational water, and drinking water. There are many different water treatments capable of reducing antibiotic resistance (including chlorination, UV, and ozone); however, no onemethod can fully eliminate it with much variation in the reported effects. Risk assessment models can be used for interpreting field data into the risk to human health from antibiotic resistance. Currently, there is no gold standard risk assessment method for evaluating antibiotic resistance. Methods in this area need further development to reflect evolving risk assessment methodologies and dynamic data as it emerges.

AB Although pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are largely unregulated, water resource recovery facilities are increasingly using advanced chemical/physical treatment technologies (e.g., advanced oxidation and reverse osmosis) to remove or destroy these trace organic contaminants (TOrCs). This can both reduce potential adverse human health effects in reuse applications and mitigate environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. Unfortunately, advanced treatment technologies are typically energy intensive and costly to implement, operate, and maintain. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimization of solids retention time (SRT) provided sufficient benefits to warrant such operational strategies for TOrC mitigation. Specifically, SRTs of 5.5, 6, and 15 days were evaluated to determine the effects on several standard wastewater parameters (e.g., nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia concentrations) and the degradation of TOrCs. The experimental SRTs were operated simultaneously in parallel, full-scale activated sludge basins. The results indicate that it can be beneficial to implement biological process optimization strategies using existing infrastructure while reducing reliance on advanced treatment technologies. This study also identified potential operational issues that might arise in activated sludge systems operating at extended SRTs.

AB BACKGROUND: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be found in urban wastewaters and which is not removed efficiently by conventional wastewater treatments. In this work, the removal of this pollutant by conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO) is studied.
   RESULTS: CDEO is able to degrade Metoprolol tartrate down to the 10 ppb level ( detection limit of the technique used) with a current charge requirement that increases with increase in the initial concentration of pollutant, although it is many times greater than the stoichiometric current charge required. CDEO also removed very efficiently the reaction intermediates. In terms of TOC the depletion follows a first-order kinetic, but the kinetic constant of Metoprolol decreases with concentration. NaCl increases significantly Metoprolol degradation rate, but it barely affects the TOC removal rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: CDEO can be used to remove Metoprolol from wastewaters, independently of the initial concentration of compound. Several reaction intermediates are formed during the electrolyses although their concentrations are very low and negligible compared with that of Metoprolol. The removal rate ( in terms of TOC) does not depend on the nature of the electrolyte used. The process is under mass transfer control for the complete range of concentrations studied.

AB Advanced oxidation processes, based on hydroxyl radical chemistry, can be used to successfully destroy chemical contaminants in waters intended for reuse. In determining the effectiveness of these radical oxidative degradations and transformations in water, both reaction rate constants and compound removal efficiencies must be considered. Removal efficiencies are defined as the number of contaminant molecules transformed per 100 hydroxyl radicals reacting. Hydroxyl radical reaction efficiencies have been determined for bisphenol A, caffeine, DEET, and sulfamethazine in different qualities of treated and model laboratory wastewaters. While these four contaminants show similar hydroxyl radical reaction rate constants, their removal efficiencies in deionized water varied significantly at 76 +/- 7, 92 +/- 8, 95 +/- 9, and 56 +/- 7%, respectively. Model wastewater studies showed that dissolved oxygen did not appreciably influence these values, and low levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) reduced the removal efficiencies by an average of approximately 20%. However, the combination of solution alkalinity and DOM had a significant impact in reducing hydroxyl radical reaction efficiencies, although not always in a linear, additive, fashion. These results imply that the effective implementation of advanced oxidation technologies in wastewater treatments might be enhanced by prior removal of organics or alkalinity.

AB Aims: To investigate whether two different wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) - treating the same pharmaceutical influent - select for a different bacterial and/ or ammonia oxidizing bacterial ( AOB) community.
   Methods and Results: Molecular fingerprinting demonstrated that each WWTP had its own total bacterial and AOB community structure, but Nitrosomonas eutropha and N. europea were dominant in both WWTP A and B. The DNA and RNA analysis of the AOB communities revealed different patterns; so the most abundant species may not necessarily be the most active ones. Nitritation failures, monitored by chemical parameter analysis, were reflected as AOB community shifts and visualized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE)- based moving window analysis.
   Conclusions: This research demonstrated the link between functional performance ( nitritation parameters) and the presence and activity of a specific microbial ecology ( AOB). Clustering and moving window analysis based on DGGE showed to be valuable to monitor community shifts in both WWTPs.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study of specific community shifts together with functional parameter analysis has potential as a tool for relating functional instability ( such as operational failures) to specific-bacterial community shifts.

AB Despite that diclofenac has been embodied to the European watch list of priority substances of concern, studies on diclofenac biodegradation are limited and the diversity of diclofenac-degrading microbiota remains unknown. In this work, an immobilized cell biofilter was constructed and operated to evaluate its effectiveness to depurate high strength diclofenac wastewater and to identify the diclofenac-degrading community accommodated in activated sludge by employing high-throughput sequencing techniques. After a two-month adaptation period, biofilter removal efficiencies reached values as high as 97.63 +/- 0.62%, whereas utilization of diclofenac in the immobilized cell biofilter led to a drastic pH decrease. Based on Illumina sequencing, the major bacterial taxa identified in the immobilized cell biofilter were members of the species Granulicella pectinivorans and Rhodanobacter terrae, followed by members of the species Castellaniella denitrificans, Parvibaculum lavamentivorans, Bordetella petrii, Bryocella elongata and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The ability of such taxa to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to effectively adapt under acidic conditions seemed to be the main parameters, which favored their prevalence in the immobilized cell biofilter. In addition, Wickerhamiella was the predominant fungal taxon in the immobilized cell biofilter, which appears to be actively involved in diclofenac degradation in activated sludge systems.

AB Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP) is one of the most common antipyretic analgesics used to treat common ailments throughout the world. Recently, APAP has been frequently detected in wastewater effluent and groundwater, resulting in potential risks to the environment. Current methods for eliminating APAP are complicated and cost-prohibitive. This study examined APAP degradation by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) and UV-C irradiation combined with activated sludge (UV/AS) to evaluate potential applications in wastewater treatment. The results of this study indicate that UV-C irradiation reached an APAP degradation efficiency of more than 52% and a degradation rate of 0.0012-0.0013 min(-1) during 720 min of exposure, while the initial APAP concentration exhibited only a nominal effect on the degradation rate. However, the UV/AS treatment demonstrated an APAP degradation rate that was 9.6 times the rate of the UV-C-only treatment, with a degradation efficiency of 99% over the same UV irradiation period. The results further indicated that APAP photolysis efficiency was more effective when applied to sterilized AS than when applied to unsterilized AS. Finally, excessive dosage of both AS and humic acid inhibited APAP photolysis efficiency.

AB In this study, ranitidine (RT), a cationic drug was tested for its removal by palygorskite (PA) under different physico-chemical conditions, such as initial RT concentrations, contact time, equilibrium solution pH, ionic strength, and temperature. FTIR, SEM, and XRD analyses were conducted to determine the mechanisms of RT uptake on PA. The results showed that cation exchange or electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged PA surfaces and positively charge dimethylamine of RT was the major mechanism of RT uptake when solution pH was less than the pK(a) value of RT. Under high pH conditions, the 2,5-disubstituted furan group interacted with the PA surface via a delocalized pi-bond, suggesting that the RT molecules were parallel to PA surface. The larger values for the RT distribution coefficient between PA and solution via electrostatic or cation exchange interactions and delocalized pi-bonds in a multi-regression analysis confirmed these mechanisms. The XRD results showed no expansion of the (1 1 0) reflection of PA while the SEM observation showed no changes in crystal size and morphology, indicating that the sites for RT uptake were limited to the external surfaces of PA.

ID WASTE-WATER; RECOVERY; ENRICHMENT
AB Hydrophilic phenolic compounds in olive-mill wastewater (OMWW) evince high potential for use in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products due to their bioactivities. However, up-to-date, effective and low-cost extraction techniques suitable for large quantities of OMWW are still wanting. This lack turns the by-product OMWW into problematic waste, instead of a value-added product. Foam fractionation has not yet been studied with regard to its potential for extracting polar phenolics from OMWW. In this study, this was investigated in a simple model system with oxidative-insensitive vanillic acid. The influence of four process parameters (concentration of vanillic acid, concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, pH value and gas flow rate) on enrichment factor and percentage recovery was analyzed with design of experiments. Analysis of the central composite design revealed that the concentration of the cationic surfactant and the gas flow rate are diametrically opposed for high enrichment factor in the foamate and simultaneous low percentage recovery in the residue. Low vanillic acid concentration and pH of 6-7 were found to be advantageous in terms of good extraction performance. Foam fractionation of vanillic acid under the optimized process parameters led to an enrichment factor of 22.24 in the foamate and 55.88% recovery in the residue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB There has been a developing technology in algae with pharmaceuticals wastewater. However, the effect and the underlying mechanism of pharmaceuticals on algae are not well understood. To investigate the effect and mechanism of pharmaceuticalson microalgae, four pharmaceuticals of clofibric acid (CLF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on C. pyrenoidosa culture were analyzed. At low concentrations (< 10 mg/L), the pharmaceuticals, especially the DCF, exhibited positive effects on both the structure and function of algal cultures; algal growth (i.e., chlorophyll a accumulation, lipid accumulation) and activities of antioxidant enzymes were stimulated. The algal metabolite differences of various DCF concentrations were investigated and a total of 91 substances were identified, whose samples were clustered and clearly separated. The key metabolomics pathway analysis found that the DCF promoted the carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolic pathway in C. pyrenoidosa under relatively low concentrations (< 10 mg/L). However, the algae metabolomics pathway was disturbed significantly under the action of a high concentration of DCF (>100 mg/L). The study detected the effects of four pharmaceuticals on C. pyrenoidosa and demonstrated that the usage of metabolomics analysis complemented with DCF could be an effective approach to understand the mechanism of molecular evolution in C. pyrenoidosa for microalgal biomass and bioenergy from wastewater in researches of biological resources.

AB Enzymatic degradation with ligninolytic enzyme, e.g., laccase, is a potential green solution for removal of pharmaceutical compounds that are released into the environment through wastewater effluent. However, the deficiencies of using the enzyme in its free forms, such as reusability and stability, should be addressed before industrial applications. In this study, laccase was immobilized onto tailor-made polyacrylonitrile biochar composite nanofibrous membrane through covalent bonding, and the parameters of immobilization were optimized. The obtained biocatalyst was utilized for removal of chlortetracycline (CTC), carbamazepine (CBZ), and diclofenac (DCF) at an environmentally relevant concentration in batch mode. These pharmaceutical compounds represented three main categories of pharmaceutical compounds, i.e., antibiotics, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory. The results showed that the immobilized laccase has improved storage, temperature, and pH stability compared to free laccase. Also, it maintained more than 17% of its initial activity after 10 cycles of ABTS oxidation which indicated improved reusability of the enzyme. Using immobilized laccase for degradation, three pharmaceutical compounds in batch experiments exhibited 72.7%, 63.3%, and 48.6% degradation efficiency for DCF, CTC, and CBZ, respectively, after 8 h of reaction. The decreasing trend of adsorption extent during reaction time for all compounds confirmed the regenerative effect of laccase on adsorption sites of biochar.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater treatment plant effluent poses a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems. Constructed wetlands have recently been used to control PhACs. However, the microbial communities that are involved in these processes have not been comprehensively investigated.
   This study aimed to evaluate the removal of PhACs and microbial response in constructed wetlands during the treatment of PhACs. The effects of PhACs on bacterial communities in constructed wetland mesocosms were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Results indicated that removal efficiencies of PhACs were enhanced over time, and constructed wetlands offer higher removal efficiencies for the PhACs studied compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants. Plants improved microbial richness and diversity while both indices were negatively correlated with PhAC concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 mu g/L in constructed wetland mesocosms. The microbial communities of the constructed wetland mesocosms were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes under PhAC exposure, while Desulfobulbus and Treponema were the dominant genera. In particular, Proteobacteria were correlated with PhAC concentrations. Overall, this study provides valuable microbial community ecology data to understand how microbial populations respond to PhAC stress in constructed wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater produced in pharmaceutical manufacturing plants (PMPs), especially the one coming from organic-synthesis facilities, is characterized by its large variability due to the wide range of solvents and chemical reagents used in the different stages of the production of medicines. Normally, the toxicity of the organic compounds prevent the utilization of biological processes and more powerful treatments are needed becoming advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) a valid alternative. In this work, the efficiency in abatement of pollution by Fenton oxidation (FO) and conductive-diamond electro-oxidation (CDEO) are compared in the treatment of 60 real effluents coming from different processes carried out in a pharmaceutical facility, using standardized tests. In 80% of the samples, CDEO was found to be more efficient than FO and in the remaining 20%, coagulation was found to exhibit a great significance in the COD abatement mechanism during FO, pointing out the effectiveness of the oxidation promoted by the electrochemical technology. Mean oxidation state of carbon was found to be a relevant parameter to understand the behavior of the oxidation technologies. It varied inversely proportional to efficiency in FO and it showed practically no influence in the case of CDEO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The nitrifying/denitrifying activated sludge process removes several micropollutants from wastewater by sorption onto sludge and/or biodegradation. The objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate a lab-scale experimental strategy for the determination of partition coefficient and biodegradation constant for micropollutant with an objective of modelling their removal. Four pharmaceutical compounds (ibuprofen, atenolol, diclofenac and fluoxetine) covering a wide hydrophobicity range (log K-ow from 0.16 to 4.51) were chosen. Dissolved and particulate concentrations were monitored for 4 days, inside two reactors working under aerobic and anoxic conditions, and under different substrate feed conditions (biodegradable carbon and nitrogen). We determined the mechanisms responsible for the removal of the target compounds: (i) ibuprofen was biodegraded, mainly under aerobic conditions by cometabolism with biodegradable carbon, whereas anoxic conditions suppressed biodegradation; (ii) atenolol was biodegraded under both aerobic and anoxic conditions (with a higher biodegradation rate under aerobic conditions), and cometabolism with biodegradable carbon was the main mechanism; (iii) diclofenac and fluoxetine were removed by sorption only. Finally, the abilities of our strategy were evaluated by testing the suitability of the parameters for simulating effluent concentrations and removal efficiency at a full-scale plant.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate low-cost and easy-to-operate engineering solutions that can be added as a polishing step to small wastewater treatment plants to reduce the micropollutant load to water bodies. The proposed design combines a sand filter/constructed wetland with additional and more advanced treatment technologies (UV degradation, enhanced adsorption to the solid phase, e. g., an engineered substrate) to increase the elimination of recalcitrant compounds. The removal of five micropollutants with different physico-chemical characteristics (three pharmaceuticals: diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, one pesticide: mecoprop, and one corrosion inhibitor: benzotriazole) was studied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system. Separate batch experiments were conducted to assess the removal efficiency of UV degradation and adsorption. The efficiency of each individual process was substance-specific. No process was effective on all the compounds tested, although elimination rates over 80% using light expanded clay aggregate (an engineered material) were observed. A laboratory-scale flow-through setup was used to evaluate interactions when removal processes were combined. Four of the studied compounds were partially eliminated, with poor removal of the fifth (benzotriazole). The energy requirements for a field-scale installation were estimated to be the same order of magnitude as those of ozonation and powdered activated carbon treatments.

AB Owing to the global industrialization, a new generation of pharmaceutical pollutants with high toxicity and persistency have been detected. In the present study, silica microspheres, a promising adsorbent has been employed to investigate the extent of removal of prevalent therapeutic acetaminophen, an emerging micropollutant, from wastewater in isolated batch experiments. The BET surface area of the adsorbent was 105.46 m(2)/g with a pore size of 15 nm. Characterization of adsorbent by scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed the microparticulate nature with a 15 +/- 5 mm particle size. Optimization of reaction parameters for enhanced assimilative removal of pollutants was performed and the highest adsorption of 96.7% of acetaminophen with an adsorption capacity of 89.0 mg/g was observed upon contact time of only 30 min. Mild process conditions of pH 5.0, 20 ppm of acetaminophen, temperature of 303 K, and 100 ppm sorbent concentration further aided in the removal process. Obtained data were best corresponded with the Freundlich isotherm (n = 2.685), indicating highly favorable adsorption. Acetaminophen adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo second order and feasible energetic changes were yielded through the thermodynamic analysis. Silica microspheres recovery carried out through a single-step desorption process had a 99.14% retrieval ability. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To estimate drug consumption more reliably, waste water-based epidemiology would benefit from a better understanding of drug residue stability during in-sewer transport. We conducted batch experiments with real, fresh wastewater and sewer biofilms. Experimental conditions mimic small to medium-sized gravity sewers with a relevant ratio of biofilm surface area to wastewater volume (33 m(2) m(-3)). The influences of biological, chemical, and physical processes on the transformation of 30 illicit drug and pharmaceutical residues were quantified. Rates varied among locations and over time. Three substances were not stable-that is, >20% transformation, mainly due to biological processes-at least for one type of tested biofilm for a residence time <= 2 h: amphetamine, 6-acetylcodeine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine. Cocaine, ecgonine methyl ester, norcocaine, cocaethylene, and mephedrone were mainly transformed by chemical hydrolysis and, hence, also unstable in sewers. In contrast, ketamine, norketamine, O-desmethyltramadol, diclofenac, carbamazepine, and methoxetamine were not substantially affected by in-sewer processes under all tested conditions and residence times up to 12 h. Our transformation rates include careful quantification of uncertainty and can be used to identify situations in which specific compounds are not stable. This will improve accuracy and uncertainty estimates of drug consumption when applied to the back calculation.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, endocrine disruptors, and their metabolites in aquatic environments has recently attracted particular attention due to their potential risks and adverse health effects. Membrane processes as widely used technologies in wastewater treatment have played a significance role in elimination of pharmaceuticals, hormones, endocrine disruptors, and their metabolites from wastewaters. In the current research, membrane processes which are used for the removal of these pollutants have been classified into three main categories, namely membrane filtration processes (UF, NF, and RO), membrane bioreactors (MBRs) (aerobic submerged and external systems), and membrane contactors (liquid-liquid extraction, supported liquid membranes, forward osmosis, and membrane distillation). Filtration processes have been applied for the removal of a large number of the contaminants; however, NF has been the most used one and the results were significant in most of the cases. Performance of MBRs has been also investigated for extensive number of contaminants. These systems have also showed great performance in many of the studies. Nevertheless, there are only a few researches on the removal of these pollutants by membrane contactors; thus, they have the potential for growth. Membrane processes have also been used in combination with other processes.

AB The ozonation of ciprofloxacin was studied in hospital wastewater treatment plant effluent with focus on parent compound degradation, degradation product identification and residual antibacterial activity. Before ozonation, ciprofloxacin sorption on suspended solids was tested as a function of temperature (110.0-27.5 degrees C and pH (3, 7 and 10). Temperature did not significantly affect ciprofloxacin sorption while sorption was highest at pH 7 (log K-d = 4.7) compared to pH 3 (log K-d = 4.3) and 10 (log K-d = 3.9) (n = 3). Ozonation was slowest at pH 7 with ciprofloxacin half life times of 29 min, compared to 19 and 27 min at pH 10 and 3, respectively. Addition of 10-1000 mu M H2O2 increased ciprofloxacin half life times up to 38 min, probably influenced by competition with H2O2 for ozone as well as radical species. Ciprofloxacin ozonation products were identical as previously detected during ciprofloxacin ozonation in deionized water and revealed strong pH dependence. Residual antibacterial activity was measured by agar diffusion tests. For Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli, reduction of antibacterial activity was related to the parent compound degradation, while degradation products indicated to be the main compounds with respect to the antibacterial activity against Bacillus coagulans.

AB Widespread occurrence of various heterocyclic aromatic compounds is reported in concentrations from 1 to 20 mu g/L in surface and groundwater as well as influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants around the world. These so-called emerging contaminants and their metabolites can cause adverse effects on the environment and humans, even at very low concentration, hence raised environmental concerns. In this study, feasibility of soybean peroxidase-catalyzed removal of three selected heterocyclic aromatics from water was investigated, including sensitivity to the most important operational conditions, pH (range 3.6-9.0), H2O2 concentration (range 0.10-1.50 mM), and enzyme activity (range 0.001-5.0 U/mL). 3-Hydroxycoumarin and 2-aminobenzoxaozle were found to be substrates for the enzyme, having >= 95% and 45% removal efficiency with most effective pHs of 7.0 and 6.0, respectively. Time course study was also conducted to determine the initial first-order rate constants and half-lives; half-lives normalized for enzyme activity (0.0257 and 452 min for the respective substrates) are compared with those of 21 other compounds reactive with soybean peroxidase. High-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to characterize the plausible oligomerization products of enzymatic treatment, which revealed formation of dimers and trimers of the two substrates.

AB Endocrine disruptors (ED) are exogenous agents capable of deregulating the normal functioning of the endocrine system in humans and animals. The ED entry routes in the environment highlight the launch of domestic and agricultural wastewater in water bodies. This work aims to evaluate the occurrence, mobility and biosorption attenuation of hormones and antibiotics in soil columns in the application of agricultural and domestic waste and rain simulation. Soil columns, which were filled with soil from an agricultural area, were installed under the conditions of a swine wastewater application (ARS) at a dose of 50 m(3)/ha with and without the biosorbent effect and human urine at a rate equivalent to nitrogen compared with ARS. The estrogen concentrations were observed by High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and the mass balance was developed to evaluate the estrogen removal in the soil profile. The occurrence of hormones in all analyses was approximately 20%. Pine bark adsorbent was found to be considerably efficient in removing hormones from liquid matrices. The mass balance of the soil columns with adsorbent exhibited an estrogen recovery in the matrix applied to less than a 1% rate. For comparison, the soil columns without adsorbent obtained a mass transit about 20% of the total applied.

AB For many polar organic micropollutants, biotransformation by activated sludge microorganisms is a major removal process during wastewater treatment. However, our current understanding of how wastewater treatment operations influence microbial communities and their micropollutant biotransformation potential is limited, leaving major parts of observed variability in biotransformation rates across treatment facilities unexplained. Here, we present biotransformation rate constants for 42 micropollutants belonging to different chemical classes along a gradient of solids retention time (SRT). The geometric mean of biomass-normalized first-order rate constants shows a clear increase between 3 and 15 d SRT by 160% and 87%, respectively, in two experiments. However, individual micropollutants show a variety of trends. Rate constants of oxidative biotransformation reactions mostly increased with SRT. Yet, nitrifying activity could be excluded as primary driver. For substances undergoing other than oxidative reactions, i.e., mostly substitution-type reactions, more diverse dependencies on SRT were observed. Most remarkably, characteristic trends were observed for groups of substances undergoing similar types of initial transformation reaction, suggesting that shared enzymes or enzyme systems that are conjointly regulated catalyze biotransformation reactions within such groups. These findings open up opportunities for correlating rate constants with measures of enzyme abundance such as genes or gene products, which in turn should help to identify enzymes associated with the respective biotransformation reactions.

AB Emerging contaminants are principally personal care products not readily removed by conventional wastewater treatment and, with an increasing reliance on water recycling, become disseminated in drinking water supplies. Carbamazepine, a widely used neuroactive pharmaceutical, increasingly escapes wastewater treatment and is found in potable water. In this study, a mechanism is proposed by which carbamazepine resists biodegradation, and a previously unknown microbial biodegradation was predicted computationally. The prediction identified biphenyl dioxygenase from Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 as the best candidate enzyme for metabolizing carbamazepine. The rate of degradation described here is 40 times greater than the best reported rates. The metabolites cis-10,11-dihydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine and cis-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrocarbamazepine were demonstrated with the native organism and a recombinant host. The metabolites are considered nonharmful and mitigate the generation of carcinogenic acridine products known to form when advanced oxidation methods are used in water treatment. Other recalcitrant personal care products were subjected to prediction by the Pathway Prediction System and tested experimentally with P. xenovorans LB400. It was shown to biodegrade structurally diverse compounds. Predictions indicated hydrolase or oxygenase enzymes catalyzed the initial reactions. This study highlights the potential for using the growing body of enzyme-structural and genomic information with computational methods to rapidly identify enzymes and microorganisms that biodegrade emerging contaminants.

AB This study evaluated a pilot-scale nonthermal plasma (NTP) advanced oxidation process (AOP) for the degradation of trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) The degradation of seven indicator compounds was monitored in tertiary-treated wastewater and spiked surface water to evaluate the effects of differing water qualities on process efficiency The tests were also conducted in batch and single-pass modes to examine contaminant degradation rates and the remediation cap abilities of the technology, respectively. values for electrical energy per order (EEO) of magnitude degradation ranged from <0 3 kWh/m(3)-log for easily degraded compounds (e g, carbamazepine) in surface water to 14 kWh/m(3)-log for more recalcitrant compounds (e g., meprobamate) in wastewater Changes in the bulk organic matter based on UV(254) absorbance and excitation-emission matrices (EEM) were also monitored and correlated to contaminant degradation These results indicate that NTP may be a viable alternative to more common AOPs due to its comparable energy requirements for contaminant degradation and its ability to operate without any additional feed chemicals (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Previous research has shown that unspiked OECD 309 tests can be used to quantify chemical biodegradation in surface waters, relying on chemical residues already present in the water. Here we test the hypothesis that unspiked OECD 309 tests can quantitatively predict chemical persistence in the environment by comparing chemical half-lives assessed in the laboratory against those measured in the field. The study object was a Swedish lake heavily impacted by treated municipal wastewater. Half-lives in the field were measured by mass balance over 12 weeks. In parallel, half-lives in the lab were determined with an unspiked OECD 309 test run for 60 days. Chemical analysis was conducted using a non-target screening approach. The field study yielded a half-life <100 days for 38 chemicals for which the dominant source was wastewater; 32 of these were also detected in the lab test, whereby 18 had half-lives with a well-constrained uncertainty that did not intersect infinity. For 14 of the 18 chemicals, the field and lab half-lives agreed within a factor 3. In summary, the lab test predicted chemical attenuation in the field well. Limitations of the approach include the need for measurable chemical concentrations in the water body and failure to account for some attenuation mechanisms like phototransformation.

AB Water scarcity has greatly increased the need for research into alternative irrigation methods. Irrigation with treated wastewater (TW) is considered an important alternative in terms of reducing our dependence upon groundwater and freshwater. In this study, we examined the effects of irrigation with TW on the nutrient contents of two alfalfa cultivars and compared them with the nutrient contents of plants irrigated with well water (WW). The two cultivars (Alhassawy-a local cultivar and CUV101) were cultivated from 2013 to 2015 and sampled twice. For both cultivars and in both sampling periods, irrigation with TW significantly affected the macronutrient and micronutrient contents of alfalfa tissues. Plants irrigated with TW had higher K and Ca contents, but lower N, P, and Mg contents. No significant variation in S content was noted between plants irrigated with WW and TW. Furthermore, cultivar and cutting time had significant effects on nutrient contents, and these variables interacted with the effect of the water type used for irrigation. However, before TW can be regularly used in irrigation processes, further long-term studies are needed that consider the variations in water treatment efficiency and differences between cultivated sites in addition to the crop being irrigated with TW.

AB The widely utilization of pharmaceutical and personal care products in the pharmaceutical therapies and agricultural husbandry has led to the worldwide pollution in the environment. However, effective purification of water contaminated by tetracycline (TC) remains a great challenge. Here, 2-dimensional (2D) zeolitic imidazolate framework-L (ZIF-L) nanoflakes with a leaf-like morphology, which could selectively adsorb TC, was successfully synthesized in aqueous media at room temperature. The removal efficiency of ZIF-L powder for TC from pharmaceutical wastewaters was greatly influenced by the solution pH, contact time, temperature and solution concentration. In order to solve these problems, ZIF-L nanoflakes were fabricated on the surface of polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified nylon microporous filter to form a 3-dimensional (3D) composite film by vacuum filtration. The result showed that this novel material could effectively remove about 99.0% of TC from pharmaceutical wastewater. Furthermore, ZIF-L film not only excluded the effects of solution pH, contact time, temperature and solution concentration on the adsorption capacity for TC, but also had a high flux (1639 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)), making it suitable for a large-scale application. The probable adsorption mechanism was investigated and suggested.

AB Limited knowledge of optimal microbial community composition for PPCP biotreatment, and of the microbial phylotypes that drive biotransformation within mixed microbial communities, has hindered the rational design and operation of effective and reliable biological PPCP treatment technologies. Herein, bacterial community composition was investigated as an isolated variable within batch biofilm reactors via comparison of PPCP removals for three distinct inocula. Inocula pre-acclimated to model PPCPs were derived from activated sludge (AS), ditch sediment historically-impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluent (Sd), and material from laboratory-scale soil aquifer treatment (SAT) columns. PPCP removals were found to be substantially higher for AS- and Sd-derived inocula compared to the SAT-derived inocula despite comparable biomass. Removal patterns differed among the 6 model compounds examined (diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and triclosan) indicating differences in biotransformation mechanisms. Sphingomonas, Beijerinckia, Methylophilus, and unknown Cytophagaceae were linked with successful PPCP biodegradation via next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes over time. Results indicate the criticality of applying engineering approaches to control bacterial community compositions in biotreatment systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are included in a group of compounds considered as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in environmental matrices. The quantification of CECs is typically accomplished using chromatographic methods that require several sample pretreatment steps. The current study proposes a voltammetric method to quantify directly nimesulide (NIM) in aqueous samples. The voltammetric parameters were optimized and chosen based on the profile of the voltammograms and peak current intensity. The adequacy of the analytical method was evaluated using validation criteria, such as accuracy, selectivity, linearity, detection, and quantification limits. Linearity was assessed by a standard addition curve at a concentration range of 0.5-130 A mu g L-1 of NIM. The limit of quantification was 0.50 A mu g L-1, with 60 s of preconcentration time. Accuracy was expressed as recovery percentages of NIM and ranged from 111.4 to 119.8%. The voltammetric method herein proposed has several advantages over others already used to determine NIM, such as fewer sample pretreatment steps, faster, and cheaper analyses. NIM was detected in wastewater samples at concentration levels ranging from 101.7 to 385.0 A mu g L-1. This result is the first evidence about NIM occurrences in environmental matrices in the area surrounding the Itaipu Lake reservoir in Brazil.

AB In this study, high permeability flat sheet polysulfone nanofiltration membranes were prepared for amoxicillin (AMX) recovery from pharmaceutical wastewater. Membrane fabrication includes two steps: raw ultrafiltration membrane synthesis by phase inversion method and nanaofiltration membrane synthesis by surface photopolymerization. Raw ultrafiltration membranes were synthesized using different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as pore former and different coagulation bath temperatures (CBTs). The synthesized ultrafiltration membranes were modified using UV-assisted polymerization technique and their performance in the separation of AMX at different pHs, were studied. The results showed that the more irradiation time, the smaller surface pore size. Moreover, the membranes made with higher molecular weight of PEG and coagulation bath temperatures were more susceptible for UV-modification at these conditions; fabricated membranes had higher flux as well as relatively high AMX separation. Moreover, pH enhancement increased AMX rejection by 85%. The effect of irradiation on membrane surface morphology was studied by SEM surface images and the morphological effects of pore former and coagulation bath temperatures on membrane structure were confirmed by SEM cross section images. A fairly comprehensive discussion about the effects of PEG, coagulation bath temperature and irradiation time on membrane structure and AMX recovery performance was represented in this study.

AB This study investigated the fouling mechanism in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by membrane distillation, with a focus on the interfacial electrokinetic effect between the membrane and foulants as well as the surface hydrophobicity effect, and an advanced in-situ optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology. Three antibiotics with different surface charges were used as feed solutions, consisting of cefotaxime (CTX, negatively charged), tobramycin (TOB, positively charged) and ciprofloxacin (CFX, neutral) for studying the interfacial electrokinetic effect. In order to study the influence of membrane hydrophobicity on the fouling process, two commercial membranes with different hydrophobicity were employed; commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (C-PVDF) and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (C-PTFE). Additionally, we also fabricated a fouling resistant polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane coated with perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (FTES)-TiO2 nanoparticles to engineer the surface charge and energy, and to achieve a superhydrophobic surface. After the MD operation, OCT scans detected no visible foulant layer on the three negatively charged membranes when treating negatively charged CTX. On the other hand, in the case of positively charged TOB, the rejection efficiency was only 78% due to its accumulation behavior on the C-PVDF membrane surface, with a thick foulant layer (326-408 mu m) and blockage of pores, while the TiO2-PVDF membrane exhibited a stable performance.

AB Because of the intensive use of pharmaceutical substances in human life, studies on the detection of these chemical compounds and their metabolites as pollutants in water bodies are continuously reported. Some pharmaceutical agents are associated with adverse effects to aquatic life, even at very low concentrations (ng L-1 to g L-1). For instance, the presence of antibiotics and hormones has been associated with increasing proliferation of antibiotic resistant pathogens and feminization and masculinization of some aquatic organisms. Currently, new attempts are being made to minimize or fully remove these types of pollutants from aquatic systems to protect the environment and human health. In this regard, physicochemical and biological treatments are among the most promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical pollutants. These treatments are green alternatives for the degradation of hazardous organic compounds into nontoxic by-products. Here, we review some of the physicochemical and biological treatment methods used for the removal of the most extensively used antibiotics and hormones. Enzymatic oxidation, photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation are described in terms of the aforementioned pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The use of membrane technologies to separate different groups of antibiotics and hormones prior to biologic or physicochemical treatment methods is also addressed.

AB A methodology based on headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) determination was developed for the monitoring and evaluation of the removal efficiency of 16 common fragrance allergens and two polycyclic musks in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). An experimental design with a full factorial model was applied to evaluate the effects of the experimental parameters on the extraction (e.g., salt content, time and extraction temperature). After determining the optimum conditions (2.4 g NaCl, 45 mm at 90 degrees C), an external calibration was performed and quality parameters of the proposed method were evaluated. Method detection limits in the range of 0.01-1.7 mu g L-1 were obtained. Satisfactory inter-day precision values between 4% and 23% (n = 5) were obtained for most compounds. The method was applied to the monitoring of the target analytes in samples from two WWTPs. Seven target compounds were detected at the primary effluent of both plants at mu g L-1 levels. Limonene, linalool and eugenol were quantitatively eliminated during the secondary treatments of both WWTPs, while lilial, benzyl salicylate, galaxolide, and tonalide were still detected at the effluent waters.

AB This study compares two different solar photo-Fenton processes, conventional photo-Fenton at pH3 and modified photo-Fenton at neutral pH with minimal Fe (5 mg L-1) and minimal initial H2O2 (50 mg L-1) concentrations for the degradation of emerging contaminants in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants effluents in solar pilot plant. As Fe precipitates at neutral pH, complexing agents which are able to form photoactive species, do not pollute the environment or increase toxicity have to be used to keep the iron in solution. This study was done using real effluents containing over 60 different contaminants, which were monitored during treatment by liquid chromatography coupled to a hybrid quadrupole/linear ion trap mass analyzer (LC-QTRAP-MS/MS) operating in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Concentrations of the selected contaminants ranged from a few ng L-1 to tens of mu g L-1. It was demonstrated in all cases the removal of over 95% of the contaminants. Photo-Fenton at pH3 provided the best treatment time, but has the disadvantage that the water must be previously acidified. The most promising process was photo-Fenton modified with Ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS), as the pH remained in the neutral range. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have shown that 1H-benzotriazole is a widespread contaminant of wastewater and surface water. Although disinfection by ozone has been shown to efficiently remove this compound, the transformation products have not been identified. To that end, the reaction of ozone with 1H-benzotriazole in aqueous solution has been studied in real time employing quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS) and negative electrospray ionization. The transformation products have been identified by calculating their empirical formulas using accurate mass measurements, and further confirmed by performing the reaction with stable isotope-labeled 1H-benzotriazole and measuring product ion spectra. Stable reaction products were distinguished from transient species by plotting their extracted mass profiles. The products that resulted from ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the reaction were qualitatively identified by modifying the conditions to either promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals, or to scavenge them. Based on experimental evidence, a mechanism for the direct reaction between ozone and 1H-benzotriazole is proposed that results in the formation of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarbaldehyde, which has an empirical formula of C4H3O2N3. Lastly, it was confirmed that the same transformation products formed in surface water and tertiary-treated wastewater, although they were observed to degrade at higher ozone doses.

AB Many transformation products (TPs) from organic micropollutants are not included in routine environmental monitoring programs due to limited knowledge of their occurrence and fate. An efficient method to identify and prioritize critical compounds in terms of environmental relevance is needed. In this study, we applied a strategic screening approach based on a case-control concept to identify TPs formed along wastewater-impacted rivers. Time-integrated samples were collected over one week at both ends of a river stretch downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfall and were analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography interfaced with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToF-MS/MS). The screening procedure of the high-resolution MS (HRMS) datasets consisted of three major steps: (i) screening for parent compounds (PCs) attenuated along the stretch; (ii) prediction of potential TPs from these PCs; and (iii) screening for TPs from this list with an increasing trend along the stretch. In total, 32 PCs decreased along the investigated river stretches. From these PCs, eight TPs had increasing concentrations along the studied stretches and could be tentatively identified. The identification of one TP (benzamide) was confirmed by its corresponding reference standard, while no standards were available for the remaining TPs.

The pulverized precursor was steeped in a saturated ammonium chloride solution (24h) to give the chemically treated adsorbent (AMPH). Pyrolysis of AMPH (623K, 1/2h) yielded the carbonized adsorbent (CMPH). Both adsorbents showed favorable physicochemical attributes (pH, bulk density, attrition, iodine adsorption number/surface area, titratable surface charge, and FT-IR analysis). NOX removal was studied under the effects of initial solution pH (2-11), adsorbent dosage (0.5-2.5g), initial NOX concentration (5-25mg/L), contact time (0-240min), and temperature (298-328K). Optimal NOX uptake (mg/g) by AMPH (1.42) and CMPH (1.88) occurred at solution pH 5 and adsorbent dose of 0.5g. Equilibrium adsorption obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. Free energy change (G degrees), enthalpy change (H degrees), and entropy change (S degrees) indicated that the adsorption of NOX was feasible, spontaneous, exothermic, and physisorptive. Kinetically, NOX uptake increased rapidly within the first 10min for both adsorbents and overall, was well modeled by the Blanchard pseudo-second-order equation. The adsorbents may find use in the removal of microcontaminants of pharmaceutical origin from effluents/wastewater.

AB The concentration of a range of endocrine disruptors: 17-beta-estradiol, estrone, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol-A, pentachlorophenol, triclosan, and butylbenzylphthalate, was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the Wetland zone of Xochimilco, a periurban area of Mexico City, during an annual cycle. Samples were taken based on their level of use and by selecting sampling points related with activities such as agriculture, livestock, and urban, as well as their potential presence in water at the Cerro de la Estrella Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which supplies the majority of water (>90 %) to the study area. The compounds analyzed are present in a wide range of products from cosmetics to home care, pharmaceuticals, and subproducts of the food industry. The importance of identifying these compounds lies in the fact that they can disrupt the endocrine system of vertebrates, in particular reproductive gland function, affecting the development of organisms and their offspring. Pentachlorophenol, triclosan, bisphenol-A, butylbenzylphthalate, estrone, and 17-beta-estradiol were detected in concentrations in nanogram-per-liter levels; 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol was always below the detection limit. The compounds showed a trend toward greater concentrations in the rainy season, probably due to the runoff that carries these compounds into the system.

AB Suspect screening using liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry provides an opportunity for expanding the detection coverage of emerging contaminants in the environment. Screening workflows may suffer from high frequency of false positives or insufficient confidence in the identification of compounds; however, stringent criteria could lead to high false negatives. A workflow must have a balanced criteria, both selective and sensitive, to be able to identify real features without missing low abundant features traceable to analytes of interest. A highly selective (87%) and sensitive (97%) workflow was developed by characterizing the occurrence of contaminants in wastewater and surface water from Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.S. Sixty-eight contaminants were identified and confirmed with reference standards, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. The antimicrobials metronidazole, clindamycin, linezolid, and rifaximin were detected. Notably, antifungal compounds were detected in samples from six countries, with levels up to 1380 ng/L. Amoxicillin transformation products, penilloic acid (285-8047 ng/L) and penicilloic acid (107 ng/L), were confirmed for the first time with reference standards in wastewater samples from India, Sweden, and U.S. This workflow provides an efficient approach to broad-scale identification of emerging contaminants using publicly-available databases for suspect screening and prioritization.

AB The release of untreated or partially treated pharmaceutical wastewater into water bodies has become a serious concern these days as the drugs and their intermediates present affect living forms heavily. Thus, the presented study evaluates the effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin drug on the performance of a technology called microbial fuel cell (MFC) which can generate electricity during wastewater treatment. In the current work, synthetic feed containing ampicillin was fed to two MFCs at different concentrations (10 and 25 mg/L). The MFC fed with 10 mg/L (MFC10) showed 25% higher voltage than the control (MFCC), whereas the reactor fed with 25 mg/L (MFC25) of ampicillin showed 10.2% lower voltage generation than the control. In terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, MFC(10)performed better than MFC(C)followed by MFC25. MFC10 and MFC25 showed comparable ampicillin removal efficiencies of 86% and 84%, respectively. Hence, the ampicillin concentration of 10 mg/L was found to be optimum for enhancing the performance of the MFC. For a concentration close to 25 mg/L or higher, the performance of the MFC was found to be negatively affected. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Point-source measures have been suggested to decrease pharmaceuticals in water bodies. We analyzed 68 and 50 alternatives, respectively, for a typical Swiss general and psychiatric hospital to decrease pharmaceutical discharge. Technical alternatives included reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated carbon; organizational alternatives included urine separation. To handle this complex decision, we used Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and combined expert predictions (e.g., costs, pharmaceutical mass flows, ecotoxicological risk, pathogen removal) with subjective preference-valuations from 26 stakeholders (authorities, hospital-internal actors, experts). The general hospital contributed ca. 38% to the total pharmaceutical load at the wastewater treatment plant, the psychiatry contributed 5%. For the general hospital, alternatives removing all pharmaceuticals (especially reverse osmosis, or vacuum-toilets and incineration), performed systematically better than the status quo or urine separation, despite higher casts. They now require closer scrutiny. To remove X-ray contrast agents, introducing roadbags is promising. For the psychiatry with a lower pharmaceutical load, costs were more critical. Stakeholder feedback concerning MCDA was very positive, especially because the results were robust across different stakeholder-types. Our MCDA results provide insight into an important water protection issue: implementing measures to decrease pharmaceuticals will likely meet acceptance. Hospital point-sources merit consideration if the trade-off between costs and pharmaceutical removal is reasonable.

AB In this study, a three-dimensional electrochemical process with aluminum electrodes in the presence of granular activated carbon derived from walnut shell (WGAC) was employed to remove Diclofenac from synthetic water. Optimum operating conditions were determined using response surface methodology, also, an empirical relationship was established between response and independent variables (activated carbon amount, contact time, pH, and electrolyte concentration). The results showed that activated carbon amount and NaCl concentration were the most influential factors on the removal efficiency, and the most significant factor affecting electrical energy was NaCl concentration. Additionally, three-dimensional electrochemical process with granular activated carbon has the potential to work in the pH range from 1 to 9. The optimal conditions to gain maximum removal efficiency and minimum electrical energy were determined to be 4.36 g granular activated carbon, 40 min contact time, and 4390 ppm of NaCl. In addition, to show the physical characteristics of activated carbon, the field emission scanning electron microscopy and BET analysis were applied, and Spectrophotometric technique was used to determine diclofenac concentration. Considering high removal efficiency and low electrical energy consumption, the three-dimensional electrochemical process with WGAC can be considered a cost-effective and practicable method to remove diclofenac from water and wastewater.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the response of bacteria, in terms of microbial community structure, from constructed wetland (CW) microcosms exposed to two veterinary antibiotics, enrofloxacin (ENR) and ceftiofur (CEF), alone or in a mixture, identifying which bacterial groups were dominant in CWs substrate during livestock wastewater treatment. Wastewater, not-doped or doped with ENR and/or CEF (100 mu g/L each), was treated during 18 one-week cycles. Systems showed removal percentages > 85% for the added antibiotics, showing also high removal percentages for nutrients and organic matter and confirming CWs systems were working properly. However, both time of exposure and presence of antibiotics influenced significantly CWs substrate bacterial community structure. Pyrosequencing results showed bacterial communities were dominated by phyla Proteobacteria (38-48%), Firmicutes (20-27%), Bacteroidetes (12-15%) and Actinobacteria (4-9%), and that their relative abundance was clearly affected by the presence of the antibiotics. Results suggest the applicability of CWs for the removal of veterinary antibiotics from livestock wastewaters and provide new knowledge about the bacteria within the system, which can potentially be involved in removal processes. This information could in the future be used to improve CWs removal rates of pharmaceuticals from livestock wastewaters.

AB Current design limitations and ineffective remediation techniques in wastewater treatment plants have led to concerns about the prevalence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in receiving waters. A novel photocatalyst, TiO2-doped low-silica X zeolite (TiO2-LSX), was used to study the degradation of the pharmaceutical compound, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The catalyst was synthesized and characterized using XRD, BET surface analysis, SEM-EDAX, and ICP-OES. The effects of different UV light intensities, initial EE2 concentrations, and catalyst dosages on the EE2 removal efficiency were studied. A higher EE2 removal efficiency was attained with UV-TiO2-LSX when compared with UV-TiO2 or UV alone. The EE2 degradation process followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. A comprehensive empirical model was developed to describe the EE2 degradation kinetics under different conditions using multiple linear regression analysis. The EE2 degradation mechanism was proposed basad on molecular calculations, identification of photoproducts using HPLC MS/MS, and reactive species quenching experiments; the results showed that oxidative degradation pathways initiated by hydroxyl radicals were predominant. This novel TiO2-doped zeolite system provides a promising application for the UV disinfection process in wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfapyridine (SPY), sulfonamide (SA) typically used in human therapies, and veterinary SA sulfamethazine (SMZ), are amongst the two SAS most frequently detected in effluent wastewater and surface water respectively. Within this context, this study reports the behaviour of both SAs and their acetylated metabolites, AcSPY and AcSMZ, under artificial irradiance conditions in both high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) water and in reclaimed wastewater, in order to compare the influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and also inorganic matter in the photolysis kinetics. Estimated degradation rate constants (k) ranged from 0.063 h(-1) (SPY) to 2.808 h(-1) (AcSPY), both in HPLC water, with corresponding half-lives (t(1/2)) of 10.93 h and 0.25 h, respectively. A total of 10 different photodegradation products were identified during the photolytic transformation of SPY and 7 for SMZ, through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry analyses (UPLC-QqTOF-MS), which allowed for exact mass measurements. Regarding the acetylated metabolites, 3 photoproducts were generated for AcSMZ and one for AcSPY. The desulfonated products of each of the four analytes under study were the most relevant photodegradation products identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A full-scale combined biological system is used for the treatment of treated wastewater discharged from a pharmaceutical industrial park. This treated water is rich in NH4+-N (average in 86.4 mg/L), low in COD/NH4+-N (average in 3.4) and low in BOD5/COD ratio (average in 0.24) with pH varying from 7.16 to 7.78. The final effluent of the combined treatment process was stably below 100 mg/L COD and 20 mg/L NH4+-N, separately, with organic loading rate of 4954 kg COD/d and 92.5 kg NH4+-N/d. It is found that the BOD5/COD ratio could be raised from 0.24 to 0.35, and the production of total VFAs account for 9.57% of the total COD via the treatment of hydrolysis/acidification. MBBR and oxidation ditch represent 35.4% and 60.7% of NH4+-N removal, 30.2% and 61.5% of COD removal, separately, of the total treatment process. PCR-DGGE is used for microbial community analysis of MBBR and oxidation ditch. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Facilities involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are an under-investigated source of pharmaceuticals to the environment Between 2004 and 2009, 35 to 38 effluent samples were collected from each of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in New York and analyzed for seven pharmaceuticals including opioids and muscle relaxants. Two WWTPs (NY2 and NY3) receive substantial flows (>20% of plant flow) from pharmaceutical formulation facilities (PFF) and one (NY1) receives no PFF flow. Samples of effluents from 23 WWTPs across the United States were analyzed once for these pharmaceuticals as part of a national survey. Maximum pharmaceutical effluent concentrations for the national survey and NY1 effluent samples were generally <1 mu g/L. Four pharmaceuticals (methadone, oxycodone, butalbital, and metaxalone) in samples of NY3 effluent had median concentrations ranging from 3.4 to >400 mu g/L. Maximum concentrations of oxycodone (1700 mu g/L) and metaxalone (3800 mu g/L) in samples from NY3 effluent exceeded 1000 mu g/L Three pharmaceuticals (butalbital, carisoprodol, and oxycodone) in samples of NY2 effluent had median concentrations ranging from 2 to 11 mu g/L. These findings suggest that current manufacturing practices at these PFFs can result in pharmaceuticals concentrations from 10 to 1000 times higher than those typically found in WWTP effluents.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) absorption characteristics of poly-Al-Zn-Fe (PAZF), a polymerized coagulant containing three kinds of metallic elements prepared from a galvanized-aluminum slag, was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometry during its polymerization process. Pollutant removal by PAZF in treating various wastewaters was investigated, in comparison with that of polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The results showed that PAZF can be applied to different wastewaters and had excellent coagulation behavior due to its special internal composition. Various complicated substances having different absorption wavelengths and polymeric properties were produced during the PAZF polymerization process, and the structures of these complicated substances were adjusted continuously with the increasing of the polymerization time. PAZF posed better turbidity and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand, CODCr) removal than PAC for different wastewaters, and the required dosage of PAZF was far lower than that of PAC when achieving the same coagulation performance. For pharmaceutical, sugar, dyeing, simulated pesticide and landscape wastewaters, PAZF gave higher removal of turbidity or CODCr than PAC, by up to 79.5% (coagulant dose: 74 mg/L) or 16% (148 mg/L), 13.4% (111 mg/L) or 10% (185 mg/L), 26.5% (148 mg/L) or 8.1% (18.5 mg/L), 40% (18.5 mg/L) or 13.4% (111 mg/L), and 5% (70 mg/L) or 5% (70 mg/L), respectively.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently detected human pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and biosolids. Soil is a primary environmental compartment receiving CBZ through wastewater irrigation and biosolid application. In this study, we explored the transformation of CBZ to biologically active intermediates in soil. Both C-14 labeling and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to track transformation kinetics and identify major degradation intermediates. Through 120 days of incubation under aerobic conditions, mineralization of CBZ did not exceed 2% of the spiked rate in different soils. Amendment of biosolids further suppressed mineralization. The fraction of non-extractable (i.e., bound) residue also remained negligible (<5%). On the other hand, CBZ was transformed to a range of degradation intermediates, including 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, acridone-N-carbaldehyde, 4-aldehyde-9-acridone, and acridine, of which acridone-N-carbaldehyde was formed in a large fraction and appeared to be recalcitrant to further degradation. Electrocyclization, ring cleavage, hydrogen shift, carbonylation, and decarbonylation contributed to CBZ transformative reactions in soil, producing biologically active products. The persistence of the parent compound and formation of incomplete intermediates suggest that CBZ has a high risk for off-site transport from soil, such as accumulation into plants and contamination of groundwater.

AB The search for optimal catalysts to improve the working efficiency of ozonation has always been an important issue in the research field of advanced oxidation processes. In this study, a novel catalyst, ferrosilicon, was selected as the catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation to degrade ibuprofen (IBP) in water and treat real pharmaceutical wastewater. During the procedure, 45(#)ferrosilicon exhibited the best catalytic activity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the IBP removal reached 75%, which was a great improvement compared to the 37% removal by ozone alone. The 45(#)-ferrosilicon-catalysed ozonation also achieved 68% TOC removal for real pharmaceutical wastewater, which was 31% higher than that by ozone alone. The degradation pathway of IBP was proposed using GC/MS. The EPR test proved that the main active species in the system were free active radicals center dot OH, and the measured accumulative center dot OH amount was 102 mu mol. The characterization results show that the nascent metallic oxides, hydroxides, and hydroxyoxides on the ferrosilicon surface facilitated the decomposition of ozone molecules and generation of free active radicals. The removal of target organic contaminants in the water was mainly attributed to the oxidization of these highly active species. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing were used to simultaneously examine both bacteria and fungi across temporal and spatial scales in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The ratio of fungi to bacteria was 0.43% on average after accounting for the multicopies in 16S rRNA gene (54.63%), indicating the number of fungi was far lower than bacteria in active sludge. The Miseq sequencing results revealed obvious seasonal and spatial variations in bacterial and fungal distribution patterns in WWTPs. Compared to bacteria, fungi showed a lower divergence in alpha and beta diversity, and exhibited less taxonomic diversity in both abundant and rare subcommunities at the class level, suggesting that the fungal community was less variable in this artificial ecosystem. Such variation of microbial communities was significantly correlated with geographical distance, DO, temperature, HRT, SRT, COD. TN and TP. In activated sludge, the main function of bacteria was chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, and nitrogen cycling processes, while the dominant functional guilds of fungi were saprotroph, animal pathogen, and animal endosymbiont. Moreover, both bacteria and fungi could play important roles in the degradation of toxicants, like hydrocarbon and aromatic compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation is used as additional wastewater treatment option to remove recalcitrant micropollutants. It also removes the estrogenic activity found in wastewater but not always the anti-estrogenic activity. This can be explained by an incomplete removal of anti-estrogenic micropollutants or by formation of transformation products (TPs) which retain the activity. The present study investigates the degradation of the anti-estrogenic pharmaceutical tamoxifen in pure water, regarding TP formation and related anti-estrogenic effect using Arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (A-YES). In total, five transformation products were detected: three N-oxides and two further products (TP 270 and TP 388). For the transformation product TP 270 a correlation of the extent of formation with an increase of the anti-estrogenic activity was determined, demonstrating that transformation products from ozonation can be more active in a bioassay than the parent compounds. Our study shows also that the transformation of tamoxifen to N-oxides reduces the anti-estrogenic activity. The reactivity of amines towards ozone typically increases with pH, since only deprotonated amines react with ozone. Hence, removal of the endocrine activity by N-oxide formation may be disfavored at low pH. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a disinfection by-product (DBP) with many known precursors such as amine-containing pharmaceuticals that can enter the environment via treated wastewater. Reverse osmosis and tight nanofiltration membranes (MW cutoff < 200 Da) are treatment technologies that demonstrate high removal of many compounds, but at relatively high energy costs. Looser membranes (>200 Da) may provide sufficient removal of a wide range of contaminants with lower energy costs. This study examined the rejection of pharmaceuticals that are known NDMA precursors (similar to 300 Da) using nanofiltration (MW cutoff 350 Da). MQ water was compared to two raw water sources, and results illustrated that NDMA precursors (as estimated by formation potential testing) were effectively rejected in all water matrices (>84%). Mixtures of pharmaceuticals vs. single-spiked compounds were found to have no impact on rejection from the membranes used. The use of MQ water vs. surface waters illustrated that natural organic matter, colloids, and inorganic ions present did not significantly impact the rejection of the amine-containing pharmaceuticals. This study illustrates that NDMA formation potential testing can be effectively used for assessing NDMA precursor rejection from more complex samples with multiple and/or unknown NDMA precursors present, such as wastewater matrices.

AB Using HPLC method with DAD detection for the simultaneous determination of 15 pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups in surface water and wastewater was proposed. The determined drugs included the analgesic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) paracetamol (PAR), metamizole (MTZ), aspirin (ASP), salicylic acid (SAL), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET), diclofenac (DIC), and naproxen (NAP); the corticosteroids dexamethasone (DEX) and prednisolone (PRE); the beta-blockers carvedilol (CAR), metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), and sotalol (SOT); and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBM). Three solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns were examined for the pre-concentration of water samples: the Oasis HLB, NEXUS and Bond Elut ENV The concentration level for which each method was validated in spiked water samples was 0.2 mu g/L. The Oasis HLB column yielded the best recovery efficiency. Different HPLC columns were examined to achieve the best separations with the shortest possible time. The best column, C-30 and was used for the determination of drugs from water samples.. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of water samples, mostly from rivers, and can be used for screening as a rapid and low-cost analytical tool. However, to confirm the positive findings MS techniques should be applied.

AB Atorvastatin (ATV) has been widely detected in wastewater treatment plant and aquatic environment. Limited mineralization ratio of ATV in current wastewater treatment processes may result in the accumulation of its transformation intermediates in effluent and cause additional ecological risk to the environment. In this study effectiveness of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by CuFe2O4 on the degradation of ATV in water were examined. Complete removal of ATV was achieved by using 40 ppm CuFe2O4 and 25 mu mol dm(-3) PMS. Eight intermediates were identified and four degradation pathways were proposed. The distribution of major intermediates ATV lactone (P-541), hydroxylated ATV lactone (P-557) and the pyrrole ring-open intermediate (P-416) were monitored with different PMS dosages. As PMS concentration increased from 25 to 150 mu mol dm-3, the main intermediates accumulated were evolved from P-541 and P-557 to P-557 and P-416, and all intermediates were completely degraded with 750 mu mol dm(-3) PMS. 61.72% TOC removal was achieved at pH 7.0 with 100 ppm CuFe2O4 and 3 m mol dm(-3) PMS, which indicated that ATV could be well mineralized if PMS and CuFe2O4 dosages were reasonably used. Overall, this study provided practical knowledge for ATV removal by CuFe2O4/PMS at ambient temperature.

AB We herein report the removal of amodiaquine, an emerging drug contaminant from aqueous solution using [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] (fum = fumaric acid; bpy = 4,4-bipyridine; bdc = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents. The adsorbents were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Adsorption process for both adsorbents were found to follow the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the adsorption equilibrium data fitted best into the Freundlich isotherm with the R-2 values of 0.973 and 0.993 obtained for [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities foramodiaquine in this study were found to be 0.478 and 47.62 mg/g on the [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] MOFs respectively, and were obtained at pH of 4.3 for both adsorbents. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis of the MOFs after the adsorption process showed the presence of the drug. The results of the study showed that the prepared MOFs could be used for the removal of amodiaquine from wastewater.

AB The selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen is the most commonly used drug for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen is considered as a pro-drug since it is known to exert its pharmacological effect through its major active metabolites, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, which are mainly excreted in the urine in the days following administration.
   In the present work, the reactivity of tamoxifen and its major active metabolites in free chlorine-containing water was investigated for the first time. Under the studied chlorination conditions, tamoxifen was fairly stable whereas its metabolites were quickly degraded. A total of thirteen chlorinated byproducts were tentatively identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. Time-course profiles of the identified byproducts were followed in real wastewater samples under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. A preliminary assessment of their acute aquatic toxicity at two trophic levels by means of quantitative structure activity relationship models showed that the identified byproducts were up to 110-fold more toxic than the parent compounds.

   Photocatalytic degradation; RSM; Wastewater treatment
AB The pharmaceutical compound, acetaminophen (ACT), is considered an environmental contaminant of emerging concern due to its persistent and bioaccumulation as well as toxicity towards human health and aquatic life. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are ineffective in the removal of ACT; thus, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are required. The heterogeneous photocatalysis process based on TiO2 semiconductor presents an effective route for the degradation of various pharmaceuticals. In this sense, Fe2O3-TiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized via the sol-gel method and characterized via XRD, N-2 physisorption, FE-SEM, EDX, UV-vis DRS, TEM, XPS, and FT-IR. The results showed that the incorporation of 5 wt% Fe2O3 has significantly increased the BET surface area, reduced particle size, stabilized the anatase phase, enhanced the optical properties of Fe2O3-TiO2 by a redshift to longer wavelength (visible light), and reduced the bandgap to 1.6 eV. The XPS results confirmed the presence of T4+ and Fe3+ in the synthesized nanocomposite., while TEM images confirmed the reduction in particle size. The photocatalytic degradation of ACT was further optimized by the response surface method based on Face-centered central composite design. Results revealed that the highest removal rate of ACT was observed at alkaline (pH 11) conditions, initial concentration of ACT of 30 mg/L, and catalyst loading of 1.25 g/L.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) treatment of municipal wastewater effluent is becoming more common as water reuse is implemented in water-stressed regions. Where RO concentrate is discharged with limited dilution, concentrations of trace organic contaminants could pose risks to aquatic ecosystems. To provide a low-cost option for removing trace organic compounds from RO concentrate, a pilot-scale treatment system comprising open-water unit-process wetlands with and without ozone pretreatment was studied over a 2-year period. A suite of ecotoxicologically relevant organic contaminants was partially removed via photo- and bio-transformations, including beta-adrenergic blockers, antivirals, antibiotics, and pesticides. Biotransformation rates were as fast as or up to approximately 50% faster than model predictions based upon data from open-water wetlands that treated municipal wastewater effluent. Phototransformation rates were comparable to or as much as 60% slower than those predicted by models that accounted for light penetration and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. Several compounds were transformed during ozone pretreatment that were poorly removed in the open-water wetland. The combined treatment system resulted in a decrease in the risk quotients of trace organic contaminants in the RO concentrate, but still dilution may be required to protect sensitive species from urban-use pesticides with low environmental effect concentrations.

AB Treatment of waste and drinking waters has gained importance in both emerging and industrialized countries. New pharmaceutical products, industrial processes, agricultural activities are reducing water quality. To solve these problems we propose an efficient and thus economical purification method which uses commercial available natural zeolites as coating material on engineered porous ceramic substrates produced by additive manufacturing. The filters were produced varying the coating thickness and processing parameters such as calcination time and temperature. A testing device was assembled to investigate the filters' performance by exposing them in flowing water (240 Lh(-1)). The micropollutant adsorption was tested in three different water matrices (distilled water, surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluent). A range of 0.05 mg NH4-N g(-1) up to 3.1 mg NH4- NH4-N g(-1) zeolite of ammonium nitrogen was observed on the processed filters. Good filter stability expressed as weight loss (<5%) was observed. The adsorption of ten tested micropollutants showed an overall efficiency of 41.5% and 43% on the surface modified zeolite filters. Natural zeolite filters showed good specific adsorption capacity for metoprolol, citalopram, venlaflaxine and clarithromycin whereas the surface modified zeolite (SMZ) filters adsorb better hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac, candesartan, mecoprop and irbesartan.

AB As a result of the widespread use of antibiotics, a large amount of excretion from human and animals containing antibiotic residues was discharged into the environment with wastewaters and manures, leading to potential adverse effects on ecosystem health. To understand the environmental fate of antibiotics, a dynamic level IV fugacity model was established here by introducing the novel process of nondiffusive wastewater irrigation from water to soil, and applied to a large-scale water-scarce region, the megacity Beijing. Furthermore, a Monte-Carlo based risk assessment approach was employed to evaluate the potential risks posed by antibiotics in water, sediment and soil, combined with the soil-water equilibrium partitioning method. Model validation, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis suggests that the fugacity model can successfully simulate the reported concentration data within an average difference of 0.2 logarithmic units. Results showed that more than one hundred tonnes of antibiotics were estimated to be discharged into the environment of Beijing in 2013, and, resulted in high antibiotics levels and posed high potential risks on the aquatic environment. On the other hand, although wastewater irrigation increased the antibiotics concentrations in soil and even dominated the total transfer fluxes, the overall risk levels of antibiotics in the soil were acceptable.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare microcontaminant degradation of a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluent by direct solar photo-Fenton treatment at neutral pH and a combined nanofiltration (NF)/solar photo-Fenton process at pilot plant scale. Photo-Fenton was run with Fe [(S,S)-ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS)] complex. The membrane pilot plant consisted of NF modules with a total surface area of 5.2 m(2), and photo-Fenton was run in a solar pilot plant (total surface of solar collectors 3 m(2), total volume of the plant 35 L) with an iron complexing agent at low iron (<0.2 mM) and H2O2 (<2 mM) concentrations. A QTRAP MS/MS system was used to evaluate micropollutant degradation (35 were evaluated, seven in concentrations over 1000 ng L-1) and >90% degradation took less than 12 min. It was demonstrated that the use of the combined NF/solar photo-Fenton process reduced required H2O2 consumption by 53% and energy by 67%, compared with direct photo-Fenton treatment of the same MWTP effluent.

AB Well-defined, uniform bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) microcolumns were synthesized through a refined hydrothermal route. During the fabrication process, a detailed orthogonal design on the synthetic conditions was performed, aiming to optimize the experimental parameters to produce BiVO4 materials (BiVO4 (Opt.)) with the most prominent visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency, where the catalytic activities of the synthesized materials were evaluated via the decolorization of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. The BiVO4 (Opt.) were then targetedly produced according to the determined optimal conditions and well characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet and visible diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared with the commercial P25-TiO2 photocatalysts, the as-synthesized BiVO4 (Opt.) displayed superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activities for the degradation of metronidazole-contained wastewater with the presence of H2O2. The degradation efficiency of metronidazole reached up to 70 % within 180 min, leading to a brief speculation on the possibly major steps of the visible-light-driven photocatalytic process. The current study provides a distinctive route to design novel shaped BiVO4 architectures with advanced photocatalytic capacities for the treatment of organic pollutants in the aqueous environment.

AB Urban water supplies are traditionally based on limited freshwater resources located outside the cities However a range of concepts and techniques to exploit alternative water resources has gained ground as water demands begin to exceed the freshwater available to cities Based on 113 cases and 15 in-depth case studies solutions used to increase water self-sufficiency in urban areas are analyzed The main drivers for increased self-sufficiency were identified to be direct and indirect lack of water constrained infrastructure high quality water demands and commercial and institutional pressures Case studies demonstrate increases in self-sufficiency ratios to as much as 80% with contributions from recycled water seawater desalination and rainwater collection The introduction of alternative water resources raises several challenges energy requirements vary by more than a factor of ten amongst the alternative techniques wastewater reclamation can lead to the appearance of trace contaminants in drinking water and changes to the drinking water system can meet tough resistance from the public Public water-supply managers aim to achieve a high level of reliability and stability We conclude that despite the challenges self-sufficiency concepts in combination with conventional water resources are already helping to reach this goal (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB There are many reports documenting the adverse effects, such as feminization of fish, of estrogen hormones in the environment. One of the major sources of these compounds is from municipal wastewater effluents. The biological processes at municipal wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove these compounds. This paper discusses the use of ultrasound to destroy estrogen compounds in water. The study examines the effect of ultrasound power density and power intensity on the destruction of various estrogen compounds which include: 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol, equilin, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel. These tests were conducted in single component batch and flow through reactors using 0.6, 2 and 4 kW ultrasound sources. The sonolysis process produced 80-90% destruction of individual estrogens at initial concentration of 10 mu g/L within 40-60 min of contact time. First order rate constants for the individual compounds under different conditions are presented. The estrogen degradation rates increase with increase in power intensity. However, the energy efficiency of the reactor was higher at lower power density. The 4 kW ultrasound reactor was more energy efficient compared to the 0.6 and 2 kW sonicators. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, home-made Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were studied for passive sampling of 15 endocrine disrupting compounds (4 alkylphenols and steroid hormones) in influent and effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as up- and downstream of the receiving river water.
   POCIS calibration at laboratory conditions was carried out using a continuous-flow calibration system. The influence of the exposure position of the POCIS within the calibration device, horizontal or vertical, to the water flow direction was evaluated. While the sampling rates of most of the target substances were not affected by the sampler position, for cis-ADT, E1, E2 and E3, the vertical position provided the highest analyte accumulation. Hence, the POCIS samplers were preferably exposed vertical to the water flow in overall experiments. Using the continuous-flow calibration device, lab-based sampling rates were determined for all the target compounds (R-SBPA = 0.0326 L/d; R-ScisADT = 0.0800 L/d, R-SE1 = 0.0398 L/d, R-SEQ = 0.0516 L/d, R-STT = 0.0745 L/d, R-SE2 = 0.0585 L/d, R-SEE2 = 0.0406 L/d, R-SNT = 0.0846 L/d, R-SPG = 0.0478 L/d and R-SE3 = 0.1468 L/d), except for DES, MeEE2, 4t0P, 4OP, 4NP5, where the uptake after 14 days POCIS exposure was found to be insignificant or indicated a no linear behaviour. Recoveries from POCIS extractions were in the range between 71 and 152% for most of the target analytes except for DES and E3 with around 59%. Good precision of the sampling procedure up till 20% was observed and limits of detection were at ng/L level. Two deuterated compounds ([H-2(3)]-E2 and [H-2(4)]-EQ) were successfully tested as performance reference compounds (PRC, k(e[2H3]-E2) = 0.0507 L/d and k(e[2H4]-EQ) = 0.0543 L/d)).
   Finally, the POCIS samplers were tested for monitoring EDCs at two wastewater treatment plants, in Halle and Leipzig (Germany). BPA, E1, EQ, E2, MeEE2, NT, EE2, PG and E3 were quantified and their time-weighted average concentrations calculated on the basis of the lab-derived sampling rates were compared with the results based on conventional grab samples. While the influent concentration of BPA, cisADT, E1, TT, PG, EE2 reached the mu g/L level, the rest of the target analytes were determined at ng/L. The analyte concentrations in the effluent never exceed ng/L level except for BPA. The concentration determined by spot sampling was partially lower (BPA, E1, TT) or comparable (EQ. E2, EE2, PG, E3) to the concentration obtained by POCIS using performance reference compounds (PRC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the different aquatic compartments is a major environmental issue. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a heterocyclic antiepileptic, which is neutral between pH 3 and 11, is known to resist biodegradation. Its elimination in wastewater treatment plants is below 20% regardless of the primary and/or secondary treatments currently implemented. Its presence in groundwater raises questions about soil permeability in relation to this molecule. In order to provide meaningful answers, the CBZ adsorption performances of the principal mineral constituents of a natural soil (alumina, quartz, goethite, haematite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and a saponin stevensite) and of an industrial activated carbon were assessed. Prior to the batch adsorption tests, the texture, mineralogy, and zero point of charge of these products were determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible spectrometry were used to characterize the CBZ used. With the exception of stevensite, these minerals did not adsorb CBZ. However, stevensite's affinity for CBZ remained very low compared to that of activated carbon (235 mg/g, tap water), which proved to be the most appropriate product for eliminating CBZ. The pi-pi, CH-pi, and hydrogen bonds are the basis for the interactions established between CBZ and activated carbon, and their combination increases the overall adsorption efficiency.

AB Methylparaben and triclosan are antimicrobial agents widely used as preservatives in a variety of personal care and pharmaceutical products. Wastewater is considered the main source of these compounds in the environment. Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors are a high rate technology for wastewater treatment based on biological processes and have been shown to be efficient in removing different types of compounds; however, little is known about the effect of contaminants such as methylparaben and triclosan on their behavior and effectiveness. In this study, we evaluate and compare the microbial and physicochemical behavior of EGSB systems during methylparaben and triclosan removal. The presence of different concentrations of pollutants had an influence on the cluster organization of microbial communities, especially bacteria. However, this did not affect the stability and performance of the EGSB systems. The banding patterns of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of archaea demonstrated the constant presence and abundance of Methanosaeta concilii throughout all stages of operation, showing that this microorganism played a fundamental role in the stability of the reactors for the production of methane. The type of compound and its concentration influenced the expression of the mcrA and ACAs genes; however, these changes did not alter the stability and performance of the EGSB systems.

AB A municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a melting pot of numerous pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) together with many other substances. The removal of PPCPs using advanced oxidation processes within a WWTP is one way to reduce the amount of PPCPs that potentially enter an aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the ozone (O-3)/UV treatment process, especially, the effects of O-3 dose and reaction time, on the removal of PPCPs in the secondary effluent of a WWTP. Experiments were conducted using a pilot-scale treatment process that consisted of two flow-through reactors connected in series. Each reactor was equipped with three 65 W lamps (UV65W). The experimental variables were ozone dosage (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mg L-1) and hydraulic retention time (HRT; 5 and 10 min). On the basis of the PPCP concentrations after O-3/UV65W treatment and their limit of detection (LOD), 38 PPCPs detected in the secondary effluent were classified into 5 groups ranging from the category of "sensitive" to O-3/UV65W or "unstable" in the O-3/UV65W process to the category of "insensitive" to O-3/UV65W or "very stable" in the O-3/UV65W process.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are emerging contaminants that have been detected in surface water across the world. Because conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat such pollutants, new technologies are needed to degrade and oxidize such contaminants. The newly developed oxy-cracking process was utilized to treat the antidiabetic drug, metformin. The process, which involved partial oxidation of metformin in alkaline aqueous medium, proved to decompose the drug into small organic molecules, with minimum emission of CO2, therefore, increasing its biodegradability and removal from industrial treatment plants. The reaction gaseous products were probed by online gas chromatography. The liquid phase before and after oxy-cracking was analyzed for total carbon content by TOC and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The products formed from the nitrogen-rich drug included ammonia, amines, amidines, and urea derivatives. A reaction mechanism for the oxy-cracking process is proposed. Because the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) is believed to play a central role in the oxy-cracking process, the mechanism is initiated by (OH)-O-center dot attacks on metformin, followed by single decomposition or isomerization steps into stable products. The reactions were investigated using density functional theory calculations and validated using high quality 2nd order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory energy calculations.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug that is frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants, soil and plants after irrigation with treated wastewater or application of biosolids. However, little information is available on the fate and uptake of CBZ in edible vegetables. In this study, radioautographic visualization of the C-14 distribution revealed that C-14-CBZ can be taken up by all three ready-to-eat vegetables. Furthermore, a mass-balance study was conducted to evaluate the dynamic processes of the uptake and translocation of CBZ by C-14 labeling. C-14-CBZ was gradually taken up with the growth of vegetables, with maximum uptake ratios of 2.19 +/- 0.15, 2.86 +/- 0.24 and 0.25 +/- 0.05% of applied C-14 in celery, carrot and pak choi, respectively. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) based on C-14 measurements ranged from 7.6 to 26.1 for celery, 3.6-12.9 for carrot, and 4.4-44 for pak choi. C-14-CBZ was easily translocated from the roots to the leaves and/or stems. The amendment of biosolids had a significant inhibitory effect on the uptake and translocation of C-14-CBZ from soil.

AB Platinum-based cytotoxic drugs are complexes of Pt used in 50-70% of cancer patients. This study was performed during 2015, in two oncology wards of Qom hospitals in Iran. Sampling was carried out using effluent of the oncology wards for measurement of total Pt concentration. Analysis was performed by ICP-OES, and limit of detection was determined (LODs = 1 mu g/L). During the sampling days, the total Pt concentration in the wastewater effluent oncology ward ranged from 5 to 762 mu g/L at Shahid Beheshti Hospital and from 3 to 629 mu g/L at Hazrat Masoumeh Hospital. According to the results from concentration of cytotoxic drugs, the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) (ng/L) in wastewater treatment plant effluent and river for cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin were determined. Calculated RQ(hww) showed that Sigma RQ(hww) - 1.19. Thus, the total platinum compound drug could have potential toxicity effect on aquatic organisms. It was concluded that monitoring of cytotoxic drugs residue in hospital effluent must be considered because of their toxicity and impact on aquatic pollution. The results also revealed that PEC < 10 ng/L for all the platinum compound drugs and sum of the PEC calculation (Sigma PPECcis,carbo,oxali).

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater streams, but little is known regarding their roles in membrane fouling during the operation of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study attempted to understand the role of ciprofloxacin exposure in control of filamentous bulking as well as membrane fouling mitigation. Compared with the control MBR, results show that the ciprofloxacin could selectively inhibit and kill filaments present in the mixed liquor, and, as a consequence, the sludge settleability improved significantly. The addition of ciprofloxacin had little influence on organic removals and nitrification, but had an adverse effect on denitrification. In addition, the sludge flocs exposure to ciprofloxacin still kept in compact structure; specifically, granular sludge was finally formed possibly due to the increase of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) corroborated the enrichment of polysaccharides in the EPS exposure to ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, because of the release of EPS and the decay of filaments, soluble microbial products (SMP), particularly soluble polysaccharides, increased significantly in the MBR exposure to ciprofloxacin. Despite this, the results of this study show that the presence of trace contaminants in wastewater streams may play some positive roles in MBR fouling control.

AB The removal efficiency of 6 micro-grain AC (mu GAC) was examined for 23 selected pharmaceutical compounds, usually found at trace level in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Two different sets of experiments were carried out using distilled water and a real WWTP secondary effluent in order to understand the adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals, including the role of the presence of background organic matter. Physical and chemical properties of mu GACs and target pollutants were checked for their potential to predict the pharmaceutical removal. Textural properties of mu GACs, and especially the mesopore volume, seemed to play the most important role during the adsorption without background organic matter whereas the chemistry of the mu GACs, such as the presence of surface oxygen groups and the point of zero charge, could have more influence in the experiments with WWTP effluent water. Positively charged molecules are better adsorbed due to the influence of the background organic matter and the presence of oxygenated groups in the surface of the mu GACs. The UV254 removal correlated well with the pharmaceutical removal and it is confirmed as an indicator to control the performance of pharmaceuticals adsorption with mu GACs in tertiary treatment.

AB This paper aims at presenting the possibilities of applying gas chromatography for the determination of pharmaceutical residues in different matrices. Section one of the study underscores the environmental advantages of employing GC for such analyses. Section two presents the innovative methods for determining pharmaceuticals in the environment. The last section discusses the results of the analysis of the GC and GC-MS market in Poland.
   According to the literature data, the described methods were applied for the analysis of real samples: wastewaters, surface waters, soil samples. The samples were collected from the Pomerania region and the Gulf of Gdansk. The pharmaceuticals were determined in various environmental samples. The highest concentrations were found in raw wastewater, medium in a treated wastewater, and the lowest - in surface water. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were: ibuprofen, paracetamol, diclofenac and naproxen, all belonging to NSAIDs.
   Furthermore, the results of the study of the Polish GC market indicate that a very limited number of entities are currently using chromatographic techniques, and pharmaceutical residues tests are exceptions, mainly due to the lack of the legal requirements in this field and the lack of own laboratories.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are highly consumed pharmaceuticals and concentrated in effluents from conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) since they are not completely eliminated. Under microbial mediated nitrification/denitrification processes occurring in nitrifying activated sludge DCF biotransformed into its nitroso and nitro derivatives (NO-DCF and NO2-DCF, respectively). SMX was biotransformed under denitrification conditions in water/sediment batch reactors into its nitro and desamino derivatives (NO2-SMX and Des-SMX, respectively). Four transformation products (TPs) from DCF and SMX were analized in wastewaters (WW) and receiving surface waters (SW). Nitrifying/denitrifying-derivatives of DCF and SMX were detected for the first time in WW and SW at one order of magnitude lower than their parent compounds. Relationships observed among levels of NO-DCF, NO2-DCF and nitrogen-species tentatively suggested that nitrification/denitrification processes are involved in nitration and nitrosation of DCF during biological WW treatment. Acute toxicity of analytes to Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri was assessed individually and in mixtures with other relevant micropollutants. Individual effects showed these compounds as not harmful and not toxic. However, synergism effects observed in mixtures evidenced that contribution of these compounds to overall toxicity of complex environmental samples, should not be dismissed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation processes are promising technologies for treating biorefractory industrial wastes with organic loads below 20000 mg L-1. In this work, electrochemical oxidation of a real industrial pharmaceutical wastewater with conductive-diamond anodes has been studied. The electrolyses were carried out in discontinuous operation mode under galvanostatic conditions, using a bench-scale plant equipped with a single compartment electrochemical flow cell. For optimizing the process and studying the interaction between the operating conditions, different experiments were performed by modifying the current density (from 25 to 180 mA cm(-2)) and recirculation flow rate (from 105 to 565 ml min(-1)) with residence times between 0 and 570 minutes. The corresponding contribution of these two operative parameters on COD removal and its evolution versus residence time was studied. A time of 98 minutes was obtained in order to evaluate the highest influence of operative parameters. For this time, the current density was found to have a considerable positive effect, while the flow rate proved to be a statistically insignificant variable. ANOVA test reported significance for three of the five involved variables and Response Surface Methodology technique was used to optimize COD removal.

AB This study aims to contribute to the risk management of pharmaceuticals in the environment, illustrating risk perceptions of lay people and experts from Southwestern Europe (Portugal, Spain, and France). The psychometric paradigm was applied to assess risk regarding four hazards: pharmaceuticals in the environment (i.e., broadly framed), pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater, pharmaceuticals in drinking water, and pharmaceuticals in crops. Two factors explained most of the variance of risk assessments: dread and unknown. The dread factor combined immediacy and severity of effects, and the old nature of hazards. Pharmaceuticals in crops and drinking water scored higher in this factor, as did experts and French respondents. The unknown factor differentiated between the assessments of lay people and experts. Lay people assessed the hazards as being more known by those who were exposed but less known by science; and exposure was perceived as more voluntary and the risk as more controllable. Even though pharmaceutical residues are present in much higher concentrations in treated wastewater, risk assessments were overall higher for drinking water and crops. Moreover, data also revealed risk management preferences: whereas lay people preferred technological and awareness-type measures, experts preferred measures to improve the disposal of pharmaceutical waste and health-type measures.

AB This study used suspect and nontarget screening with high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the occurrence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the nearshore marine environment of Puget Sound (WA). In total, 87 non-polymeric CECs were identified; those confirmed with reference standards (45) included pharmaceuticals, herbicides, vehicle-related compounds, plasticizers, and flame retardants. Eight polyfluoroalkyl substances were detected; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) concentrations were as high as 72-140 ng/L at one location. Low levels of methamphetamine were detected in 41% of the samples. Transformation products of pesticides were tentatively identified, including two novel transformation products of tebuthiuron. While a hydrodynamic simulation, analytical results, and dilution calculations demonstrated the prevalence of wastewater effluent to nearshore marine environments, the identity and abundance of selected CECs revealed the additional contributions from stormwater and localized urban and industrial sources. For the confirmed CECs, risk quotients were calculated based on concentrations and predicted toxicities, and eight CECs had risk quotients >1. Dilution in the marine estuarine environment lowered the risks of most wastewater-derived CECs, but dilution alone is insufficient to mitigate risks of localized inputs. These findings highlighted the necessity of suspect and nontarget screening and revealed the importance of localized contamination sources in urban marine environments.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were used as adsorbent material for the removal of clofibric acid (CA) which was difficult to be removed from wastewater by traditional wastewater treatment technique. Adsorption kinetics, adsorption equilibrium, and effect of pH, ionic strength, and humic acid (HA) of the adsorption of CA onto the GO nanosheets in aqueous solution were investigated in detail. Adsorption isotherm studies indicated that the Langmuir isotherm equation fitted the sorption isotherm data better than Freundlich model and the maximum adsorption capacity of GO nanosheets for CA was 994 mg g(-1). In addition, adsorption kinetics data showed that the sorption of CA on GO nanosheets reached equilibration within a few minutes and were well fitted by pseudo second-order model. The results of the effects of environment factors indicated that CA sorption on GO nanosheets was weakly affected by ionic strength and strongly depended on pH and HA because of the structure of CA and the large number of oxygen-containing function groups presented on the surface of GO nanosheets. Besides, the removal efficiency of GO nanosheets for CA was reduced at pH >4 and enhanced at pH <4 in the presence of HA.

AB Removal of seven active pharmaceutical substances (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, clofibric acid, mefenamic acid, and gemfibrozil) was assessed by batch experiments, with suspended biofilm carriers and activated sludge from several full-scale wastewater treatment plants. A distinct difference between nitrifying activated sludge and suspended biofilm carrier removal of several pharmaceuticals was demonstrated. Biofilm carriers from full-scale nitrifying wastewater treatment plants, demonstrated considerably higher removal rates per unit biomass (i.e. suspended solids for the sludges and attached solids for the carriers) of diclofenac, ketoprofen, gemfibrozil, clofibric acid and mefenamic acid compared to the sludges. Among the target pharmaceuticals, only ibuprofen and naproxen showed similar removal rates per unit biomass for the sludges and biofilm carriers. In contrast to the pharmaceutical removal, the nitrification capacity per unit biomass was lower for the carriers than the sludges, which suggests that neither the nitrite nor the ammonia oxidizing bacteria are primarily responsible for the observed differences in pharmaceutical removal. The low ability of ammonia oxidizing bacteria to degrade or transform the target pharmaceuticals was further demonstrated by the limited pharmaceutical removal in an experiment with continuous nitritation and biofilm carriers from a partial nitritation/anammox sludge liquor treatment process.

AB Municipal water recycling may expose humans and the environment to trace organic contaminants. We assessed biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration for removal of organic micropollutants (MPs). Adsorption experiments were carried out in batch reactors containing secondary effluent and new granular activated carbon (GAC) and preloaded BAC media. Results show that BAC has good potential for removal of dissolved organic carbon (40%) and MPs (60-95%). The primary objective was to better understand removal mechanisms of representative MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations. Adsorption and biodegradation of 20 compounds of varying physico-chemical properties were investigated by inhibiting the biomass with azide. Average removal of compounds by adsorption on GAC was 88 +/- 5% with no influence of azide. Average BAC removal was 72 +/- 15%, reduced to 59 +/- 20% after azide addition, showing that biological activity is important for MP removal. Comparison of MP removal by BAC and BAC + azide showed a more important impact of the inhibition on the removal of negatively charged compounds. Sustained removal of recalcitrant compounds showed that BAC maintained sorption capacity. These results highlight the advantage of a combination of adsorption and biodegradation as compared to other biofiltration techniques for the long-term attenuation of MPs.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) can influence pharmaceutical adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC) by direct adsorption competition and pore blocking. However, in the literature there is limited information on which of these mechanisms is more important and how this is related to NOM and pharmaceutical properties. Adsorption batch experiments were carried out in ultrapure, waste- and surface water and fresh and NOM preloaded GAC was used. Twenty-one pharmaceuticals were selected with varying hydrophobicity and with neutral, negative or positive charge. The influence of NOM competition and pore blocking could not be separated. However, while reduction in surface area was similar for both preloaded GAcs, up to 50% lower pharmaceutical removal was observed on wastewater preloaded GAG. This was attributed to higher hydrophobicity of wastewater NOM, indicating that NOM competition may influence pharmaceutical removal more than pore blocking. Preloaded GAG was negatively charged, which influenced removal of charged pharmaceuticals significantly. At a GAG dose of 6.7 mg/L, negatively charged pharmaceuticals were removed for 0-58%, while removal of positively charged pharmaceuticals was between 32-98%. Charge effects were more pronounced in ultrapure water, as it contained no ions to shield the surface charge. Solutes with higher log D could compete better with NOM, resulting in higher removal.

AB We proposed a new peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator that the dispersed CoMn2O4 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (CoMn2O4@N-rGA) with interlinked three-dimensional network via hydrothermal method for oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation. CoMn2O4@N-rGA and PMS (CoMn2O4@N-rGA/PMS) exhibited a high degradation rate of 91.3% within 20 min and a rapid catalytic degradation rate of 0.0729 min(-1). The radical pathway system had excellent effects on OTC degradation in a wide range of pH from 3.0 to 9.0 and an outstanding catalytic activity on actual pharmaceutical wastewater. It was attributed to dispersed CoMn2O4 nanoparticles embed in nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel with interlinked three-dimensional network by Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The mechanism was hypothesized that PMS was activated to generate sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), which could be confirmed via free radical quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. Finally, a flow-type setup based on the feedback mechanism with excellent effect on high concentration of OTC and actual pharmaceutical wastewater was designed for verifying the practical value of the system.

The presence of SMX had no significant impacts on treatment performance of the reactors as well as stability of the granules. Results confirmed different bacterial community structure of flocs and granules. During the operation, variations in bacterial community structure of suspended and granular sludge were observed in all reactors. The variations in bacterial community composition due to the exposure to 2 mu g/L SMX were found after two months in both suspended and granular biomass. Nitrosomonas, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were detected as the genes capable of degrading SMX in both biomass types. Also, Rikenellaceae, Oscillospira, Rhodocyclaceae, Zoogloea, and Shewanella varied in abundance over the operation time. Rikenellaceae and Oscillospira were vulnerable to SMX and decreased in abundance the operation time; while Rhodocyclaceae, Zoogloea, Shewanella, and Aeromonas were found as SMX resistance genes.

AB Urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are a major vector of highly ecotoxic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) for urban and sub-urban streams. Ecotoxicological risk assessments (ERAs) provide essential information to public environmental authorities. Nevertheless, ERAs are mainly performed at very local scale (one or few WWTPs) and on pre-selected list of CECs. To cope with these limits, the present study aims to develop a territorial-scale ERA on CECs previously identified by a "suspect screening" analytical approach (LC-QToF-MS) and quantified in the effluents of 10 WWTPs of a highly urbanized territory during three periods of the year. Among CECs, this work focused on pharmaceutical residue and pesticides. ERA was conducted following two complementary methods: (1) a single substance approach, based on the calculation for each CEC of risk quotients (RQs) by the ratio of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) and Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC), and (2) mixture risk assessment ("cocktail effect") based on a concentration addition model (CA), summing individual RQs. Chemical results led to an ERA for 41 CEC (37 pharmaceuticals and 4 pesticides) detected in treated effluents. Single substance ERA identified 19 CECs implicated in at least one significant risk for streams, with significant risks for DEET, diclofenac, lidocaine, atenolol, terbutryn, atorvastatin, methocarbamol, and venlafaxine (RQs reaching 39.84, 62.10, 125.58, 179.11, 348.24, 509.27, 1509.71 and 3097.37, respectively). Mixture ERA allowed the identification of a risk (RQmix > 1) for 9 of the 10 WWTPs studied. It was also remarked that CECs leading individually to a negligible risk could imply a significant risk in a mixture. Finally, the territorial ERA showed a diversity of risk situations, with the highest concerns for 3 WWTPs: the 2 biggest of the territory discharging into a large French river, the Rh & ocirc;ne, and for the smallest WWTP that releases into a small intermittent stream.

AB Cell-based metabolomics was used in a proof-of-concept fashion to investigate the biological effects of contaminants as they traveled from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge to a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intake in a surface-water usage cycle. Zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells were exposed to water samples collected along a surface-water flowpath, where a WWTP was located similar to 14.5 km upstream of a DWTP. The sampling sites included: 1) upstream of the WWTP, 2) the WWTP effluent discharging point, 3) a proximal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 4) a distal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 5) the drinking water intake, and 6) the treated drinking water collected prior to discharge to the distribution system. After a 48-h laboratory exposure, the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites in ZFL cell extracts were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct changes in metabolite profiles in response to WWTP effluent exposure. These effects on the hydrophilic metabolome gradually diminished downstream of the WWTP, becoming nonsignificant at the drinking water intake (comparable to upstream of the WWTP, p = 0.98). However, effects on the lipophilic metabolome increased significantly as the river flowed from the distal location downstream of the WWTP to the drinking water intake (p < 0.001), suggesting a source of bioactive compounds in this watershed other than the WWTP. ZFL cells exposed to treated drinking water did not exhibit significant changes in either the hydrophilic (p = 0.15) or lipophilic metabolome (p = 0.83) compared to the upstream site, suggesting that constituents in the WWTP effluent were efficiently removed by the drinking water treatment process. Impacts on ZFL cells from the WWTP effluent included disrupted energy metabolism, a global decrease in amino acids, and altered lipid metabolism pathways. Overall, this study demonstrated the utility of cell-based metabolomics as an effective tool for assessing the biological effects of complex pollutant mixtures, particularly when used as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring.

AB Combined sewer systems collect surface runoff as well as wastewater of industrial and domestic origin. During periods of heavy rainfall the capacity of the sewer system is exceeded and the overflow is discharged into receiving waters without any treatment. Consequently, combined sewer overflow (CSO) is considered as a major source of water pollution. This study investigates the effectiveness of a retention soil filter (RSF) for the removal of micropollutants as well as facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria from CSO. The removal of organic group parameters like total organic carbon was excellent and the removal efficiency for micropollutants of the RSF and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which treats wastewater of the same origin during dry and normal weather conditions, was comparable. Compounds of high environmental concern like estrogens or certain pharmaceuticals, e.g. diclofenac, were completely eliminated or removed to a high degree during RSF passage. RSF treatment also reduced the number of E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci by 2.7, 2.2 and 2.4 log-units (median values), respectively. Obviously, some Staphylococcus species can better adapt to the conditions of the RSF than others as a shift of the abundance of the different species was observed when comparing the diversity of staphylococci obtained from the RSF influent and effluent. RSF treatment also decreased the absolute number of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The percentage of antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci isolates also decreased during passage of the RSF, whereas the percentage of resistant enterococci did not change. For E. coli ampicillin and for enterococci and staphylococci erythromycin determined the antibiotic resistance level. The results demonstrate that RSFs can be considered as an adequate treatment option for CSO. The performance for the removal of micropollutants is comparable with a medium sized WWTP with conventional activated sludge treatment. The number of facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria was considerably decreased during RSF passage. However, as RSF effluents still contained antibiotic resistance genes and traces of micropollutants; receiving waters may still be at risk from negative environmental impacts.

AB The diffusion of antibiotic resistance determinants in different environments, e.g., soil and water, has become a public concern for global health and food safety and many efforts are currently devoted to clarify this complex ecological and evolutionary issue. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has an important role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, among the different HGT mechanisms, the capacity of environmental bacteria to acquire naked exogenous DNA by natural competence is still poorly investigated. This study aimed to characterize the ability of the environmentalEscherichia colistrain ED1, isolated from the crustaceanDaphniasp., to acquire exogenous DNA by natural competence. Transformation experiments were carried out varying different parameters, i.e., cell growth phase, amount of exogenous DNA and exposition to artificial lake water (ALW) and treated wastewater to mimic environmental-like conditions that may be encountered in the agri-food system. Results were compared with those showed by the laboratoryE. colistrain DH5 alpha. Our experimental data, supported by genomic sequencing, showed that, when exposed to pure water, ED1 strain was able to acquire exogenous DNA with frequencies (10(-8)-10(-9)) statistically higher than the ones observed for DH5 alpha strain (10(-10)). Interestingly, higher values were retrieved for ED1 than DH5 alpha strains exposed to ALW (10(-7)vs. 10(-9), respectively) or treated wastewater (10(-8)vs. 10(-10), respectively). We tested, therefore, ED1 strain ability to colonize the rhizosphere of lettuce, a model plant representative of raw-consumed vegetables of high economic importance in the ready-to-eat food industry. Results showed that ED1 strain was able to efficiently colonize lettuce rhizosphere, revealing a stable colonization for 14 days-long period. In conclusion, ED1 strain ability to acquire exogenous DNA in environmental-like conditions by natural competence, combined with its ability to efficiently and stably colonize plant rhizosphere, poses the attention to food and human safety showing a possible route of diffusion of antibiotic resistance in the agri-food system, sustaining the "One Health" warnings related to the antibiotic spread.

AB Effluent organic matter (EfOM), contained in treated municipal wastewater, differs in composition from naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM). The presence of EfOM may thus alter the photochemical production of reactive intermediates in rivers that receive measurable contributions of treated municipal wastewater. Quantum yield coefficients for excited triplet-state OM ((OM)-O-3*) and apparent quantum yields for singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were measured for both whole water samples and OM isolated by solid phase extraction from whole water samples collected upstream and downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges in three rivers receiving differing effluent contributions: Hockanum R., CT (22% (v/v) effluent flow), E. Fork Little Miami R., OH (11%), and Pomperaug R., CT (6%). While only small differences in production of these reactive intermediates were observed between upstream and downstream whole water samples collected from the same river, yields of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) varied by 30-50% between the rivers. Apparent quantum yields of O-1(2) followed similar trends to those of (OM)-O-3*, consistent with (OM)-O-3* as a precursor to O-1(2) formation. Higher (OM)-O-3* reactivity was observed for whole water samples than for OM isolates of the same water, suggesting differential recoveries of photoreactive moieties by solid phase extraction. (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) yields increased with increasing E-2/E-3 ratio (A(254 nm) divided by A(365 nm)) and decreased with increasing electron donating capacities of the samples, thus exhibiting trends also observed for reference hurnic and fulvic acid isolates. Mixing experiments with EfOM and DOM isolates showed evidence of quenching of triplet DOM by EfOM when measured yields were compared to theoretical yields. Together, the results suggest that effluent contributions of up to 25% (v/v) to river systems have a negligible influence on photochemical production of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) apparently because of quenching of triplet DOM by EfOM. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of whole water studies for quantifying in situ photoreactivity, particularly for (OM)-O-3*.

AB CWO (catalytic wet oxidation) of a process wastewater and phenolate solution was carried out at 230 degrees C, 200 degrees C and total pressure of 50 bar, with oxygen, in a stainless steel autoclave. Monolith Ti mesh supported precious metal oxide catalysts were characterized with XPS, ICP-MS, SEM and their activity compared in oxidation of model and real wastewaters.
   The Ru/Ir oxide coated Ti monolith catalysts showed remarkable catalytic activity in wet oxidation both in the overall oxidation expressed by COD (chemical oxygen demand) decrease and in the carbon mineralization expressed by TOC (total organic carbon) decrease. This was valid for the real pharmaceutical wastewater as well as for a phenolate solution too. Meshes containing Ru, Pd and Ir oxide alone were less active than Ru/Ir together on Ti. This observation is in accordance with the electrochemical properties of the same mesh used in hypochlorite production.
   The commercial mesh was most stable under the conditions of wet oxidation, however the loss of its precious metal content was observed during longer usage. The Ru/Ir monolith catalysts prepared in our laboratories had similar initial activity but they were less stable, the leaching and/or abrasion of the surface precious metal oxide layer was faster, independently of that their had fragmented or continuous structure, resulting from the preparation methods.
   The loss of activity during longer usage can be the result of deposition of iron and silicon oxides too, as showed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis.
   An important feature of the good catalytic activity of the Ru/Ir oxide coated Ti mesh can be the uniform distribution of the two oxides showed by LA-ICPMS (laser ablation-inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry). According to XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) results, the upper surface layer of the catalysts is covered by a mixture of Ru-Ir-Ti oxide of approximately 0.1:0.02:1 atomic ratio for commercial catalyst, and an 0.5:0.7:1.0 atomic ratio for catalysts prepared in our laboratories. We suppose that such mixture of oxides with uniform distribution are the carrier of the good catalytic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are continuously affected by anthropogenic pressure. One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.

AB An urban watershed in northern New Jersey was studied to determine the presence of four classes of antibiotic compounds (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines) and six degradates in the water column and bottom sediments upstream and downstream from the discharges of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a drinking-water intake (DWI). Many antibiotic compounds in the four classes not removed by conventional WWTPs enter receiving waters and partition to stream sediments.
   Samples were collected at nine sampling locations on 2 days in September 2008. Two of the nine sampling locations were background sites upstream from two WWTP discharges on Hohokus Brook. Another background site was located upstream from a DWI on the Saddle River above the confluence with Hohokus Brook Because there is a weir downstream of the confluence of Hohokus Brook and Saddle River, the DWI receives water from Hohokus Brook at low stream flows.
   Eight antibiotic compounds (azithromycin (maximum concentration 024 mu g/L), ciprofloxacin (0.08 mu g/L), enrofloxacin (0.015 mu g/L), erythromycin (0.024 mu g/L), ofloxacin (0.92 mu g/L), sulfamethazine (0.018 mu g/L), sulfamethoxazole (0.25 mu g/L), and trimethoprim (0.14 mu g/L)) and a degradate (erythromycin-H2O (0.84 mu g/L)) were detected in the water samples from the sites downstream from the VVWTP discharges. The concentrations of six of the eight detected compounds and the detected degradate compound decreased with increasing distance downstream from the WVVTP discharges.
   Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim were detected in stream-bottom sediments. The concentrations of three of the four compounds detected in sediments were highest at a sampling site located downstream from the WWTP discharges. Trimethoprim was detected in the sediments from a background site. Pseudo-partition coefficients normalized for streambed sediment organic carbon concentration were calculated for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Generally, there was good agreement between the decreasing order of the pseudo-partition coefficients in this study and the order reported in the literature. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB For successful wastewater reclamation, advanced oxidation processes have attracted attention for elimination of emerging contaminants. In this study, the synergistic treatment with UV irradiation and chlorine (UV/chlorine) was used to degrade carbamazepine (CBZ). Neither UV irradiation alone nor chlorination alone could efficiently degraded CBZ. UV/chlorine oxidation showed a significant synergistic effect on CBZ degradation through generation of radical species ((OH)-O-center dot and (CI)-C-center dot), and this process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic. The degradation rate constants (k(obs.CBZ)) of CBZ increased linearly with increasing UV irradiance and chlorine dosage. The degradation of CBZ by UV/chlorine in acidic solutions was more efficient than that in basic solutions mainly due to the effect of pH on the dissociation of HOCl and OCl- and then on the quantum yields and radical species quenching of UV/chlorine. When pH was increased from 5.5 to 9.5, the rate constants of degradation of CBZ by (OH)-O-center dot decreased from 0.65 to 0.14 min(-1) and that by Cl-center dot decreased from 0.40 to 0.11 min(-1). The rate constant for the reaction between Cl-center dot and CBZ was 5.6 +/- 1.6 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1). Anions of HCO3- (1-50 mM) showed moderate inhibition of CBZ degradation by UV/chlorine, while Cl- did not. UV/chlorine could efficiently degrade CBZ in wastewater treatment plant effluent, although the degradation was inhibited by about 30% compared with that in ultrapure water with chlorine dosage of 0.14-0.56 mM. Nine main oxidation products of the CBZ degradation by UV/chlorine were identified using the HPLC-QToF MS/MS. Initial oxidation products arose from hydroxylation, carboxylation and hydrogen atom abstraction of CBZ by (OH)-O-center dot and Cl-center dot, and were then further oxidized to generate acylamino cleavage and decarboxylation products of acridine and acridione.

AB This study evaluated the feasibility of the electrooxidation process using a sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides (TiOX) reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) as anode for the treatment of a secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. The main objectives were to analyze (i) the degradation of a pharmaceutical pollutant, carbamazepine, added at a concentration of 100 mu g L-1, (ii) the mineralization of the residual total organic carbon (TOC = 7 mg L-1), (iii) the formation of toxic by-products and (iv) the energy consumption of the REM process. Two main operating parameters were tested: the current density applied to the REM (74, 149 and 290 A m-2) and the flux of TOC passing through the membrane. The results revealed that the efficiency of the process was maintained above 70% of mineralization and >98% of degradation of carbamazepine until a limiting value of TOC flux was reached. The higher the current density, the higher the limiting value of the TOC flux above which the efficiency decreased. This trend was ascribed to the limitation from the amount of reactive species produced on the REM surface (current limitation instead of mass transport limitation at lower TOC flux). As the energy efficiency strongly increased when applying a higher TOC flux, it is therefore crucial to apply the process around this threshold value. This study also showed that it is possible to control the formation of toxic chlorine-containing by-products (ClO3-, ClO4-, AOCl) by decreasing the current density. This issue is particularly important for such effluents containing a significant amount of Cl- ions. By taking into consideration both advantages and drawbacks, optimal results were obtained with the lowest current density of 73 A m- 2 and a TOC flux through the membrane of 4.41 g h-1 m- 2 corresponding to 1.34 m3 h-1 m- 2. These conditions allowed for >98% degradation of carbamazepine and 70% of mineralization with an energy consumption of 0.15 kWh g-1 of TOC removed (i.e. 0.74 kWh m- 3 of treated wastewater).

AB The present study compares the ultraviolet (UV)-based AOPs for the disinfection and the post-treatment of the biologically-treated hospital wastewater (BHW). It was found that the vacuum UV (VUV) photoreactor was much more efficient than the UVC photoreactor in inactivation of E. coli. A 6.4 and 3.7 log E. coli inactivation (from an initial concentration of 1.09 x 10(10 )CFU/mL) was achieved in the VUV and UVC photoreactors, respectively, operated under similar conditions at the neutral pH of water. In the case of continuous-flow operation, the complete inactivation of E. coli was achieved in the VUV photoreactor in hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 min. However, the UVC photoreactor could not attain the same performance even at the longer HRT of 10 min. Adding H2O2 to the VUV photoreactor improved the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) from the BHW. The TOC removal in the recirculated VUV photoreactor improved from 10.8%-61.7% in the reaction time of 10 min at the presence of the optimum H2O2 amount of 3 mM whereas the TOC removal in the UVC/H2O2 operated at the similar conditions was only 13.1%. When operated under flow-through condition, 93.6% of TOC could be removed from the BHW in the VUV/H2O2 process at the HRT of 10 min where the complete bacterial inactivation and detergent removal was also achieved. The electrical energy consumption was 52.9, 12.2, and 6.5 kW h/m(3) in the UVC/H2O2, VUV and VUV/H2O2 processes, respectively, when operated at the HRT of 10 min under identical conditions for TOC removal. The VUV/H2O2 process could also degrade most of the residual substances in the BHW thus efficiently detoxified the BHW to the level sufficient for discharging into the water environment. Accordingly, the VUV/H2O2 process is an efficient, energy-effective, and thus emerging method for the disinfection and the post-treatment of the hospital wastewater.

AB Micropollutants enter surface waters through various pathways, of which wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a major source. The large diversity of micropollutants and their many modes of toxic action pose a challenge for assessing environmental risks. In this study, we investigated the potential impact of WWTPs on receiving ecosystems by describing concentration patterns of micropollutants, predicting acute risks for aquatic organisms and validating these results with macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data. Grab samples were taken upstream, downstream and at the effluent of 24 Swiss WWTPs during low flow conditions across independent catchments with different land uses. Using liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, a comprehensive target screening of almost 400 organic substances, focusing mainly on pesticides and pharmaceuticals, was conducted at two time points, and complemented with the analysis of a priority mixture of 57 substances over eight time points. Acute toxic pressure was predicted using the risk assessment approach of the multi-substance potentially affected fraction, first applying concentration addition for substances with the same toxic mode of action and subsequently response addition for the calculation of the risk of the total mixture. This toxic pressure was compared to macroinvertebrate sensitivity to pesticides (SPEAR index) upstream and downstream of the WWTPs. The concentrations were, as expected, especially for pharmaceuticals and other household chemicals higher downstream than upstream, with the detection frequency of plant protection products upstream correlating with the fraction of arable land in the catchments. While the concentration sums downstream were clearly dominated by pharmaceuticals or other household chemicals, the acute toxic pressure was mainly driven by pesticides, often caused by the episodic occurrence of these compounds even during low flow conditions. In general, five single substances explained much of the total risk, with diclofenac, diazinon and clothianidin as the main drivers. Despite the low predicted acute risk of 0%-2.1% for affected species, a significant positive correlation with macroinvertebrate sensitivity to pesticides was observed. However, more effect data for pharmaceuticals and a better quantification of episodic pesticide pollution events are needed for a more comprehensive risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of the environment is recognized as a global problem although most research has focused on Europe and North America to date, and there remains a dearth of information for developing countries, including those in Africa. To address this data gap, the occurrence of 37 pharmaceuticals belonging to 19 therapeutic classes was monitored in surface water and effluents in Lagos State, Southwest Nigeria. Samples were collected quarterly between April 2017 and March 2018 from 22 sites, and 26 compounds were detected at least once, many in the mu g/L range. Maximum concentrations for those compounds detected ranged from 75 to 129 mu g L-1, and even mean concentrations for 13 compounds were in the order of mu g L-1. These values are among the highest ever measured globally. Sewage effluent was more important than drug manufacturing waste in polluting rivers, although there are likely to be numerous unregulated sources of effluent being discharged to rivers that require further study, including urban waste collection areas and vacuum trucks that collect effluent. Seasonal trends in the data were complex, with some compounds being found at higher concentrations in the dry season and, conversely, others being greater during the wet period; this variation potentially relates to the variety of pollution sources in the catchment. Pharmaceuticals are indispensable to human health, although their usage and discharge into the aquatic environment may lead to ecological problems and antibiotic resistance. The data we present indicate that pharmaceutical pollution of freshwaters is a serious issue in Nigeria, and management efforts are needed to improve this problem. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (including pharmaceuticals) are not effectively removed by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), so particular concern is related to agricultural wastewater reuse due to their possible uptake in crops irrigated with WWTPs effluents. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and solar AOPs have been demonstrated to effectively remove pharmaceuticals from different aqueous matrices. In this study, an heterogeneous photocatalytic process using powdered nitrogen-doped TiO2 immobilized on polystyrene spheres (sunlight/N-TiO2) was compared to the benchmark homogenous AOP sunlight/H2O2 in a compound triangular collector reactor, to evaluate the degradation of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), trimethoprim (TMP)) in water. The degradation of the contaminants by sunlight and sunlight-AOPs well fit the pseudo-first order kinetic model (but for TMP under sunlight). High removal efficiency by solar photolysis was observed for DCF (up to 100%, half-life sunlight cumulative energy Q(s)(,1/2) = 2 kJ L-1, half-life time t(1/2) = 32 min), while CBZ (32%, Q(s)(,1/2) = 28 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 385 min) and TMP (5% removal after 300 min) removal was poor. The degradation rate of CBZ, TMP and DCF was found to be slower during sunlight/H2O2 (Q(s)(,1/2) = 5 kJ L-1, t(1/2)= 77 min; Q(s)(,1/2) = 20 kJ L-1, t(1/2) =128 min; Q(S,1/2) =4 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 27 min, respectively) compared to sunlight/N-TiO2 (Q(s1/2) =4 kJ L-1, t(1/2 )= 55 min; Q(S,1/2) = 3 kJ L-1, t(1/2) = 42 min; Q(s)(,1/2) = 2 kJ L-1, t(1/2 )= 25 min, respectively). These results are promising in terms of solar technology upscale because the faster degradation kinetics observed for sunlight/N-TiO2 process would result in smaller treatment volume, thus possibly perspective compensating the cost of the photocatalyst.

AB This paper focused on the performance of an up-flow bio-electrochemical system (UBES) for treating the 3-lactams pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). UBES is added a bio-electrochemical system below the three-phase separator based on up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Comparisons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, accumulation of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and biogas production were investigated during the 316-day operation time, which was divided into five parts with HRT of 96 h, 72 h, 48 h, 36 h and 20 h, respectively. The average COD removal efficiency of UBES could reach 45.3 +/- 7.5%, 72.2 +/- 3.5%, 86.2 +/- 1.4%, 75.9 +/- 1.8% and 64.9 +/- 2.0%, which were 2.4%, 6.1%, 6.4%, 10.2%, 8.7% more than those of UASB under different HRTs, respectively. Biogas production as well as methane production of UBES were significantly higher than UASB during the whole changing HRT process, the maximum methane yield of UBES was 0.31 +/- 0.07 L/gCOD(removed). Accumulation of VFA in UBES was discovered to be lighter than UASB, the minimum average VFA in UBES was 131.9 +/- 18.5 mg/L, which was obtained at HRT of 48 h. These results proved that UBES can slow down the inhibition of VFA on methanogens to make sure a good performance on COD removal and biogas production than UASB. Moreover, the relationships between methane production and VFA, biogas production and COD consumption were analyzed. A cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of UBES in practical applications compared with UASB. Finally, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was developed and fitted well with the experimental data, which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of the UBES and UASB.

AB By means of rigorously controlled lab-scale activated sludge systems operated in parallel, the affect of the addition of a nutritive supplement on the overall performance of these systems was verified. Nutriflok 50 S is a commercially available product. containing nutrients and flocculating agents. In a first series of tests by means of SCAS (semi-continuous activated sludge) reactors, fed with synthetic wastewater, the positive effect of the supplement (dosed at 5% of the chemical oxygen demand (GOD) load) on the sludge volume index (SVI) (39% improvement) and the residual COD (40% improvement) was demonstrated. In a second series, an industrial wastewater was used in a benchscale set-up according to the OECD procedure. The overall efficiency and sludge sedimentation characteristics were compared for two parallel activated sludge systems continuously fed with pharmaceutical wastewater. In the control no additive was given; the other reactor received on a daily basis a dose of Nutriflok 50 S corresponding to 10% of the COD load. The performance of the Nutriflok 50 S supplemented reactor was found to be statistically better in terms of sedimentation characteristics, nitrification and COD removal than the control. Especially when operated under winter conditions (10 degrees C) and at higher sludge loading rates (Bx = 0.26 kg COD/kg VSS.d) the COD removal efficiency was about 35% higher in the treated reactor. Moreover, nitrification could be maintained in the supplemented reactor at low temperatures, whilst it became minimal under those conditions in the control reactor. Also in the second series of tests, sludge sedimentation characteristics improved with Nutriflok 50 S. The SVI was 40% lower for the Nutriflok 50 S amended sludge and the recycled sludge was 27% more concentrated. When operated at higher temperatures (20-26 degrees C) the amended sludge was less sensitive to denitrification linked flotation in the settler. Microscopic examination of the sludge revealed a more diverse microbial community and the presence of higher trophic organisms in the supplemented reactor. These results indicate a potential for considerable improvement, not only of the overall conversion efficiency, but also of the sludge management characteristics when Nutriflok 50 S is dosed to the activated sludge.

AB The occurrence and fate of the popular pharmaceutical gabapentin (GBP) in the urban water cycle were investigated with a focus on its transformation during water chlorination. GBP was detected in all samples with average concentrations of 1285 ng/L (n = 24) for wastewater effluent, 304 ng/L for river water (n = 22), and 180 ng/L for drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) influent (n = 4). The monitoring sites were located in the Nakdong River watershed, Korea. GBP was rapidly (within 20 min) transformed into 1-cyanocyclohexylacetic acid (GBP-nitrile) under typical chlorination conditions (1.4 mgCl(2)/L). When there was a molar excess of chlorine to GBP, the primary amine of GBP was double-chlorinated to form N-Cl-2 GBP with a second-order rate constant of >10(3) M-1 s(-1). Decomposition of N-Cl-2 GBP had a first-order rate constant of (0.5-1.0) x 10(-2) s(-1) and produced GBP-nitrile with a yield of 87%-10 0%. We propose that N-Cl-2 GBP is transformed into N-Cl GBP imine and then to GBP-nitrile via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations with the former as the rate-limiting step. N-Cl-2 GBP had a much higher decom-position rate than N-Cl-2 produced from other simple aliphatic amines, which could be related to the structural features of GBP such as its carboxyl group and quaternary b-carbon. The wastewater effluent samples did not contain GBP-nitrile even in the chlorinated effluent because of the relatively low chlorine dose or high ammonia level. In a full-scale DWTP employing a pre-chlorination unit, GBP present in the influent river water was fully transformed into GBP-nitrile. The formed GBP-nitrile was degraded in subsequent ozonation (*OH oxidation) and biological activated carbon filtration (biodegradation) processes. The toxicity of GBP-nitrile is thought to be low but further studies are warranted to assess the toxicological relevance of nitrile formation during water chlorination. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the group of pharmaceuticals that is most often found in the environment, whereas estrogenic hormones are considered to be potent endocrine disruptors. However, the fate and persistence of these compounds in the environment are still unclear. In this study we propose two approaches for determining these compounds in environmental water samples: GC-MS using time windows and operating in selected ion-monitoring mode (SIM) and, for the first time, gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The identification criteria of both methods fulfilled the requirements of Directive 2002/657/EC. The use of time windows improved the sensitivity of GC-MS measurements. In GC-MS analysis the pharmaceuticals were determined as trimethylsilyl, in GC-ECD as pentafluoropropionyl derivatives. The influence of such parameters as the type of reagent, type of solvent, reaction time, reaction temperature and microwave irradiation in a household microwave oven on the efficacy of silylation was investigated. Derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in pyridine (1:1, v/v) for 30 min in 60 degrees C was found to be optimal. Optimization of the solid phase extraction procedure (SPE) confirmed that the application of Oasis HLB cartridges, the acidification of loading samples to pH 2 and the use of methanol as eluent gave the best absolute recoveries (ARs) of the target compounds. The following ARs of all the compounds were achieved: 58.2-106.8% in influent wastewater, 77.8-103.4% in effluent wastewater and 81.2-101.9% in surface water samples. Validation of the SPE-GC-MS method enables 13 pharmaceuticals to be determined with MDLs between 3.3 and 343.6 ng/L, depending on the analytes and matrices. GC-ECD analysis enables the determination of 6 pharmaceuticals in surface water samples with MDLs between 0.7 and 5.4 ng/L The proposed methods were successfully used for analyzing selected pharmaceuticals in wastewaters and river waters in Poland.

AB Non-potable reuse of treated wastewater is becoming widespread as means to address growing water scarcity. Removal of micropollutants (MPs) from such water often requires advanced oxidation processes using center dot OH radicals. center dot OH can be generated in-situ via water photolysis under vacuum-UV (lambda < 200 nm) irradiation.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of unmasking V-UV radiation from low pressure Hg lamps (emitting at 185 and 254 nm), commonly used in decentralized treatment systems, for enhancing MPs removal efficiency. Triclosan, a biocide of limited biodegradability, served as a model compound for MPs that are not very biodegradable. Its degradation kinetics and identification of intermediate products were investigated under 254 nm and under combined 254/185 nm irradiation both in dry thin films and in aqueous solutions. In the latter, degradation was faster under combined 254/185 nm radiation, although the 185 nm radiation accounted for only 4% of the total UV light intensity. In contrast, triclosan photodegradation in dry film did not show significant differences between these irradiation wavelengths, suggesting that the enhanced degradation of dissolved triclosan under combined radiation is mainly due to oxidation by center dot OH formed via water photolysis under V-UV. This conclusion was supported by slower TCS degradation in aqueous solution when methanol was added as center dot OH scavenger. Under both irradiation types (254, 254/185 nm) three transformation products (TPs) were identified: 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 5-chloro-2-(4- or 2-chlorophenoxy) phenol, and 2-hydroxy-8-chlorodibenzodioxin. In-silico QSAR toxicity assessment predicted potential toxicity and moderate-to-low biodegradability of these TPs. Removal of these TPs was faster under 254/185 nm irradiation.
   Considering the low cost, simple operation (i.e. no chemicals addition) and small size of such low-pressure mercury lamps, this is a promising direction. Further investigation of the process in flow-through reactors and real wastewater/greywater effluent is needed for its future implementation in small on-site systems for post-treatment of persistent pollutants.

AB Ozone is an effective oxidant and disinfectant commonly used for elimination of micropollutants and inactivation of resistant microbes. However, undesirable oxidation/disinfection byproducts such as bromate might form during ozonation. In this study, the UV absorbance and fluorescence indices were applied as surrogate indicators for predicting the inactivation of bacteria and formation of bromate during ozonation of water and wastewater effluents. The inactivation efficiencies of lab-cultured Escherichia coli (E. coli) and autochthonous bacteria were measured by plating (for E. coli only) and flow cytometry with fluorescence staining. During ozonation of E. coli spiked into wastewater effluents (similar to 10(6) cell/mL), the priority of inactivation efficiency determined by different cell viability methods were in the order of CFU > membrane damage > DNA damage. Approximately, 99% membrane damage and/or 90% DNA damage are conservatively supposed as an indicator for sufficient bacterial inactivation as well as degradation of antibiotic resistance genes. The related required O-3 dosing thresholds for sufficient inactivation of E. coli and autochthonous bacteria refer to similar to 0.6 O-3/DOC (g/g), similar to 50% decrease of UVA254, similar to 60% decrease of UVA280, or similar to 80% decrease of humic-like fluorescence. Within the range of 10(6)-10(8) cell/mL the bacterial concentration did not have significant effects on the required thresholds of the specific O-3 doses or spectroscopic indicators required for bacterial inactivation. The addition of 50 mM tert-BuOH as center dot OH scavenger increased the required specific ozone doses but decreased the losses of spectroscopic indicators necessary for sufficient bacterial inactivation, and also suggested that the membrane/DNA damages for bacterial inactivation were mainly attributed to the direct O-3 attacks. The bromate concentration was determined using ion chromatography with MS/MS detection. The results showed that when O-3 was dosed at the required thresholds for sufficient bacterial inactivation, bromate formation could usually be suppressed below 10 mu g/L. The present work supports that it is possible to reach a balance between bacterial inactivation and bromate formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is a major waste stream resulting from numerous operations that occur during the production stages of olive oil. The resulting effluent contains various organic and inorganic contaminants and its environmental impact can be notable. The present work aims at investigating the efficiency of (i) jet-loop reactor with ultrafiltration (UF) membrane system (Jacto.MBR), (ii) solar photo Fenton oxidation after coagulation/flocculation pre-treatment and (iii) integrated membrane filtration processes (i.e. UF/nanofiltration (NF)) used for the treatment of OMW. According to the results, the efficiency of the biological treatment was high, equal to 90% COD and 80% total phenolic compounds (TPh) removal. A COD removal higher than 94% was achieved by applying the solar photo-Fenton oxidation process as post-treatment of coagulation/flocculation of OMW, while the phenolic fraction was completely eliminated. The combined UF/NF process resulted in very high conductivity and COD removal, up to 90% and 95%, respectively, while TPh were concentrated in the NF concentrate stream (i.e. 93% concentration). Quite important is the fact that the NF concentrate, a valuable and polyphenol rich stream, can be further valorized in various industries (e.g. food, pharmaceutical, etc.). The above treatment processes were found also to be able to reduce the initial OMW phytotoxicity at greenhouse experiments; with the effluent stream of solar photo-Fenton process to be the least phytotoxic compared to the other treated effluents. A SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats) analysis was performed, in order to determine both the strengths of each technology, as well as the possible obstacles that need to overcome for achieving the desired levels of treatment. Finally, an economic evaluation of the tested technologies was performed in an effort to measure the applicability and viability of these systems at real scale; highlighting that the cost cannot be regarded as a 'cut off criterion', since the most cost-effective option in not always the optimum one.

AB In spite of growing scientific concern about pharmaceuticals in the environment, there is still a lack of information especially with regard to their metabolites. The present study investigated ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of three widely used cytostatic agents 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine (CYT) and gemcitabine (GemC) and their major human metabolites, i.e. alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL), uracil-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (AraU) and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), respectively. Effects were studied in acute immobilization and reproduction assays with crustacean Daphnia magna and growth inhibition tests with alga Desmodesmus subspicatus and bacteria Pseudoinonas putida. Genotoxicity was tested with umu-test employing Salmonella choleraesius subsp. chol. Toxicity was relatively high at parent compounds with EC(50) values ranging from 44 mu g L(-1) (5-fluorouracil in the P. putida test) to 200 mg L(-1) (cytarabine in D. magna acute test). In general, the most toxic compound was 5-FU. Studied metabolites showed low or no toxicity: only FBAL (metabolite of 5-FU) showed low toxicity to D. subspicatus and P. putida with EC(50) values 80 and 140 mg L(-1), respectively. All parent cytostatics showed genotoxicity with minimum genotoxic concentrations (MGC) ranging from 40 to 330 mg L(-1). From metabolites, only FBAL was genotoxic in high concentrations. To our knowledge, the present study provides some of the first ecotoxicity data for both cytostatics and their metabolites, which might further serve for serious evaluation of ecological risks. The observed EC(50) values within the mu g L(-1) range were fairly close to concentrations reported in hospital sewage water, which indicates further research needs, especially studies of chronic toxicity.

AB This work presents the treatment of selected emerging concern pharmaceuticals in real hospital wastewater (HWW) from Tumaco-Colombia by combination of a biological system with a sonochemical process. Fifteen compounds, commonly present in HWW, were considered: acetaminophen, didofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, loratadine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, darithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Initially, HWW was characterized in terms of global parameters and the pharmaceuticals content. HWW contained a moderate amount of organic matter (i.e., total organic carbon: 131.56 mg L-1 (C)) mainly associated to biodegradable components. However, the most of pharmaceuticals were found at levels upper than their predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Then, a conventional biological treatment was applied to the HWW. After 36 h, such process mainly removed biodegradable substances, but had a limited action on the pharmaceuticals. The resultant biotreated water was submitted to the sonochemical process (375 kHz and 88 W L (-1), 1.5 h), which due to its chemical (i.e., radical attacks) and physical (i.e., suspended solids disaggegation) effects induced a considerable pharmaceuticals degradation (pondered removal: 58.82%), demonstrating the complementarity of the proposed combination. Afterwards, Fe2+ (5 ppm) and WC light (4 W) were added to the sonochemical system (generating sons-photo-Fenton process), which significantly increased up to 82.86% the pondered pharmaceuticals removal. Subsequently, to understand fundamental aspects of the pharmaceuticals degradations, a model compound (norfloxacin) in distilled water was treated by sonochemical system. sono-photo-Fenton process and their sub-systems (i.e., sono-Fenton and UVC alone). This allowed proving the hydroxyl radical action in sonochemical treatment, plus the contribution of Fenton reaction and direct photodegradation in the pharmaceuticals removal by sono-photoFenton. Finally, it was found that 91.13% of the initial pharmaceuticals load in HWW was removed by the biological/sono-photo-Fenton combination. The high pollutants abatement evidenced that this combination is a powerful alternative for removing pharmaceuticals from complex-matrix waters, such as raw HWW. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of parabens (5 congeners), triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) at the scale of the Parisian sewer network and to provide representative knowledge on these compounds in France for a large area. For this purpose and in collaboration with the Parisian public sanitation service (SIAAP) in charge of the collect and treatment of the Parisian wastewater, this study focused on seven main sewer trunks of the Paris conurbation, accounting for 1 900 000 m(3) d(-1), i.e., about 8 million inhabitants. Concentrations lying in the 2000-20 000 ng l(-1) ranges were found in wastewater, confirming the ubiquity of parabens, TCS and TCC in our environment and household products. Parabens (>97%) and to a lesser extent TCS (68% in median) were mainly associated to the dissolved fraction, as demonstrated by low K-D and K-OC values. For the first time, this study also evaluated the pollutant mass loads per population equivalent (PE) of parabens, TCS and TCC at the large and representative scale of the Parisian conurbation. Hence, the median mass loads varied from 176 to 3040 mu g PE-1 d(-1) for parabens and from 26 to 762 mu g PE-1 d(-1) for TCS and TCC. Based on these results and according to the assumptions done, the extrapolation of the mass loads at the national scale pointed out an annual mass loads between 51.8 and 100.7 t y(-1) for methyl paraben (MeP) and between 11.2 and 23.5 t y(-1) for TCS. Mass loads per equivalent habitant and national mass loads are both extremely relevant and innovative data. Contrary to other countries, such data are nowadays rather difficult to gain in France and neither enquiry nor database provides access to information on the use and production of these chemicals. Since cosmetic industries are voluntarily and fully engaged in the substitution of parabens, triclosan and triclocarban in personal care product, this study could constitute a "time reference status" which could be used as a basis for future monitoring.

AB Pharmaceutical substances present at low concentrations in the environment may cause effects on biological systems such as microbial consortia living on solid riverbed substrates. These consortia are an important part of the river ecosystem as they form part of the food chain. This case study aims to contribute to an increased understanding of how low levels of pharmaceuticals in freshwater streams may influence sessile bacterial consortia. An important point source for pharmaceutical release into the environment is treated household sewage water. In order to investigate what types of effects may occur, we collected water samples as well as riverbed substrates from a small stream in the south of Sweden, Knivstaan, upstream and downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP). Data from these samples formed the base of this case study where we investigated both the presence of pharmaceuticals in the water and bacterial composition on riverbed substrates. In the water downstream from the STP, 19 different pharmaceuticals were detected at levels below 800 ng/dm(3). The microbial composition was obtained from sequencing 16S rRNA genes directly from substrates as well as from cultivated isolates. The cultivated strains showed reduced species variability compared with the data obtained directly from the substrates. No systematic differences were observed following the sampling season. However, differences could be seen between samples upstream and downstream from the STP effluent. We further observed large similarities in bacterial composition on natural stones compared to sterile stones introduced into the river approximately two months prior to sampling, giving indications for future sampling methodology of biofilms.

AB Contaminants in septic tank effluent (STE) are expected to be removed by the soil system before discharging to the environment. However, potential contaminants such as phosphorus (P), caffeine and artificial sweeteners do find their way to watercourses impacting aquatic eco systems. In this study, the attenuation of STE P, caffeine and saccharin were investigated in untreated soil and in soil with reduced microbial activity, in aqueous solutions and in the complex matrix of STE. Time series sorption and desorption experiments using batch equilibrium and a column experiment of STE P attenuation were conducted. The results revealed that the soil distribution coefficients (K-d) were: P 81.57 > caffeine 22.16 > saccharin 5.98 cm(3)/g, suggesting greater soil affinity to P adsorption. The data revealed that 80% of saccharin and 33% of caffeine attenuation was associated with microbial activities rather than adsorption processes. However, a complete removal of saccharin and caffeine did not occur during the equilibration period, suggesting their leaching potential. The dominant mechanism of P attenuation was adsorption (chemical and physical), yielding P retention of >73% and 35% for Pin aqueous solution and in STE matrix, respectively, for batch equilibrium. The soil in the column acted as effluent P sink retaining 125 mu g P/g soil of effluent P. The attenuation of 13, caffeine and saccharin in the aqueous solution was greater than in STE, suggesting that the complex composition of STE reduced soil adsorption ability, and that other substances present in STE may be competing for soil binding sites. The data revealed that caffeine and P had similarities in the interaction with soils and thus caffeine may be considered as a STE tracer of anthropogenic source of P in receiving waters.

AB The report describes the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and LC/MS/MS to investigate the occurrence and distribution of 4 estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and 3 anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) in the Zhangweinanyun River System (China). Relatively higher concentrations were observed for estrone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and ketoprofen in the Wei Canal than in the Wei River and in the Zhangweixin River. The study suggested that there is a potential ecological risk of male fish feminization from estrogens in the Zhangweinanyun River System.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have attracted increasing attention due to their large consumption volumes, high bioactivity and potential ecotoxicity. In this study, a total of 150 commonly used drugs were investigated in sediments of Jiaozhou Bay (JZB). Twenty-five target compounds were detected, of which ten were discovered for the first time in marine sediments. The range of total PhAC content was 3.62-21.4 ng/g dry weight. Ketoprofen (2.49 ng/g), oxytetracycline (1.00 ng/g) and roxithromycin (0.97 ng/g) were the preponderant PhACs. PhACs gradually decreased from east to west, and the distribution of PhACs in the sediment was controlled by the source channel, seawater dynamic process and sediment composition. The diatom, organic matter, and clay proportions in the sediments and the nutrients in the overlying water were the most important environmental factors affecting the distribution of PhACs. PhAC pollution in the sediments of the JZB exhibited an increasing trend. Coprostanol could be used as a chemical indicator of the PhAC concentration in JZB sediments. PhACs were mainly derived from direct pollution due to human fecal excretion in the eastern region. Ofloxacin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline were found to pose high or medium risks to aquatic organisms. It is necessary and urgent to improve the treatment technology of drug residues in sewage treatment plants to decrease the pollution of PhAC residues. With the continuous aging of the global population, the use of PhACs will increase rapidly, which may cause more unpredictable threats to the marine ecosystem. Therefore, the monitoring of PhACs in the marine environment needs to be strengthened, and studies on PhAC occurrence and effects must be considered a priority in global environmental research.

AB A variety of pharmaceuticals has been detected in many environmental samples worldwide. Given the unpredictable and possible severe effects, there is substantial public concern about the environment contamination with pharmaceutical residues. Nevertheless, only preliminary measures aimed at protecting the environment from adverse effects of pharmaceutical pollutants are in place; these measures must be supplemented by integrated programs. This paper provides an overview of recent scientific research on the sources and occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, an up to date review of the EU regulations and directives on the environmental protection with respect to pharmaceuticals and emphases the problems encountered in the implementation of the protection measures.

AB Four typical organic micro-pollutants in effluent sewage were subjected to the various treatments using three ozone-based oxidation processes, i.e. individual ozonation (O-3), ultrasonic ozonation (US/O-3) and photocatalytic ozonation (PC/O-3) under different experimental conditions involving supplied ozone dose, pH value and humic acid (HA) concentration of the effluent, ultrasonic radiation power, and photocatalyst dose. The target compounds, i.e. clofibric acid (CFA), nonylphenol (NP), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and carbamazepine (CBZ), were selected from 11 organic pollutants frequently detected in the aquatic environment through a developed screening system. The increase on the supplied ozone doses would improve the performances of ozonation of the target compounds. Besides, the removal rates of the compounds during the three ozone-based oxidation processes increased with the rise on pH value in the set range (3.7-9.5) of this study. However, the removal rates on the whole reduced with the increasing HA addition, especially during the US/O-3 combined process. Compared with the individual O-3, the two combined processes enhanced considerably the removal rates, by 13.9% or above for CFA, 12.6% or above for NP, over 13.3% for EEZ, and no less than 14.8% for CBZ. The optimal removal of the target compounds was obtained at the ultrasonic power 240 W for the ultrasonic ozonation treatment. For the PC/O-3 combined process, the enhanced removal of the targets was mainly due to the larger amount of oxidizing species generated through the enhancement effects of photocatalysis as the adsorption of the targets to the photocatalyst was far less. The US/O-3 combined process could achieve the best removal of the target micro-pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We determined national baseline levels and release inventories of 77 traditional and novel brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in biosolids composites (prepared from 110 samples) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2001 national sewage sludge survey (NSSS). Additionally, analyses were performed on archived samples from a 3-year outdoor mesocosm study to determine the environmental persistence of BFRs in biosolids-amended soil. The total polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) concentration detected in biosolids composites was 9400 960 mu g/kg dry weight, of which deca-BDE constituted 57% followed by nona- and penta-BDE at 18 and 13%, respectively. The annual mean loading rate estimated from the detected concentrations and approximate annual biosolids production and disposal numbers in the U.S., of the sum of PBDEs and non-BDE BFRs was calculated to be 47,900-60,100 and 12,900-16,200 kg/year, of which 24,000-36,000 and 6400 9700 kg/year are applied on land, respectively. Mean concentration of PBDEs were higher in the 2001 samples compared to levels reported in EPA's 2006/7 Targeted NSSS, reflecting on-going efforts in phasing-out PBDEs in the U.S. In outdoor soil mesocosms, > 99% of the initial BFRs mass in the biosolids/soil mixtures (1:2) persisted over the monitoring duration of three years. Estimates of environmental releases may be refined in the future by analyzing individual rather than composited samples, and by integrating currently unavailable data on disposal of biosolids on a plant-specific basis. This study informs the risk assessment of BFRs by furnishing national inventories of BFR occurrence and environmental release via biosolids application on land. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Presented here, based on new recommendations of the European Commission, is an environmental risk assessment (ERA) of a selected group of pharmaceuticals for Phase 1, environmental exposure assessment, and Phase II Tier A, initial environmental fate and effect analysis. This pharmaceutical group is composed of the 111 highest-selling human drug substances that have annual sales in Germany of more than 5,000 kg. The data required for this ERA came from analyzing: (1) sales annually (in kg or IU) of the 2671 active pharmaceutical drug substances (2001) on the German market in all medicinal products sold by pharmacies (with and without prescriptions) and used in hospitals in 1996-2001; (2) the use pattern of drug substances as categorized according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification indexes ATC3 and ATC7; (3) data for excretion, toxicity, and metabolites of the 111 selected human drug substances; (4) the physicochemical properties of these substances; and (5) the degradability of selected drug substances in sewage treatment plants (STPs) by using a validated and accredited liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. A correction factor for the pharmaceutical therapeutic (PT) activity of metabolites, the PTindex (excretion rate/100) for drug substances and PT active metabolites was established to refine the predicted environmental concentration (PECSURFACEWATER). A refinement of the PECSURFACEWATER was carried out with the market penetration factor of the human drug substances in Germany. In addition, for effect analysis the predicted no-effects concentration (PNEC) was calculated using assessment factors. The estimated PEC results were validated with the exposure results of effluents of the STPs. All results on ERA of drug substances have been documented in a Microsoft Access 2000 database.

AB Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are one of the major source of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic environment. Generally, the effects of individual chemicals on fish are studied under laboratory conditions, which leads to results that are potentially not realistic regarding the effects of these chemicals under environmental conditions. Therefore, in this study, common carps were held in exposed pond that receive water from STP effluents for 360 days under natural conditions. Elimination of xenobiotics starts in the fish intestine, in which the microbial community strongly influences its function. Moreover, the fish intestine functions as crucial organ for absorbing lipids and fatty acids (FA), with consequent transport to the liver where their metabolism occurs. The liver is the primary organ performing xenobiotic metabolism in fish, and therefore, the presence of pollutants may interact with the metabolism of FA. The catalytic activity of CYP1A and CYP3A-like enzymes, their gene expression, FA composition and intestinal microbiome consortia were measured. The catalytic activity of enzymes and their gene and protein expression, were induced in hepatic and intestinal tissues of fish from the exposed pond. Also, fish from the exposed pond had different compositions of FA than those from the control pond: concentration of 18: 1 n-9 and 18: 2 n-6 were significantly elevated and the longer chain n-3 FA 20: 5 n-3, 22: 5 n-3 and 22: 6 n-3 were significantly lowered. There were clear differences among microbiome consortia in fish intestines across control and exposed groups. Microbiome taxa measured in exposed fish were also associated with those found in STP activated sludge. This study reveals that treated STP water, which is assumed to be clean, affected measured biomarkers in common carp. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The antiviral drug Tamiflu has received particular attention because of its recommended use against the influenza A H5N1 and H1N1 viruses. Given its resistance to degradation and its hydrophilicity the active metabolite, Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), is expected to enter the aquatic ecosystem from sewage treatment plants. In the present paper the bacterial community of surface water samples, treated with OC (1.5 mg L-1), was characterized by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in microcosm experiments. The alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased in OC-treated versus non-treated water samples during the incubation period, suggesting these bacterial groups had an active role in OC degradation.

AB Biosolids were obtained from four Ontario municipalities that vary in how the sewage sludge is treated. These included a Class B biosolids that was anaerobically digested, a Class A biosolids that were heat treated and pelletized (Propell), and two Class A biosolids that were stabilized using either the N-Viro (N-Rich) or Lystek (LysteGro) processes. Viable enteric indicator or pathogenic bacteria in the biosolids were enumerated by plate count, gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer were detected by PCR, and a subset of these gene targets were quantified by qPCR. Following application at commercial rates to field plots, the persistence of enteric bacteria and gene targets in soil was followed during the growing season. Carrots, radishes and lettuce were sown into the amended and unamended control plots, and the diversity and abundance of gene targets they carried at harvest determined. All three Class A biosolids carried fewer and less abundant antibiotic resistance genes than did the Class B biosolids, in particular the very alkaline N-Viro product (N-Rich). Following application, some gene targets (e.g. int1, sul1, strA/B, aadA) that are typically associated with mobile gene cassettes remained detectable throughout the growing season, whereas others (e.g. ermB, ermF, blaOXA20) that are not associated with cassettes became undetectable within three weeks or less. At harvest a larger number of gene targets were detected on the carrots and radishes than in the lettuce. Overall, land application of Class A biosolids will entrain fewer viable bacteria and genes associated with antibiotic resistance into crop ground than will amendment with Class B biosolids.

AB Concern is increasing regarding the environmental impact of the high usage rate and intensive release of antibiotics used for human and animal therapy in major urban areas of China. In the present study, regional environmental distribution simulations and risk assessments for 3 commonly used fluoroquinolones in the Wenyu River catchment were conducted using a typical catchment model widely used in Europe. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics investigated (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) are consumed at high levels for personal health care in China. These antibiotics were simulated in the aquatic environment of the Wenyu River catchment across the Beijing City area for annual average concentrations, with regional predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of approximately 711ng/L, 55.3ng/L, and 22.2ng/L and local PECs up to 1.8 mu g/L, 116ng/L, and 43ng/L, respectively. Apart from hydrological conditions, the concentrations of fluoroquinolones were associated closely with the sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their serving population, as well as hospital distributions. The presence of these fluoroquinolones in the catchment area of the present study showed significant characteristics of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment in an urban river, with typical down-the-drain chemicals. Significantly high concentrations of specific antibiotics indicated non-negligible risks caused by the intensive use in the local aquatic environment in a metropolitan area, particularly ofloxacin in upstream Shahe Reservoir, middle stream and downstream Qing River, and Liangma River to the Ba River segment. Specific treatment measures for these pharmaceuticals and personal care products in STPs are required for such metropolitan areas. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2764-2770. (c) 2015 SETAC

AB A diverse mix of micropollutants. including pesticides, biocides, and pharmaceuticals, reaches the aquatic environment through treated sewage effluents. We sampled 21 final effluents with polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and investigated to what extent chemical analyses of six photosystem II (PS-II) inhibitors and 12 other chemicals explain the toxic burdens quantified with two bioassays Baseline toxicity equivalent concentrations (TEQ) were determined with a bacterial bioluminescence inhibition assay using Vibrio fischeri (baseline-TEQ(bacteria)) and by assessing toxicity on algal growth using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (baseline-TEQ(algae)). Inhibition PS-II was also determined with algae and expressed using chiffon equivalent concentrations (DEQ(bio)) Concentrations of chemicals and toxicities varied appreciably between effluents, typically spanning two orders of magnitude Across 21 independent effluents, a DEQ calculated by concentration addition of PS-II inhibitors (DEQ(chem)) proved a very good predictor of DEQ(bio):DEQ(chem) explained 65% of DEQ(bio) However, baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) correlated poorly with baseline-TEQ(algae,bio), because baseline-TEQ(algae) were strongly influenced by PS-II inhibitors Using data on the 18 quantified compounds, and then estimated toxicities in the bacterial assay, we calculated a baseline-TEQ(bacteria,chem). With one exception, a site with a high load of diclofenac, less than 1% of baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) was explained by the analyzed chemicals. We conclude that for the analyses of final effluents. DEQ(bio) is a robust endpoint and useful screening tool for PS-II inhibitors; in the presence of herbicides, baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) proves a more robust measure of baseline toxicity than baseline-TEQ(algae,bio).

AB In military out of area missions of the Bundeswehr, it can be necessary to produce drinking water even from highly polluted surface waters containing a variety of organic, inorganic, and microbiological contaminants, Thus, mobile drinking water purification systems must be able to remove such contaminants as far as possible to meet the requirements of the German and European drinking water regulation/directive, Presently, two novel drinking water purification units applying membrane filtration undergo intensive long-term trials carried out by the Bundeswehr. If these trials positively proof the functionality of these units and their ability to remove all possible contaminants they shall substitute so far available devices which use large amounts of chemicals and charcoal filtration for water purification. In the course of a research project, the functionality of the new devices and their efficacy to remove high amounts of algae, microbes, and organic and inorganic pollutants are additionally tested in "worst-case" field studies. In September 2000, the first mobile drinking water purification unit was tested at the Teltowkanal in Berlin, Germany. This canal was chosen because it carries high burdens of municipal sewage effluents. The results from the fatigue test confirmed the ability of the water purification unit to reduce the concentrations of all contaminants meeting the maximum tolerance levels set by the German/European drinking water regulation, The pre-filtration device was very effective in removing algae and solid particles to protect the membranes from clogging and to enable an almost maintenance-free operation, Residues of pharmaceuticals and some other organic contaminants have almost totally been removed from the surface water where they were detected at individual concentrations up to the mug/L-level.

AB Background In this study, the biodegradation of N-acetyl-para-aminophenol also known as acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol) was studied by bacterial strain Bacillus drentensis strain S1 (accession no. KY623719) isolated from sewage sample. Results The Bacillus drentensis strain S1 was isolated from the sewage sample using the enrichment culture method. As per our knowledge this is the first Bacillus drentensis strain reported for the degradation of APAP. In this study a 20-L batch reactor was employed for degradation of APAP. The maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) was observed at 400 mg/L concentration of APAP. The pilot-scale anaerobic batch reactor of was stable and self-buffered. The degradation in pilot-scale reactor was slow as compared to batch experiments due to fluctuation in pH and exhaustion of nutrients. Design-Expert(R) software was used for optimization of conditions for APAP degradation; such as temperature (40 degrees C), pH (7.0), concentration of APAP (300 g/L) and agitation speed (165 rpm). The FTIR and GC-MS were used to identify the degradation metabolites. The intermediates of degradation like 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone and phenothiazine were observed, based on these results the metabolic pathway has been predicted. Conclusions The optimization, kinetic, batch study and pilot study indicates the potential of Bacillus drentensis strain S1 for degradation of acetaminophen. The experimental design, optimization and statistical analysis were performed by Design Expert(R) software. The optimal growth condition for Bacillus drentensis strain S1 was found to be at temperature 40 degrees C, pH 7, acetaminophen at concentration of 300 (mg/L) and agitation speed 165 rpm. The GC-MS and FTIR was used for identification of metabolites produced during acetaminophen degradation and the partial metabolic pathway for degradation of acetaminophen was also proposed .

AB Treatment efficiency and electricity generation were evaluated using a solid plain-graphite plate microbial fuel cell (MFC) anoxic/oxic (A/O) process that treated pharmaceutical sewage using different hydraulic retention times (HRT). Short HRTs increased the volumetric organic loading rate, thereby reducing the MFC performance due to rapid depletion of the substrate (carbon/nitrogen source). The COD removal efficiency decreased from 96.28% at a HRT of 8 h to 90.67% at a HRT of 5 h. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen was reduced from 74.16% at a HRT of 8 h to 53.42% at a HRT of 5 h. A shorter HRT decreased the efficiency in treatment of the pharmaceutical products (PPs), which included acetaminophen, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole in an aerobic reactor because these antibiotic compounds inhibited the microbial activity of the aerobic activated sludge in the MFC A/O system. The average power density and coulombic efficiency values were 162.74 mW m(-2) and 7.09% at a HRT of 8 h and 29.12 mW m(-2) and 2.23% at a HRT of 5 h, respectively. The dominant bacterial species including Hydrogenophaga spp., Rubrivivax spp. and Leptothrix spp., which seem to be involved in PP biodegradation; these were identified in the MFC A/O system under all HRT conditions for the first time using next generation sequencing. Bacterial nanowires were involved in accelerating the transfer of electrons and served as mediators in the SPGRP biofilm. In conclusion, a SPGRP MFC A/O system at a HRT of 8 h gave better removal of COD, T-N and PPs, as well as generated more electricity.

AB In the present study, in vitro toxicity as well as biopersistence and photopersistence of four artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharine, and sucralose) and five antibiotics (levofloxacin, lincomycin, linezolid, marbofloxacin, and sarafloxacin) and of their phototransformation products (PTPs) were investigated. Furthermore, antibiotic activity was evaluated after UV irradiation and after exposure to inocula of a sewage treatment plant. The study reveals that most of the tested compounds and their PTPs were neither readily nor inherently biodegradable in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-biodegradability tests. The study further demonstrates that PTPs are formed upon irradiation with an Hg lamp (UV light) and, to a lesser extent, upon irradiation with a Xe lamp (mimics sunlight). Comparing the nonirradiated with the corresponding irradiated solutions, a higher chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for the irradiated solutions of linezolid. Neither cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity was found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their PTPs. Antimicrobial activity of the tested fluoroquinolones was reduced after UV treatment, but it was not reduced after a 28-day exposure to inocula of a sewage treatment plant. This comparative study shows that PTPs can be formed as a result of UV treatment. The study further demonstrated that UV irradiation can be effective in reducing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics, and consequently may help to reduce antimicrobial resistance in wastewaters. Nevertheless, the study also highlights that some PTPs may exhibit a higher ecotoxicity than the respective parent compounds. Consequently, UV treatment does not transform all micropollutants into harmless compounds and may not be a large-scale effluent treatment option.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications can enter the environment as trace contaminants, at individual concentrations generally below a part per billion (mu g/L). APIs enter the environment primarily via the discharge of raw and treated sewage. Residues of unmetabolized APIs from parenteral and enteral drugs are excreted in feces and urine, and topically applied medications are washed from skin during bathing. These trace residues may pose risks for aquatic life and cause concern with regard to subsequent human exposure.
   APIs also enter the environment from the disposal of unwanted medications directly to sewers and trash. The relative significance of this route compared with excretion and bathing is poorly understood and has been subject to much speculation. Two major aspects of uncertainty exist: the percentage of any particular API in the environment originating from disposal is unknown, and disposal undoubtedly occurs from a variety of dispersed sources. Sources of disposal, along with the types and quantities of APIs resulting from each source, are important to understand so that effective pollution prevention approaches can be designed and implemented.
   Accumulation of leftover, unwanted drugs poses three major concerns: (i) APIs disposed to sewage or trash compose a diverse source of potential chemical stressors in the environment. (ii) Accumulated drugs represent increased potential for drug diversion, with its attendant risks of unintentional poisonings and abuse. (iii) Leftover drugs represent wasted healthcare resources and lost opportunities for medical treatment.
   This paper has four major purposes: (1) Define the processes, actions, and behaviors that control and drive the consumption, accumulation, and need for disposal of pharmaceuticals. (2) Provide an overview of the diverse locations where drugs are used and accumulate. (3) Present a summary of the first cataloging of APIs disposed by a defined subpopulation. (4) Identify opportunities for pollution prevention and source reduction. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Australia, trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) and endocrine active compounds (EACs) have been detected in rivers impacted by sewage effluent, urban stormwater, agricultural and industrial inputs. It is unclear whether these chemicals are at concentrations that can elicit endocrine disruption in Australian fish species. In this study, native rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) and introduced invasive (but prevalent) mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to the individual compounds atrazine, estrone, bisphenol A, propylparaben and pyrimethanil, and mixtures of compounds including hormones and personal care products, industrial compounds, and pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations. Vitellogenin (Vtg) protein and liver VtgmRNA induction were used to assess the estrogenic potential of these compounds. Vtg expression was significantly affected in both species exposed to estrone at concentrations that leave little margin for safety (p < 0.001). Propylparaben caused a small but statistically significant 3x increase in Vtg protein levels (p = 0.035) in rainbowfish but at a concentration 40x higher than that measured in the environment, therefore propylparaben poses a low risk of inducing endocrine disruption in fish. Mixtures of pesticides and a mixture of hormones, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides induced a small but statistically significant increase in plasma Vtg in rainbowfish, but did not affect mosquitofish Vtg protein or mRNA expression. These results suggest that estrogenic activity represents a low risk to fish in most Australian rivers monitored to-date except for some species of fish at the most polluted sites.

AB We collected influent and effluent samples from four sewage treatment plants (STPs) as well as surface water samples in Han River of Seoul, Korea, in three sampling events representing different flow conditions, i.e., April, June, and August, 2005, and analyzed for eleven pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cimetidine, diltiazem, trimethoprim, and five sulfonamide antibiotics, using LC-MS-ESI. Pharmaceuticals of high annual production amount were detected in higher level in STP influents. Levels of pharmaceutical residues in the influents were the highest for acetaminophen (average 27,089 ng/L), followed by caffeine (23,664 ng/L), cimetidine (8045 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (523 ng/L). Levels of acetaminophen and caffeine in STP effluents were very low compared to the influent concentrations. However cimetidine was detected in relatively high levels even in STP effluent samples. in effluent samples, cimetidine showed the highest level (5380 ng/L), followed by caffeine (278 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (193 ng/L), and carbamazepine (111 ng/L). The concentration of cimetidine was also the highest in surface water samples (average 281 ng/L), which is the highest level reported from surface water worldwide to our knowledge. Caffeine (268.7 ng/L), acetaminophen (34.8 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (26.9 ng/L) were also detected in relatively high levels. Levels of pharmaceuticals detected in surface water samples upstream STPs were generally very low compared to the downstream samples, suggesting that the STPs potentially be a major source of the test pharmaceuticals into Han River. The hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated for the test pharmaceuticals based on their occurrences in surface water, and no pharmaceutical resulted in HQ greater than one, suggesting that their potential environmental impact may be low.

AB Recently, considerable interest has developed regarding the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, but there has been comparatively little study on the potential of these substances to enter potable supplies. This is surprising because drinking water would provide a direct route into the body for any drugs that might be present. Although many countries employ advanced treatments, such as granular activated carbon, membrane technologies, ozonation and ultraviolet radiation, for treating water intended for human consumption, some compounds have been shown to be unaffected by such processes. Here, we examine the levels of drug substances reported in drinking water around the world. The possible implications of the presence of these compounds are highlighted and assessed, and recommendations are made for further research.

AB The environmental fate of organic waste-derived trace organic contaminants is a recent focus of research. Public awareness of this issue and concern about the potential risks are increasing, partly as a result of this research. Knowledge remains sparse but, due to growing waste volumes and contaminant concentrations, situations are arising where decisions are urgently needed and the stakes are high. We present an approach to provide stakeholders with the soundest possible information on relevant risks in specific situations where local experimental data are scarce or inexistent. With accuracy taking precedence over precision in such situations, the quantitative fate assessment aspect of the approach considers uncertainty at all levels in order to estimate best-to-worst-case (cumulative uncertainty) fuzzy fate ranges. The approach was applied to conditions that prevail on the island of Reunion. Contrasting possible organic residue recycling scenarios are considered in which trace organic contaminants originate either from pig slurry or sewage sludge. The stakeholders' concerns targeted are leaching, soil persistence and crop (sugarcane) shoot translocation. The fate assessment results in soil removal dynamics that vary over a wide range, even for a particular chemical in a particular scenario. For 3 out of 27 chemicals residual soil concentrations after one sugarcane crop cycle could possibly exceed the 100 ng/g dry weight mass fraction range, only in a worst case situation. Substances predicted to be of the highest mobility (erythromycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) might produce appreciable leaching only in the event of substantial rainfall shortly after a high rate decadal application. And only the higher bound sugarcane shoot concentration estimates of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and tris(chloropropyl)phosphate are significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) contain a diverse range of organic groups that present a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health. However, their actual fate in rivers remains only partially understood. The occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of PPCPs in aquatic systems have received global research attention. However, few studies have focused on the Longgang River in Shenzhen City, South China. This study was the first to simultaneously identify and quantify five PPCPs residues in the mainstream of Longgang River. All surface water and sediment samples were analyzed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The five assessed PPCPs were all detected in the mainstream of the Longgang River, with sediment concentrations much higher than water concentrations. Fluconazole and Triclosan were the dominant PPCPs in water and sediments, with maximum concentrations of 55.86 ng/L and 19.24 mu g/kg, respectively. Others were present at mean concentrations below 40 ng/L in water and 15 mu g/kg in sediments. The recovery rates of the five PPCPs ranged from 57.2% to 110.6%, which were within the limits of reliability. These results demonstrate that sewage treatment plants exhibited different degrees of removal effects for the five PPCPs and showed a natural attenuation trend along the Longgang River for all PPCPs except carbamazepine. The trace amounts of individual PPCPs residues in the river posed a low risk to aquatic organisms in the mainstream, although the potential risks created by low dose exposure and bioaccumulation of PPCPs should be considered.

AB In this study, the removal of ibuprofen and gemfibrozil by chlorination, ozonation and a combination of ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2) advanced oxidation process (AOP) from treated sewage effluent (TSE) has been investigated. The removals were evaluated as single components and in binary systems at different oxidant dosages. Chlorination showed insignificant removal for both pharmaceuticals, while ozonation and O-3/H2O2 achieved significant removals for both ibuprofen and gemfibrozil. The highest removal efficiency of ibuprofen achieved with ozonation and O-3/H2O2 in TSE was 80% at 1.5 mg/L ozone dosage (0.27 mg O-3/mg DOC) within 5 min contact time and was not increased at extended times as the ozone residual approached zero in 5 min. For gemfibrozil, complete removals were achieved at ozone dosages of 1 and 1.5 mg/L by both ozonation and O-3/H2O2 within 30 s. The rate constants obtained from the second order kinetics study were almost similar for the binary and single component tests, however, the degradation of ibuprofen was around four times faster by O-3/H2O2 with a rate constant of 9 x 10(4)M(-1) s(-1) in comparison to ozone alone. The results in the single component and binary systems were almost similar for gemfibrozil, but noticeably lower removals of ibuprofen were obtained in the binary system showing the higher selectivity and oxidation demand of gemfibrozil. Although O-3/H2O2 has a higher operation cost, but its capability for faster degradation makes it preferable over ozonation only, as more water can be treated on a daily basis or a smaller treatment plant can be used with lower capital cost, which practically becomes more cost efficient.

AB Eleven antibiotics in three different categories were investigated in two types of coastal bays (a semi-enclosed bay and an open bay) of the Yellow Sea and in fresh water (rivers and sewage treatment plants [STP] effluents) that discharged into the bays. The results revealed the presence of three predominant antibiotics: dehydration erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. These antibiotics were detected in the seawater and fresh water with concentrations of <0.23-50.4 ng L-1 and <0.25-663.1 ng L-1, respectively. In terms of the regional distribution of the compounds within the two types of bays, higher concentrations (<0.23-50.4 ng L-1) and higher spatial variations (coefficients of variation: 98%-124%) were found in the semi-enclosed Jiaozhou Bay due to the poor water-exchange ability and to fresh-water inputs through rivers and/or STP effluents. In contrast, lower concentrations (<0.23-3.0 ng L-1) and lower spatial variations (coefficients of variation: 36%-75%) were present in the open Yantai Bays due to the strong water-exchange with the open sea. The source apportionment suggested that 1) fresh-water inputs were the primary source of macrolides in the coastal water, and 2) mariculture affected the relative pollution levels of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole in the bays. In addition, a risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotient (RQ) showed that the dehydrated erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin detected at most of the sampling sites in Jiaozhou Bay could pose high (RQ>1) risks to the most sensitive aquatic microorganisms, such as Synechococcus leopoliensis and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, whilst in the Yantai Bays, the compounds could pose medium risks (1 >= RQ > 0.1) to the same aquatic microorganisms.

AB The occurrence, bioaccumulation and risk assessment of lipophilic pharmaceutically active compounds (LPhACs), such as antibiotics (roxithromycin, erythromycin and ketoconazole), anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen and diclofenac), beta-blockers (propranolol), antiepileptics (carbamazepine) and steroid hormones (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol), were investigated in the downstream rivers of sewage treatment plants in Nanjing, China. The results indicate that these LPhACs were widely detected in the surface water and fish samples, with the mean concentrations of the total LPhACs (Sigma LPhACs) being in the range of 15.4 and 384.5 ng/L and 3.0 and 128.4 ng/g (wet weight), respectively. The bioaccumulation of the Sigma LPhACs in wild fish tissues was generally in the order the liver > brain > gill > muscle. Among the target LPhACs, however, an interspecies difference in tissue distribution was evident for erythromycin. The bioaccumulation factors of LPhACs in the liver and brain, the two major targeted storage sites for toxicants, exhibited an obvious negative correlation with the aquatic concentrations (P < 0.05). Finally, risk quotients posed by pharmaceuticals were assessed by comprehensive and comparative methods for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish). The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be algae > daphnids > fish. However, the results indicate that diclofenac, ibuprofen and 17a-ethinylestradiol each posed chronic risks for high trophic level organisms (fish). In all of the risk assessments, erythromycin was found to be the most harmful for the most sensitive algae group. In this work, however, the total BAF and toxicological interactions of pharmaceuticals were not performed due to the lack of metabolite information and combined toxicity data, which represents a major hindrance to the effective risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.

TI The Carver-Greenfield process: Dehydration/solvent extraction technology
   for waste treatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB A combination dehydration/solvent extraction treatment technology, the proprietary Carver-Greenfield (C-G) Process, can be wed to separate solid/liquid waste materials into three separate product streams convenient for reuse or disposal:
   (1) clean, dry solids suitable for fixation of nonhazardous landfilling;
   (2) water virtually free of solids and oils which can be processed in gn industrial or public wastewater treatment facility: and,
   (3) oil indigenous to the feed, a mixture of extracted hydrocarbon-soluble compounds which typically includes any hazardous contaminants which are present.
   As normally practiced, this dehydration/solvent extraction technology involves slurrying water-wet waste in a hydrocarbon solvent which extracts indigenous oil from contaminated solid particles and concentrates it in the solvent phase. Dehydration also takes place during the treatment; water is evaporated and condensed as a separate product. Dry solids are reslurried in fresh solvent one or more additional times depending on the degree of extraction required. Extracted solids are centrifuged away from the solvent and residual solvent in the centrifuge cake vaporized off the final product solids stream in a desolventizer, Indigenous oil from the waste is separated from the solvent by distillation with recovered solvent being recycled to the process.
   For commercial applications, this process is very flexible in its ability to be efficiently adapted to waste processability and treatment objectives. For example, if the contaminants are very heavy organics like PCB's, they may be further concentrated in a portion of the indigenous oil such that only a very small highly concentrated contaminant stream need be disposed of and uncontaminated oil may be recovered for a process credit. In some cases where the feed has a high water concentration, the dry solids need not be separated from the indigenous oil but they can be recovered/disposed of together.
   This dehydration/solvent extraction technology has been licensed to over 80 facilities over the past 30 years to solve waste disposal problems in a wide variety of fields. More than half of the plants were designed to dry and deoil slaughterhouse wastes Cin rendering plants). The other units are used to evaporate water and extract indigenous oil from a broad spectrum of other materials, including municipal and industrial sewage sludges, wool scouring wastes, petrochemical sludges, wood-pulp waste, pharmaceutical wastes, dairy and food products, textile wastes and animal manure.
   This paper discusses the C-G Process flexibility and economics as applied to various hazardous waste examples including PCB contaminated sediments, soils and sludges, spent drilling fluids (U.S. EPA SITE Program). refinery wastes, manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, etc.

AB Titanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system and, subsequently, enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids. This study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products, derives estimates of human exposure to dietary (nano-) TiO2, and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of TiO2 entering the environment. The foods with the highest content of TiO2 included candies, sweets, and chewing gums. Among personal care products, toothpastes and select sunscreens contained 1% to >10% titanium by weight. While some other cremes contained titanium, despite being colored white, most shampoos, deodorants, and shaving creams contained the lowest levels of titanium (<0.01 mu g/mg). For several high-consumption pharmaceuticals, the titanium content ranged from below the instrument detection limit (0.0001 mu g Ti/mg) to a high of 0.014 mu g Ti/mg. Electron microscopy and stability testing of food-grade TiO2 (E171) suggests that approximately 36% of the particles are less than 100 nm in at least one dimension and that it readily disperses in water as fairly stable colloids. However, filtration of water solubilized consumer products and personal care products indicated that less than 5% of the titanium was able to pass through 0.45 or 0.7 mu m pores. Two white paints contained 110 mu g Ti/mg while three sealants (i.e., prime coat paint) contained less titanium (25 to 40 mu g Ti/mg). This research showed that, while many white-colored products contained titanium, it was not a prerequisite. Although several of these product classes contained low amounts of titanium, their widespread use and disposal down the drain and eventually to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) deserves attention. A Monte Carlo human exposure analysis to TiO2 through foods identified children as having the highest exposures because TiO2 content of sweets is higher than other food products and that a typical exposure for a US adult may be on the order of 1 mg Ti per kilogram body weight per day. Thus, because of the millions of tons of titanium-based white pigment used annually, testing should focus on food-grade TiO2 (E171) rather than that adopted in many environmental health and safety tests (i.e., P25), which is used in much lower amounts in products less likely to enter the environment (e.g., catalyst supports, photocatalytic coatings).

TI Insights into the retention behavior of betamethasone by nanofiltration
   - An alternative for decentralized drinking water treatment

AB Betamethasone (BET) has been found in surface and wastewater around the world. The pharmaceutical is prescribed to human and veterinary use due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and immunosuppressive properties. As a result of its recalcitrant character and resistance to biological degradation processes, BET is not retained by wastewater treatment plant, nor in drinking water treatment plants. However, it is necessary to invest in techniques that allow BET to be removed from aqueous matrices in view of its adverse effect on human health and the environment. In this sense, nanofiltration (NF) stands out as a promising alternative. Thus, in this study, the DK NF membrane was applied under different transmembrane pressure (TMP; 4-10 bar) and feed flow rates (0.8-3.2 L/min) for surface water treatment, aiming for a higher permeate flux, as well as the higher BET retention. Increasing TMP lead to higher permeate flux (47.44 L/m(2).h) and lower flux decline (J/J(0) = 0.95). The increase in feed flow rates besides lead to a high permeate flux also contributed to a high membrane rejection (BET retention of 98.8%), but implies a higher specific energy consumption. The NF Opex was estimated in 0.43 US$/m(3), which demonstrates that NF could be a feasible alternative to remove BET from drinking water with high desalination capacity.

AB Wastewater and effluent discharges are the main causes of receiving water body pollution and important challenges in water quality management. Among the emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals have increasingly drawn attention due to their incomplete removal during conventional biological treatment, inducing potential and actual risks to living organisms following residue discharges in river effluent. Electron beam irradiation (EBI) is a clean process technology for organic compound degradation and mineralization, as well as persistent pollutant detoxification. This study aimed to evaluate EBI effects on the degradation and toxicity removal of anti-inflammatory aspirin (ASA) in a single solution and in a fluoxetine (FLX) mixture. Results indicate that 98% of the single aspirin was degraded at 5.0 kGy. Aspirin toxicity to Daphnia similis, however, increased with increasing absorbed dose (1.0 to 5.0 kGy), possibly as a result of the presence of H2O2 and other byproducts formed during the oxidation process. Regarding the irradiated mixture, complete degradation was achieved for both pharmaceuticals. Toxicity removals for the mixture were of 56.2 +/- 0.9% and 58.8 +/- 5.4% for 1.0 and 2.5 kGy, respectively. These findings demonstrate that EBI can be an interesting alternative process to be applied as a pre-treatment followed by biological treatment.

AB Freshwater bivalve populations are stressed by watershed development at the global scale. Though pharmaceuticals released from wastewater treatment plant effluent discharges are increasingly reported to bioaccumulate in fish, an understanding of bioaccumulation in bivalves is less defined. In the present study, we examined accumulation of 12 target pharmaceuticals in C. fluminea during a 42 day in situ study in Pecan Creek, an effluent dependent wadeable stream in north central Texas, USA. Caged clams were placed at increasing distances (5 m, 643 m, 1762 m) downstream from a municipal effluent discharge and then subsampled on study days 7,14, 28 and 42. Acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, desmethylsertraline, and methylphenidate were identified in C. fluminea whole body tissue homogenates via isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Tissue concentrations ranged from low mu g/kg (methylphenidate) to 341 mu g/kg (sertraline). By study day 7, rapid and apparent pseudo-steady state accumulation of study compounds was observed in clams; this observation continued throughout the 42 d study. Notably, elevated bioaccumulation factors (L/kg) for sertraline were observed between 3361 and 6845, which highlights the importance of developing predictive bioaccumulation models for ionizable contaminants with bivalves. Future research is also necessary to understand different routes of exposure and elimination kinetics for pharmaceutical accumulation in bivalves. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The determination of the peak volumetric removal rate of ibuprofen in batch culture was used to select a microbial community utilizable for augmentation. For a continuous removal process, this rate, particularly the peak value of the volumetric removal rate is an essential factor reflecting the catabolic behavior (metabolic quotient qs) and the physiological state of a microbial community which depends on environmental conditions. Thus, if stable environmental conditions are maintained in a homogeneous continuous regime, a high metabolic quotient and volumetric removal rate could be maintained for the selected microbial community.
   Using equations derived from the material balance of ibuprofen in a wastewater treatment mini-plant (WTMP) operating in a homogeneous condition, the beginning and end of an acclimatization period after an IBP toxic shock were estimated by comparison of the experimental values of IBP accumulated to its theoretical accumulation. Using the experimental values of IBP accumulated within the WTMP, the actual transient change in the volumetric removal rate along the acclimatization period was calculated from another derived equation. This procedure allows to measure the change in the volumetric removal rate, showing the kinetic response of the system and the acclimatization time of a microbial consortium after a toxic shock.

AB Diclofenac has recently been included in the first watch list of substances to be monitored in all member states so as to evaluate its future inclusion in the priority substances list by the Water Framework Directive. Therefore, in view of upcoming limitations on diclofenac discharge, the objective of this work was to assess its removal from water by a microalgae-based treatment. Moreover, considering microalgae application inwastewater treatment, it was aimed to verify if their nutrient removal capacity was affected by the presence of diclofenac. For a comparison purpose, three different microalgae strains, namely Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus, were cultured in photobioreactors under identical controlled conditions. For the three strains, the addition of diclofenac meant an organic carbon source and provided higher biomass concentration. C. sorokiniana was the strain showing the largest increase of growth rate and microalgae density, which were above 25% and 31%, respectively, compared with the positive control. However, S. obliquus showed the highest efficiency in the removal of diclofenac (>79%) and nutrients (>87% nitrates, >99% phosphates) per litre and per gram of biomass. These results pointed to the potential application of microalgae for the removal of pharmaceuticals in the bioremediation of wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work analyses the presence of twenty-five pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven different therapeutic groups and one iodinated contrast media (ICM) in a Spanish medium-size hospital located in the Valencia Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the hospital wastewater was performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (HPLC-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds investigated. Additionally, the environmental hazard associated to the various compounds measured was assessed through the calculation of the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) Index, which categorizes compounds according to their environmentally damaging characteristics. The results of the study showed the presence of twenty-four out of the twenty-six compounds analysed at individual concentrations ranging from 5 ng L-1 to 2 mg L-1. The highest concentrations corresponded to the ICM iomeprol, found at levels between 424 and 2093 mu g L-1, the analgesic acetaminophen (15-44 mu g L-1), the diuretic (DIU) furosemide (6-15 mu g L-1), and the antibiotics (ABIs) ofloxacin and trimethoprim (2-5 mu g L-1). The lowest levels corresponded to the anti-inflammatory propyphenazone, found at concentrations between 5 and 44 ng L-1. Differences in terms of concentrations of the analysed compounds have been observed in all the therapeutic groups when comparing the results obtained in this and other recent studies carried out in hospitals with different characteristics from different geographical areas and in different seasons. The screening level risk assessment performed in raw water from the hospital effluent showed that the analgesics and anti-inflammatories (AAFs) acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen, the antibiotics (ABIs) clarithromycin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim, and the p-blocker (BBL) propranolol were present at concentrations leading to HQ values higher than 10, thus indicating high risk. When applying a factor to take into account potential dilution and degradation processes, only the compound ibuprofen showed a HQ higher than 1. Likewise, the cumulative HQ or Toxic Units (TUs) calculated in the raw water for each of the therapeutic groups studied showed that these three classes of drugs were at concentrations high enough to potentially generate high risk to aquatic organisms while taking into account possible dilution and degradation processes only one of them, the AAFs can be considered to represent high risk. Finally, the environmental hazard assessment performed showed that the AAFs diclofenac and ibuprofen and the ABI clarithromycin have the highest, maximum value of 9 of PBT Index due to their inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.
   The methodology followed in the present case study can be taken as a novel approach to classify and categorize pharmaceuticals on the basis of their occurrence in hospital effluents, their derived environmental risks, and their associated environmental hazard. This classification becomes important because it can be used as a model or orientation for hospitals in the process of developing environmentally sustainable policies and as an argument to justify the adoption of advanced, specific treatments for hospital effluents before being discharged into the public sewage system.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most detected pharmaceutical compounds around the world, with adverse human and animal health impacts in wastewater effluents. Recently, biocatalytic degradation using ligninolytic enzymes such as laccase along with redox mediators provides a promising approach for their removal from water and wastewater. However, the effects of operational parameters on biotransformation need to be investigated in order to design a robust and efficient process. In this research, central composite design was performed and analyzed using response surface methodology to study the effects of temperature, pH, enzyme concentration and mediator concentration. The adequacy of the developed model was confirmed by the coefficient of multiple regression (R-2 = 75.97%) indicating a reasonable model for practical implementation. The results showed that performing the biotransformation at 35 degrees C, pH 6, with 60 U/L of enzyme concentration and 18 mu M of mediator concentration resulted in 95% removal of CBZ. 10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxy-CBZ were identified as the major metabolites of CBZ oxidation by laccase. The estrogenicity tests indicated that the CBZ with an initial concentration of 4 mu M and its biotransformation products had no estrogenic effect. The successful transformation of CBZ demonstrated the potential of the laccase-mediator system for the removal of recalcitrant micro-contaminants.

AB BACKGROUND: In this work, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is utilized to estimate the environmental footprint of solar Fenton oxidation at pilot scale used as a polishing step of secondary-treated urban effluents. All inputs (e.g. natural resources, raw materials, etc.) and outputs (e.g. emissions, etc.) of the process were quantitatively defined and/or estimated. The system under study includes raw materials, energy, land use, chemicals, local transportation needs, and air-/waterborne emissions.
   RESULTS: The main environmental hotspots of this system were identified (i.e. energy consumption and use of chemicals). The environmental sustainability of this technology was found to be high, since its environmental footprint for the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater was found to be only 8.7 kg CO2 m(-3), which is approx. 1.6% of the total CO2 emissions of the treatment of the daily effluents of a Cypriot resident. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios were investigated, in order to further enhance its overall environmental performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the majority of the environmental impacts of this process could be attributed to indirect emissions, tracing back to electricity generation, followed by emissions from the chemicals used. The most critical improvement identified herein, is the use of a renewable energy source. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Understanding and acquiring knowledge about the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) is imperative to the chemical engineering applications of CNMs, as well as to risk assessment and pollution control of both CNMs and pharmaceuticals. A computational assessment of the mechanism and thermodynamics of the adsorption of 18 most common pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibric acid, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, phenazone, primidone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tramadol) on four different CNMs (pristine/functionalised graphene and carbon nanotube) in two different solvents (water and n-octanol) was provided. We show that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on pristine CNMs is controlled by dispersion forces, pi-interactions and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, adsorption on functionalised CNMs is controlled by hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how functionalization of CNM, CNM curvature and background solution properties modulate the intensity of non-covalent interactions and their contribution towards adsorption free energy. With this knowledge, we pinpoint functionalised graphene at environmental pH as the most effective setting for the removal of a given set of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. Finally, we show that CNMs may transport pharmaceuticals into living organisms and release them in nonpolar mediums such as cellular membranes and fat cells.

AB Photocatalytic degradation of typical pharmaceuticals in natural sunlight and in actual water is of great significance. In this study, the oxygen or nitrogen linked heptazine-base polymer (ONLH) was successfully incorporated with TiO2 nanoparticles and formed a TiO2/ONLH nanocomposite which was responded to the natural sunlight. Under natural sunlight, the TiO2/ONLH can effectively degrade ten types of pharmaceuticals. In particular, fluoroquinolone containing N-piperazinyl, and cardiovascular drugs containing long aromatic side chains were easily degraded. The half-life of the best degradation performance of propranolol was less than 5 min. The rate constants of propranolol using the TiO2/ONLH were approximately sixand eight-fold higher than those of pristine TiO2 and ONLH, respectively. Two reactive species ((OH)-O-center dot and O2(center dot-)) facilitated the rapid degradation of propranolol, which occurred primarily through the hydroxyl radical addition, ring-opening, and ipso substitution reactions. An acute toxicity test using luminescent bacteria indicated that the toxicity of the propranolol reaction solution gradually decreased with lower total organic carbon (TOC). According to the toxicity evaluation of monomer products, the TiO2/ONLH also reduced the generation of toxic transformation products. The effects of actual water/wastewater have further shown the TiO2/ONLH might be applied for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater.

AB Wastewater reuse presents a promising way to mitigate the risk to global water resources and achieve sustainability in water, especially in agricultural areas in the southeast of Spain, such as the Murcia region. However, the risks related to the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) or pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent suggest the need to implement effective and relatively low-cost tertiary treatments. With this aim, a self-sustainable pilot prototype based on three combined modules (disc-filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) bed adsorption and UV disinfection) assisted by solar panels was installed as an alternative tertiary treatment in a conventional WWTP in the Murcia region. The obtained results clearly confirmed the efficiency of the proposed prototype for CECs removal, and showed optimal results at a workflow of 500 L/h. In all cases, high removal efficiency was obtained for the different indicator microorganisms described in the recently published Regulation (EU) 2020/741 (E. coli, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages, total coliphages, and Clostridium perfringens). The protection of the activated carbon by disc-filters and the energy autonomy and self-operation of the prototype resulted in an efficient and economically viable methodology for its implementation in both conventional WWTPs and in isolated areas attached to crops.
