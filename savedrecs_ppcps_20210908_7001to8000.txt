AB Transformation products of pharmaceuticals formed by human metabolism within sewage treatment plant or receiving waters are predicted, in most cases, to be less toxic than the parent compound to common aquatic species. However, there is little available data to demonstrate whether this is generally the case. In the present study, a framework was developed to guide testing of transformation products using phototransformation of the beta-blocker propranolol to test the hypothesis for this particular transformation route. Phototransformation is an important depletion mechanism of some pharmaceuticals in surface waters with fast reaction rate constants at environmentally relevant conditions. Samples of propranolol in deionized water (DIW) and river water (RW) were exposed to a solar simulator (lambda:295-800 nm) and comparative toxicity of propranolol and its degraded mixtures measured using algal (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) screening tests. Results suggested a reduction of toxicity in photodegraded mixtures compared to the parent active pharmaceutical ingredient in all samples tested. Chemical analysis of effect test solutions supported the hypothesis that propranolol was transformed into compounds that appear to be less toxic to the organisms tested under the study conditions. Although the reactions were much faster in RW than in DIW, profiles of transformation products were similar in both matrices at two starting concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L). Results for propranolol implied that the reduction of toxicity using algal and rotifer screening tests was probably due to the production of more hydrophilic and more polar transformation products. Such results will provide useful insights into the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals by taking into account their transformation products.

AB An effective analytical method for simultaneously determining 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 28 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), and 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has been developed to measure their concentrations in the Mississippi river waters in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The method involves the simultaneous extraction of the selected PAHs, PCBs, and PPCPs, from the aqueous phase by solid phase extraction using two-layer disks consisting of C-18 and SDB-XC, and collection of suspended solid in water samples by 0.2-0.6 mu m filter in a single step. Target compounds adsorbed on the extraction disks were eluted with methanol, acetone, and dichloromethane. The suspended particles retained by the filter were sonically extracted using the same solvents. GC/MS was used for quantification of PAHs and PCBs directly and of PPCPs after derivatization. The analytical method was used in a 6-month field study of the Mississippi river water for contamination by PAHs, PCBs, and PPCPs and the following concentrations (ng/l) have been obtained: clofibric acid (3.2-26.7), ibuprofen (0-34.0), acetaminophen (24.7-65.2), caffeine (0-38.0), naproxen (0-135.2), triclosan (8.8-26.3), bisphenol A (0-147.2), carbamazepine (42.9-113.7), estrone (0-4.7), 17 beta-estradiol (0-4.5), total PAHs (62.9-144.7), and total PCBs (22.2-163.4).

SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY

ID CHEMICALS
AB Iodinated S-ray contrast media are diagnostic pharmaceuticals that are applied to enhance the contrast between organs or vessels examined and surrounding tissues during radiography. These substances are applied in doses up to ca, 200 g per person (corresponding to approx 100 g iodine) and are rapidly excreted. In the sewage system they contribute to the burden of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX). To assess the potential environmental impact of this release, studies on environmental fate and effects mere conducted for a risk assessment of the frequently used X-rag contrast medium iopromide (brand name: Ultravist). A screening test for biological degradation (OECD Screening Test 301 E) led to iopromide being classified as not readily biodegradable, Therefore, the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in surface mater was calculated in a first step. The resulting concentration of 2 mu g/liter was then compared in a second step with the predicted no-effect concentration as derived from a battery of ecotoxicity tests. In short-term toxicity tests with bacterial (Vibrio fisheri, Pseudomonas putida), algae (Scenedesmus subspicatus), crustaceans (Daphnia magna), and fish (Danio rerio, Leuciscus idus) no toxic effects were detected at the highest tested concentration of 10 g/liter, In a chronic toxicity test with D, magna no effect was observed at the highest tested concentration of 1 g/liter. Using an assessment factor of 100 the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) was calculated to be less than or equal to 0.0002. This low value indicates that no environmental risk has to be expected as a result of the release of iopromide into the aquatic environment, (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB The biological effects of endocrine-active compounds and increasing water temperatures as a result of climate change have been studied extensively and independently, but there is a dearth of research to examine the combined effect of these factors on exposed organisms. Recent data suggest that estrogenic exposure and rising ambient temperatures independently impact predator-prey relationships. However, establishing these connections in natural settings is complex. These obstacles can be circumvented if biomarkers of estrogenic exposure in resident fish can predict changes in predator-prey relationships. To test the effects of estrone and temperature, the piscivore bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) was exposed for 30 days to estrone at concentrations (90 +/- 17.6 ng/L [mean +/- standard deviation] and 414 +/- 146 ng/L) previously shown to reduce prey-capture success. Exposures were conducted at four temperatures (15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C) to simulate breeding season ambient temperatures across the natural range of this species. A suite of morphological and physiological biomarkers previously linked to estrogenic exposures were examined. Biomarkers of estrone exposure were more commonly and severely impacted in male fish than in female fish. Notably, the gonadosomatic index was lower and gonads were less mature in exposed males. Additionally, temperature modulated the effects of estrone similarly in males and females with fish exposed at higher temperatures typically exhibiting a decreased morphological index. This study provides evidence that alterations in hepatic function and gonadal function may cause shifts in metabolism and energy allocation that may lead to declining prey capture performance.

AB Pharmaceutical consumption continues to grow constantly. Unused/expired pharmaceuticals are disposed of to the municipal sewage system or waste disposal. Consequently, many countries have implemented a system of collecting pharmaceutical waste, with pharmacies playing an important role. It is important to educate consumers on rational consumption and the appropriate disposal of unused/expired pharmaceuticals and to identify the level of public awareness. Two studies were conducted in Poland to estimate the problem of collection and disposal of expired/unused pharmaceuticals. The purpose of the Survey I was to identify the scale of pharmaceutical consumption and the way pharmaceuticals are disposed of by various social groups. The Survey II was aimed to identify patients' attitudes regarding expired/unused pharmaceuticals at home. Of the respondents who participated in in Survey I, almost 74% indicated that analgesics were among the over-the-counter drugs they purchased. Group of pharmaceuticals 65% of the respondents purchased were medicines for treating flu symptoms. Almost 68% of the respondents said they usually disposed of expired pharmaceuticals in their household waste or by flushing them down the toilet. In Survey II more than 35% reported that they disposed of pharmaceuticals in the same ways. Of all respondents, similar to 30% returned their expired pharmaceuticals to pharmacies. Most respondents (over 65%) who participated Survey I indicated that they were aware that pharmaceutical waste can be returned to pharmacies. It should be noted that local governments are currently not obliged by law to work with or compensate pharmacies in the collection and proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.

AB The biodegradation of fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, and metoprolol using ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing consortium, nitrite-oxidizing consortium, and heterotrophic biomass was evaluated in batch tests applying different retention times. The ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing consortium presented the highest biodegradation percentages for mefenamic acid and metoprolol, of 85 and 64% respectively. This consortium was also capable to biodegrade 79% of fluoxetine. The heterotrophic consortium showed the highest ability to biodegrade fluoxetine reaching 85%, and it also had a high potential for biodegrading mefenamic acid and metoprolol, of 66 and 58% respectively. The nitrite-oxidizing consortium presented the lowest biodegradation of the three pharmaceuticals, of less than 48%. The determination of the selected pharmaceuticals in the dissolved phase and in the biomass indicated that biodegradation was the major removal mechanism of the three compounds. Based on the obtained results, the biodegradation kinetics was adjusted to pseudo-first-order for the three pharmaceuticals. The values of kbiol for fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, and metoprolol determined with the three consortiums indicated that ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing and heterotrophic biomass allow a partial biodegradation of the compounds, while no substantial biodegradation can be expected using nitrite-oxidizing consortium. Metoprolol was the less biodegradable compound. The sorption of fluoxetine and mefenamic acid onto biomass had a significant contribution for their removal (6-14%). The lowest sorption coefficients were obtained for metoprolol indicating that the sorption onto biomass is poor (3-4%), and the contribution of this process to the global removal can be neglected.

AB There is a dearth of information on the occurrence and risks of antibiotics in the urban rivers from plateau areas. This study investigated 83 antibiotics in water and sediments of an urban river and effluents of sewage treatment plants (E-STPs) in Xining, Qinghai (northeastern Tibetan Plateau). Fifty-three antibiotics were detected, and the concentrations of individual antibiotics varied in the range of undetected (ND)-552 ng/L in water, ND-164 ng/g in sediments, and ND-3821 ng/L in E-STPs. Seasonal differences of antibiotic concentrations were significant for water samples (p<0.05) but insignificant for sediments (p>0.05). In urban area, E-STP is the main source of antibiotics in the river, while runoff from manured cropland contributes partially to antibiotics in the river in the suburban area. The antibiotic compositions in water were different from those in sediments, but were similar to those in E-STPs. Notably, because of strong solar radiation and long sunshine hours in the plateau area, low levels of quinolones, which are sensitive to photolysis, were observed in river water. Moreover, norfloxacin and enrofloxacin, observed in urban river from other regions of China, were not detected in the Huangshui River water. The occurrence of ofloxacin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim in E-STPs may induce a possible risk to antibiotic resistance evolution. Trimethoprim, anhydroerythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, and clindamycin in river water could pose low to medium risks to aquatic organisms. Further investigation on the occurrence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in the Huangshui River is urgently needed.

AB Antineoplastic drugs (AD) have been increasingly used, but the disposal of their wastes in the environment via hospital effluent and domestic sewage has emerged as an environmental issue. The current risks posed to these animals and effects of pollutants on the reptiles' population level remain unknown due to lack of studies on the topic. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mutagenicity of neonate Podocnemis expansa exposed to environmental concentrations (EC) of cyclophosphamide (Cyc). The adopted doses were EC-I 0.2g/L and EC-II 0.5g/L Cyc. These doses correspond to 1/10 and 1/4 of concentrations previously identified in hospital effluents. Turtles exposed to the CyC recorded larger total number of erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities than the ones in the control group after 48-h exposure. The total number of abnormalities for both groups (EC-I and EC-II) 96h after the experiment had started was statistically similar to that of animals exposed to high Cyc concentration (positive control 5x10(4)g/L). This outcome confirms the mutagenic potential of Cyc, even at low concentrations. On the other hand, when the animals were taken to a pollutant-free environment, their mutagenic damages disappeared after 240h. After such period, their total of abnormalities matched the basal levels recorded for the control group. Therefore, our study is the first evidence of AD mutagenicity in reptiles, even at EC and short-term exposure, as well as of turtles' recovery capability after the exposure to Cyc.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two forms of basic granular activated carbon (GAC), mineral (pH = 10.5) and vegetal (pH = 9), for the removal of three pharmaceuticals, as sulphamethoxazole (SMX), diclofenac (DCF) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2), from two different matrices: fortified distilled (2.4-3.0 mg L-1 and pH from 5.5 to 6.5) and natural (similar to 1.0 mg L-1 and pH from 7.1 to 7.2) water in a bench scale. The Rapid Small-Scale Column Test used to assess the ability of mineral and vegetal GAC on removal of such pharmaceuticals led to removal capacities varying from 14.9 to 23.5 mg g(-1) for E2, from 23.7 to 24.2 mg g(-1) for DCF and from 20.5 to 20.6 mg g(-1) for SMX. Removal efficiencies of 71%, 88% and 74% for DCF, SMX and E2, respectively, were obtained at breakthrough point when using mineral GAC, whereas for the vegetal GAC the figures were 76%, 77% and 65%, respectively. The carbon usage rate at the breakthrough point varied from 11.9 to 14.5 L g(-1) for mineral GAC and from 8.8 to 14.8 L g(-1) for vegetal GAC. Mineral CAG also exhibited the best performance when treating fortified natural water, since nearly complete removal was observed for all contaminants in the column operated for 22 h at a carbon usage rate of 2.9 L g(-1).

AB A model to predict the mass flows and concentrations of pharmaceuticals predominantly used in hospitals across a large number of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and river waters was developed at high spatial resolution. It comprised 427 georeferenced hospitals and 742 STPs serving 98% of the general population in Switzerland. In the modeled base scenario, domestic, pharmaceutical use was geographically distributed according to the population size served by the respective STPs. Distinct hospital scenarios were set up to evaluate how the predicted results were modified when pharmaceutical use in hospitals was allocated differently; for example, in proportion to number of beds or number of treatments in hospitals. The hospital scenarios predicted the mass flows and concentrations up to 3.9 times greater than in the domestic scenario for iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) used in computed tomography (CT), and up to 6.7 times greater for gadolinium, a contrast medium used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Field measurements showed that ICM and gadolinium were predicted best by the scenarios using number of beds or treatments in hospitals with the specific facilities (i.e., CT and/or MRI). Pharmaceuticals used both in hospitals and by the general population (e.g., cyclophosphamide, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac) were predicted best by the scenario using the number of beds in all hospitals, but the deviation from the domestic scenario values was only small. Our study demonstrated that the bed number-based hospital scenarios were effective in predicting the geographical distribution of a diverse range of pharmaceuticals in STP effluents and rivers, while the domestic scenario was similarly effective on the scale of large river-catchments.

AB To evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of ten prescription drugs against aquatic organisms from different taxonornical classes, a set of biotests were performed using the cladoceran Daphnia magna, the chlorophyte Desniodesmus subspicatus and the macrophyte Lemna minor. Endpoints were immobilisation for Daphnia and inhibition of the average growth rate for Desmodesmus and Lemna. For most of the substances, toxicities were moderate, with EC(50)s in the range from 10 to 100 mg l(-1) or even far above, whereas Lemna was the most sensitive test species in the majority of all tested compounds. Tests with combinations of various pharmaceuticals revealed stronger effects than expected from the effects measured singly. Clofibrinic acid and Carbamazepine have been found to act by a non-specific mode of action (non-polar narcosis), and with Daphnia the combination effect of these substances followed the concept of concentration addition, while in the algae test the concept of independent action could be used to calculate the mixture toxicity. The anti-inflammatory drugs Diclofenac and Ibuprofen have also been found to act unspecific by non-polar narcosis and to follow the concept of concentration addition in the algal test as well as in the Daphnia test. The measured toxicities of the tested pharmaceuticals shows that acute effect of single substances in the aquatic environment are very unlikely. But we should keep in mind that considerable combination effects can occur and that toxicity data from chronic studies are needed to assess the environmental risk of drug residues.

AB The increasing consumption of medications by humans has negative effects such as the increased disposal of these compounds in the environment. Little is known about how the disposal of a drug mix (DM) in aquatic ecosystems can affect their biota. Thus, we evaluated whether the exposure of Lithobates casteibeianus tadpoles to a DM composed of different medication classes (antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antacid drugs)at environmentally relevant concentrationsmay change their oral morphology, trigger behavioral disorders, and have mutagenic effects on erythrocyte cells. Based on our data, animals exposed to the DM showed changes in mandibular sheath pigmentation, dentition, and swimming activity, as well as atypical behavior in the social aggregation test [with co-specific and interspecific (Physalaemus cuvieri) individuals] and antipredatory defensive response deficit (chemical stimulus from Odonata larvae), after 15 exposure days. The mutagenic analysis revealed higher frequency of nuclear abnormalities in the erythrocytes of tadpoles exposed to the DM (e.g., multilobulated, blebbed, kidney-shaped, notched nucleus, binuclear, and micronucleated erythrocytes). Given the chemical complexity of the DM, we assumed that several organic functions may have been affected, either by the isolated, synergistic, antagonistic, or additive action of DM compounds. Finally, our study confirms the toxicological potential of DM in L. catesbeianus tadpoles, with emphasis to impacts that can affect the fitness of individuals and their natural populations. Thus, we suggest that more attention should be given to the disposal of medications in the environment and reinforce the need of improving water and sewage treatment systems.

AB Biosolids are a potentially valuable source of carbon and nutrients for agricultural soils; however, potential unintended impacts on human health and the environment must be considered. Virtually all biosolids contain trace amounts endocrine-disrupting chemicals derived from human use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). One potential way to reduce the bioavailability of PPCPs is to co-apply biosolids with biochar to soil, because biochar's chemical (e.g., aromaticity) and physical properties (e.g., surface area) give it a high affinity to bind many organic chemicals in the environment. We developed a soil-specific extraction method and utilized a luciferase-based bioassay (CALUX) to detect endocrine active chemicals in a biosolids-biochar co-amendment soil greenhouse study. Both biochar (walnut shell, 900 degrees C) and biosolids had positive impacts on carrot and lettuce biomass accumulation over our study period. However, the walnut shell biochar stimulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suggesting the presence of potential endocrine active chemicals in the biochar. Since the biochar rate tested (100 t ha(-1)) is above the average agronomic rate (10-20 t ha(-1)), endocrine effects would not be expected in most environmental applications. The effect of high temperature biochars on endocrine system pathways must be explored further, using both quantitative analytical tools to identify potential endocrine active chemicals and highly sensitive bioanalytical assays such as CALUX to measure the resulting biological activity of such compounds.

The exposure experiments were conducted under three conditions (5 mu g L-1 DCF, 5 mu g L-1 DCF+5 mu g L-1 IBP and 5 mu g L-1 DCF+5 mu g L-1 IBP+5 mu g L-1 NPX) in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) for 130 days. Removals of COD and NH4+-N were not affected but total nitrogen (TN) removal decreased. IBP and NPX had the high removal efficiencies (79.96% to 85.64%), whereas DCF was more persistent (57.24% to 64.12%). In addition, the decreased removals of TN remained the same under the three conditions (p > 0.05). The results of oxidizing enzyme activities, live cell percentages and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) indicated that NSAIDs damaged the cell walls or microorganisms and the mixtures of the three NSAIDs increased the toxicity. The increased Shannon-Wiener diversity index suggested that bacterial diversity was increased with the addition of selected NSAIDs. Bacterial ribosomal RNA small subunit (16S) gene sequencing results indicated that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched, while Micropruina and Nakamurella decreased with the addition of NSAIDs. The enrichment of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes indicated that both of them might have the ability to degrade NSAIDs and thereby could adapt well with the presence of NSAIDs.

AB Many soils at former industrial sites are degraded. The objective of this research was to determine the ability of compost, biosolids, and biosolids blends to improve soil ecosystem function with minimal potential impact to surface water. Treatments rototilled into the top 12.5 cm of soil were biosolids at 202 Mg ha(-1); biosolids at 404 Mg ha(-1); compost at 137 Mg ha(-1); or a blend consisting of biosolids applied at 202 Mg ha(-1), drinking water treatment residual, and biochar. Rainfall runoff from experimental plots was collected for 3 yr. One year after soil amendments were incorporated, a native seed mix containing grasses, legumes, and forbs was planted. Soil amendments improved soil quality and nutrient pools, established a dense and high-quality vegetative cover, and improved earthworm reproductive measures. Amendments increased soil enzymatic activities that support soil function. Biosolids treatments increased the Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index for grasses. For the forbs group, control plots had the lowest diversity index and the biosolids blend had the highest diversity index. Biosolids and compost increased the number of earthworm juveniles. In general, biosolids outperformed compost. Biosolids increased N and P in rainfall runoff more than compost before vegetation was established. Several microconstituents (i.e., pharmaceutical and personal care products) were detected in runoff water but at concentrations below the probable no-effect levels and therefore should pose little impact to the aquatic environment. Future restoration design should ensure that runoff control measures are used to control sediment loss from the restored sites at least until vegetation is established.

AB In order to achieve high quality water reuse, a dual membrane hybrid system (combining microtiltration-granular activated carbon (MF-GAC)) adsorption hybrid system followed by nanofiltration (NE)) was used This system's performance was evaluated in terms of organic matter, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and removal of inorganic matter. Biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSF) collected from a water reclamation plant in Sydney, Australia was used as the water source. The removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of MF-GAC strongly depends on the dose of GAC and filtration flux. MF-GAC system effectively removed hydrophobic organics (45-80%) as well as hydrophilic organics (50-80%). The removal of various PPCPs ranged from 33% to 92%, and as expected, the amount of inorganic matter removed by the MF-GAC system was very small. Hence, the NF system, as a second membrane system, was employed to polish the effluent from the MF-GAC hybrid system. The NF system rejected most of DOC (> 95%), sulfates (99%) and a substantial amount of calcium (70%), and magnesium (60%) from ME-GAC effluent. Further, more than 90% of PPCPs were removed by the NE system. Overall the dual membrane hybrid system proved to be very effective in removing organics, PPCPs and inorganic matter. The MF-GAC followed by NE results in high quality water reuse and this system can serve as an effective treatment option for water reuse schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) was used in assessing the occurrence and risk of 12 widely used antibiotics and 5 most potent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. During laboratory validation, the kinetics of pollutant uptake by POCIS were linear, and the sampling rates of most compounds were raised by flow rate and salinity, reaching the highest values at salinity 14 parts per thousand. The sampling rates varied with the target compounds with the EDCs showing the highest values (overall average = 0.123 L d(-1)), followed by chloramphenicols (0.100 L d(-1)), macrolides (0.089 L d(-1)), and finally sulfonamides (0.056 L d(-1)). Validation in the Yangtze Estuary in 2013 showed that the field sampling rates were significantly greater for all compounds except bisphenol A, in comparison to laboratory results, and high-frequency spot sampling is critical for fully validating the passive sampler. The field studies show that antibiotics were widely detected in the Yangtze Estuary, with concentrations varying from below quantification to 1613 ng L-1, suggesting their widespread use and persistence in estuarine waters. The dominating pollutants in July were sulfonamides with a total concentration of 258 ng L-1 and in October were macrolides with a total concentration of 350 ng L-1. The calculation of risk quotient suggested that sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline and erythromycin-H2O may have caused medium damage to sensitive organisms such as fish.

AB The seasonal occurrence and distribution of 69 pharmaceuticals along coastal watercourses during 6 sampling campaigns and their input through El Albujon watercourse to the Mar Menor lagoon were determined by UPLC-MS-MS, considering a total of 115 water samples. The major source of pharmaceuticals running into this watercourse was an effluent from the Los Alcazares WWTP, although other sources were also present (runoffs, excess water from irrigation, etc.). In this urban and agriculturally influenced watercourse different pharmaceutical distribution profiles were detected according to their attenuation, which depended on physicochemical water conditions, pollutant input variation, biodegradation and photodegradation rates of pollutants, etc. The less recalcitrant compounds in this study (macrolides, beta-blockers, etc.) showed a relevant seasonal variability as a consequence of dissipation processes (degradation, sorption, etc.). Attenuation was lower, however, for diclofenac, carbamazepine, lorazepam, valsartan, sulfamethoxazole among others, due to their known lower degradability and sorption onto particulate matter, according to previous studies. The maximum concentrations detected were higher than 1000 ng L-1 for azithromycin, clarithromycin, valsartan, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. These high concentration levels were favored by the limited dilution in this low flow system, and consequently some of them could pose an acute risk to the biota of this watercourse. Considering data from 2009 to 2010, it has been estimated that a total of 11.3 kg of pharmaceuticals access the Mar Menor lagoon annually through the El Albujon watercourse. The highest proportion of this input corresponded to antibiotics (46%), followed by antihypertensives (20%) and diuretics (18%). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amoxicillin (AMX) is a widely used penicillin-type antibiotic whose presence in the environment has been widely investigated, despite its rapid hydrolysis to various degradation products (DPs). In this work, the formation of AMX DPs was studied in various aqueous solutions containing 100 mu g mL(-1) AMX. Three phosphate buffer solutions, at pH 5, pH 7 and pH 8, and a fourth buffer solution at pH 7 with the addition of the bivalent ions Mg2+ and Ca-2 as chelating agents, were examined under controlled environmental conditions. In addition, two solutions from natural sources were examined secondary effluents and tap water. The obtained DPs were identified by their MS/MS, UV and NMR spectra (obtained from pure compounds isolated by preparative HPLC) as: AMX penicilloic acid (ADP1/2), AMX penilloic acid (ADP4/5) and phenol hydroxypyrazine (ADP6). Two additional detected DPs AMX 2',5'-diketopiperazine (ADP8/9), and AMX-S-oxide (ADP3) were reported and discussed in our previous publications. These DPs were then detected in secondary effluent and groundwater from a well located beneath agricultural fields continuously irrigated with secondary effluent. Concentrations in the secondary effluent were: ADP1/2, several micrograms per liter; ADP4/5, 0.15 mu g L-1, and ADP8/9, 0.5 mu g L-1. ADP6 were detected but not quantified. In the groundwater, only ADP8/9 was detected, at a concentration of 0.03 mu g L-1. The detection and quantification of DPs of other investigated drugs is recommended as an integral part of any study, method or technique dealing with pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter aquatic environments in unchanged form or as metabolites. Little is known about their potential hormonal activity, which is of particular interest due to potential long-term effects on fertility and reproduction in aquatic organisms. Moreover, there is a need to assess the combined activity of pharmaceutical mixtures. In this study, 37 pharmaceuticals have been analysed in vitro for estrogenic activity using a recombinant yeast system expressing the human estrogen receptor a. Six pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes, cimetidine, fenofibrate, furosemide, paracetamol, phenazone and tamoxifen, exhibited weak estrogenic activity. Furosemide showed an almost full concentration-response curve, whereas the other compounds showed low efficacy. The half-maximal activities of the pharmaceuticals were in the range of 0.66-25.53 mM. Furthermore, binary mixtures of furosemide and 17 beta-estradiol (132), and furosemide and phenazone, and mixtures of up to five active pharmaceuticals were assessed for their combinatory activity at different equipotent concentrations. The estrogenic activity of binary mixtures of furosemide with E2 and phenazone, respectively, followed the model of concentration addition (CA). Mixtures of other pharmaceuticals often deviated from the CA model, because extrapolations become inaccurate with only partial and non-parallel concentration-response curves having low efficacy. This demonstrates that full and parallel concentration-response curves are a prerequisite for accurate predictions of mixture activity. Our study demonstrates for the first time weak estrogenic activity in vitro of some common pharmaceuticals and their mixtures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Water pollution has become a global problem and have been identified various sources of pollution such as sewage discharge, industrial effluents and agricultural runoff and their potential has been studied in mass. From an environmental view, two approaches to dealing with water pollution are to reduce the sources and to treat the water to remove pollutants or convert them to forms that can be disposed of safely Advanced oxidation processes are widely studied for the treatment of toxic compounds; photocatalysis and radiolysis have been used in the treatment of persistent organic compounds. Radiocatalysis is a process analogous to heterogeneous photocatalysis wherein activation occurs through absorption of ionizing radiation rather than visible or ultraviolet photons. New and emerging pollutants present a new global water quality challenge with potentially-serious threats to human health and ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds are among the prime examples of emerging contaminants. Diclofenac is a prevalent anti-inflammatory drug used throughout the world. Its frequent occurrence in freshwater environments and its potential toxicity towards several organisms such as fish and mussels makes diclofenac an emerging environmental contaminant. In this work, radiocatalysis was studied as advanced oxidation process for the degradation of diclofenac. For this, commercial titanium oxide was used as catalyst. The samples were exposed to gamma radiation using an irradiator, which is provided with a Co-60 source (gamma ray energies: 1.17 and 1.33 MeV). Some variations in conditions of irradiation (doses and ambient air) were used to determine their effect in process. The effect of adding the deposited catalyst on the degradation of diclofenac was observed and some differences in both processes, photocatalysis and radiocatalysis, were found.

AB UV/chlorine is regarded as a promising advanced oxidation process (AOPs) for the abatement of micro organic pollutants, but there is still much uncertainty about the involved radical chemistry. In this study, degradation of three beta-blockers, i.e. propranolol (PRO), metoprolol (MTP) and atenolol (ATE) were investigated in UV/chlorine process. The roles of primary and secondary radicals were differentiated by various radical scavengers and kinetic modeling. Chlorine radical (Cl-center dot) played major role in beta-blocker degradation while hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) dichloride radical anion (Cl-2(center dot-)) and carbonate radical (CO3 center dot-) also made nonnegligible contributions. Bromide and chloride ions significantly facilitated the degradation of PRO but not for MTP and ATE. Ammonium and natural organic matter (NOM) inhibited the degradation of three beta-blockers, while bicarbonate showed only slight impacts. The degradation products of PRO by UV/chlorine were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF MS analysis with three new oxidation products (OPs, P290, P324 and P326-Cl) firstly reported, and thus the specific radical-based transformation pathway of PRO was proposed. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity evolution was studied by ECOSAR program, and the increased toxicity during PRO degradation was attributed to the accumulation of some toxic OPs. This study provides an insight into the important role of secondary radicals in the oxidation efficiency and toxicity evolution in the UV/chlorine process, and helps with optimization and risk control when applying the process.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of 33 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), five artificial sweeteners (ASs), and six pesticides in groundwater in rural agricultural and rural non-agricultural area in South Korea. A total of 31 target compounds (15 antibiotics, four anthelmintics, seven other PPCPs, four ASs, and one pesticide) were detected in agricultural groundwater at concentrations from not detected (ND) to 49.3 ng/L for PPCPs, ND to 1340 ng/L for ASs, and ND to 116 ng/L for pesticides. Four target compounds (two PPCPs and two ASs) were detected in rural non-agricultural groundwater in the range of 0.085-5.74 ng/L for PPCPs and 5.64-1330 ng/L for ASs. Among the target compounds, ASs, especially acesulfame (detection frequency 69% in rural agricultural areas and 100% in the rural non-agricultural area) were predominantly detected in both agricultural (mean: 32.9 ng/L) and non-agricultural (mean: 536 ng/L) groundwater, but different occurrence patterns were observed according to the sources of contamination. Knownmarkers of sewage leakagewere detected in both agricultural and non-agricultural groundwater samples (e.g., acesulfame (69% and 100%), caffeine (88% and 100%), and crotamiton (62% and 100%)), while compounds related to agricultural activities were only observed in agricultural groundwater (e.g., sulfathiazole (38%), sulfamethoxazole (31%), oxfendazole (69%), and carbofuran (42%)).

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Metformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical with very high use worldwide that is excreted in unchanged form, leading to concern about potential aquatic life impacts associated with MET, and its primary transformation product guanylurea (GUU). This study presents, in two companion papers, a risk assessment following internationally accepted guidelines of MET and GUU in surface water based on literature data, previously unpublished studies, and a new degradation test that resolves conflicting earlier results. Previous studies have shown that MET is removed during sewage treatment, primarily through transformation to GUU. In addition, measurements in WWTPs suggest that MET is not only transformed to GUU, but that GUU is further biodegraded. A prolonged inherent biodegradation test strongly suggests not only primary transformation of MET to GUU, but also subsequent full mineralization of GUU, with both degradation phases starting after a clear lag phase. MET may partition from surface water to sediment, where both transformation to GUU and in part mineralization is possible, depending on the presence of competent degrading microorganisms. In addition, MET may form non-extractable residues in sediments (12.8-73.5%). Both MET and GUU may be anaerobically degraded during sludge digestion, in soils or in sediments. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values in crops and most plants are close to 1 suggesting low bioaccumulation potential, moreover, at least some plants can metabolize MET to GUU; however, in aquatic plants higher BCFs were found, up to 53. Similarly, neither MET nor GUU are expected to bioaccumulate in fish based on estimated values of BCFs <= 3.16. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The photo-degradation process of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is studied under different conditions. Reactions were carried out under UV-H2O2, US-UV-H2O2 and US-UV-H2O2-Fe systems. An important synergistic effect between sonolysis and UV irradiation of 27.7% was quantified using the first order rate constants for carbamazepine degradation.
   An empirical model that includes the scavenger effect was applied and found to reproduce both degradation and mineralization of CBZ satisfactorily.
   Comparison experiments of scavenger-loaded conditions demonstrated that the carbamazepine photodegradation occurs mainly through a radical mechanism in two steps: during the first 10-15 min, CBZ is completely degraded, whereas TOC barely changes, confirming that intermediates are not easy to mineralize. During this phase, dissolved oxygen (DO) remains in low values and the pair O-2(center dot-)/HO2 center dot is an active contributor to CBZ degradation. Mineralization is low and the scavenger effect from center dot OH radicals is relatively high (k(scv) = 0.0014 min(-1) mM(-1)). From that moment, intermediates are formed and center dot OH radicals are responsible for increased mineralization rate with a gradual decrease in the scavenger effect (k(scv) = 0.0004 min(-1) mM(-1)).
   Experiments performed under the US-UV-H2O2-Fe system proved the important contribution of center dot OH radicals. The maximum mineralization (93% in 35 min) was reached for [Fe] = 15 ppm and [H2O2] = 680 ppm.
   A study of the flow pattern inside the reactor showed that improvement in mineralization rate with US radiation cannot be attributed to a positive effect in mixing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inhibition of mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is well characterized; major hepatic CYPs can be inhibited by drugs and other environmental contaminants. CYP function and inhibition has not yet been well established in fish yet these studies are important for several reasons. First, such studies will provide functional information for non-mammalian CYPs. Second, specific inhibitors can be used as a diagnostic tool for studying CYP-mediated reactions. Lastly, pharmaceutical mixtures are found in the aquatic environment and adverse effects associated with drug-drug interactions, including CYP inhibition by ;pharmaceuticals may be of concern. Using liver microsomes from untreated and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF)-treated rainbow trout, eight fluorescent CYP-mecliated catalytic assays were used to assess in vitro CYP inhibition by four pharmaceuticals: fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin, gemfibrozil and erythromycin. Expressed zebrafish CYP1 proteins (CYP1A, CYP1B1,CYP1C1 and CYP1C2) were assessed for inhibition with selected substrates. All pharmaceuticals decreased the metabolism of a number of substrates. Fluoxetine was the strongest and most broad inhibitor of CYP-mediated reactions in liver microsomes. Zebrafish CYP1s were strongly inhibited by erythromycin and fluoxetine. Although the pharmaceuticals are selective CYP inhibitors in mammals, inhibition across a number of substrates suggests they are broad inhibitors in fish. These data demonstrate that in vitro hepatic CYP inhibition by pharmaceuticals is possible in fish and the patterns seen here are different than what would be expected based on CYP inhibition in mammals.

AB Giving public water authorities another tool to monitor and measure levels of human waste contamination of waters simply and rapidly would enhance public protection. Most of the methods used today detect such contamination by quantifying microbes occurring in feces in high enough densities that they can be measured easily. However, most of these microbes, for example E. coli, do not serve as specific markers for any one host species and many can have origins other than feces. As an alternative, chemicals shed in feces and urine might be used to detect human waste contamination of environmental waters. One potential chemical marker of human waste is the compound urobilin. Urobilin is one of the final by- products of hemoglobin breakdown. Urobilin is excreted in both the urine and feces from many mammals, particularly humans. Source waters from 21 sites in New England, Nevada, and Michigan were extracted using hydrophilic - lipophilic balance ( HLB) cartridges and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray mass spectrometry ( HPLC - ES- MS). As a marker of human waste, urobilin was detected in many of the source waters at concentrations ranging from not detectable to 300 ng L (-1). Besides urobilin, azithromycin, an antibiotic widely prescribed for human use only in the US, was also detected in many of these waters, with concentrations ranging from not detectable to 77 ng L (-1). This methodology, using both urobilin and azithromycin ( or any other human- use pharmaceutical) could be used to give public water authorities a definitive method for tracing the sources of human waste contamination. The analysis and detection of urobilin in surface waters by HPLC - ES- MS has not been previously reported in the peer- reviewed literature.

AB Antimicrobial resistance is a major concern for human and animal health, projected to deteriorate with time and given current trends of antimicrobial usage. Antimicrobial use, particularly in healthcare and agriculture, can result in the release of antimicrobials into surface waters, promoting the development of antibiotic resistance in the environment, and potentially leading to human health risks. This study reviews relevant literature, and investigates current European and Irish antimicrobial usage trends in humans and animals, as well as potential pathways that antibiotics can take into surface waters following use. Reported levels in the aquatic environment are summarized, with particular focus on Ireland. There are relatively few studies examining Irish water bodies or sewage effluent for antibiotic residues, however, five antibiotics, namely azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and trimethoprim, have been measured in Irish waters, in concentrations predicted to select for resistance. Numerous isolates of multi-drug resistant bacteria have also been found in water bodies throughout Ireland and Europe. The value of risk assessment methodologies in understanding risks posed by antibiotic residues is reviewed including the advantages and disadvantages of specific approaches. Hazard quotient and bespoke Monte Carlo approaches are predominant risk assessment tools used to examine antimicrobial release and their complex pathways. This study highlights the need for monitoring of antimicrobial releases and the potential for resistance development, persistence and transmission while highlighting the role of risk assessment methodologies in assessing potential human and environmental health impacts.

AB Coastal wetlands are areas that suffer from great pressure. Much of it is due to the rapid development of the surrounding artificial landscapes, where socio-economic factors lead to alterations in the nearby environment, affecting the quality of natural and agricultural systems. This work analyses interconnections among landscapes under the hypothesis that urban-artificial impacts could be detected on soils and waters of an agro-ecological protected area, L'Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, located in the vicinity of the City of Valencia, Spain. The methodological framework developed addresses two types of anthropogenic pressure: (1) direct, due to artificialisation of soil covers that cause soil sealing, and (2) indirect, which are related to water flows coming from urban populations through sewage and irrigation systems and which, ultimately, will be identified by the presence of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants in waters of the protected area. For soil sealing, a methodology based on temporal comparison of two digital layers for the years 1991 and 2011, applying Geographical Information Systems and landscapes metrics, was applied. To determine presence of emerging contaminants, 21 water samples within the Natural Park were analysed applying liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of 17 pharmaceutical compounds. Results showed that both processes are present in the Natural Park, with a clear geographical pattern. Soil sealing and presence of pharmaceuticals are more intensive in the northern part of the study area. This is related to population density (detection of pharmaceuticals) and land cover conversion from agricultural and natural surfaces to artificial ones (soil sealing). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB An evaluation of measured and predicted concentrations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in surface waters of the United States and Europe was conducted to develop expected long-term exposure concentrations for this compound. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) in surface waters were identified from the literature. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were generated for European and U.S. watersheds using the GREAT-ER and PhATE (TM) models, respectively. The majority of MECs are nondetect and generally consistent with model PECs and conservative mass balance calculations. However, the highest MECs are not consistent with concentrations derived from conservative (worst-case) mass balance estimates or model PECs. A review of analytical methods suggests that tandem or high-resolution mass spectrometry methods with extract cleanup result in lower detection limits and lower reported concentrations consistent with model predictions and bounding estimates. Based on model results using PhATE and GREAT-ER, the 90th-percentile low-flow PECs in surface water are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 ng/L for the United States and Europe, respectively. These levels represent conservative estimates of long-term exposure that can be used for risk assessment purposes. Our analysis also indicates that average concentrations are one to two orders of magnitude lower than these 90th-percentile estimates. Higher reported concentrations (e.g., greater than the 99th-percentile PEC of similar to 1 ng/L) could result from methodological problems or unusual environmental circumstances; however, such concentrations are not representative of levels generally found in the environment, warrant special scrutiny, and are not appropriate for use in risk assessments of long-term exposures.

AB The present study was performed to determine the occurrence of 64 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in source water and finished water at 6 drinking water purification plants and 2 industrial water purification plants across Japan. The analytical methods employed were sample concentration using solid-phase extraction cartridges and instrumental analysis by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC/MS), or trimethylsilyl derivatization followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Thirty-seven of the 64 target substances were detected in the source water samples. The maximum concentrations in the source water were mostly below 50 ng/L except for 13 substances. In particular, residual concentrations of iopamidol (contrast agent) exceeded 1000 ng/L at most facilities. Most of the residual pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the source water samples were removed in the course of conventional and/or advanced drinking water treatments, except for 7 pharmaceuticals and 1 metabolite, i.e., amantadine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, epinastine, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, iopamidol, and oseltamivir acid. The removal ratios of the advanced water treatment processes including ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration were typically much higher than those of the conventional treatment processes. The margins of exposure estimated by the ratio of daily minimum therapeutic dose to daily intake via drinking water were substantial, and therefore the pharmacological and physiological impacts of ingesting those residual substances via drinking water would be negligible.

AB Purpose This study was designed to assess the fate and the overall potential impacts of the widely prescribed drugs ranitidine and tramadol after their introduction into the aquatic environment.
   Methods The probability to detect these two drugs in the aquatic environment was studied by analyzing their abiotic and biotic degradation properties. For this purpose, samples were irradiated with different light sources, and three widely used biodegradability tests from the OECD series, the closed bottle test (OECD 301 D), the manometric respirometry test (OECD 301 F) and the Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B), were conducted. The ecotoxicity of the photolytically formed transformation products was assessed by performing the bacterial growth inhibition test (EN ISO 10712). Furthermore, quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis and a risk analysis based on the calculation of the predicted environmental concentrations have also been conducted to assess the environmental risk potential of the transformation products. The possible formation of stable products by microbial or photolytical transformation has been investigated with DOC and LC-MS analytics.
   Results In the present study, neither ranitidine, nor tramadol, nor their photoderivatives were found to be readily or inherently biodegradable according to test guidelines. The photolytic transformation was faster under a UV lamp compared to the reaction under an Xe lamp with a spectrum that mimics sunlight. No chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for ranitidine or its photolytic decomposition products, but a low toxicity was detected for the resulting mixture of the photolytic transformation products of tramadol.
   Conclusions The study demonstrates that transformation products may have a higher environmental risk potential than the respective parent compounds.

AB Contamination of natural aquatic environments with human-use pharmaceuticals poses a significant potential threat to local ecosystems. However studies of the risk assessment of this contamination are limited, in part because Currently the environmental concentration prediction is logistically and technically difficult to perform. In this study, 1) a strategic method to determine occurrence and risk of pharmaceutical compounds in an aquatic environment is proposed, and 2) this method is applied to study ten human-use pharmaceuticals in Taiwan's Sindian river, which traverses and supplies drinking water for Taipei, a major metropolitan center. In river-water samples collected over a three-week period, concentrations of NSAIDs (acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen), steroids (estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol), the anti-hypertensive agent propranolol, and the lipid regulator gemfibrozil were found at ng/L to mu g/L levels; night-time concentrations were often doubled or even greater, compared to day-time levels. With the exception of the estrogens, predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of the target pharmaceuticals agreed well with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). Conclusions: In the Sindian river, which is impacted by both regional and hospital discharges, the pattern of pharmaceutical Occurrences and concentrations observed here is due to variations in source release rather than to natural attenuation phenomena. In addition, the environmental risk posed by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and the estrogens was observed to be imminent, while risk from the other drugs targeted was found to be lower, even when maximum MECs were considered.

AB With questions emerging on the presence and risks associated with metabolites and transformation products (TPs) of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment, progress has been made in terms of monitoring and regulation of pesticide metabolites. However, less interest is shown for pharmaceutical residues, although their pseudo-persistence and adverse effects on non-target organisms are proven. This study provides original knowledge about the contamination of ten sites located along three French rivers (water, sediments, biofilms, clams) by pharmaceutical metabolites and TPs, as well as a preliminary environmental risk assessment. Studied compounds included carbamazepine with five metabolites and TPs, and diclofenac with three metabolites and TPs. Results show that metabolites and TPs are present in all studied compartments, with mean concentrations up to 0.52 mu g L-1 in water, 229 ng g-1 in sediments, 2153 ng g-1 in biofilms, and 1149 ng g-1 in clams. QSAR estimations (OECD toolbox) were involved to predict the studied compounds ecotoxicities. QSAR models showed that diclofenac and its metabolites and TPs could be more toxic than carbamazepine and its metabolites and TPs to three aquatic species representing green algae, invertebrates, and fish. However, real ecotoxicological effects are still to be determined. The environmental risk assessment showed that hydroxydiclofenac, 2-[(2-chlorophenyl)-amino]benzaldehyde and dibenzazepine could present a greater risk than other studied compounds for aquatic organisms. In addition, the risk associated with a mixture of diclofenac and its related metabolites and TPs has been found to be greater than that of the compounds considered individually.

AB This study investigated, for the first time, the occurrence and fate of 29 multiple-class pharmaceuticals (PhACs) in two source separated sanitation systems based on: (i) batch experiments for the anaerobic digestion (AD) of fecal sludge under mesophilic (37 `C) and thermophilic (52 "C) conditions, and (ii) a full-scale blackwater treatment plant using wet composting and sanitation with urea addition. Results revealed high concentrations of PhACs in raw fecal sludge and blackwater samples, with concentrations up to hundreds of pg L-1 and fig kg-1 dry weight (dw) in liquid and solid fractions, respectively. For mesophilic and thermophilic treatments in the batch experiments, average PhACs removal rates of 31% and 45%, respectively, were observed. The average removal efficiency was slightly better for the full-scale blackwater treatment, with 49% average removal, and few compounds, such as atenolol, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, showed almost complete degradation. In the AD treatments, no significant differences were observed between mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. For the full-scale blackwater treatment, the aerobic wet composting step proved to be the most efficient in PhACs reduction, while urea addition had an almost negligible effect for most PhACs, except for citalopram, venlafaxine, oxazepam, valsartan and atorvastatin, for which minor reductions (on average 25%) were observed. Even though both treatment systems reduced initial PhACs loads considerably, significant PhAC concentrations remained in the treated effluents, indicating that fecal sludge and blackwater fertilizations could be a relevant vector for dissemination of PhACs into agricultural fields and thus the environment.

AB Different carbon xerogels (CXs) were synthesized by the polymerization of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) catalyzed by cesium carbonate (Cs), and by varying the molar ratio R/Cs. The CXs were labeled as XCs-100, XCs-500, XCs-1000, and XCS-2000, corresponding to the R/Cs ratio of 100, 500, 1000, and 2000, respectively. The surface chemistry of the CXs varied very slightly with the R/Cs ratio because the point of zero charge (pH(PZC)) and the concentrations of basic and acid sites were almost independent on the R/Cs ratio. The surface areas of the four CXs decreased slightly by increasing the R/Cs ratio; however, XCs-500 presented the highest volume of pores and mesopores and mesopore surface area. At a concentration of diclofenac (DCF) at equilibrium of 800 mg/L, the adsorption capacities of XCs-100, XCs-500, XCs-1000, and XCs-2000 towards DCF in aqueous solution were 132.0, 184.6, 126.5, and 126.4 mg/g, respectively. Hence, the adsorption capacity of XCs-500 was about 1.4 times larger than those of the other CXs. The adsorption capacity of XCs-500 was reduced by increasing the solution pH due to electrostatic interactions, whereas the adsorption capacity was increased by raising the temperature, confirming that the adsorption was endothermic. The bacteria Escherichia coli adhered to the surface of XCs-500 forming a biofilm, and the presence of bacteria enhanced 1.3 times the adsorption capacity of XCs-500 towards DCF from water solutions.

AB Cytostatic drugs are compounds used to treat cancer, one of the deadliest diseases worldwide with a rising yearly incidence. However, the occurrence and concentrations of a large number of cytostatics in waters and waste-waters are unknown. Thus, this study sought to analyze the concentrations of these compounds in different aquatic environments worldwide to assess the risk that these compounds pose to aquatic organisms. The top five most monitored cytostatics in aquatic environments are fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Risk quotients (RQs) based on maximum reported measured concentrations revealed that mycophenolic acid and tamoxifen pose a high risk to aquatic organisms (ROmax >=( )1) at concentrations observed in surface waters. Moreover, methotrexate and tegafur were categorized as moderate risk compounds, and bicalutamide was found to pose a low risk. Importantly, the available analytical methodologies for the quantification of some cytostatics (e.g., cisplatin, fluorouracil, daunorubicin, imatinib, and mycophenolic acid) in water could not rule out potential risk to aquatic biota, since estimated risks for these compounds using the lowest method detection limits reported in the literature (RQ MDL) were all >= 0.01 (i.e., low risk or higher). Moreover, risks based on predicted concentrations (RQ PEC) were consistently lower than those based on measured concentrations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment based on measured values. Thus, accurate and sensitive analytical methods are crucial to identify and quantify cytostatic exposure in aquatic ecosystems in order to preserve biodiversity and ensure a safer environment.

AB The emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals posed high risk and much uncertainty to eco-environment and human health. An analytical method, developed for the simultaneous determination of five steroid estrogens in groundwater and soil based upon solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was applied to investigate the distribution of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol around Shenyang City with particular focus on penetrating from surface to groundwater in this study. Mean concentrations of the estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were 55.1 ng L-1 and 56.1 ng L-1 in groundwater, 32.5 ng g(-1) and 23.1 ng g(-1) in soil, respectively. The distribution of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were similar in groundwater, the concentration in the west of the site center was relatively low, and the surroundings were relatively high. The concentration of estrone was changed less, but 17 beta-estradiol was significantly increased in silt and silty sand layers in vadose zone profiles. Both estrone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations changed abruptly at the interface of layers. Incorporating the temporal and spatial evolution of physical-chemical-biological environmental parameters at the sites, sorption and biodegradation were suggested the controlling roles in the fate and transport of SEs in the soil-groundwater system. The Ecological risk quotients values of both soil and groundwater indicated a very high ecological risk associated with SEs, but the non-carcinogenic harm quotients did not exceed the acceptable level of non-carcinogenic human health risk.

AB In this work we have investigated in details the process of degradation of the 4-amino-6-chlorobenzene-1,3-disulfonamide (ABSA), stable hydrolysis product of frequently used pharmaceutical hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), as one of the most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water. The study encompassed investigation of degradation by hydrolysis, photolysis, and photocatalysis employing commercially available TiO2 Degussa P25 catalyst. The process of direct photolysis and photocatalytic degradation were investigated under different type of lights. Detailed insights into the reactive properties of HCTZ and ABSA have been obtained by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, preference of HCTZ towards hydrolysis was confirmed experimentally and explained using computational study. Results obtained in this study indicate very limited efficiency of hydrolytic and photolytic degradation in the case of ABSA, while photocatalytic degradation demonstrated great potential. Namely, after 240 min of photocatalytic degradation, 65% of ABSA was mineralizated in water/TiO2 suspension under SSI, while the nitrogen was predominantly present as NH4+. Reaction intermediates were studied and a number of them were detected using LC-ESI-MS/MS. This study also involves toxicity assessment of HCTZ, ABSA, and their mixtures formed during the degradation processes towards mammalian cell lines (rat hepatoma, H-4-II-E, human colon adenocarcinoma, HT-29, and human fetal lung, MRC-5). Toxicity assessments showed that intermediates formed during the process of photocatalysis exerted only mild cell growth effects in selected cell lines, while direct photolysis did not affect cell growth.

AB This study analyses the presence of 17 cytostatic agents from seven different groups, based on their different mechanisms of action, in the effluent from a medium-sized hospital located in eastern Spain. Analysis of the compounds found in the effluents studied involved solidphase extraction (SPE) coupled on-line to a high performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). The environmental risk of the compounds studied was then assessed by calculating the hazard quotient (HQ), combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs). In addition, the environmental hazard associated was evaluated in accordance with their intrinsic characteristics by calculating the PBT (Persistence Bioaccumulation Toxicity) index. The results of this study showed the presence of seven of the 17 compounds analysed in a range of between 25 and 4761 ng/L. The highest concentrations corresponded to ifosfamide (58-4761 ng/L), methotrexate (394-4756 ng/L) and cyclophosphamide (46-3000 ng/L).
   Assessment of the environmental hazard showed that the three hormonal agents (tamoxifen and its metabolites endoxifen and hydroxytamoxifen) exhibited a maximum PBT value of 9 due to their inherent harm to the environment resulting from their characteristics of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.
   A combined evaluation of the risk and environmental hazard showed that three of the 17 compounds studied, namely, ifosfamide, imatinib and irinotecan, all of which exhibited HQ values higher than 10 and PBT indices of 6, indicative of a particularly high potential to harm the environment, deserve special attention.

AB Depurated effluents can be employed as reclaimed water for irrigation in regions with low precipitations, while nutrients-rich biosolids are usually applied as fertilizer for agricultural purposes. However, both practices may result in the accumulation of micropollutants in the soil compartment, the contamination of groundwater, and/or their biotransfer to different living organisms until they finally may reach human receptors. The fate and transport of seven pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) with different physicochemical properties was analysed for these scenarios employing two different models: the buckets model and the HYDRUS-1D software package. The results indicated that these compounds have a low potential to contaminate groundwater in the type of soil under study (silty loam), although triclosan tended to accumulate in the top layers of the soil. Similar conclusions were reached through both models, although they predicted different solute plant uptake and accumulation patterns of the evaluated compounds. Therefore, the buckets model can be considered as an adequate option to perform a screening level assessment of these compounds. However, HYDRUS-1D could provide more information on the fate of pharmaceuticals in soil, thus contributing to reduce the uncertainty already associated to PPCPs. Additionally, the significant difference of the Hazard Index (HI) obtained from a human health risk assessment performed using the estimated soil concentrations from both models also contributed to recommend the use of a model that considers all the relevant mechanisms of mass transfer to reduce overestimation of risk.

AB Steroidal and non-steroidalanti-inflammatories are pharmaceutical prescribed in human medicine and have the potential to contaminate water and sediments via inputs from sewage treatment plants. Their impacts on humans and ecosystems are emerging issues in environmental health. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of diclofenac and dexamethasone in male fish Hoplias malabaricus after trophic exposure. Fish were fed twice every week with Astyanax sp. submitted to intraperitoneal inoculation with diclofenac (0; 0.2; 2.0 or 20.0 mu g/kg) or dexamethasone (0; 0.03; 03 or 3.0 mu g/kg). After 12 doses, blood was collected for testosterone dosage. The gonad and liver were collected to calculate gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Antioxidants enzymes activity and biotransformation were also evaluated in liver and gonads. In liver, diclofenac caused oxidative stress with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipoperoxidation (LPO). The GST activity was reduced by diclofenac in liver. Trophic exposure of H. malabaricus to dexamethasone caused an increase in antioxidant system (GPx, CAT, GST, and GSH) and LPO in liver. However, it reduced antioxidant system (GPX and GST activities and GSH) in gonads. Both diclofenac and dexamethasone reduced the levels of testosterone, causing impairment to reproduction. Diclofenac reduced HSI at the 0.2 mu g/kg, but not GSI. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and dexamethasone caused oxidative stress and reduced testosterone levels that can have a negative impact in aquatic organisms.

AB The application of sewage sludge to land can expose soils to a range of associated chemical toxicants. In this paper we explore the effects of the broad spectrum anti-microbial compound triclosan on the phenotypic composition of the microbial communities of three soils of contrasting texture (loamy sand, sandy loam and clay) using phospholipid fatty-acid (PLFA) analysis. Each soil type was dosed and subsequently re-dosed 6 weeks later with triclosan at five nominal concentrations in microcosms (10, 100, 500, 1000 mg kg(-1) and a zero-dose control). PLFA profiles were analysed using multivariate statistics focussing on changes in the soil phenotypic community structure. Additionally, ratios of fungal:bacterial PLFA indicators and cyclo:mono-unsaturated PLFAs (a common stress indicator) were calculated. It was hypothesised that triclosan addition would alter the community structure in each soil with a particular effect on the fungal:bacterial ratio, since bacteria are likely to be more susceptible to triclosan than fungi. It was also hypothesised that the PLFA response to re-dosing would be suppressed due to acclimation. Although the microbial community structure changed over the course of the experiment, the response was complex. Soil type and time emerged as the most important explanatory factors. Principal component analysis was used to detect phenotypic responses to different doses of triclosan in each soil. As expected, there was a significant increase in the fungal:bacterial ratio with triclosan dose especially in treatments with the highest nominal concentrations. Furthermore, the PLFA response to re-dosing was negligible in all soils confirming the acclimation hypothesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photodecomposition might be regarded as one of the most important abiotic factors affecting the fate of UV absorbing compounds in the environment and photocatalysis has been suggested as an effective method to degrade organic pollutants. However. UV filters transformation appears to be a complex process, barely addressed to date. The white rot fungus Trametes versicolor is considered as a promising alternative to conventional aerobic bacterial degradation, as it is able to metabolise a wide range of xenobiotics. This study focused on both degradation processes of two widely used UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and benzophenone-1 (BP1). Fungal treatment resulted in the degradation of more than 99% for both sunscreens in less than 24 h, whereas photodegradation was very inefficient, especially for BP3, which remained unaltered upon 24 h of simulated sunlight irradiation. Analysis of metabolic compounds generated showed BP1 as a minor by-product of BP3 degradation by T. versicolor while the main intermediate metabolites were glycoconjugate derivatives. BP1 and BP3 showed a weak, but significant estrogenic activity (EC50 values of 0.058 mg/L and 12.5 mg/L, respectively) when tested by recombinant yeast assay (RYA), being BP1 200-folds more estrogenic than BP3. Estrogenic activity was eliminated during T. versicolor degradation of both compounds, showing that none of the resulting metabolites possessed significant estrogenic activity at the concentrations produced. These results demonstrate the suitability of this method to degrade both sunscreen agents and to eliminate estrogenic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, and the concerns for negative effects on aquatic organisms, has gained increasing attention over the last years. As ecotoxicity data are lacking for most active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), it is important to identify strategies to prioritise APIs for ecotoxicity testing and environmental monitoring. We have used nine previously proposed prioritisation schemes, both risk- and hazard-based, to rank 582 APIs. The similarities and differences in overall ranking results and input data were compared. Moreover, we analysed how well the methods ranked seven relatively well-studied APIs. It is concluded that the hazard-based methods were more successful in correctly ranking the well-studied APIs, but the fish plasma model, which includes human pharmacological data, also showed a high success rate. The results of the analyses show that the input data availability vary significantly: some data, such as logP, are available for most API while information about environmental concentrations and bioconcentration are still scarce. The results also suggest that the exposure estimates in risk-based methods need to be improved and that the inclusion of effect measures at first-tier prioritisation might underestimate risks. It is proposed that in order to develop an adequate prioritisation scheme, improved data on exposure such as degradation and sewage treatment removal and bioconcentration ability should be further considered. The use of ATC codes may also be useful for the development of a prioritisation scheme that includes the mode of action of pharmaceuticals and, to some extent, mixture effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals may be released to the soil environment through the application of biosolidsbiosolids. To understand those factors affecting the persistence of pharmaceuticals in the soil environment, the present study was performed to assess the effects of soil type, the presence of biosolids, and the impact of chemical mixture interactions on the degradation of three pharmaceuticals: naproxen, carbamazepine, and fluoxetine. Single-compound studies showed that naproxen degraded in a range of soils with half-lives ranging from 3.1 to 6.9 d and in biosolids with a half-life of 10.2 d. No relationships were observed between degradation rate and soil physicochemical properties and soil bioactivity. For naproxen, addition of biosolids to soils reduced the degradation rate observed in the soil-only studies, with half-lives in the soil-biosolid systems ranging from 3.9 to 15.1 d. Carbamazepine and fluoxetine were found to be persistent in soils, biosolids, and soil-biosolid mixtures. When degradation was assessed using a mixture of the three study compounds and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine, the degradation behavior of fluoxetine and carbamazepine was similar to that observed in the single compound studies (i.e., no degradation). However, the degradation rate of naproxen in soils, biosolids, and soil-biosolid systems spiked with the mixture was significantly slower than in the single-compound studies. As degradation studies for risk assessment purposes are performed using single substances in soil-only studies, it is possible that current risk assessment procedures will underestimate environmental impacts. Further work is therefore warranted on a larger range of substances, soils, biosolid types, and chemical mixtures to better understand the fate of pharmaceuticals in terrestrial systems.

AB Fluoxetine, the active ingredient of many antidepressants, was identified as specifically toxic toward algae in a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis with literature data for algae, daphnia, and fish. The goal of this study was to elucidate the mode of action in algae and to evaluate the toxicity of the major human metabolites of fluoxetine using two different algae tests. The time dependence and sensitivity of the different effect endpoints yield information on the physiological mode of action. Baseline toxicity was predicted with QSARs based on measured liposome-water partition coefficients. The ratio of predicted baseline toxicity to experimental toxicity (toxic ratio TR) gives information on the intrinsic potency (extent of specificity of effect). The metabolite p-trifluoromethyl phenol was classified to act as baseline toxicant Fluoxetine (TR 60-150) and its pharmacologically active metabolite norfluoxetine (TR 10-80) exhibited specific toxicity. By comparison with reference compounds we conclude that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have an effect on the energy budget of algal cells since the time pattern of these two compounds is most similar to that observed for norflurazon, but they act less specifically as indicated by lower TR values and the similarity of the effect pattern to baseline toxicants, The mixture toxicity of fluoxetine and its human metabolites norfluoxetine and p-TFMP can be predicted using the model of concentration addition for practical purposes of risk assessment despite small deviations from this model for the specific endpoints like PSII inhibition because the integrative endpoints like growth rate and reproduction in all cases gave agreement with the predictions for concentration addition.

AB The residues of antimicrobials used in human and veterinary medicine are popular pollutants of anthropogenic origin. The main sources of introducing antimicrobials into the environment are sewage treatment plants and the agricultural industry. Antimicrobials in animal manure contaminate the surrounding soil as well as groundwater, and can be absorbed by plants. The presence of antimicrobials in food of plant origin may pose a threat to human health due to their high biological activity. As part of the research, a procedure was developed for the extraction and determination of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, cefuroxime, nalidixic acid and metronidazole in environmental samples (soil and parsley root). An optimized solid-liquid extraction (SLE) method was used to separate antimicrobials from the solid samples and a mixture of citrate buffer (pH = 4): methanol (1:1; v/v) was used as the extraction solvent. Solid phase extraction (SPE) with OASIS(R) HLB cartridges was used to purify and pre-concentrate the sample. The recovery of the developed method was in the range of 55-108%. Analytes were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an ultraviolet (UV) detector and a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-UV-MS/MS). The procedure was validated and applied to the determination of selected antimicrobials in soil and parsley root samples. Five types of soil and five types of parsley roots of different origins were analyzed. The presence of nalidixic acid in the parsley root samples was found in the concentration range of 0.14-0.72 ng g(-1). It has been shown that antimicrobials are absorbed by the plant and can accumulate antimicrobials in its edible parts.

AB Soil amendment with organic fertilizers is an effective approach to improve soil fertility. However, organic fertilizers may contain pollutants such as trace elements (TEs) and antibiotics (ABs), which, once deployed in arable soil, can be taken up by vegetables and have adverse effects on crops and human health. This study assesses the presence of 15 TEs and 16 ABs in lettuce grown in a greenhouse facility and amended with 3 different organic fertilizers (sewage sludge (SS), organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), and swine manure (SM)) at 3 different fertilization doses. The results show that lettuces amended with SS resulted in the lowest content of TEs. Although 11 ABs were detected in the SM and SS fertilizers, only 3 ABs were detected in lettuce leaves. The concentrations of detected ABs in lettuce ranged from 0.67 ng/g fw (lincomycin) to 14.2 ng/g fw (ciprofloxacin) in SS. The organic fertilization dose did not affect the lettuce uptake of TEs or ABs. Moreover, the use of SS resulted in the highest lettuce yield of the organic amendments. The total hazard quotients (THQs) obtained for TEs and ABs were less than 1 for all the studied fertilization treatments. The highest THQs for TEs were observed in lettuce amended with SM (0.11-0.16), whereas the highest THQs for ABs were observed in SS treatments (0.06-0.09). The results thus suggest that consumption of lettuces amended with organic fertilizers would not pose a risk to human health due to the presence of studied TEs or ABs, but potentially harmful combined effects cannot ruled out.

AB With increasing attention toward novel sterilization methods, plasma sterilization has gained more and more interest. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. In this paper, we investigated the inactivation of Escherichia coli using dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in saline water. There were three processes shown in the survival curve, namely, during the preparation period, the reaction period, and the saturation period. Observations under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and detection by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) supplied adequate details regarding these processes. Based on these results, we infer that during the preparation period, the main process is the accumulation of chemical substances. During the reaction period, adequate amounts of chemicals decompose and denature cell membranes and macromolecules to kill bacteria in large quantities. During the saturation period, the killing effect decreases because of the protection by clustered cells and the saturation of pH. This study of sterilizing processes systematically reveals the mechanisms of plasma sterilization.
   IMPORTANCE Compared with traditional methods, plasma sterilization has advantages of high efficiency, easy operation, and environmental protection. This may be more suitable for air and sewage sterilization in specific spaces, such as hospitals, laboratories, and pharmaceutical factories. However, the mechanisms of sterilization are still relatively unknown, especially for bactericidal activities. Knowledge of sterilization processes provides guidance for practical applications. For example, the bactericidal action mainly occurs during the reaction period, and the treatment time can be set based on the reaction period, which could save a lot of energy. The results of this study will help to improve the efficiency of plasma sterilization devices.

AB The present work illustrates the development of an analytical method, based on offline solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-electron spray ionisation-single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceuticals belonging to various therapeutic classes (analgesics/anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, antibiotics, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, psychomotor stimulants, glucocorticoid steroids, disinfectants, beta-blockers, H2 receptor antagonists and oestrogens) in surface waters. The method developed was applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters from different sampling points along the aquatic systems of Lake Pamvotis and the River Kalamas, close to the city of Ioannina (Epirus, Greece), while the monitoring programme was carried out during the four seasons of the year. According to the results obtained, the majority of the compounds were detected in discrepant concentrations. The concentrations for all the compounds ranged from levels below quantification limit to 3506ng/L, with caffeine and salicylic acid being the ubiquitous compounds. The results of the monitoring contributed substantially to the knowledge on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in Greece and more specifically in surface waters of the region of Epirus. Regarding the environmental risk due to the presence of target compounds in surface waters, this was estimated calculating risk quotients (RQs) for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish). The results denoted a possible threat for the aquatic environment, rendering in this way the RQ method as a helpful tool for a first approach. Extensive study is needed for triclosan, salicylic acid, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin in order to better correlate their occurrence and potential toxic effects in aquatic life and humans.

AB Purpose The present research aims to optimize the removal of ibuprofen (IBP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drug from the aqueous solution using a synthesized magnetic carbon-iron nanocomposite, and to investigate the individual and combined effects of the independent process variables.
   Method Combining the adsorptive capability of carbon and magnetic property of iron, a carbon-iron nanocomposite was synthesized. A four-factor Box-Behnken experimental design-based optimization modeling was performed for maximizing the removal of IBP from water by the nanocomposite using the batch experimental data. A quadratic model was built to predict the responses. Significance of the process variables and their interactions was tested by the analysis of variance and t test statistics.
   Results The experimental maximum removals of IBP from the aqueous solution by carbon and magnetic nanocomposite were 14.74% and 60.39%, respectively. The model predicted maximum removal of 65.81% under the optimum conditions of the independent variables (IBP concentration 80 mg/l; temperature 48 degrees C; pH 2.50; dose 0.6 g/l) was very close to the experimental value (65.12 +/- 0.92%). pH of the solution exhibited most significant effect on IBP adsorption.
   Conclusion The developed magnetic nanocomposite was found superior than its precursor carbon exhibiting higher removal of IBP from the water and can be easily separated from the aqueous phase under temporary external magnetic field. The developed magnetic nanocomposite may be used for an efficient removal of IBP from the water.

AB Antibiotics and antibiotic metabolites have been found in the environment, but the biological activities of these compounds are uncertain, especially given the low levels that are typically detected in the environment. The objective of this study was to estimate the selection potential of chlortetracycline (CTC on the antibiotic resistance of aerobic bacterial populations in a simulated river water ecosystem. Six replicates of a 10-day experiment using river water in continuous flow chemostat systems were conducted. Each replicate used three chemostats, one serving as a control to which no antibiotic was added and the other two receiving low and high doses of CTC (8 mu g/liter and 800 mu g/liter, respectively). The addition of CTC to the chemostats did not impact the overall level of cultivable aerobic bacteria (P = 0.51). The high-CTC chemostat had significantly higher tetracycline-resistant bacterial colony counts than both the low-CTC and the control chemostats (P < 0.035). The differences in resistance between the low-CTC and control chemostats were highly nonsignificant (P = 0.779). In general a greater diversity of tet resistance genes was detected in the high-CTC chemostat and with a greater frequency than in the low-CTC and control chemostats. Low levels of CTC in this in vitro experiment did not select for increased levels of tetracycline resistance among cultivable aerobic bacteria. This finding should not be equated with the absence of environmental risk, however. Low concentrations of antibiotics in the environment may select for resistant bacterial populations once they are concentrated in sediments or other locations.

AB Antibiotics, such as sulfirdiazine, reach agricultural soils directly through manure of grazing livestock or indirectly through the spreading of manure or sewage sludge on the field. Knowledge about the fate of antibiotics in soils is crucial for assessing the environmental risk of these compounds, including possible transport to the groundwater. Transport of C-14-labelled sulfadiazine was investigated in disturbed soil columns at a constant flow rate of 0.26 cm h(-1) near saturation. Sulfadiazine was applied in different concentrations for either a short or a long pulse duration. Breakthrough curves of sulfadiazine and the nonreactive tracer chloride were measured. At the end of the leaching period the soil concentration profiles were determined. The peak maxima of the breakthrough curves were delayed by a factor of 2 to 5 compared to chloride and the decreasing limbs are characterized by an extended tailing. However, the maximum relative concentrations differed as well as the eluted mass fractions, ranging from 18 to 83% after 500 h of leaching. To identify relevant sorption processes, breakthrough curves of sulfadiazine were fitted with a convective-dispersive transport model, considering different sorption concepts with one, two and three sorption sites. Breakthrough curves can be fitted best with a three-site sorption model, which includes two reversible kinetic and one irreversible sorption site. However, the simulated soil concentration profiles did not match the observations for all of the used models. Despite this incomplete process description, the obtained results have implications for the transport behavior of sulfadiazine in the field. Its leaching may be enhanced if it is frequently applied at higher concentrations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is a major issue for marine and coastal environments in the proximity of urban areas. The occurrence of EDCs in the Pearl River Delta region is well documented but specific data related to Macao is unavailable. The levels of bisphenol-A (BPA), estrone (E1), 17 alpha-estradiol (alpha E2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) were measured in sediment samples collected along the coastline of Macao. BPA was found in all 45 collected samples with lower BPA concentrations associated to the presence of mangrove trees. Biodegradation assays were performed to evaluate the capacity of the microbial communities of the surveyed ecosystems to degrade BPA and its analogue BPS. Using sediments collected at a WWTP discharge point as inoculum, at a concentration of 2 mg l(-1) complete removal of BPA was observed within 6 days, whereas for the same concentration BPS removal was of 95% after 10 days, which is particularly interesting since this compound is considered recalcitrant to biodegradation and likely to accumulate in the environment. Supplementation with BPA improved the degradation of bisphenol-S (BPS). Aiming at the isolation of EDCs-degrading bacteria, enrichments were established with sediments supplied with BPA, BPS, E2 and EE2, which led to the isolation of a bacterial strain, identified as Rhodoccoccus sp. ED55, able to degrade the four compounds at different extents. The isolated strain represents a valuable candidate for bioremediation of contaminated soils and waters.

AB A large amount of pharmaceuticals are flushed to environment via sewage system. The compounds are persistent in environment and are very difficult to remove in drinking water treatment processes. Degradation of fluoxetine (FLU) and fluvoxamine (FLX) by ferrate(VI) were investigated. For the 10?mg/L of FLU and FLX, 35% and 50% of the compounds were degraded in the presence of 50?mg/L FeO42? within 10 minutes, respectively. After 10 minutes of the reaction, degradation of FLU and FLX is affected by formation of by-products which were likely more reactive with ferrate and competed in the reaction with FeO42?. In the case of FLU, the identified degradation by-products were hydrofluoxetine, N-methyl-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine, 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol and 1-{[(1R,S)-1-Phenyl-2-propen-1-yl]oxy}-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene. In the case of FLX, the degradation by-products were fluvoxamine acid and 5-methoxy-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pent-2-en-1-imine. The results of the ecotoxicological study based on protozoa Spirostomum ambiguum have shown that 50?mg/L FeO42? reduced toxicity of 10?mg/L of FLU and FLX by around 50%. However, in the case of FLX, the results of the ecotoxicological study suggested formation of slightly more toxic compound(s) than FLX during reaction with FeO42?. Application of ferrate(VI) is a viable option for drinking water treatment process; however, caution is needed due to formation of by-products with unknown human health risk.

AB The occurrence of 36 pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water of the Xiangjiang River was investigated in twoseasons (n=38). Twenty-five of these compoundswere detected, with cefotaxime (maximum concentration 830 ng L-1) the most abundant compound followed by amoxicillin (maximum concentration 710 ng L-1). The spatiotemporal distribution was observed; indicating that pollution hotspots were mostly located in economically developed and densely populated regions such as Changsha City. Lower concentrations were found in summer than winter, which may be attributed to the dilution effect of a flood event and higher water temperatures. The distribution of pharmaceuticals was significantly correlated with temperature and ammonia nitrogen content. A principal component analysis-multiple linear regression model estimated that domestic sewage was the main source of pharmaceuticals, although the source composition varied among different sampling sites. Risk assessment was conducted using both individual and mixture models for preliminary identification of potential hazards. Sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, and azithromycin posed a high risk to algae, while sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and erythromycin-H2O showed a medium risk to invertebrates. Moreover, the mixture risk quotients calculated using a concentration additionmodel ranged from 0.31 to 9.60 in winter, and from 0.06 to 0.61 in summer, indicating a potential risk to the aquatic environment. This study provides scientific support to policy-makers to establish contaminant management priorities and enriches the global data on emerging contaminants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transport of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals in soils and consequent ground-water contamination are influenced by many factors, including compound sorption on soil particles. Here we evaluate the sorption isotherms for 7 pharmaceuticals on 13 soils, described by Freundlich equations, and assess the impact of soil properties on various pharmaceuticals' sorption on soils. Sorption of ionizable pharmaceuticals was, in many cases, highly affected by soil pH. The sorption coefficient of sulfamethoxazole was negatively correlated to soil pH, and thus positively related to hydrolytic acidity and exchangeable acidity. Sorption coefficients for clindamycin and clarithromycin were positively related to soil pH and thus negatively related to hydrolytic acidity and exchangeable acidity, and positively related to base cation saturation. The sorption coefficients for the remaining pharmaceuticals (trimethoprim, metoprolol, atenolol, and carbamazepine) were also positively correlated with the base cation saturation and cation exchange capacity. Positive correlations between sorption coefficients and clay content were found for clindamycin, clarithromycin, atenolol, and metoprolol. Positive correlations between sorption coefficients and organic carbon content were obtained for trimethoprim and carbamazepine. Pedotransfer rules for predicting sorption coefficients of various pharmaceuticals included hydrolytic acidity (sulfamethoxazole), organic carbon content (trimethoprimand carbamazepine), base cation saturation (atenolol and metoprolol), exchangeable acidity and clay content (clindamycin), and soil active pH and clay content (clarithromycin). Pedotransfer rules, predicting the Freundlich sorption coefficients, could be applied for prediction of pharmaceutical mobility in soils with similar soil properties. Predicted sorption coefficients together with pharmaceutical half-lives and other imputes (e.g., soil-hydraulic, geological, hydro-geological, climatic) may be used for assessing potential ground-water contamination.

AB There is an increasing need to monitor concentrations of polar organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Integrative passive samplers can be used to assess time weighted average aqueous concentrations, provided calibration data are available and sampling rates are known. The sampling rate depends on environmental factors, such as temperature and water flow rate. Here we introduce an apparatus to investigate the sampling properties of passive samplers using river-like flow conditions and ambient environmental matrices: river water and treated sewage effluent. As a model sampler we selected Empore (TM) SDB-RPS disks in a Chemcatcher housing. The disks were exposed for I to 8 days at flow rates between 0.03 and 0.4 m s(-1). Samples were analysed using a bioassay for estrogenic activity and by LC-MS-NIS target analysis of the pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and clarithromycin. In order to assess sampling rates of SDB disks, we also measured aqueous concentrations of the pharmaceuticals. Sampling rates increased with increasing flow rate and this relationship was not affected by the environmental matrix. However, SDB disks were only sampling in the integrative mode at low flow rates < 0.1 m s(-1) and/or for short sampling times. The duration of linear uptake was particularly short for sulfamethoxazole (1 day) and longer for clarithromycin (5 days). At 0.03 m s(-1) and 12-14 degrees C, the sampling rate of SDB disks was 0.09 L day(-1) for clarithromycin, 0.14 L day(-1) for sulfamethoxazole and 0.25 L day(-1) for carbamazepine. The results show that under controlled conditions, SDB disks can be effectively used as passive sampling devices.

AB The current problem related to the supply of drinking water for the metropolitan area of Monterrey, which comprises of five million inhabitants, and the important role played by theEl CuchilloDam, found downstream of the Santa Catarina River basin as a surface source of drinking water for the city, renders this river an interesting site for assessment. This work evaluates the degree to which the surface water and the subsoil of the river are affected by emerging organic pollutants due to their existence, even at low concentrations, representing a toxic risk enhanced by the absence of stricter standards for regulating these substances. Based on fieldwork, three discharge points that could affect the quality of the surface water were selected: two points on the river stream, and three groundwater wells. Gas chromatography results showed the presence of BisPhenol A (BPA) and bis(2-EthylHexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) in both the surface water and subsoil at different seasons of the year. The highest concentration levels in the samples taken from both types of water were 0.9 and 60 mu g L(-1)for BPA and DEHP, respectively. Results of this research did not reveal the level at which the aquifer is affected by these substances.

AB Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used pharmaceuticals, and due to its inefficient removal by conventional wastewater treatment, it can be found in natural surface waters at high concentrations. Recently, we demonstrated that the TpBD-(CF3)(2)covalent organic framework (COF) can adsorb ibuprofen from ultrapure water with high efficiency. Here, we investigate the performance of the COF for the extraction of ibuprofen from natural water samples from a lake, river, and estuary. In general, the complexity of the natural water matrix induced a reduction in the adsorption efficiency of ibuprofen as compared to ultrapure water. The best performance, with over 70% adsorption efficiency, was found in lake water, the sample which featured the lowest pH. According to the theoretical calculations, ibuprofen more favorably interacts with the COF pores in the protonated form, which could partially account for the enhanced adsorption efficiency found in lake water. In addition, we explored the effect of the presence of competing pharmaceuticals, namely, acetaminophen and phenobarbital, on the ibuprofen adsorption as binary mixtures. Acetaminophen and phenobarbital were adsorbed by TpBD-(CF3)(2)with low efficiency and their presence led to an increase in ibuprofen adsorption in the binary mixtures. Overall, this study demonstrates that TpBD-(CF3)(2)is an efficient adsorbent for the extraction of ibuprofen from natural waters as well.

AB The presence of diclofenac (DCF) in water has developed into a severe environmental problem due to its pernicious effects on animals and human being. Herein, a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) method using I doped TiO2 (I-TiO2) photoelectrode has been developed, which exhibited excellent visible activity in the degradation of DCF as well as pharmaceutical wastewater. The Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetic model, active species trapping experiments and analysis of intermediate products were employed to analyze the PEC degradation mechanism of DCF. The results revealed that the decomposition of DCF was primarily performed on the photoelectrode (I-TiO2) surface, and the degradation process was accompanied by the dechlorination reaction. The degradation of DCF was caused mainly by holes (66.6%) and hydroxyl radicals (27.6%) when Na2SO4 acted as electrolyte. The degradation rate of DCF could be significantly enhanced under the condition of high Cl(-)concentration (NaCl acted as electrolyte), which was caused by the participation of chloride radicals (Cl-center dot) in the PEC process. The Cl-center dot was the major factor contributing to the decomposition of DCF, and the holes and hydroxyl radicals played a less important role than Cl-center dot under this condition.

AB In this study, the efficacy of membrane-photocatalytic reactor (MPR) in sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal was explored at a fixed initial SMX concentration, i.e. 100 mg/L. A supported catalyst, i.e. TiO2 on granular activated carbon (GAC-TiO2), was used for MPR experiments. The SMX removal efficiency of the MPR was investigated under a range of hydraulic retention time (i.e. HRT from 51 to 152.5 min) and TiO2 catalyst dosage (55-50 mg/L). A maximum SMX removal efficiency of 83.6% was observed under 220 mg/L catalyst dosage and 80 min HRT. The increase in catalyst dosage from 55 to 550 mg/L has increased the transmembrane pressure of the reactor from 9.8 to 22.2 kPa. A multiple non-linear regression model was developed based on the experimental data and its significance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Based on the model, the optimal HRT and catalyst dosage for complete SMX removal (100%) were found out. The comparison of photocatalytic degradation experiments with sorption experiments conducted earlier revealed that SMX removal in the MPR was mainly by photocatalytic degradation and not by adsorption onto GAC-TiO2 catalyst. However, the performance of MPR in removing other emerging pollutants from real-time wastewaters could be explored before its field-scale application.

AB Passive sampling (PS) is a very useful approach for the monitoring of emerging contaminants in environmental matrices, showing greater sensitivity than can be achieved by current best practice - grab sampling - and is applicable to a wide variety of compounds. An EU Directive (2013/39/EC) has added substances to the existing Water Framework Directive (WFD) Priority Substance list. Investigation into PS in the monitoring of these compounds is necessary to show the potential of this technique in supporting monitoring requirements under the WFD. A catchment-based approach evaluated the occurrence of these compounds in Irish surface waters. This work deals with the challenges associated with the use of PS in a legislative context, and for routine monitoring of emerging contaminants. Looking at a number of sites across Ireland, upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants, the focus was on polar analytes and polar PS (POCIS). With method limits of detection (LODs) of 0.001 mg L-1 pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were found in water and passive samples alike, whereas the polar pesticides were not often detected or were below the annual average environmental quality standard levels. The results of this study show the potential for PS as a monitoring technique for emerging and watch-list chemicals.

AB This study aimed to investigate the dual role of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode and electrooxidation process in the electrochemical degradation of tetracycline (TC) - as model of antibiotics considered emergent pollutants in water - and also in the electrochemical detection based process control. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the operating parameters for both TC degradation/mineralization and its electrochemical detection in the process control. The operating parameters such as current density, pH and TC concentration range were set to achieve the best process performance. The mechanism and kinetics of TC electrodegradation are also discussed. A current density of 50 Am-2 and pH 5 were found to be optimum for TC degradation and mineralization in a concentration range between 25 and 100 mg L-1. Furthermore, these conditions enhanced the biodegradability character of TC during a subsequent biological treatment step in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The versatility of the BDD electrode also made possibile for it to be used for the electrochemical detection of TC using CV, allowing the process control with the same electrode, hence confirming the dual role of the electrode material.

AB Physico-chemical properties of a galactan exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Weissella confusa KR780676 isolated from an idli batter were studied. In our previous paper, we had reported the isolation and characterization of a linear galactan (containing alpha-(1 -> 6)-linked galactose units) isolated from an acidic fermented food. In this manuscript, we are reporting the physico-chemical properties viz., Colour evaluation (L* 81.79, a* 3.15, b* 15.04), flow properties (compressibility index 38.46%), syneresis, light transmittance (50.7% for 5 days), pasting properties (temperature 64.6 C), texture (hardness 9.876 N) and particle size (549.81 d nm) for the galactan were carried out. This galactan also possessed high oil absorption capacity (5.09 mL/g) with good emulsifying activity (69.4%) and emulsion stability up to 15 days. Flocculating activity of 65.3-81.7% was observed with 0.2 mg/mL EPS in a wide range of pH (2.0-12.0). These functional properties will make the galactan EPS a good candidate for use as thickening and gelling agent and emulsifier to form long-term emulsions in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, as well as for bio-treatment of wastewater and hydrocarbon-polluted environments.

AB In the present work we studied the thermophilic biological treatability of high strength liquid wastes from a pharmaceutical industry (rich in organic matter - COD: Chemical Oxygen Demand, nutrients and salinity). Different mixtures (with concentrations of COD, phosphorus and chloride up to 57,000 mg L-1, 2000 mg L-1 and 9000 mg L-1, respectively) were tested. The pilot plant used in this work was designed and built with dimensions comparable to a semi-industrial unit. The results are therefore representative for full-scale applications. During four months of experimentation, the pilot plant (TAMR - Thermophilic Aerobic Membrane Reactor) was operated at 49 +/- 1 degrees C and the organic loading rate was 1.5-5.5 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1) with a hydraulic retention time of 5-10 days.
   Main results are the following: a) extremely high COD removal rate (up to 98%); b) very low sludge production (similar to 0.016 kg(VSS produced) kg(COD removed)(-1)); suitability as a pre-treatment to a conventional (e.g. activated sludge) biological treatment (the studied pharmaceutical industrial wastewaters are discharged into the sewer system for final polishing in a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant) and d) high phosphorus removal (up to 99%).

AB Bacterial isolates with the capacity to remove paracetamol were selected from an activated sludge sample collected in an oxidation ditch of a wastewater treatment plant. Among these, twelve bacterial isolates were selected according to their capacity to grow in the presence of paracetamol. They were identified using the colony morphotype procedure and by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, but only four of them showed the ability to utilise paracetamol as the sole carbon source in the presence of a nitrogen supply. Those four bacterial isolates were assigned to species of the genera Bacillus, [Brevibacterium], Corynebacterium and Enterococcus. Bacterial isolates were cultured in liquid mineral salt medium (MSM) spiked with 200 mg/L of paracetamol at 28 degrees C in the dark. In cultures inoculated with [Brevibacterium] frigoritolerans, Corynebacterium nuruki and Enterococcus faecium, removal of 97 +/- 4%, 97 +/- 6% and 86.9 +/- 0.8% of paracetamol at 200 mg/L were obtained, respectively, while in the presence of a species belonging to Bacillus cereus group removal of the drug below the limits of detection was attained with evidence of mineralisation, after 144 h of incubation. During the degradation process, the metabolites 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone and 2-hexenoic acid were detected. As far as we know, these species are herein first-time described as paracetamol degraders.

AB Currently, there is great concern about global water pollution. Wastewater generally contains substances called emerging pollutants, and if the removal of these pollutants is not given sufficient attention, the pollutants can enter into the water cycle and reach the water supply for domestic use, causing adverse effects on the well-being of people. In order to avoid this menace, a multitude of techniques to reduce the high concentration levels of these substances dissolved in water are being researched and developed. One of the most-used techniques for this goal is the physical-chemical separation of contaminants in water through membrane technology. In this study, different membranes were tested with the objective of investigating the removal of three emerging pollutants: caffeine, metformin, and methyl-paraben. Initially, a nanofiltration (NF) membrane was selected, and the influence of pressure was evaluated in the rejection coefficients and permeate fluxes. Next, a screening of three new membranes to remove methyl paraben was completed. The influence of the operating variables, working pressure, and methyl paraben-feed concentration was checked. Finally, the solution-diffusion model was applied to predict the behavior of the different membranes in the removal of methyl paraben. A good correlation between experimental and calculated values of permeate flux and methyl paraben concentration was obtained.

AB The existence of antibiotics like ciprofloxacin in wastewater is a severe threat to human health and it also can leads to the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In the present study, two different morphologies of MgO nanostructures are prepared by using a simple microwave-assisted process to adsorb Ciprofloxacin (CIP) from aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the prepared MgO nanostructures are investigated by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analysis and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with EDS. The cube and spherical shaped MgO nanostructures demonstrate good adsorption property with the maximum adsorption capacity (Q(0)) of 476 and 528 mg g(-1) for CIP. The experimental data have been fitted well with the pseudo second order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm. The prepared MgO nanostructures show potent antibacterial activity for the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The increased oxidative stress and damaged cell membrane on interaction with MgO nanoparticle ultimately contribute to bacterial death. The prepared MgO nanostructures show high adsorption and antimicrobial activity, which could promise in controlling the threat to humans posed by antibiotics and the development of drug-resistant bacteria in aqueous solution.

AB Alkaline dehydration can treat human urine to produce a dry and nutrient-rich fertilizer. To evaluate the technology at pilot-scale, we built a prototype with capacity to treat 30 L urine d(-1)and field tested it for the first time at a military training camp in Finland. We operated the system for 3 months and monitored the recovery of nutrients, end-product composition, physicochemical properties and energy consumption. Results revealed that the system received less urine than anticipated, but achieved high dehydration rates (30-40 L d(-1)m(-2)), recovered 30 +/- 6% N, and yielded end-products with 1.4% N, 0.9% P, and 8.3% K. However, we demonstrated that the system had potential to recover nearly 70% N and produce fertilizers containing 13.2% N, 2.3% P, and 6.0% K, if it was operated at the design capacity. The energy demand for dehydrating urine was not optimized, but we suggested several ways of reducing it. We also discussed concerns surrounding non-essential heavy metals, salts, and micropollutants, and how they can be overcome to safely recycle urine. Lastly, we pointed out the research gaps that need to be addressed before the technology can be implemented at larger scale.

AB A magnetic biosorbent was synthesized from rice straw (a biological waste) and magnetic particles of Fe3O4. The produced biosorbent, which was characterized by XRD, FE SEM, FTIR, and TGA experiments, was used for adsorption of two drug chemical components of Penicillin G and Amlodipine Besylate from aqueous solutions. Effects of various operating parameters such as adsorption temperature (10 to 70 degrees C), the dose of adsorbent (1 to 5 g/L), contact time (30 to 360 min), and pH of system (pH=4 to 11) on the adsorption efficiency were studied. The produced adsorbent can remove impurities with maximum adsorption efficiency of about 95% for Pen-G and 65% for AMB; therefore, it is a good adsorbent for removing pharmaceutical impurities from wastewater. Moreover, the produced biosorbent can easily separate from the solution by using an external magnetic field. Five isotherm models-linear adsorption model, Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, and Toth-were used for describing the results; and based on Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity of the produced biosorbent is 164.7 mg/g for Pen-G and 229 mg/g for AMB. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and it is shown that the adsorption is extremely in physical mode.

AB Widely consumed benzodiazepine drugs are emerging contaminants, some of them being endocrine disruptors. Although many of these drugs remain in wastewater even after conventional treatment, innovative treatability studies are still sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis using synthesized composites based on TiO2 and activated carbon (TiO2/AC) as catalysts under sunlight-simulated irradiation. Different ratios and calcination temperatures were tested for the synthesis, and the composite with the best photocatalytic efficiency (based on methylene blue dye removal from water solution) was the one formed by 10% AC calcined at 400 degrees C (TiO2/AC10%). This composite was applied in heterogeneous photocatalysis to remove bromazepam, clonazepam, and diazepam at environmentally relevant concentrations (100g/L). Such treatment approach has not been reported in the literature to date. Independent variables such as catalyst concentration, pH, and sunlight-simulated irradiation were studied using design of experiments (DoE) to find conditions that provide maximum removal efficiency. TiO2/AC10% powder was characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, and diffuse reflectance. Under feasible optimized conditions, the efficiency of TiO2/AC10% to remove benzodiazepine drugs from water was >97.5%, which is much higher than the removal obtained with commercial catalyst and all controls.

AB The main removal process for polar organic micropollutants during activated sludge treatment is biotransformation, which often leads to the formation of stable transformation products (TPs). Because the analysis of TPs is challenging, the use of pathway prediction systems can help by generating a list of suspected TPs. To complete and refine pathway prediction, comprehensive biotransformation studies for compounds exhibiting pertinent functional groups under environmentally relevant conditions are needed. Because many polar organic micropollutants present in wastewater contain one or several amine functional groups, we systematically explored amine biotransformation by conducting experiments with 19 compounds that contained 25 structurally diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amine moieties. The identification of 144 TP candidates and the structure elucidation of 101 of these resulted in a comprehensive view on initial amine biotransformation reactions. The reactions with the highest relevance were N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, N-acetylation, and N-succinylation. Whereas many of the observed reactions were similar to those known for the mammalian metabolism of amine-containing xenobiotics, some N-acylation reactions were not previously described. In general, different reactions at the amine functional group occurred in parallel. Finally, recommendations on how these findings can be implemented to improve microbial pathway prediction of amine-containing micropollutants are given.

AB Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) inmunicipalwastewater effluents that are discharged to streams are of potential concern to ecosystem and human health. This study examined the fate of a suite of TOrCs and estrogenic activity in water and sediments in an effluent-dependent stream in Tucson, Arizona. Sampling campaigns were performed during 2011 to 2013 along the Lower Santa Cruz River, where TOrCs and estrogenic activitywere measured in aqueous (surface) and solid (riverbed sediment) phases. Some TOrCs, including contributors to estrogenic activity, were rapidly attenuated with distance of travel in the river. Those TOrCs that are not sufficiently attenuated and percolate to ground water have in common low biodegradation probabilities and low octanolwater distribution ratios. Independent experiments showed that attenuation of estrogenic compounds may be due in part to indirect photolysis caused by formation of organic radicals fromsunlight absorption. Hydrophobic TOrCs may accumulate in riverbed sediments during dry weather periods, but riverbed sediment quality is periodically affected through storm-related scouring during periods of heavy rainfall and runoff. Taken together, evidence suggests that natural processes can attenuate at least some TOrCs, reducing potential impacts to ecosystem and human health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we aimed to develop an understanding of the triple effects of sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline (ETS) and the dual effects of sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST), erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) and erythromycin-tetracycline (ET) on the anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater throughout a year of operation. Concentrations of the antibiotics in the influent were gradually increased until the metabolic collapse of the anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), which corresponded to ETS (40 + 3 + 3 mg/L) and ST (25 + 2.5 mg/L), ET (4 + 4 mg/L) and ES (3 + 40 mg/L). Acetate accumulation in the anaerobic SBRs, acetoclastic activity of the anaerobic sludge taken from different antibiotic feeding stages and also expression of acetyl-coA synthetase from the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway on the mRNA level were assessed. The results indicated that, while acetate accumulation and decrease of acetoclastic activity were observed after stage 3 in the ST and ES reactors, and stage 7 in the ETS and ET reactors, the expression of acetyl-coA synthetase was mostly decreased in the last stages in all SBRs, in which antibiotic mixture feeding was terminated. It might be speculated that acetoclastic methanogens have an important role in acetate degradation by expressing acetyl-coA synthetase.

AB Water and wastewater effluents contain a vast range of pharmaceutical chemicals. The present study aims to determine the potential of the advanced oxidation technology UV/H2O2/O-3 and its sub-processes (i.e. UV, UV/H2O2, UV/O-3, O-3 and H2O2/O-3) for the degradation of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP) and trimethoprim (TMP), and the antineoplastic drug cyclophosphamide (CPD) from water. Creating AOP conditions improved in most cases the degradation rate of the target compounds (compared with O-3 and UV alone). H2O2 concentration was found to be an important parameter in the UV/H2O2 and H2O2/O-3 sub-processes, acting as (OH)-O-center dot initiator as well as (OH)-O-center dot scavenger. Out of the examined processes, O-3 had the highest degradation rate for TMP and H2O2/O-3 showed highest degradation rate for CIP and CPD. The electrical energy consumption for both CIP and CPD, as calculated using the E-EO parameter, was in the following order: UV > UV/O-3 > UV/H2O2/O-3 > O-3 > H2O2/O-3. Whereas for TMP O-3 was shown to be the most electrical energy efficient. Twelve degradation byproducts were identified following direct UV photolysis of CIP.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment are raising concern. It is expected that many anthropogenic pharmaceuticals are largely excreted via urine; a popular argument for introducing urine source separation. However, to date, this assumption lacks verification. We close this gap with quantitative screening of official pharmaceutical data. We analysed the excretion pathways of 212 pharmaceuticals' active ingredients (Al), equalling 1,409 products. On average, 64% (+/- 27%) of each Al was excreted via urine, and 35% (+/- 26%) via faeces. In urine, 42% (+/- 28%) of each Al was excreted as metabolites. However, these numbers need cautious interpretation. We found an extreme variability (1) between different therapeutic groups, (2) within some groups and (3) sometimes even between products of the same Al. We discuss various therapeutic groups and include Swiss sales' quantities. For instance, urine source separation could very effectively remove the highly sold and non-degradable x-ray contrast media: 94% (+/- 4%) are excreted via urine. However, for different pharmaceuticals belonging to cytostatics, excretion via urine was 6-98%. Because of such large variability we advise caution to introduce the still imperfect urine separation, technology solely because of pharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, together with other good arguments for this innovation, removal of pharmaceuticals is a welcome side effect.

AB As water reuse becomes increasingly important to satisfy water demand, ensuring the quality of recycled wastewater becomes ever more vital. Pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEOs) metabolites are two groups of chemicals that are commonly present in treated effluent and have received attention for their demonstrated or potential biological effects. In this paper we present data on the effects of river transport, wetland treatment, and groundwater recharge on the attenuation of these emerging chemicals. Using data from three advanced water treatment plants, we also report on the efficiency of microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet oxidation in removing these compounds from advanced treated effluents. With respect to natural attenuation processes, decreases in pharmaceutical concentrations during river transport were likely attributed to sediment sorption and chemical and biological degradation or transformation. Wetland treatment was less efficient when compared to river transport. Groundwater recharge appeared to be an effective removal process (> 99% attenuation) for PhACs and APEO metabolites, although trace levels of the latter can travel substantial distances in the subsurface. With regards to the engineered treatment options, reverse osmosis was capable of almost complete rejection of all PhACs and APEO metabolites analyzed, whereas the performances of microfiltration and UV treatment were much less efficient and consistent.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug considered as an emerging pollutant (frequently detected in wastewater), was investigated on CNT, Pt/CNT and Ru/CNT modified electrodes based on Carbon Toray in aqueous media. The electroreactivity of DCF on these modified electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry and the kinetic parameters were calculated from the scan rate study. Cyclic voltammograms show several oxidation processes, which confirm the interaction between DCF and the catalyst surface necessary for direct oxidation processes. Constant potential electrolysis of DCF was carried out on carbon nanotubes (CNT) and metal supported CNT (M/CNT) modified electrodes, in 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer media. The highest DCF conversion (88% after 8 h of electrolysis) was found in carbonate buffer medium, for Ru/CNT, while the best carbon mineralization efficiency (corresponding to 48% of the oxidized DCF) was obtained on Pt/CNT modified electrode in 0.1 M NaOH medium. The products of the electrolyses were identified and quantified by HPLC-MS, GC-MS, HPLC-UV-RID and IC. The results show the presence of some low molecular weight carboxylic acids, confirming the cleavage of the aromatic rings during the oxidation process.

AB Raman spectroscopy yields a fingerprint spectrum and is of great importance in medical and biological sciences as it is non-destructive, non-invasive, and available in the aqueous environment. In this study, Raman spectroscopy and Raman mapping were used to explore the dynamic biochemical processes in screened bacteria under ceftazidime stress. The Raman spectral difference between bacteria with and without antibiotic stress was analyzed by principal component analysis and characteristic peaks were obtained. The results showed that amino acids changed first and lipids were reduced when bacteria were exposed to ceftazidime stress. Furthermore, in Raman mapping, when bacteria were subjected to antibiotic stress, the peak at 1002 cm(-1) (phenylalanine) increased, while the peak at 1172 cm(-1) (lipids) weakened. This indicates that when bacteria were stimulated by antibiotics, the intracellular lipids decreased and the content of specific amino acids increased. The reduction of intracellular lipids may suggest a change of membrane permeability. The increase of specific amino acids suggests that bacteria resist external stimuli of antibiotics by regulating the activities of related enzymes. This study explored the processes of the action between bacteria and antibiotics by Raman spectroscopy, and provides a foundation for the further study of the dynamics of microbial biochemical processes in the future.

AB Many ionizable organic contaminants (IOCs) are present in treated wastewater used to irrigate edible crops and accumulate in plants under field conditions. Phytoavailability of IOCs with pKa values between 4 and 9 may be affected by the pH of the rhizosphere (the water and soil within 2-3 mm of the root surface). Plants can alter rhizosphere pH by 2-3 units in either direction in response to nutrient availability. The effects of plant modulation of rhizosphere pH on IOC accumulation have not been previously reported. Here we provide direct evidence that plant-driven changes in rhizosphere pH impact accumulation of an IOC in plant leaves. Using a modified hydroponic system, we found that rhizosphere pH was higher by 1.5-2.4 units when plants received only nitrate rather than a combination of nitrate and ammonium. Plant-driven changes to rhizosphere pH altered accumulation of lamotrigine (pKa = 5.7) but not carbamazepine, a non-ionizable contaminant. Lamotrigine accumulation in leaves correlated strongly with the concentration of the neutral species available in porewater. We expect plant-driven changes in rhizosphere pH to be important across a wide range of plant species and IOCs. Consideration of plant modulation of rhizosphere pH may be necessary to accurately predict IOC bioaccumulation.

AB The limited availability of fresh water is a global crisis. The growing consumption of fresh water due to anthropogenic activities has taken its toll on available water resources. Unfortunately, water bodies are still used as sinks for waste water from domestic and industrial sources. Azo dyes account for the majority of all dye stuffs, produced because they are extensively used in the textile, paper, food, leather, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Bacterial degradation of azo dyes under certain environmental conditions has gained momentum as a method of treatment, as these are inexpensive, eco-friendly, and can be applied to wide range of such complex dyes. The enzymatic approach has attracted much interest with regard to degradation of azo dyes from wastewater. The oxido-reductive enzymes are responsible for generating highly reactive free radicals that undergo complex series of spontaneous cleavage reactions, due to the susceptibility of enzymes to inactivation in the presence of the other chemicals. The oxidoreductive enzymes, such as lignin peroxidase, laccases, tyrosinase, azoreductase, riboflavin reductive, polyphenol oxidase, and aminopyrine n-demethylase, have been mainly utilized in the bacterial degradation of azo dye. Along with the reductive enzymes, some investigators have demonstrated the involvement in some other enzymes, such as Lignin peroxides and other enzymes. This chapter reviews the importance of enzymes in dye degradation.

AB Polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified chitosan was prepared and used to remove clofibric acid (CA) from aqueous solution. PEI was chemically grafted on the porous chitosan through a crosslinking reaction, and the effects of PEI concentration and reaction time in the preparation on the adsorption of clofibric acid were optimized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that PEI macromolecules were uniformly grafted on the porous chitosan, and the analysis of pore size distribution indicated that more mesopores were formed due to the crosslinking of PEI molecules in the macropores of chitosan. The PEI-modified chitosan had fast adsorption for CA within the initial 5 h, while this adsorbent exhibited an adsorption capacity of 349 mg center dot g(-1) for CA at pH 5.0 according to the Langmuir fitting, higher than 213 mg center dot g(-1) on the porous chitosan. The CA adsorption on the PEI-modified chitosan was pH-dependent, and the maximum adsorption was achieved at pH 4.0. Based on the surface charge analysis and comparison of different pharmaceuticals adsorption, electrostatic interaction dominated the sorption of CA on the PEI-modified chitosan. The PEI-modified chitosan has a potential application for the removal of some anionic micropollutants from water or wastewater.

AB The extensive development and use of new anthropogenic chemicals have inevitably led to their presence in aquatic environments. Surface waters affected by sewage effluents have been exposed to these new substances. In the present study, the occurrence of anthropogenic substances, including pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, was investigated in one of the major rivers in Korea, the Nakdong River. Furthermore, seasonal variations in their content were determined via annual monitoring. Through the suspect and non-target screening (SNTS) technique, 58 substances were newly identified in the river and integrated in the quantitative monitoring practice. The results revealed that niflumic acid and melamine exhibited the highest median concentrations, i.e., 320 ng/L and 11,000 ng/L, respectively. The results associated with seasonal change revealed that the concentration of a considerable number of substances increased in winter when the flow rate was low. Conversely, some substances exhibited high concentrations in summer (e.g., polyethylene glycol) and spring (e.g., niflumic acid). This was attributed to the seasonal changes in the consumption, prescriptions, or the application of alternative substances. These changes were also reflected by the risk quotient (RQ) values calculated from the concentration and toxicity values. Pharmaceuticals such as telmisartan and carbamazepine and industrial chemicals such as organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) and melamine accounted for approximately 90% of the total RQ. Major substances prioritized using the production of the RQ value and the detection frequency included OPFRs and telmisartan. It is recommended that these results be reflected in future water quality monitoring plans. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoxetine and propranolol are neuroactive human pharmaceuticals that occur frequently as pollutants in surface waters. The potential effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms have raised concern but many adverse effects are not well characterized for a broad range of concentrations and endpoints. In this study, 6 biological parameters in the freshwater Cladoceran Daphnia magna were compared for their responses to fluoxetine or propranolol exposure: mobility (dichotomous response), active swimming time, swimming distance, swimming velocity, swimming acceleration speed, and survival in the absence of food (starvation-survival). Changes in swimming behavior was quantified by video tracking followed by image analyses at six exposure concentrations between 100 ng/L and 10 mg/L. Active swimming time and swimming distance were the most responsive parameters among the behavioral traits. Sublethal exposure concentrations resulted in nonmonotonic responses and behavior profiling suggested that fluoxetine and propranolol stimulated swimming activity at 1-10 mu g/L whereas lower (0.1-1 mu g/L) and higher exposure concentrations (>100 mu g/L) inhibited swimming activity. The ability to survive in the absence of food when exposed to fluoxetine or propranolol resulted in EC50 and EC10 values that were lower than for swimming behavior (EC50 of 0.79-0.99 mg/L; EC10 of 1.4-2.9 mu g/L). Starvation-survival appeared to be a potentially simple and sensitive endpoint for adverse effects in D. magna at intermediate exposure concentrations. Nonmonotonic behavioral responses at low exposure concentrations and decreased ability to survive starvation should be considered in assessment of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals to freshwater invertebrates.

AB Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug frequently found in the aquatic environment. Previous studies have reported histological changes in the liver, kidney, and gills of fish at concentrations similar to those measured in treated sewage effluents (approximately 1 mu g/L). Analyses or predictions of blood plasma levels in fish allow a direct comparison with human therapeutic plasma levels and may therefore be used to indicate a risk for pharmacological effects in fish. To relate internal exposure to a pharmacological interaction, we investigated global hepatic gene expression together with bioconcentration in blood plasma and liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to waterborne diclofenac. At the highest exposure concentration (81.5 mu g/L), the fish plasma concentration reached approximately 88% of the human therapeutic levels (C-max) after two weeks. Using an oligonucleotide microarray followed by quantitative PCR, we found extensive effects on hepatic gene expression at this concentration, and some genes were found to be regulated down to the lowest exposure concentration tested (1.6 mu g/L), corresponding to a plasma concentration approximately 1.5% of the human C-max. Thus, at concentrations detected in European surface waters, diclofenac can affect the expression of multiple genes in exposed fish. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed effects on biological processes such as inflammation and the immune response, in agreement with the mode of action of diclofenac in mammals. In contrast to some previously reported results, the bioconcentration factor was found to be stable (4.02 +/- 0.75 for blood plasma and 2.54 +/- 0.36 for liver) regardless of the water concentration.

AB The degradation of the pharmaceuticals phenazone and metamizole, two pyrazolone-derivates in widespread use, using biofilms created by natural organisms from the national park Unteres Odertal, Germany, were investigated. An analytical method based on LC-MS/ MS was optimised to determine the substances phenazone and methylaminoantipyrine (MAA), the hydrolysis product of metamizole (also known as dipyrone), as well as their metabolites 1,5-dimethy1-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP), acetaminoantipyrine (AAA), formylaminoantipyrine (FAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA). Performance characteristics of the method were evaluated in terms of recovery, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, method detection limits (MDL) and method quantification limits (MQL). Degradation studies of phenazone and MAA were conducted using a laboratory-scale continuous flow biofilm reactor fed with different nutrient media and with variable hydraulic retention times of 24 and 32 h. MAA was degraded rapidly to FAA and AA, while phenazone was not degraded under the prevailing conditions even after 32 h. By operating the bioreactor in batch mode to study the phenazone degradation potential of the biofilm under limiting nutrient conditions, an elimination rate of 85% phenazone was observed, but because of the slow elimination rate and aerobic conditions, the metabolite DP was not detected. In additional batch experiments using bacterial isolates from the natural biofilm to decompose phenazone, some bacterial strains were able to form DP from phenazone in marginal concentrations over the sampling period of eight weeks. Obviously, the microorganisms need a reasonably long time to adapt their metabolisms to enable the removal of phenazone from water samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Passive sampling is a tool to monitor the presence and concentrations of micropollutants in the aquatic environment. We investigated the duration of integrative sampling and the effects of flow rate on the performance of three configurations of the Chemcatcher - a sampler for polar organic compounds. Chemcatchers were fitted with Empore (TM) styrenedivinylbenzene (SDB) XC disks (XC), SDB-RPS disks (RPS) or SDB-RPS disks covered with a polyethersulfone membrane (RPS-PES). Samplers were either exposed to treated sewage effluent for 5 days at various flow rates, or at a single flow rate with overlapping exposures of 3-24 days. Chemical analysis focused on a set of pharmaceuticals and biocides and ecotoxicological analysis measured inhibition of photosystem II in algae. For compounds with log K-OW > 2, both XC and RPS disks respond dynamically to higher flow rates; uptake increased up to five-fold when flow increased from 0.03 to 0.37 m s(-1). At a flow rate of 0.13 m s(-1) the integrative window of SDB disks approached 6 days for more hydrophobic compounds (log K-OW > 3.5). The RPS-PES configuration was less affected by flow and also showed an extended integrative window (up to 24 days). The membrane causes a lag phase of up to 2.3 days which thwarts a sound interpretation of data from sampling periods of less than 10 days. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, structure, and mobility of Tn1546-like elements were studied in environmental vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRIE) isolated from municipal sewage, activated sludge, pharmaceutical waste derived from antibiotic production, seawater, blue mussels, and soil. Of 200 presumptive VRE isolates tested, 71 (35%) harbored vanA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis allowed the detection of 26 subtypes, which were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n = 13), E. casseliflavus (n = 6), E. mundtii (n = 3), E. faecalis (n = 3), and E. durans (n = 1) by phenotypic tests and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Long PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (L-PCR-RFLP) analysis of Tn1546-like elements and PCR analysis of internal regions revealed the presence of seven groups among the 29 strains studied. The most common group (group 1) corresponded to the structure of Tn1546 in the prototype strain E. faecium BM4147. Two novel L-PCR-RFLP patterns (groups 3 and 4) were found for E. casseliflavus strains. Indistinguishable Tn1546-like elements occurred in VRE strains belonging to different species or originating from different sources. Interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of vancomycin resistance to E. faecium BM4105 was demonstrated for E. faecalis, E. mundtii, and E. durans. This study indicates that VRE, including species other than E. faecium and E. faecalis, are widespread in nature and in environments that are not exposed to vancomycin selection and not heavily contaminated with feces, such as seawater, blue mussels, and nonagricultural soil. Tn1546-like elements can readily transfer between enterococci of different species and ecological origins, therefore raising questions about the origin of these transposable elements and their possible transfer between environmental and clinical settings.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) containing wastewater with a concentration of 1-5 mg/L was treated in an activated sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR), for 60 days, in order to investigate the overall performance of the SBR, the parameter variations during a typical cycle, the chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the evolution of microbial community. The average removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N and TN were > 85%, while > 40% of the IBU was removed and the removal efficiencies of TP fluctuated around similar to 75%. The EPS content increased significantly with IBU addition (p < 0.01). Fulvic acid-like substances in the chemical composition of EPS increased during the stable operation phase. Proteobacteria associated with nitrogen removal was the dominant phylum, which can also resist IBU stress. For the denitrifying bacteria, the OTUs of both Rhodobacter and Pseudomonas increased from day 1-30 and reduced on day 60 (p < 0.01), which was opposite to the results observed for Rhodocyclaceae (phosphorus-accumulating bacteria). The OTUs of Acidovorax showed an increasing trend (p < 0.01), whereas the OTUs for Nitrospira (nitrite oxidizers) and Nitrosomonas (ammonia oxidizers) decreased significantly (p < 0.05).

AB Considerable pollutant loads can enter surface waters during rain events. Three factors challenge quantification of these pollutant fluxes using traditional sampling methods: (i) concentration fluctuations; (ii) unknown event duration; and (iii) placement, operation, and maintenance of equipment. Passive samplers offer the advantage of sampling in a continuous mode without power supply. However, variable uptake rates due to environmental factors and desorption in the case of fluctuating concentrations can affect the accuracy of time-weighted average (TWA) concentration estimates. While uncertainties related to environmental factors could be accounted for with additional effort, we can neither control nor quantify the concentration variability. We present measured and modelled concentration profiles at high temporal resolution and provide a systematic approach to assessing deviations from true TWA concentration due to fluctuating concentration profiles. We evaluate sampling of sewer overflows (0.3-14 h) with Chemcatcher and 1-week sampling in rivers. The uncertainty due to fluctuating concentrations is small, and other factors such as chemical analyses and sampler calibration have a similar or higher impact. The uncertainty due to fluctuations clearly increases with the sampling duration, particularly when exceeding the half-life of equilibrium. We conclude that passive sampling can also be used in wastewater systems with potentially high concentration variations.

AB The increasing demand on water resources throughout the world has motivated researchers to seek new ways to obtain quality water increasing their interest in water reclamation. However, the presence of harmful organic chemicals such as pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is a serious environmental concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the pH on the rejection of seven target PhACs (acetaminophen, caffeine, erythromycin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) by different low-pressure membranes within the fine ultrafiltration (UF) and loose nanofiltration (NF) range. For this purpose, three ceramic membranes and a polyamide membrane were used for UF and NF experiments, respectively. Experimental results indicated that PhACs with negative charge were effectively rejected at basic conditions (< 75% for UF, < 90% for NF), improving both their hydrophilicity and solubility with increasing pH. Furthermore, high soluble PhACs with high pKa values showed low rejection values (similar to 15% for UF, similar to 30% for NF) and a pH-independent behaviour during low-pressure filtration experiments. Therefore, the use of low-pressure membranes could be considered as an appropriate and sustainable supplemental technique to remove PhACs in a wastewater treatment plant.

AB A variety of synthetic dyestuffs, released by the textile industry pose a threat to environment safety. Azo dyes account for the majority of all dyestuffs, produced because they are extensively used in the textile, paper, food, leather, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. This study deals with the decolorization of the commercially important azo dye, Acid blue 158 under microaerophilic condition in wastewater. The removal of color is mainly associated with the anaerobic stage and also facultative-anaerobic stage. Decolorization of azo dyes during biological effluent treatment can involve both adsorption to cell biomass and degradation by azo-bond reduction during anaerobic digestion. Degradation was expected to form aromatic amines, which may be toxic and recalcitrant to anaerobic/facultative anaerobic treatment.
   Methods for the quantitative detection of substituted aromatic amines arising from azo-dye cleavage are complex. Samples after decolorization were analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The statistical analysis revealed that the dye concentration and temperature showed maximum significance towards dye degradation. Laboratory scale bioreactor was operated for a period of 25 days at a temperature 30-35 degrees C. The performance of the bioreactor was evaluated by monitoring color and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal. Color and COD removal above 90% were achieved within 10 d incubation time.

AB The elimination of 11 selected emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, metoprolol, caffeine, antipyrine, sulfamethoxazole, flumequine, ketorolac, atrazine, isoproturon, 2-hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac) has been investigated by means of ultrafiltration membranes in a cross-flow equipment that operated in continuous regime. Two different aqueous systems were used for dissolving the selected pollutants: ultrapure water and a secondary effluent generated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The influence of the MWCO of the membranes, and the nature of the water matrix on the permeate flux was established, and the rejection coefficients of the selected compounds were determined. Additionally, in the UF of the secondary effluent, rejection coefficients of several quality parameters (turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and absorbance at 254 nm) were also evaluated. In order to enhance the efficiency of the single UF process, three different combined processes were also tested: two pre-treatments consisting in coagulation (by using aluminum sulfate) and adsorption (by using powdered active carbon) stages followed by the UF stage; and adsorption post-treatment (by using granular active carbon) that was conducted to the permeate of the UF stage. The improvements in the elimination of the selected compounds and the quality pollutant parameters were established and discussed.

AB Decentralized direct potable reuse systems present new opportunities and potential risks for resilient and sustainable facilities of the future. This study explored the use of advanced cell-based composite toxicity methods to augment the assessment of known and unknown chemicals in waters from decentralized direct potable reuse systems. The decentralized reuse systems were equipped with newly-developed low energy membranes and advanced oxidation technologies for the control of the full spectrum of contaminants found in wastewater effluent. The feed and product waters from these systems were tested for conventional chemical contaminants, personal care and pharmaceutical products, composite cytotoxicity and composite genotoxicity. The composite toxicity assays confirmed the high degree of purification in the decentralized potable reuse systems and responded accordingly when known contaminants were detected at levels approaching or exceeding regulatory limits. The composite toxicity assays identified potential risks for water samples that would not be considered contaminated or a risk to health based on conventional contaminant monitoring. Unknown disinfection byproducts appeared to be the causal factors due to increases in cytotoxicity that occurred during the disinfection step. It is recommended that composite toxicity assays be considered to augment validation and optimization of direct potable reuse systems to minimize potential health risks associated with the additive effects of known and unknown contaminants.

AB Metformin has been treated for diabetes (type 2). Nowadays, this compound is frequently found in ambient water, influent/effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. To evaluate the metformin aquatic toxicity under a multi-generational exposure regimen, we exposed Oryzias latipes to metformin for two generations (133 d) and investigated its adverse effects. In the F0 generation, metformin significantly elevated gene expression for cytochrome P450 19a (CYP19a) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) in male fish; in female fish, the treatment decreased gene expression of vitellogenin (VTG2) and ER beta 1, suggesting endocrine disruption (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Intersex occurrence of F0 female fish were found in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no significant changes in fecundity and hatching rate were observed (p < 0.05). Metformin increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, and decreased the glutathione (GSH) content in F0 male fish compared with those of the control (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). In F0 female fish, metformin increased catalase activity compared with that of the control (p > 0.05). The results demonstrated that metformin leads to oxidative stress and two-generation endocrine disruption in O. latipes. These results may be useful for better understanding metformin toxicity mechanism.

AB The aim of the work was to determine the influence of salicylic acid (SA) oxidation products on the effectiveness of their further removal in the membrane filtration process. Two commercial polyamide-based polymer membranes, HL (GE Osmonics) and TS80 (TriSep(TM)), were used and characterized by SEM microscopic analysis, contact angles, and free surface energy. The products of salicylic acid oxidation, 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and catechol, were determined and their impact on the removal of unreacted salicylic acid in the nanofiltration process was investigated. It was also checked to what extent and why they were retained or not by the membranes. The results of the research have shown that the main product of salicylic acid oxidation, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, has a negative impact on the retention of salicylic acid in the nanofiltration stage, while the other product, catechol, improves SA retention. The determined values of contact angles correlate well with solubility (S) of the tested compounds, which increases in the following order S-SA < S-2,S-3-DHBA < S-CAT, while the contact angle of the membrane decreases. Nevertheless, it has been shown that some oxidation products can penetrate the environment due to poorer membrane separation properties of these products.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a recalcitrant xenobiotic pharmaceutical pollutant highly stable in soil and wastewater during treatment. The biodegradation of CBZ using streptomycetes has been few studied up to now. Sixteen newly filamentous bacteria belong to genus Streptomyces spp. isolated from different Romanian soil samples and three strains from a collection of microorganisms (MIUG) were morphologically characterized, tested based on their resistance against CBZ toxicity and then selected as agents for bioremediation. Five Streptomyces spp. strains coded MIUG 4.88, MIUG 4.89, SNA, LP1 and LP2 showed CBZ tolerance at all of the tested concentrations, i.e. 0.05, 0.2, 1, 5 and 8 mg L-1. Two of these (MIUG 4.89 and SNA strains) were selected based on their resistance to target compound and were then assessed for CBZ biodegradation. The strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 showed an interesting efficiency for CBZ removal, with a yield of 35% when it was cultivated in submerged conditions on a minimal medium supplemented with 5 g L-1 glucose. This ability was linked to extracellular laccase production. These results are promising for the use of these filamentous bacteria as bioremediation agents.

AB Eighteen selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), consisting of five non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (N-APs), four sulfonamides (SAs), four tetracyclines (TCs), four macrolides (MCs), and one quinolone (QN) were detected in surface water and sediments from Guanting Reservoir (GTR) and its upstream rivers in north China. Acetaminophen, caffeine, chlorotetracycline, and ofloxacin were detected with 100% frequency in the surface water of GTR and its upstream rivers, while diltiazem was also detected with 100% frequency in surface water from the reservoir's upstream rivers. Acetaminophen and caffeine were detected with 100% frequency in sediments from GTR and its upstream rivers, while high concentrations of ofloxacin in GTR, and carbamazepine, tetracycline, and chlortetracycline in upstream rivers were also detected in 100% of samples. Five N-APs, especially acetaminophen and caffeine, were prominent pollutants. The mean concentrations of acetaminophen were 155 and 302 ng L-1 in surface water and 529 and 202 ng g(-1) in sediments from GTR and upstream rivers, respectively. The mean concentrations of caffeine were 208 and 338 ng L-1 in surface water samples and 1430 and 1020 ng g(-1) in sediments from GTR and upstream rivers, respectively. The geographical differences in PPCP concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Zhangjiakou City and human activities around the GTR basin were the main sources of PPCPs in this area. An environmental risk assessment for the worst-case scenario was undertaken using calculated risk quotients, which indicated a medium risk from erythromycin in GTR and a high risk in its upstream rivers.

AB Pollution by chemical substances is of concern for the maintenance of healthy and sustainable aquatic environments. While the occurrence and fate of numerous emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceuticals, is well documented in freshwater, their occurrence and behavior in coastal and marine waters is much less studied and understood. This study investigates the occurrence of 58 chemicals in the open surface water of the Western Mediterranean Sea for the first time. 70 samples in total were collected in 10 different sampling areas. 3 pesticides, 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 2 artificial sweeteners were detected at sub-ng to ng/L levels. Among them, the herbicide terbuthylazine, the pharmaceuticals caffeine, carbamazepine, naproxen and paracetamol, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the antibacterial triclocarban and the two artificial sweeteners acesulfame and saccharin were detected in all samples. The compound detected at the highest concentration was saccharin (up to 5.23 ng/L). Generally small spatial differences among individual sampling areas point to a diffuse character of sources which are likely dominated by WWTP effluents and runoffs from agricultural areas or even, at least for pharmaceuticals and artificial food additives, from offshore sources such as ferries and cruising ships. The implications of the ubiquitous presence in the open sea of chemicals that are bioactive or toxic at low doses on photosynthetic organisms and/or bacteria (i.e., terbuthylazine, sulfamethoxazole or triclocarban) deserve scientific attention, especially concerning possible subtle impacts from chronic exposure of pelagic microorganisms.

AB This study investigated the i) kinetics, and ii) proportion of photolysis of 30 relatively stable active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) during artificial UV irradiation for 28 d in ammonium acetate buffer, filtered and unfiltered river water. Buffer was included to control removal kinetics under stable pH conditions and without particulate matter. Dark controls were used to determine removal due to other processes than photolysis and calculate the proportion of photolysis of the total removal. The removal of each API in each matrix was determined using online solid phase extraction/liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE/LC-MS/MS). Most APIs transformed during the 28 d of UV irradiation and the dark controls showed that photolysis was the major removal process for the majority of the APIs studied. The half-lives ranged from 6 h (amitriptyline) in unfiltered river water to 884 h (37 d, carbamazepine) in buffer. In unfiltered river water, the proportion of APIs with short half-lives (<48 h) was much higher (29%) than in the other matrices (4%), probably due to additional organic carbon, which could have promoted indirect photolysis. Furthermore, two APIs, memantine and fluconazole, were stable in all three matrices, while alprazolam was stable in buffer and unfiltered river water and four additional APIs were stable in buffer. Considering the relatively long-term UV-exposure, this study enabled the investigation of environmentally relevant half-lives in natural waters. Many APIs showed high persistence, which is environmentally concerning and emphasizes the importance of further studies on their environmental fate and effects. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB The electrochemical degradation kinetics of diclofenac (DCF) using graphite-PVC composite as anode was assessed in pure water and effluent wastewat er. Effects of initial concentration of diclofenac, chloride ion (Cl-) loading, type of sample and applied voltage were determined to test and validate a kinetic model for the oxidation of diclofenac by the electrochemic al oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of diclofenac followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The rate constant values ranged from 0.018 to 0.173 /min, depending on the operating parameters. However, 6 V and 4 g/L NaCl were selected for further experiments (96.9% removal of diclofenac and 0.0078 kWh/g diclofenac consumption energy) after 30 min and at 20 mg/L of diclofenac. High consumption energy (0.0303 kWh/g diclofenac) was accompanied with high applied voltage of 10 V so it was not considered in this study.
   Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ToF/MS) was used for the elucidation of the main transformation products (TPs) which are resulted from the degradation of diclofenac (DCF) during the application of graphite-PVC composite as anode in aqueous matrices. The toxicity of DCF and its TPs was assessed against E. coli bacteria at different incubation time. (C) 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biocides are widely formulated in household and personal care products. We investigated the distribution and ecological risks of 16 household biocides in aquatic environments of a highly urbanized region in South China, evaluated triclosan as a chemical indicator for this group of household chemicals, and proposed a novel approach to predict the environmental occurrence and fate of these household biocides by using triclosan usage data and a level-III fugacity model. Eleven biocides were quantitatively detected at concentrations up to 264 +/- 15.3 ng/L for climbazole in surface water, and up to 5649 +/- 748 ng/g for triclocarban in sediment of four rivers in the region. The distribution of biocides in the aquatic environments was significantly correlated with environmental variables such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus and population. Domestic sewage in the region was the dominant pollution source for most biocides such as azole fungicides (fluconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and carbendazim) and disinfectants (triclosan and triclocarban). Preliminary risk assessment showed high ecological risks posed by two biocides carbendazim and triclosan in river waters. Mostly important, triclosan was found to be a reliable chemical indicator to surrogate household biocides both in water and sediment based on the correlation analysis. In addition, the fugacity modeling could provide simulated concentrations comparable to the monitoring results. Therefore, with the usage data of the chemical indicator triclosan and correlation formula with other biocides, this model can be applied for predicting the occurrence and fate of various household biocides in a catchment.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR), is an ionizable and polar antimicrobial compound, and it may enter the environment in substantial amounts via the application of manure or sewage as a fertilizer. Sorption of NOR onto humic acid (HA) may affect its environmental fate. In this study, HA extracted from weathered coal was used to investigate the sorption of NOR at different solution chemistry conditions (pH, ionic strength) and temperatures. The sorption of NOR onto HA showed a two-stage sorption process with an equilibration time of 48 h. The sorption kinetic curve fitted well with a pseudo second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic characteristics demonstrated that the sorption of NOR onto HA was a spontaneous and exothermic process predominated by physical sorption. All sorption isotherms fitted well with the Freundlich and Langmuir models and they were highly nonlinear with values of n between 0.4 and 0.5, suggesting the high heterogeneity of HA. Increasing Ca2+ concentration resulted in a considerable reduction in the K-d values of NOR, hinting that Ca2+ had probably competed with NOR+,0 for the cation exchange sites on the surfaces of HA. The sorption reached a maximum at pH 6.0 over the pH range of 2.0-8.0, implying that the primary sorption mechanism was cation exchange interaction between NOR+,0 species and the negatively charged functional groups of HA. Spectroscopic evidence demonstrated that the piperazinyl moiety of NOR was responsible for sorption onto HA, while the carbonyl group and the aromatic structure of HA participated in adsorbing NOR.

AB The authors examined effects of three common contaminants, caffeine (CF), acetaminophen (AC), and diclofenac (DF), as well as their mixtures on the development, functioning, and biodiversity of river biofilm communities. Biofilms were cultivated in rotating annular reactors. Treatments included AC, CF, DF, AC+CF, AC+DF, CF+DF, AC+CF+DF at 5 mu g/L, and their molar equivalent as carbon and nutrients. Incubations using 14C-labeled AC, DF, and CF indicated that 90% of the CF, 80% of the AC, and less than 2% of the DF were converted to CO2. Digital imaging revealed a variety of effects on algal, cyanobacterial, and bacterial biomass. Algal biomass was unaffected by AC or CF in combination with DF but significantly reduced by all other treatments. Cyanobacterial biomass was influenced only by the AC+DF application. All treatments other than AC resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial biomass. Diclofenac or DF+CF and DF+AC resulted in increases in micrometazoan grazing. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of Eubacterial community DNA, evaluated by principal component analysis and analysis of similarity, indicated that relative to the control, all treatments had effects on microbial community structure (r=0.47, p<0.001). However, the AC+CF+DF treatment was not significantly different from its molar equivalent carbon and nutrient additions. The Archaeal community differed significantly in its response to these exposures based on community analyses, confirming a need to integrate these organisms into ecotoxicological studies. Environ.

AB A carbonaceous (heterotrophic) activated sludge process (ASP), nitrifying ASP and a nitrifying/denitrifying ASP have been studied to examine the role of process type in steroid estrogen removal. Biodegradation efficiencies for total steroid estrogens (Sigma(EST)) of 80 and 91% were recorded for the nitrifying/denitrifying ASP and nitrifying ASP respectively. Total estrogen biodegradation (Sigma(EST)) was only 51% at the carbonaceous ASP, however, the extent of biodegradation in the absence of nitrification clearly indicates the important role of heterotrophs in steroid estrogen removal. The low removal efficiency did not correlate with biomass activity for which the ASP(carbonaceous) recorded 80 mu g kg(-1) biomass d(-1) compared to 61 and 15 mu g kg(-1) biomass d(-1) at the ASP(nitrifying) and ASP(nitrifying/denitrifying) respectively. This finding was explained by a moderate correlation (r(2) = 0.55) between total estrogen loading (Sigma(EST) mg m(-3) d(-1)) and biomass activity (mu g Sigma(EST) degraded kg(-1) d(-1)) and has established the impact of loading on steroid estrogen removal at full-scale. At higher solids retention time (SRT), steroid estrogen biodegradation of >80% was observed, as has previously been reported. It is postulated that hydraulic retention time (HRT) is as important as SRT as this governs both reaction time and loading. This observation is based on the high specific estrogen activity determined at the ASP(carbonaceous) plant, the significance of estrogen loading and the positive linear correlation between SRT and HRT.

AB The 20 kHz ultrasound-induced degradation of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) was investigated. Several operating conditions, such as power density (25-100 W/L), substrate concentration (2.5-80 mg/L), initial solution pH (3.5-11), liquid bulk temperature and the type of sparging gas (air, oxygen, argon), were tested concerning their effect on DCF degradation (as assessed measuring absorbance at 276 nm) and hydroxyl radicals generation (as assessed measuring H2O2 concentration). Sample mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), aerobic biodegradability (as assessed by the BOD5/COD ratio) and ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna and Artemia salina were followed too.
   DCF conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities and liquid bulk temperatures, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air or oxygen. The reaction rate increases with increasing DCF concentration in the range 2.5-5 mg/L but it remains constant in the range 40-80 mg/L, indicating different kinetic regimes (i.e. first and zero order, respectively). H2O2 production rates in pure water are higher than those in DCF solutions, implying that decomposition basically proceeds through hydroxyl radical reactions. Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than DCF to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable. Toxicity to D. magna increases during the early stages of the reaction and then decreases progressively upon degradation of reaction by-products; nevertheless, complete toxicity elimination cannot be achieved at the conditions in question. Neither the original nor the treated DCF samples are toxic to A. salina. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elimination of antibiotics such as tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) from wastewater is of great significance, but still faces challenges. Herein, for the first time, I and P co-doped TiO2 catalysts were prepared via a hydrolysis method. We also reported a simple method to prepare I and P co-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes, which exhibited preeminent photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance for the decomposition of TC. The synergistic effect of I and P co-doping could significantly improve the charge separation rate and enhance the light absorption capacity of TiO2, leading to an enhancement of PEC activity. The main factors affecting the PEC performance were investigated, and the highest degradation rate constant (4.20 x 10(-2) min(-1)) was achieved when the doping content of P was 4 at% (ITP-4 photoelectrode) at pH 11.02 under visible light. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model and active species trapping experiments were selected to investigate the degradation mechanism of TC. The results suggest that the hydroxyl radicals and photogenerated holes were the main active species that were responsible for the decomposition of TC. Moreover, the degradation pathways of TC based on the intermediates also demonstrated that the hydroxyl radicals and holes showed a principal role in degrading TC.

AB Acrylamide (AM) is a carcinogen and neurotoxicant, and its growing application in numerous industrial processes is contaminating the environment. In addition, the inhibitory effect of AM makes its biodegradation in the environment challenging. This study investigated AM degradation using a selectively enriched inoculum of mixed sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) isolated from a local wastewater treatment plant in Daegu, Korea. The use of SRB is promising for effectively treating several environmental pollutants, but the feasibility for biodegrading AM has not yet been reported. Experimental results showed that 73% AM (initial concentration: 7 mM) biodegradation was achieved in just 120 h, together with 42% and 96% TOC and sulfate removal, respectively. In addition, the SRB performance was not significantly affected by a threefold increase in the AM concentration; biodegradation performance dropped by only 12%. These results imply SRB immunity toward lethal contaminants and the viability of using SRB in different treatment processes. The kinetic results of batch studies enabled development of a pseudo-first-order kinetic model for AM biodegradation, TOC, and sulfate removal. In addition, although the sulfate removal efficiency was affected by a higher sulfate loading, it had little effect on AM and TOC removal. This study shows the potential of using SRB to effectively degrade recalcitrant pharmaceutical pollutants.

AB A novel and porous molecularly imprinted polymer (PMIP) was synthesized and used as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent for preconcentration of carbamazepine (CBZ) prior to its quantitation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in various sample forms (e.g., drinking water, river water, hospital wastewater, and pharmaceuticals). PMIP-CBZ was applied to a polymerization process in which polystyrene spheres were coated with a silica layer. Removal of polystyrene spheres and formation of porous silica facilitated the recovery of CBZ (99.4%) during the extraction process. Site accessibility to the surface of PMIP-CBZ increased the density of high recognition sites. PMIP-CBZ was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The key variables influencing the extraction efficiency of PMIP (e.g., adsorbent loading, eluent type, eluent volume, reusability of the adsorbent, and cross-reactivity) were optimized. The optimized protocol was successfully employed to quantify CBZ with limit of detection and limit of quantification as 0.082 and 0.270 ng/mL, respectively (linear detection range: 0.5-250 ng/mL and a relative standard deviation: < 5%). Use of the PMIP adsorbent resulted in a sensitive and stable method for efficiently quantitation of CBZ from various real sample matrices.

AB To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in the Karst river system in Kaiyang, Southwest China. Ten water samples were collected from the Karst river in Kaiyang, Southwest China. Thirty-five antibiotics, including nine sulfonamides, four tetracyclines, five macrolides, sixteen quinolones and chloramphenicol, were analyzed. The results suggest that antibiotics are widely prevalent in the Karst river, with macrolides and quinolones being the most dominant and occupying 47% and 43% of total antibiotic concentration, respectively. The maximum total concentrations of sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones were 30.4, 421, 884, and 1,807 ng/L, respectively. Lincomycin, roxithromycin, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were detected in all samples with a detection frequency of 100%. The main sources of antibiotics were wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rural dumps that did not contain sanitary treatment, which accounted for 33% and 40% of the total antibiotics present in the Karst river. Due to an increase in river flow quantity, the presence of WWTPs and rural dumps did not affect the concentration and distribution of antibiotics in the Karst river; however, the mass flux of antibiotics were significantly affected by the contamination source and the poor natural attenuation.

AB Toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) was applied to the effluent from a pharmaceutical industrial complex, following the US EPA TIE guidelines. The whole effluent toxicity (WET) test found toxicity greater than 16 toxic units (TU) in the effluent. Dissolved non-polar organic compounds were identified as the major contributor to the observed toxicity in the TIE manipulations in phases I and II. Among the 48 organic compounds identified, three compounds (i.e., acetophenone, benzoimide, and benzothiazole) were related to the pharmaceutical production procedure; however, no contribution to toxicity was predicted in the compounds. The results of the ECOSAR model, which predicts toxicity, indicated that the alkane compounds caused significant toxicity in the effluent. The toxicity test and heavy metal analysis, which used IC and ICP/MS, identified that particulate and heavy metals, such as Cu and Zn, contributed to the remaining toxicity, except dissolved organics. The results showed the applicability of the TIE method for predicting regional effluents produced by the industrial pharmaceutical complex in this study. Although the location was assumed to be affected by discharge of pharmaceutical related compounds in the river, no correlations were observed in the study. Based on the results, advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, are recommended for the wastewater treatment process in this location. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study compared the biosorption of tetracycline, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections, in aqueous solution under various conditions using two brown seaweeds commonly found in Hong Kong waters-Pachydictyon coriaceum and Sargassum hemiphyllum. Two environmental effects (temperature and shaking speed) and two chemical effects (pH and salinity) were investigated to determine the optimal conditions for sorption of tetracycline by biomass. It was found that the maximum biosorption capacity (q (max)) of tetracycline by the two types of seaweed was generally higher at lower temperature (15 A degrees C) and higher shaking speed (250 rpm). The sorption performances of P. coriaceum and S. hemiphyllum were better in slightly acidic solution (pH 3), with q (max) around 9 mg/g for P. coriaceum. Higher salinity (100 mM NaCl) reduced the sorption ability of both brown seaweeds by reducing the solubility of the aqueous tetracycline. It was found that S. hemiphyllum could tolerate and had higher sorption in a slightly saline solution (50 mM NaCl), while P. coriaceum performed better without the presence of NaCl. This study provides crucial information for achieving optimal sorption of aqueous tetracycline using P. coriaceum over S. hemiphyllum as an effective biomass for removing antibiotics in wastewater.

AB Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and dydrogesterone (DDG) are synthetic progestins widely used in human and veterinary medicine. Although aquatic organisms are exposed to them through wastewater and animal farm runoff, very little is known about their effects in the environment. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to MPA, DDG, and their binary mixtures at measured concentrations between 4.5 and 1663 ng/L. DDG and both mixtures impaired reproductive capacities (egg production) of breeding pairs and led to histological alterations of ovaries and testes and increased gonadosomatic index. Transcriptional analysis of up to 28 genes belonging to different pathways demonstrated alterations in steroid hormone receptors, steroidogenesis enzymes, and specifically, the circadian rhythm genes, in different organs of adult zebrafish and eleuthero-embryos. Alterations occurred even at environmentally relevant concentrations of 4.5-4.8 ng/L MPA, DDG and the mixture in eleuthero-embryos and at 43-89 ng/L in adult zebrafish. Additionally, the mixtures displayed additive effects in most but not all parameters in adults and eleuthero-embryos, suggesting concentration addition. Our data suggest that MPA and DDG and their mixtures induce multiple transcriptional responses at environmentally relevant concentrations and adverse effects on reproduction and gonad histology at higher levels.

AB A cloud point extraction (CPE) method was developed using silicone-ethylene oxide surfactant, DC193C, to study the equilibrium phase separation of parabens in environmental water samples. The volume of the surfactant rich phase (V-s), aqueous phase (V-w), preconcentration factor (C-F), distribution coefficient (K-d), and percentage of recovery (%R) were evaluated to obtain the optimum condition for phase separation of parabens. Satisfactory results were obtained whereby the preconcentration factor for methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and benzylparaben were close to 65, 60, 80, and 45, respectively, at 0.5% weight of surfactant. The presence of DC193C gave a low phase volume ratio but insignificant result was observed with the increased of surfactant concentration. The parabens were well separated on a reverse-phase Chromolith C-18 column (100mmx4.6mm) with a gradient elution (acetonitrile: water; 30:70 v/v) and detected at 254nm. The proposed method was successfully applied to environmental samples such as river water, treated wastewater, sea water, and tap water with satisfactory results. The method detection limit was 0.1-0.2 ppb and the recoveries were 71.2-97.7% with the relative standard deviations of 0.3-2.1%.

AB Despite the fact that some hydrophobic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been found to accumulate in river sediments, little is known about the contribution of these compounds to the toxicity of the whole sediment. We sampled river sediments from two urban creeks with an unsewered drainage area to investigate the toxicity for a benthic organism, Chironomus yoshimatsui. The concentrations of selected hydrophobic PPCPs, triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC) and galaxolide (HHCB) were analysed using gas chromatographic mass spectroscopy or liquid chromatographic mass spectroscopy and were found to lie within the range 50 to 200ngg(-1). The toxicity of the three individual contaminants for the chironomid was also determined. The toxicity of TCC was found to be the strongest, with an NOEC value of 2.5gg(-1). Combining the toxicity and measured environmental concentration, the ecological risk was assessed and the contribution of these contaminants to the whole sediment toxicity estimated, assuming additivity. The hazard quotient of all three compounds, determined without assessment factor, ranged between 0.01 and 0.1. The combined contribution of the three compounds to total sediment toxicity was as high as 8.2%, but other unknown factors may also make an important contribution.

AB The degradation and the mineralisation of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide were studied by an advanced electrochemical oxidation process, `electro-Fenton', which generates in situ hydroxyl radicals that are able to successfully oxidise or mineralise organic pollutants. In this study, a 0.1 mM (29.8 mg L-1) hydrochlorothiazide solution was completely oxidatively degraded in 15 min under constant current electrolysis at 500 mA. The absolute kinetic rate constant of the oxidation reaction was also determined as (4.37 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). The quasi-complete mineralisation of the solution was obtained with electrolysis for 6 h under the same applied current. Several oxidation reaction intermediates were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The formed carboxylic acids during the mineralisation process were also studied; oxamic, oxalic, acetic and maleic acids were identified and their concentrations were monitored throughout the electrolysis. The ions released during the treatment were also considered. Based on these data and the total organic carbon (TOC) removal results, a possible mineralisation pathway was proposed. These findings enable the conclusion that the electro-Fenton process is an efficient and environmentally-friendly method to eliminate the hazardous drug hydrochlorothiazide from an aqueous environment.

AB Conventional photocatalytic nanomaterials are not environmentally sustainable since these are usually produced from scarce mineral and metal precursors. Moreover, high pollutant removal efficiencies by conventional photocatalysts are only attained after several hours of reaction with light. In this study, novel visible light-active photocatalysts were synthesized from environment-friendly carbon precursors and applied for the rapid degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in aqueous solutions. The photocatalysts were prepared via the co-pyrolysis of urea with varying doping temperature and dopant amount. These variations played a vital role in improving the performance of the photocatalysts and resulted in up to >99% SMX removal within 45 min of visible light irradiation. Characterization of the photocatalysts showed that potassium and iodine dopants were responsible in the red shift and broadening of the light absorption spectrum to the visible region. In addition, the band gap energy narrowed by 0.23 eV resulting in faster charge transfer but slower recombination of the photo-generated electron and hole pairs. Effects of varying concentrations of inorganic salts (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, PO43-) on SMX removal were also examined. Lastly, the mechanism of SMX photodegradation was elucidated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, selective removal of acidic pharmaceutical from aqueous media was investigated. The purpose of this work was to use the multi template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for the selective extraction of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from aqueous samples. A multi template MIP was synthesized using a bulk polymerization method. The performance of the MIP in aqueous solutions was evaluated by optimizing several adsorption parameters. The optimized adsorption conditions were 50 mg of MIP, extraction time of 10 min and a sample pH of 4.6. The imprinting factors obtained for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were 1.25, 1.42, and 2.01, respectively, which corresponded to the selectivity order of diclofenac > ibuprofen > naproxen. Furthermore, the synthesized MIP showed great selectivity to the target compounds in the presence of gemfibrozil and fenoprofen. The data was modelled best by pseudo 2nd order which implied a chemisorption of pharmaceuticals onto MIP particles. Based on R-2 values, it was determined that the adsorption data fitted Langmuir isotherm which meant that the binding occurred on the homogeneous sites. The recovery in wastewater influent for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac was 38%, 69% and 87%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are persistently exposed to pharmaceutical pollutants, including carbamazepine. Despite the ubiquity and recalcitrance of carbamazepine, the effects of this pharmaceutical on freshwater ecosystems and communities are unclear. To better understand how carbamazepine influences the invertebrate community and ecosystem dynamics in freshwaters, we conducted a mesocosm experiment utilizing environmentally relevant concentrations of carbamazepine (200 and 2000 ng/L). Mesocosms were populated with four gastropod taxa (Elimia, Physa, Lymnaea and Helisoma), zooplankton, filamentous algae and phytoplankton. After a 31 d experimental duration, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to relate changes in the community structure and ecosystem dynamics to carbamazepine exposure. Invertebrate diversity increased in the presence of carbamazepine. Additionally, carbamazepine altered the biomass of Helisoma and Elimia, induced a decline in Daphnia pulex abundance and shifted the zooplankton community toward copepod dominance. Lastly, carbamazepine decreased the decomposition of organic matter and indirectly altered primary production and dissolved nutrient concentrations. Changes in the invertebrate community occurred through both direct (i.e., exposure to carbamazepine) and indirect pathways (i.e., changes in food resource availability). These data indicate that carbamazepine may alter freshwater community structure and ecosystem dynamics and could have profound effects on natural systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present study was to analyse the behaviour of activated carbon with different chemical and textural properties in nitroimidazole adsorption, also assessing the combined use of microorganisms and activated carbon in the removal of these compounds from waters and the influence of the chemical nature of the solution (pH and ionic strength) on the adsorption process. Results indicate that the adsorption of nitroimidazoles is largely determined by activated carbon chemical properties. Application of the Langmuir equation to the adsorption isotherms showed an elevated adsorption capacity (X-m = 1.04-2.04 mmol/g) for all contaminants studied. Solution pH and electrolyte concentration did not have a major effect on the adsorption of these compounds on activated carbon, confirming that the principal interactions involved in the adsorption of these compounds are non-electrostatic. Nitroimidazoles are not degraded by microorganisms used in the biological stage of a wastewater treatment plant. However. the presence of microorganisms during nitroimidazole adsorption increased their adsorption on the activated carbon, although it weakened interactions between the adsorbate and carbon surface. In dynamic regime, the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon was markedly higher in surface water and groundwater than in urban wastewaters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Compounds of emerging concern as new plant stressors linked to water

AB Global crop production is limited by water, nitrogen, and phosphorous availability. Reclaimed water and organic fertilizers, such as crop residues, animal manure, and biosolids, can mitigate these needs. However, these materials may contain different pollutants arising from, among others, human and veterinarian health care, industry, cleaning media, or leakages from plastics or textiles. The European PRIMA-DSWAP project deals with the risks derived from these practices in relation to the presence of the so-called contaminants of emerging concern, or CECs, while exploring possible technical and mitigation measures to minimize those impacts. Risk assessment analyses of the CEC presence in soils and water bodies have been mainly focused in their consequences for human and environmental health, but very little has been studied about their potential negative effects on crop performance and quality. Here we review the current knowledge on macroscopic and molecular plant responses to the presence of several CECs known to abound in reclaimed waters, manure, and biosolids, with particular emphasis on crop plants, when available. With this information, and with the analysis of the potential implications of scaling these effects to the commercial agricultural level, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the water reuse and biosolid application in agriculture in the context of circular economy.

AB Micro-estuarine ecosystems have a surface area <1 km(2) and are abundant in Mediterranean regions. As a result of their small size, these systems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chemical pollution. Due to the fluctuating flow conditions of base flow dominated by treated wastewater effluents and flood events transporting rural and urban non-point-source pollution, microestuaries are under a dynamic risk regime, consequently struggling to provide ecological services. This 2 year study explored the occurrence and risks of pharmaceutical contamination in the Alexander micro-estuary in Israel. Pharmaceuticals were detected in all samples (n = 280) at as high as 18 mu g L-1 in flood events and 14 mu g L-1 in base flow. The pharmaceutical mixture composition was affected by flow conditions with carbamazepine dominating the base flow and caffeine dominating flood events. The median annual risk quotients for fish, crustaceans, and algae were 19.6, 5.2, and 4.5, respectively, indicating that pharmaceuticals pose a high risk to the ecosystem. Ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and caffeine contributed most to the risk quotients. The current work highlights that micro-estuary ecosystems, like the Alexander estuary, are continuously exposed to pharmaceuticals and most likely to other pollutants, placing these ecologically important systems under an elevated risk in comparison to the more frequently studied large estuarine systems.

AB A BiOCl-Bi12O17Cl2 nanocomposite with a high visible-light response and a low photoinduced electron-hole pair recombination rate was successfully synthesized using an ultrasonic-hydrothermal method. The texture, structure, optical, and photocatalytic properties of the composite were characterized. The results showed that the composite had a sheet flower-like structure with a large specific surface area. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra and photoluminescence spectra showed that the composite had an excellent visible-light response and a low recombination rate of photoinduced electron hole pairs. The photocatalytic property of the composite was evaluated by the removal efficiency of rhodamine B and ciprofloxacin under visible-light illumination. The composite's reaction rate constant of removing rhodamine B (/ciprofloxacin) was approximately 8.14 (/4.94), 42.63 (/11.91) and 64.66 (/36.07) times that of Bi12O17Cl2, P25, and BiOCl, respectively. Furthermore, the composite showed a wide applicable pH range and excellent reusability. Mechanism analysis showed that photogenerated holes played a dominant role and center dot O-2- also contributed to photocatalytic degradation. In summary, this study presents a high-efficiency photocatalyst for wastewater treatment. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study deals with the potential of bioflocculant for the treatment of various industrial wastewaters. Bioflocculant (BFBl) produced by Bacillus licheniformis NJ3, showed 97% flocculating activity in primary screening (kaolin assay). The characteristics of the BFBl such as temperature and pH stability, cation-independency makes the flocculation process more economic as harmful coagulants and stabilizers are not required. BFBl efficiently treated synthetic wastewaters as compared to alum by reducing turbidity (69-87%), chemical oxygen demand (50-80%) and oil (87%). Further BFBl was used to treat pesticide, petroleum, pharmaceutical and starch processing industrial wastewaters having diversified pH. It reduced total suspended solids (61.9-80%), turbidity (54-94%), total dissolved solids (11-54%), oil and grease (75%) and heavy metals (62-100%) from wastewaters in the absence of cations without altering the temperature and pH. Additionally, Sludge settling process in the presence of BFBl was three times faster as compared to alum. Thus, BFBl successfully treats various wastewaters reducing multiple pollution indices. BFBl was a glycoprotein with 92% polysaccharide and 7% protein contents providing biodegradable nature. As a result, BFBl emerged as environment-friendly and economical alternative for the bioremediation of various industrial wastewaters.

AB Photoproducts of pharmaceuticals have been studied in order not to overlook their potential risks to aquatic organisms. However, no studies have verified an equation for predicting the fate of photoproducts in aquatic environment (Poiger equation) by field measurements, leaving uncertainties in its practical utility. Therefore, we conducted this study to test the applicability of the Poiger equation to 3-ethylbenzophenone (EBP), a photoproduct of ketoprofen (KTP). Photolysis experiments determined the fraction of KTP transformed into EBP as 0.744 +/- 0.074 and the quantum yield of EBP degradation as 0.000418 +/- 0.000090. Field studies in urban rivers and waste-water treatment plants (WWTPs) revealed that EBP was produced by sunlight, mainly in the rivers, but also appreciably in outdoor primary and secondary clarifiers in the WVVTPs. We developed a model in the secondary clarifiers, disinfection tanks, and rivers by incorporating the Poiger equation, which was effective at predicting the concentrations of EBP in the river waters and wastewaters. Thus, our first trial of verification by field measurements enhanced the practical utility of the Poiger equation, though further study including several photo products should be conducted.

AB In this study, a 3-L compartmentalized activated sludge (CAS) system with 6 compartments was designed and fabricated. In the start-up stage, pre-acclimatized inoculums were added into the CAS and the system was operated under certain operating conditions until the system performance remained at a steady state. The effects of two process variables (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and influent chemical oxygen demand (CODin)) on the reactor performance were investigated and the process was modeled and analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM). From the results, the ratio of food to microorganism (F/M) was found to be the most important factor for the process control. Maximum removal efficiency (89%) was determined at a MLVSS and CODin of 4800 and 2000 mg/L, respectively. Kinetic coefficients (Y and K-d) were determined as 0.0815 g VSSproduced/g CODrem and 0.009 d(-1), respectively. Biodegradation of Co-amoxiclav and ciprofloxacin were also investigated in the CAS system. The COD removal dropped from 29 to -18% after five turnovers (two days) for Co-amoxiclay. The process instability was also observed by a remarkable increase in effluent turbidity (>370 NTU) as a result of intensive biomass decomposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photocatalytic experiments on the pharmaceutical pollutant carbamazepine (CBZ) were conducted using sol-gel nitrogen-doped TiO2-coated glass slides under a solar simulator. CBZ was stable to photodegradation under direct solar irradiation. No CBZ sorption to the catalyst surface was observed, as further confirmed by surface characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of N-doped TiO2 surfaces. When exposing the catalyst surface to natural organic matter (NOM), an excess amount of carbon was detected relative to controls, which is consistent with NOM remaining on the catalyst surface. The catalyst surface charge was negative at pH values from 4 to 10 and decreased with increasing pH, correlated with enhanced CBZ removal with increasing medium pH in the range of 5-9. A dissolved organic carbon concentration of 5 mg/L resulted in similar to 20% reduction in CBZ removal, probably due to competitive inhibition of the photocatalytic degradation of CBZ. At alkalinity values corresponding to CaCO3 addition at 100 mg/L, an over 40% decrease in CBZ removal was observed. A 35% reduction in CBZ occurred in the presence of surface water compared to complete suppression of the photocatalytic process in wastewater effluent. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this interdisciplinary research project in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany, entitled "Elimination of pharmaceuticals and organic micropollutants from waste water" involved the conception of cost-effective and innovative waste-water cleaning methods. In this project in vitro assays, in vivo assays and chemical analyses were performed on three municipal waste-water treatment plants (WWTP). This publication focuses on the study of the in vitro bioassays. Cytotoxic, estrogenic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects of the original as well as enriched water samples were monitored before and after wastewater treatment steps using MTT and PAN I, ER Calux and A-YES, micronucleus and Comet assays as well as AMES test. In most cases, the measured effects were reduced after ozonation, but in general, the biological response depended upon the water composition of the WWTP, in particular on the formed by-products and concentration of micropollutants. In order to be able to assess the genotoxic and/or mutagenic potential of waste-water samples using bioassays like Ames test, Comet assay or micronucleus test an enrichment of the water sample via solid-phase extraction is recommended. This is in agreement with previous studies such as the "ToxBox"-Project of the Environmental Agency in Germany.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) has been solely employed for the removal of charged ions from water, showing limited feasibility compared to other conventional technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO). In this work, we propose to use CDI with activated carbon electrodes for simultaneous removal of inorganic salt and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs). This approach is based on the inherent sorption potential of activated carbon CDI electrodes towards organic species. We show that salt removal by CDI is only slightly affected by the presence of different TOrCs (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, estrone, and phentoxifylline). Sorption and removal of TOrCs (taking place concomitantly) was most effective for the hydrophobic compounds (bisphenol A and estrone) and was not affected by the presence of salt or the applied electric field. Sequential desorption of salt and TOrCs into two separated streams was achieved by short-circuiting the two electrodes and washing the electrodes with water and ethanol, respectively. Notably, the described process produces separate waste streams for salts (i.e., water) and organics (i.e, ethanol), which can facilitate their disposal or further treatment. Altogether, the study shows the high potential of the proposed CDI application, which may be valuable for treating water or wastewater streams contaminated with both salt and TOrCs.

AB Benzophenone-3 is an organic compound widely used as a UV filter, which has been reported as water pollutant and is connected with endocrine disruption in humans and animals. Expanded granular sludge beds (EGSB) are a form of an anaerobic digestion system, which has been successfully evaluated for wastewater treatment, and the removal of different compounds, however little is known about the effect of compounds as Benzophenone-3 in the performance of EGSB systems. In this study, we evaluate the effect of BP-3 on the performance, microbial structure and metabolism of EGSB reactors. For this purpose, biogas production, removal efficiencies of BP-3 and DQO were monitored. Changes in bacteria and archaea microbial structure were investigated using PCR-DGGE, and the effect on anaerobic metabolism was evaluated by measuring the expression of mcrA and ACAs genes through qRT-PCR. The systems remained stable and efficient throughout the operation stages, with CH4 percentages greater than 55% and COD and BP-3 removal percentages greater than 90%. The presence of different concentrations of Benzophenone-3 influenced the organization of microbial communities, especially archaea. However, this did not affect the stability and performance of the EGSB systems.

AB Fibrous silica-titania (FST) catalysts were synthesized by microemulsion followed by silica seed-crystal crystallization methods under various molar ratios of toluene to water (T/W). The catalysts were characterized by XRD, UV-DRS, FESEM, TEM, AFM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR, and ESR. The results revealed that altering the T/W ratio affected the growth of the silica and titania and led to different size, fiber density, silica-titania structure, and number of hydroxyl groups, as well as oxygen vacancies in the FSTs, which altered their behavior toward subsequent application. Photodegradation of ibuprofen (IBP) are in the following order: FST(6:1) (90%) > FST(5:1) (84%) > FST(7:1) (79%) > commercial TiO2 (67%). A kinetics study using Langmuir-Hinshelwood model illustrated that the photodegradation followed the pseudo-first-order and adsorption was the rate-limiting step. Optimization by response surface methodology (RSM) showed that the pH, initial concentration, and catalyst dosage were the remarkable parameters in photodegradation of IBP. The FST (6:1) maintained its photocatalytic activities for up to five cycles reaction without serious catalyst deactivation, and was also able to degrade other endocrine-disrupting chemicals, indicating its potential use for the treatment of those chemicals in wastewater.

AB The influence of key process parameters of homogenous catalytic ozonation using ferrous or manganese catalysts on the mineralization rate of salicylic acid (SA), model pharmaceutical pollutant, in water was investigated. In order to assess the combined influence and interactions of studied process parameters as well, the empirical/statistical approach applying Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. Three numerical and one categorical variables representing the key process parameters (initial pH, concentration of ozone, concentration and type of catalyst) were included in applied BBD. RSM models predicting the mineralization rate of SA in dependence on studied process parameters were developed, while their significance and accuracy were evaluated on the basis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and obtained statistical parameters (R-2, F, p). The developed models are characterized as highly accurate and predictive for the studied system behavior. Evaluation of the influence of all four process parameters showed that mineralization rate of SA strongly depends on the initial pH, ozone concentration and combined interactions between the initial pH and type of catalyst. When two processes, O-3/Fe2+ and O-3/Mn2+, were observed separately, significant differences between them were determined, particularly related with complexing chemistry of applied catalysts within the investigated pH range.

AB Nicotine, the main alkaloid of tobacco, is a non-prescription drug to which all members of a tobacco-smoking society are exposed either through direct smoke inhalation or through second-hand passive 'smoking'. Nicotine is also commercially available in some pharmaceutical products and is used worldwide as a botanical insecticide in agriculture. Nicotine dynamics in indoor and outdoor environments as well as the human excretions and the manufacturing process are responsible for its entry in the environment through municipal and industrial wastewater discharges. The presence of nicotine in surface and ground waters points out that it survives a conventional treatment process and persists in potable-water supplies. Complete removal of nicotine is instead reported when additional chlorination steps are used.
   In this paper a simulation of STP chlorination of nicotine and a genotoxic evaluation of its main degradation products are reported. Under laboratory conditions removal of nicotine seems not to be due to mineralization but to transformation in oxidized and chlorinated products. The by-products have been isolated after fractionation by diverse chromatographic procedures and their structures determined using mass spectrometry and H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. Preliminary genotoxic SOS Chromotests with Escherichia coli PQ37 evidence no toxicity of the products. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, Co3O4-carbon composite was synthesized by calcined metal organic framework (MOF) ZIF-67 and used as efficient catalysts for ozonation of norfloxacin (NOF). The MOF-derived Co3O4-C composite remained similar polyhedrons structure of ZIF-67, suggesting that Co3O4 was well-dispersed in Co3O4-C composite. Furthermore, a larger amount of surface carbon-oxygen functional groups were distributed on Co3O4-C composite, which resulted in the diversification of active sites for catalytic ozonation reaction. NOF degradation and mineralization could be effectively enhanced in Co3O4-C/O-3 process. Moreover, NOF mineralization by catalytic ozonation strongly depended on the solution pH, while other operational conditions, such as O-3 concentration and catalyst dosage had not obvious influence on it. Co3O4-C composite could significantly accelerate O-3 decomposition to produce active free radicals (such as center dot OH), which enhanced the mineralization of NOF. The possible catalytic mechanism of Co3O4-C composite was proposed. Additionally, after five consecutive use of Co3O4-C composite in catalytic ozonation process, there was no obvious decrease in TOC removal efficiency, indicating a stable performance of Co3O4-C composite, which was suitable for the catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment.

AB Due to large drug consumption, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) can be found as water contaminants. The removal of PhACs is a significant issue, as they can easily overtake traditional purification methods. Because of their surface properties, carbon nanomaterials are among the most efficient materials able to adsorb PhACs. However, their limitation is their recovery after use and their possible leakage into the aquatic system. Consequently, new hybrid supramolecular ionic liquid gels (HILGs) have been designed for the adsorption of some antibiotic drugs (ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid) from water. The chemical-physical properties of gels, such as the temperature of the gel-sol transition, morphology, and rheology, have been studied for their use as sorbents. These properties influence the gel removal efficiency of PhAC, i.e., the best system is the gel that presents weaker colloidal forces. A fast removal (RE = 51%) is obtained in 3 h for ciprofloxacin, while a slower adsorption process is observed for nalidixic acid (RE = 88% in 24 h). HILGs can be recycled up to seven cycles and regenerated. In addition, they can be used with higher concentrations or volumes of PhAC and in a realistic apparatus like dialysis membranes. These peculiarities suggest that HILGs can be competitive with more complex sorbent systems.

AB The emerging organic micro-pollutants, such as bisphenol A (BPA), chloroxylenol (PCMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ), have raised concerns owing to their adverse impact on human health and ecological security. In this study, a novel cyclodextrin polymer (beta-CDP) has been successfully prepared by nucleophilic substitution of beta-cyclodextrin with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFP). The removal of three emerging organic micro-pollutants (BPA, CBZ and PCMX) by beta-CDP under a single or mixture adsorption system was examined, and the adsorption behavior was investigated by adsorption kinetics and isotherm study. The maximum adsorption capacity of beta-CDP for BPA, PCMX and CBZ according to Langmuir isotherm in single system was 164.4, 144.1 and 136.4 mg/g, respectively. Compared with single system, the competitive adsorption of each pollutant on beta-CDP in mixture system was only slightly inhibited. Changing the pH, raising the presence of fulvic acid (FA) or ionic strength had no significant influence on the adsorption of BPA, PCMX and CBZ onto beta-CDP. The removal of these three organic micro-pollutants was related to the value of logK(ow) of the contaminants. These results demonstrated remarkable advantages of beta-CDP material relevant to organic micro-pollutants removal in wastewater treatment.

AB Emerging pollutants such as personal care products can reach the environment via effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and digested sludge. Only recently, the antidandruff agent and antimycotic climbazole was detected for the first time in a WWTP effluent with concentrations up to 0.5 mu g/L. Climbazole acts as a C14-demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and thus has a high efficacy against fungi, but knowledge of its potential environmental impact is lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize climbazole's ecotoxicity by conducting standard biotests with organisms representing different trophic levels from the aquatic as well as the terrestrial ecosystems. It was found that the toxicity of climbazole is mostly similar to that of other DMI fungicides, whereas it proved to be particularly toxic to primary producers. The lowest median effective concentrations (EC50s) were determined for Lemna minor, at 0.013mg/L (biomass yield), and Avena sativa, at 18.5mg/kg soil dry weight (shoot biomass). Reduction of frond size in water lentils and shoot length in higher plants suggested an additional plant growth-retarding mode of action of climbazole. In addition, it was demonstrated here that for an ionizable compound such as climbazole, the soil pH can have a considerable influence on phytotoxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:2816-2825.

AB Background This study analyzes the effectiveness of gamma irradiation in removing diatrizoate contrast from different water matrices: ultrapure water, surface water, groundwater and wastewater. The use of gamma irradiation for degradation is influenced by coexisting substances in natural waters and wastewaters. The influence of the presence of anions Cl-,NO2-,NO3-,SO42-andCO32-/HCO3- on the degradation of diatrizoate by gamma irradiation was investigated. Results Study results indicate that: (1) diatrizoate radiolysis fits pseudo-first-order kinetics; removal of91.9% of the diatrizoate was achieved at a dose of 1000Gy; (2) diatrizoate degradation depends on the type of water matrix, with the radiolysis being affected by the presence of anions, as follows: (i) high concentrations of Cl- increase the efficacy of the process; and (ii) low concentrations of NO2- markedly decrease the degradation rate, because nitrite ions act as scavengers of eaq-, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen radical; (3) TOC values showed that diatrizoate does not mineralize at a dose of 1000Gy. Conclusions Radiolysis degrades diatrizoate by more than 90%; results obtained indicate that it is not mineralized, with TOC values remaining constant in all waters studied.

AB Tylosin has been considered inhibiting COD removal in anaerobic digestion. In this study it is proven that this is not always the case. Accordingly, elevated concentrations of Tylosin (100-800mgL(-1)) could be tolerated by the anaerobic system. The influence of Tylosin concentrations on an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) was assessed using additions of Tylosin phosphate concentrate. Results showed high efficiency for COD removal (average 93%) when Tylosin was present at concentrations ranging from 0 to 400mgL(-1). However, at Tylosin concentrations of 600 and 800mgL(-1) treatment efficiency declined to 85% and 75% removal respectively. The impact of Tylosin concentrations on archaeal activity were investigated and the analysis revealed that archaeal cells dominated the reactor, confirming that there was no detectable inhibition of the methanogens at Tylosin levels between 100 and 400mgL(-1). Nevertheless, the investigation showed a slight reduction in the number of methanogens at Tylosin levels of 600 and 800mgL(-1). These results demonstrated that the methanogens were well adapted to Tylosin. It would not be expected that the process performance of the UASR would be affected, not even at a level well in excess of those appearing in real wastewater from a Tylosin production site.

AB Today, the presence of recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals or other organic compounds, is one of the main obstacles to the widespread implementation of water reuse. In this context, the development of innovative processes for their removal becomes necessary to guarantee effluent quality. This work presents the potentiality of magnetic nanoparticles immobilized on SBA-15 mesoporous silica as Fenton and photo-Fenton catalysts under visible light irradiation. The influence of the characteristics of the compounds and nanoparticles on the removal yield was investigated. Once the key aspects of the reaction mechanism were analyzed, to evaluate the feasibility of this process, an azo dye (Orange II) and an antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) were selected as main target compounds. The concentration of Orange II decreased below the detection limit after two hours of reaction, with mineralization values of 60%. In addition, repeated sequential experiments revealed the recoverability and stability of the nanoparticles in a small-scale reactor. The benchmarking of the obtained results showed a significant improvement of the process using visible light in terms of kinetic performance, comparing the results to the Fenton process conducted at dark. Reusability, yield and easy separation of the catalyst are its main advantages for the industrial application of this process.

AB Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot)-based advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) is an effective and clean way to remove sulfonamide antibiotics in water at ambient temperature and pressure. In this study, we systematically investigated the degradation kinetics of sulfamethazine (SMT) by(center dot)OH with a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The second-order rate constant (k) of SMT with(center dot)OH was experimentally determined to be 5.27 +/- 0.06 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)at pH 4.5. We also calculated the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors for the reactions by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP/6-31G*. The results revealed that(center dot)OH addition pathways at the methylene (C4) site on the pyridine ring and the ortho sites (C12 and C14) of the amino group on the benzene ring dominate the reaction, especially C14 site on the benzene ring accounted for 43.95% of SMT degradation kinetics. The theoreticalkvalue which was calculated by conventional transition state theory is 3.96 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), indicating that experimental observation (5.27 +/- 0.06 x 10(9)) is correct. These results could further help AOTs design in treating sulfonamide during wastewater treatment processes.

The capacity of UiO-66-NH2 was much higher than commercial activated carbon (AC) for the adsorption of PPCPs and it was because UiO-66-NH2 had a smaller pore size than AC. The UiO-66-NH2 also indicated some interactions, like pi-pi stacking and electrostatic interaction. The removal efficiency of diflunisal and salicylic acid from wastewater with the UiO-66-NH2 groups was higher than the original UiO-66. It could be explained with the acid-base attraction between the NH2 group of UiO-66-NH2 and the COOH group of diflunisal and salicylic acid. However, the performance of UiO-66-NH2 in the adsorption of carbamazepine was not very desirable. The base-base repulsion between the NH2 group of UiO-66-NH2 and the NH2 group of carbamazepine led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of UiO-66-NH2. The UiO-66-NH2 could be regenerated with ethanol and reused for the adsorption removal of the adsorbates.

AB The process of bank filtration acts as a barrier against many anthropogenic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and industrial products, leading to a substantial improvement of groundwater quality. The performance of this barrier is, however, affected by seasonal influences and subject to significant temporal changes, which have already been described in the literature. Much less is known about spatial differences when considering one field site. In order to investigate this issue, two undisturbed cores from a well-investigated bank filtration field site were sampled and operated in the course of a column study. The ultimate aim was the identification and quantification of heterogeneities with regard to the biodegradation of 14 wastewater derived micropollutants, amongst others acesulfame, gabapentin, metoprolol, oxypurinol, candesartan, and olmesartan. While six of the compounds entirely persisted, eight compounds were prone to degradation. For those compounds that were subject to degradation, degradation rate constants ranged between 0.2 day(-1) (gabapentin) and 31 day(-1) (valsartan acid). Further, the rate constants consistently diverged between the distinct cores. In case of the gabapentin metabolite gabapentin-lactam, observed removal rate constants differed by a factor of six between the cores. Experimental data were compared to values calculated according to two structure based prediction models.

AB Drinking water is most essential thing for life on earth. Due to environmental pollution day by day the quality and quantity of drinking water is lowering. Ground water tables are becoming contaminated due industrial pollution. Contamination level of antibiotics namely ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), oxytetracycline (OTC), doxycycline (DOX) were quantified in soil and underground water of surrounding areas of pharmaceutical industry in Lahore. HPLC with DAD detector, C-18 column and solid phase cartridges were used to analyze antibiotic residues. In groundwater DOX has highest mean level of contamination and OFL was determined as highest contaminating pollutant in soil. Highest detected value in groundwater of OFL was 0.50, CIP and LEV 0.20, DOX 0.80, OTC 0.40 ng/L. Ground water have residual level of CIP 0.01-0.20 ng/L, LEV 0.02-0.20 ng/L, OFL 0.01-0.50 ng/L, OTC 0.02-0.40 ng/L, and DOX 0.04-0.80 ng/L. Ground water was contaminated by these residues is very important as it is source of accumulation of antibiotics to human and animal body as well as to plants.

AB A huge amount of hazardous organopollutants, often persistent and toxic, is produced annually over the world and may contaminate soil, water, ground water, and air. Being from various sources such as wastewater, landfill leachates, and solid residues, xenobiotics include phenols, plastics, hydrocarbons, paints, dyes, pesticides and insecticides, paper and pulp mills, and pharmaceuticals. Among biological processes for degradation of xenobiotics, fungal ones, being eco-friendly and cost cheap, have been investigated extensively because most of basidiomycetes are more tolerant to high concentrations of pollutants. Fungal bioremediation is a promising technology using their metabolic potential to remove or reduce xenobiotics. Basidiomycetes are the unique microorganisms that show high capacities of degrading a wide range of toxic xenobiotics. They act via the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, including laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase. Their capacities to remove xenobiotic substances and produce polymeric products make them a useful tool for bioremediation purposes. During fungal remediation, they utilize hazardous compounds, even the insoluble ones, as the nutrient source and convert them to simple fragmented forms. The aim of this chapter is to elucidate the ability of basidiomycetes to degrade xenobiotics. This is an overview to present the importance of extracellular enzymes for efficient bioremediation of a large variety of xenobiotics.

AB The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is found worldwide in natural water bodies and toxicological investigations report harmful effects for aquatic species even at low concentrations. Diclofenac is one of the pharmaceutical substances on the first watch list of the European Water Framework Directive. If it will be categorized as a priority substance, emission limits will be established. One of the discussed methods of diclofenac reduction in wastewater are advanced oxidation processes. In this paper, the degradation of diclofenac in water was investigated using a sonoelectrochemical system, consisting of an ultrasound transducer with a frequency of 850 kHz and boron doped diamond electrodes. With the combination of acoustic cavitation and electrochemical oxidation, as advanced oxidation processes, more than 90% of diclofenac could be degraded within 5 min at an initial concentration of 50 mu g L-1. These studies provide optimization of ultrasound density, voltage and electrode positioning on diclofenac degradation. The reaction was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.505 min(-1). Samples were concentrated with solid phase extraction and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography using a diode array detector. The formation of oxidative species was visualized by chemiluminescence of luminol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A dispersive liquid-liquid micellar microextraction (DLLMME) method coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using Diode Array Detector (DAD) detector was developed for the analysis of five pharmaceutical compounds of different nature in wastewaters. A micellar solution of a surfactant, polidocanol, as extraction solvent (100L) and chloroform as dispersive solvent (200L) were used to extract and preconcentrate the target analytes. Samples were heated above critical temperature and the cloudy solution was centrifuged. After removing the chloroform, the reduced volume of surfactant was then injected in the UHPLC system. In order to obtain high extraction efficiency, the parameters affecting the liquid-phase microextraction, such as time and temperature extraction, ionic strength and surfactant and organic solvent volume, were optimized using an experimental design. Under the optimized conditions, this procedure allows enrichment factors of up to 47-fold. The detection limit of the method ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 mu g/L for the different pharmaceuticals. Relative standard deviations were <26% for all compounds. The procedure was applied to samples from final effluent collected from wastewater treatment plants in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), and two compounds were measured at 67 and 113 mu g/L in one of them.

AB The occurrence of a range of recalcitrant organic micropollutants in our aquatic environment has led to the development of various tertiary wastewater treatment methods. In this study, biogenic manganese oxides (Bio-MnOx), biogenic silver nanoparticles (Bio-Ag0) and ionic silver were used for the oxidative removal of the frequently encountered drug diclofenac and its dechlorinated form, 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA). Diclofenac was rapidly degraded during ongoing manganese oxidation by Pseudomonas putida MnB6. Furthermore, whereas preoxidized Bio-MnOx, Bio-Ag0 and Ag+ separately did not show any removal capacity for diclofenac, an enhanced removal occurred when Bio-MnOx and silver species were combined. Similar results were obtained for APA. Finally, a slow removal of diclofenac but more rapid APA degradation was observed when silver was added to manganese-free P. putida biomass. Combining these results, three mechanisms of diclofenac and APA removal could be distinguished: (i) a co-metabolic removal during active Mn2+ oxidation by P. putida; (ii) a synergistic interaction between preoxidized Bio-MnOx and silver species; and (iii) a (bio)chemical process by biomass enriched with silver catalysts. This paper demonstrates the use of P. putida for water treatment purposes and is the first report of the application of silver combined with biogenic manganese for the removal of organic water contaminants.

AB The widespread use of triclocarban (FCC) has led to its substantial release into aquatic environment. As an important microbial community in wastewater treatment, denitrifying cultures likely remove TCC and also may be affected by TCC which has not been revealed. This work therefore aims to add knowledge to these questions. Experimental results showed that 71.2 %-79.4 % of TCC was removed by denitrifying sludge in stable operation when TCC concentration was 1 - 20 mg/L. Mass balance analyses revealed that TCC was dominantly removed by adsorption rather than biodegradation, and non-homogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for this removal, with hydroxyl groups, amides and polysaccharides acting as the possible adsorption sites. Although the physicochemical properties of denitrifying cultures were unaffected after short-term exposure, long-term exposure to TCC deteriorated the settleability, dewaterability, flocculability and hydrophobicity of denitrifying biomass. It was observed that 20 mg/L TCC decreased denitrification efficiency by 70 % in long-term operation. Mechanism studies revealed that long-term exposure to TCC resulted in the increase of extracellular polymeric substances especially proteins, and the decrease of denitrifiers' activities. High-throughput sequencing revealed that TCC decreased the diversity of microbial community and the abundances of denitrifier genera such as Hyphomicrobium, Paracoccus, Saprospiraceae and unclassified-f-Rhodocyclaceae.

AB In view of the valorisation of the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus biomass, it was used for the biosorption of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, namely salicylic acid and ibuprofen, from water. Microalgae biomass was characterized, namely by the determination of the point of zero charge (pH(PZC)), by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Kinetic and equilibrium batch experiments were carried out and results were found to fit the pseudo-second order equation and the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. The Langmuir maximum capacity determined for salicylic acid (63 mg g(-1)) was larger than for ibuprofen (12 mg g(-1)), which was also verified for a commercial activated carbon used as reference (with capacities of 250 and 147 mg g(-1), respectively). For both pharmaceuticals, the determination of thermodynamic parameters allowed us to infer that adsorption onto microalgae biomass was spontaneous, favourable and exothermic. Furthermore, based on the biomass characterization after adsorption and energy associated with the process, it was deduced that the removal of salicylic acid and ibuprofen by Scenedesmus obliquus biomass occurred by physical interaction.

AB A rapid reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of paracetamol, ibuprofen, olanzapine, simvastatin and simvastatin acid in the context of microalgae bioremediation. The method was validated according to the guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and Eurachem with respect to system suitability, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, limits of detection and quantification, ruggedness, selectivity and specificity. The estimated limits of detection and quantification were, respectively, 0.03 and 0.10 mu g mL(-1) for paracetamol, 0.03 and 0.09 mu g mL(-1) for ibuprofen, 0.04 and 0.13 mu g mL(-1) for olanzapine, 0.27 and 0.83 mu g mL(-1) for simvastantin, and 0.05 and 0.14 mu g mL(-1) for simvastantin acid. The inter-day and intra-day precision results were within the acceptance limit of relative standard deviation (%RSD) of less than 2, and the percentage recovery was found to be within the required limits of 80-110%. The developed method is rapid, linear, precise, robust and accurate, and has been successfully applied to the determination of the above common pharmaceutical products during microalgae bioremediation.

AB This research aimed to further our understanding of how environmental processes control micropollutant dynamics in surface water systems as a means to predict peak concentration events and inform intermittent sampling strategies. We characterized micropollutant concentrations in daily composite samples from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station over 18 months. These data were compiled alongside environmental covariates, including daily measurements of weather, hydrology, and water quality parameters, to generate a novel data set with high temporal resolution. We evaluated the temporal trends of several representative micropollutants, along with cumulative metrics of overall micropollutant contamination, by means of multivariable analyses to determine which combination of covariates best predicts micropollutant dynamics and peak events. Peak events of agriculture-derived micropollutants were best predicted positive associations with turbidity and UV254 absorbance and negative associations with baseflow index. Peak events by of wastewater-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with alkalinity and negative associations with streamflow rate. We demonstrate that these predictors can be used to inform intermittent sampling strategies aimed at capturing peak events, and we generalize the approach so that it could be applied in other watersheds. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to contextualize micropollutant data derived from infrequent grab samples.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds like diclofenac (DFS), ibuprofen (IBP), and other drugs that persist in the environment are listed as emerging contaminants. These escape from normal wastewater treatment plants and find their way to water streams; therefore, alternate treatment processes are needed. Herein, a sorbent material is reported that is prepared through hydrotermal carbonization from dried fruit powder of Zizipus mauritiana L. (HTC-ZM) and applied for simultaneous removal of DFS and IBP. Carbonized material (HTC-ZM) was found as agglomerates of approximately 1 mu m particle size with surface area of 1160 m(2)/g having oxygen functional groups (e.g., COO, O, C=O) on surface. Simultaneous removal of IBP and DFS onto HTC-ZM was studied using response surface methodology with a set of 18 experiments using factors such as pH, amount of sorbent, contact time, and sorbate concentration. Maximum removal efficiency was obtained 88% and 97% for DFS and for IBP, respectively, with adsorption capacity of 2.03 mmol g(-1) for DFS and 2.54 mmol g(-1) for IBP. Kinetics modeling and "mean free energy" values predicted that sorption is mainly governed by physical interactions followed by "pore filling" mechanism for uptake of DFS and IBP.

AB In recent years, many studies have highlighted the consistent finding of tramadol (TRA) in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) and also in some rivers and lakes in both Europe and North America, suggesting that TRA is removed by no more than 36% by specific disinfection treatments. The extensive use of this drug has led to environmental pollution of both water and soil, up to its detection in growing plants. In order to expand the knowledge about TRA toxicity as well as the nature of its disinfection by-products (DBPs), a simulation of the waste treatment chlorination step has been reported herein. In particular, we found seven new by-products, that together with TRA, have been assayed on different living organisms (Aliivibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Daphnia magna), to test their acute and chronic toxicity. The results reported that TRA may be classified as a harmful compound to some aquatic organisms whereas its chlorinated product mixture showed no effects on any of the organisms tested. All data suggest however that TRA chlorination treatment produces a variety of DBPs which can be more harmful than TRA and a risk for the aquatic environment and human health.

AB Metronidazole (MNZ) is widely used in clinical applications and animal feed as an antibiotic agent and additive, respectively. Widespread occurrence of MNZ in wastewater treatment and hospital effluents has been reported. In this study, the mechanism of MNZ degradation in aqueous solutions via thermally activated persulfate (TAP) process was established under different conditions. The kinetic model was derived for MNZ degradation and followed pseudo-firstorder reaction kinetics and was consistent with the model fitted by experimental data (R-2 > 98.8%). The rate constant increased with the initial dosage of persulfate, as well as the temperature, and the yielding apparent activation energy was 23.9 kcal mol(-1). The pH of the solutions did not have significant effect on MNZ degradation. The degradation efficiency of MNZ reached 96.6% within 180 min for an initial MNZ concentration of 100 mg L-1 under the optional condition of [PS](0) = 20mM, T = 60 degrees C, and unadjusted pH. SO4- and HO center dot were confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra during TAP process. Radical quenching study revealed that SO4- was mainly responsible forMNZ degradation at an unadjusted pH. MNZ mineralization evaluation showed that the removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) reached more than 97.2%.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a bacteriostatic antibiotic ubiquitously found in the aquatic environment. Since conventional biological wastewater treatment is not efficient to remove SMX, photolysis in natural waters can represent an important transformation pathway. It was recently shown that SMX transformation products can retain antibiotic activity. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand photochemical processes occurring in natural water just as the formation of active transformation products (TPs).
   During long-term SMX photolysis experiments (one week), nine TPs were identified by reference standards. Moreover, five further TPs of photodecomposition of SMX were found. For the first time, a TP with m/z 271 [M + H](+) was observed during photolysis and tentatively confirmed as 4,x-dihydroxylated SMX. The DOC mass balance clearly showed that only around 5 to 10% were mineralized during the experiment emphasizing the need to elucidate the fate of TPs. Bacterial bioassays confirmed that the mixture retains its antibiotic toxicity toward luminescence (24 h) and that there is no change over the treatment time on EC50. In contrast, growth inhibition activity was found to slightly decrease over the irradiation time. However, this decrease was not proportional to the transformation of the parent compound SMX.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a persistent pharmaceutical compound, cannot be effectively removed (<10%) by conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study investigates the removal of this molecule in water solution using a photocatalytic process at 365 nm. Five commercial TiO2-based photocatalysts (P90, P25, UV100, PC500, and ST01) were tested over a range of operating parameters (type and concentration of photocatalysts, pH, treatment time, and light intensity). The best operating conditions for CBZ degradation in solution (99% CBZ removal) were obtained using P90 as photocatalyst at a concentration of 1.5 g/L for 90 min of treatment with a pH of 5.0 and a light intensity of 18.9 W/m(2). Under these conditions, removal of 74% of total organic carbon was recorded. This optimized photocatalytic process can treat either relatively high concentrations of CBZ (5 mg/L to 20 mg/L) or low concentrations of CBZ (37 mu g/L) in water. The initial rate of photocatalytic degradation of CBZ using P90 as photocatalyst can be described by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood CL-H) kinetic model with a reaction rate constant of 2.22 +/- 0.003 mg/L/min at ca. 20 degrees C.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of sixteen pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in mixed solutions with four types of water and two sets of UV radiation was investigated. UVC (254 nm) photolysis was ineffective at eliminating a large number of PhCs while a big number of them were refractory. However, vacuum UV (VUV: 185 nm + 254 nm) photolysis in the same experimental conditions eliminated the PhCs almost completely. The eliminations in ultrapure water (UPW), tap water (TW) and Neya River water (NRW) and their organic/inorganic contents were inversely correlated, which was more evident in VUV photolysis. Natural organic matter (NOM) in NRW did not have an impact in indirect photolysis, but effluent organic matter (EfOM) in secondary-treated effluent (NWTPE) enhanced indirect photolysis, which was more evident in VUV photolysis underlining the point that radiation wavelength/intensity can be a limiting factor in organic-rich waters. Moreover, VUV photolysis was far superior (90% mineralization) to UVC photolysis (10% mineralization) for PhCs mineralization. The greatly enhanced elimination and mineralization efficiencies observed for VUV photolysis were attributed to accelerated direct photolysis with 185 nm wavelength and indirect photolysis involving (OH)-O-center dot. The results demonstrated efficacy of VUV photolysis in wastewater treatment and its potential use as a tertiary treatment.

AB This study evaluates a novel adsorbent for ciprofloxacin (CPX) removal from water using a composite derived from municipal solid waste biochar (MSW-BC) and montmorillonite (MMT). The composite adsorbent and pristine materials were characterized using powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) before and after the adsorption. Batch experiments were conducted to study the mechanisms involved in the adsorption process. Ciprofloxacin sorption mechanisms were interpreted in terms of its pH-dependency and the distribution coefficients. The SEM images confirmed the successful binding of MMT onto the MSW-BC through flaky structure along with a porous morphology. Encapsulation of MMT onto MSW-BC was exhibited through changes in the basal spacing of MMT via PXRD analysis. Results from FTIR spectra indicated the presence of functional groups for both pristine materials and the composite that were involved in the adsorption reaction. The Hill isotherm model and pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models fitted the batch sorption data, which explained the surface heterogeneity of the composite and cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Changes made to the MSW-BC through the introduction of MMT, enhanced the active sites on the composite adsorbent, thereby improving its interaction with ionizable CPX molecules giving high sorption efficiency.

AB BACKGROUNDTetracycline (TC), a group of broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotics, has been detected in wastewater at concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to mg L-1. However, low biodegradation efficiencies of TC, especially at high concentrations, were obtained in conventional activated sludge processes. This study aimed to investigate the biodegradation and behavior of TC at high concentrations in an enriched mixed culture system.
   RESULTHigh TC removal efficiencies of 83.6 4.3% and 93.2 +/- 2.2% were obtained in two reactors with the addition of TC at 10 mg L-1 and 1 mg L-1, respectively. In the presence of TC, activated sludge floc size kept increasing and aggregation phenomena were observed. In addition, TC exposure decreased the microbial diversity and enriched the dominant bacteria. These effects were more prominent with higher TC concentration.
   CONCLUSIONTC at high concentrations could be effectively removed in enriched mixed culture, and biodegradation was the primary mechanism. TC induced the aggregation of activated sludge and the effect was more prominent under higher TC stress. The TC exposure affected the microbial communities of activated sludge, resulting in a decrease in microbial diversity and the enrichment of dominant bacteria. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This is the first study reporting the presence of endogenous caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline in all organs of poplar plants. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used in order to evaluate the uptake, translocation, and metabolism of caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) in Populus alba L. Villafranca clone grown in hydroponic conditions. We investigated the remediation of caffeine since it is one of the most widely consumed drugs and it is frequently detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents, surface water, and groundwater worldwide. Our results demonstrated that poplar can absorb and degrade exogenous caffeine without negative effects on plant health. Data showed that concentrations of all endogenous compounds varied depending on caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) treatments. In particular, in control conditions, endogenous caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were mainly distributed in roots. On the other hand, once caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) was provided, this compound and its dimethy-C-13 metabolites are mainly localized at leaf level. In conclusion, our results support the possible use of Villafranca clone in association with other water treatment systems in order to complete the process of caffeine remediation.

AB In this study, we investigated a protocatechuate catabolic gene cluster involved in naphthalene degradation in Rhodococcus ruber OA1. Rhodococcus ruber OA1 was isolated from the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant of Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Zibo, China). Substrate utilization tests showed that OA1 utilizes naphthalene, phenol, benzoate, salicylate, and protocatechuate as the sole carbon and energy sources for growth. A degradation assay revealed that phthalate is an intermediate in naphthalene degradation and that the protocatechuate pathway plays an important role in naphthalene degradation. To determine the genetic basis and regulation of protocatechuate catabolism in OA1, a fosmid genomic library was constructed and a positive clone carrying the protocatechuate degradation gene cluster was isolated. Sequencing and a bioinformatics analysis identified the complete gene cluster, pcaJIGHBARC, responsible for protocatechuate degradation. Based on this gene cluster, the genes pcaGH (encoding the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, 3,4-PCD) were coexpressed and the expressed products showed 3,4-PCD activity. This study illustrates a potential pathway of naphthalene degradation and identifies a protocatechuate pathway in Rhodococcus ruber OA1 for the first time, thus extending our understanding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and the related aromatic compounds degraded in the process.

AB A new technology based on laccase immobilized over ceramic membranes was formerly developed for the degradation of antibiotics from wastewaters. This work has been pointed to the determination of the economic aspects of this new enzymatic decontamination technology. These calculations have been based on previous modeling and simulations of real scale processes for tetracycline degradation in municipal, hospital and industrial WWTP effluents. A mathematical cost estimation model, originally developed for petrochemical wastewater treatment by ceramic membranes, has been adapted for the proposed enzymatic technology and applied to the subsequent economic viability analysis of the different designed processes in order to determine the competitiveness of this new technology compared to alternative decontamination technologies. Finally, some aspects where the new investigation efforts should be focused on to improve the process competitiveness and overcome the identified economic drawbacks have been proposed. Multi-objective optimization tools were employed to determine the magnitude of the required improvements in three main reactor characteristics: enzymatic kinetics, reactor effective lifetime, and membrane conditioning or regeneration costs. Under these improved conditions, the technology could be considered as a competitive alternative with specific total costs around 1 (sic)/m(3). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A significant percentage of bisphenol A and nonylphenol removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants relies on biodegradation. Nonetheless, incomplete information is available concerning their degradation pathways performed by microbial communities in activated sludge systems. Hydroquinone dioxygenase (HQDO) is a specific degradation marker enzyme, involved in bisphenol A and nonylphenol biodegradation, and it can be produced by axenic cultures of the bacterium Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP3. Proteomics, a technique based on the analysis of microbial community proteins, was applied to this strain. The bacterium proteome map was obtained and a HQDO subunit was successfully identified. Additionally, the reliability of the applied proteomics protocol was evaluated in activated sludge samples. Proteins belonging to Sphingomonas were searched at decreasing biomass ratios, i.e. serially diluting the bacterium in activated sludge. The protein patterns were compared and Sphingomonas proteins were discriminated against the ones from sludge itself on 2D-gels. The detection limit of the applied protocol was defined as 10(-3) g TTNP3 g(-1) total suspended solids (TSSs). The results proved that proteomics can be a promising methodology to assess the presence of specific enzymes in activated sludge samples, however improvements of its sensitivity are still needed.

AB Biodegradation of select endocrine-disrupting compounds (17 beta-estradiol, estrone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, 4-nonylphenol, 4-nonylphenol-monoexthoylate, and 4-nonylphenoldiethoxylate) was evaluated in stream biofilm, sediment, and water matrices collected from locations upstream and downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge. Both biologically mediated transformation to intermediate metabolites and biologically mediated mineralization were evaluated in separate time interval experiments. Initial time intervals (0-7 d) evaluated biodegradation by the microbial community dominant at the time of sampling. Later time intervals (70 and 185 d) evaluated the biodegradation potential as the microbial community adapted to the absence of outside energy sources. The sediment matrix was more effective than the biofflm and water matrices at biodegrading 4-nonyl-phenol and 17 beta-estradiol. Biodegradation by the sediment matrix of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol occurred at later time intervals (70 and 185 d) and was not observed in the biofilm or water matrices. Stream biofilms play an important role in the attenuation of endocrine-disrupting compounds in surface waters due to both biodegradation and sorption processes. Because sorption to stream biofilms and bed sediments occurs on a faster temporal scale (<1 h) than the potential to biodegrade the target compounds (50% mineralization at >185 d), these compounds can accumulate in stream biofilms and sediments.

AB The concerns regarding the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants have been increased in the last decades. Gatifloxacin (GAT), the fourth generation of fluoroquinolones, has been widely used to treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and has a limited metabolization. The present study aimed to evaluate the ozonation as a technique to degrade GAT. A UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the residual of GAT and to assess its degradation products. The removal efficiency was higher at alkaline condition (pH = 10), reaching up to 99% of GAT after 4 min. It was also observed that the first ozone attack on the GAT molecule was through the carboxylic group. In contrast, at acid conditions (pH = 3), the ozone attack was first to the piperazinyl ring. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis as test organisms, and it was observed that the residual activity reduced most at the alkaline conditions. In contrast, the best condition to remove the residual toxicity evaluated for the marine bacteria V. fischeri was the acidic one. Due to this, the ozonation seemed to be an exciting process to remove GAT at aqueous media.

AB Antibiotic pollution is one of the factors contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment. Advanced oxidation and irradiation processes have been introduced to eliminate antibiotics from water and wastewater. However, few studies have reported the toxic effects of residual antibiotics and their byproducts induced by a treatment system. In this study, we compared the efficacies of chemical (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and biological (antimicrobial susceptibility test) assays for measuring the concentrations of residual antibiotics after gamma irradiation for degrading amoxicillin, cephradine, lincomycin, and tetracycline. The concentrations of residual antibiotics estimated using the two assay methods were almost identical, except cephradine. In the case of cephradine, inhibited bacterial growth was observed that was equivalent to twice the concentration measured by HPLC in the samples subjected to gamma irradiation. The observed inhibition of bacterial growth suggested the generation of potentially toxic intermediates following antibiotic degradation. These results indicate that biological and chemical assays should be used in concert for monitoring antibiotic contamination and the toxic derivatives of antibiotic degradation. The results demonstrate that these four antibiotics can be decomposed by 2.0 kGy gamma-irradiation without toxic effects of their byproducts.

AB Concerns about environmental pollution from antibiotics such as amoxicillin have received increasing attention. These compounds should be eliminated from discharged effluents to avoid their possible negative effects on humans and animals, as well as on the environment. Recently, advanced oxidation techniques have been used to remove antibiotics. This work aims to study the removal of amoxicillin using a photocatalysis/ozonation process for treating pharmaceutical wastewater loaded with this type of refractory pollutants. The removal process was carried out using different pH values (3-11), catalyst dosages (250-750 mg/L), and reaction times (30-90 min), at an ozonation rate of 200 mg/h. Statistical analysis indicated that a quadratic model was suitable for modeling amoxicillin degradation by the photocatalytic process and that all studied parameters had statistically significant critical levels. Under optimum conditions (pH 11, a catalyst dose of 500 mg/L, and a reaction time of 90 min), the amoxicillin degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic process was 78.7%. The results of the photocatalysis/ozonation process indicated that after 90 min of ozone injection, an amoxicillin degradation efficiency of 98.7% was obtained. Therefore, it was concluded that the combined ozonation process and photocatalytic process could be used to remove amoxicillin effectively.

AB The behavior of ibuprofen (IBU) during the startup phase of a microfiltration membrane bioreactor (MBR) was determined. A full-scale experimental installation treating real urban wastewater was used for the study. The MBR was composed of an anoxic and an aerobic bioreactors working in pre-denitrification configuration, followed of a membrane reactor. A full mass balance was carried out to estimate the contribution of biotransformation and sorption to biomass to the overall removal of the IBU. During the startup phase of the MBR system there were significant oscillations of the operational variables, mainly of the sludge retention time (SRT); nevertheless, the capacity of the system for IBU removal was very high, with yields of over 94%, despite reaching minimum SRT values of 4.15 d. The main IBU removal occurs in the aerobic reactor, both in the liquid phase and the one associated with the sludge, while in the anoxic bioreactor the removal was scarce, although a certain transfer of IBU from the liquid phase to the sludge took place under anoxic conditions. Despite the high IBU removal yields during startup, the SRT was the most influential variable in IBU removal, an effect observed in all bioreactors, particularly in the anoxic one.

AB One of the main pursuits, yet most difficult, in monitoring studies is to identify the sources of environmental pollution. In this study, we have identified health-care facilities from south European countries as an important source of pharmaceuticals in the environment. We have estimated that compounds consumed in by the elderly and released from effluents of senior residences can reach river waters at a concentration higher than 0.01 mu g/L, which is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) threshold for risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals in surface waters. This study has been based on five health institutions in Portugal, Spain, and France, with 52 to 130 beds. We have compiled the pharmaceuticals dispensed on a daily base and calculated the consumption rates. From 54.9 to 1801 g of pharmaceuticals are consumed daily, with laxatives, analgesics, antiepileptics, antibiotics, and antidiabetic agents being the main drug families administered. According to excretion rates, dilution in the sewerage system, and elimination in wastewater treatment plants, macrogol, metformin, paracetamol, acetylcysteine, amoxicillin, and gabapentin, among others, are expected to reach river waters. Finally, we discuss the risk management actions related to the discharge of pharmaceuticals from senior residences to surface waters.

AB Because aquatic insects use histamines as neurotransmitters, adverse impacts on aquatic insects living in aquatic environments that receive antihistamines with wastewater effluent are plausible. In this study, we exposed damselfly larvae to low concentrations of two commonly used antihistamines (Hydroxyzine and Fexofenadine, 360 +/- 42 and 2200 +/- 43 ng 1(-1), respectively), and recorded damselfly larvae behavior before and after exposure. Further, after the second set of behavioral assays was performed, we quantified bioconcentration of the antihistamines in the damselfly bodies. Our results showed significant changes in damselfly behavior following antihistamine exposure. After Hydroxyzine exposure, the damselfly larvae became less active, and they showed reduced fleeing response (i.e. increased boldness) after being exposed to Fexofenadine, the latter also being significantly different from the non-exposed (control) individuals. Further, we found high levels of bioconcentration in the damselflies; Hydroxyzine showed an average bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 2000. As such, our results indicate that low concentrations of antihistamines can have sub-lethal effects on aquatic insects manifested as behavioral changes, and that bioconcentration of these substances can be high. Therefore, the need to investigate the impact of emergent aquatic contaminants also on aquatic insects, and on behaviors that are of ecological importance, is further highlighted.

AB Nano-functionalized products such as UV protective paints additives, antimicrobial food packaging, and fuel additives offering reduced CO2 emissions have the potential to secure a significant Irish market share in the near future. This scoping study gives a first estimation of nanomaterial surface water concentrations and population ingestional exposure through drinking water resulting from these products. As nanomaterial behavior in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs) is currently unclear, bridging data relating to potentially relevant materials (pharmaceuticals and metal removal efficiencies in WWTPs; pathogen removal efficiencies in WTPs) are employed in this study. Mean nanomaterial removal efficiencies of 59.8% and 70.2% were predicted for Irish WWTPs, between 96.95% and 0% for Irish WTPs. Predicted nano-scale TiO2 concentrations in surface waters (resulting from exterior paints) were 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of Ag (resulting from food packaging) and CeO2 (resulting from fuel additives), respectively. Predicted surface and drinking water concentrations were unlikely to pose any ecotoxicological or human health risk, although nano-scale TiO2 and Ag may warrant monitoring as part of standard surface water monitoring schemes. Future research should be directed toward characterizing the behavior of different categories of nanomaterials within WWTP processes.

AB This work describes a rapid solvent-minimized process to effectively determine four common paraben preservatives (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butyl-paraben) in surface water samples. The method involved the use of a combination of a novel ultrasound-assisted simultaneous-silylation within dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UASS-DLLME) with detection by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To overcome the challenges related to the different experimental conditions, multivariate experimental design approaches conducted by means of a multilevel categorical design and a Box-Behnken design were utilized to screen and optimize parameters that have significant influences on the efficiency of silylation and extraction. The method was then validated and shown to provide low limits of quantitation (LOQs; 1-5 ng L-1), high precision (3-11%), and satisfactory mean spiked recoveries (accuracy; 79-101%). Upon analyzing samples of surface water obtained from the field, we found that, in total, there was a relatively high concentration of the target parabens ranging from 200 to 1389 ng L-1. The sources of the elevated levels of these parabens may be from the release of untreated municipal wastewater in this region, and also due to the widespread application of parabens in personal care and food products.

AB Boron and Nitrogen co-doped carbon nanotubes incorporated iron carbide (Fe3C) nanoparticles (Fe3C@BN-C) were successfully prepared by one-step pyrolysis method employing melamine, ferric chloride and boric acid as precursors. Characterizations indicate that the catalyst has large specific surface area (258.17-305.74 m(2)/g) and abundant defect sites, which are closely related to the adsorption performance and catalytic efficiency of the catalysts. In the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the removal rates of Fe3C@BN-C-7, Fe3C@BN-C-8 and Fe3C@BN-C-9 for doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX-H) are 87.0%, 91.9% and 86.0% within 120 min. Fe3C nanoparticles, oxygen-containing functional groups, pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphite N and B, N dopants play a vital role in the improvement of catalytic activity. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies show that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) is dominant reactive oxygen species, demonstrating that the degradation reaction predominantly follows the non-radical oxidation pathway. The possible degradation pathway of DOX-H is proposed and 14 intermediate products are reported for the first time. This work not only provides a novel and valuable catalyst for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, but also reveals a new perspective for the study of activated PMS dominated by non-radical pathway.

AB An innovative process based on the combination of a UASB reactor and an IFAS system is proposed in order to combine different redox conditions and biomass conformations to promote a high microbial diversity. The objective of this configuration is to enhance the biological removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) as well as to achieve the abatement of nitrogen by using the dissolved methane as an inexpensive electron donor. Results showed high removals of COD (93%) and dissolved methane present in the UASB effluent (up to 85%) was biodegraded by a consortium of aerobic methanotrophs and heterotrophic denitrifiers. Total nitrogen removal decreased slightly along the operation (from 44 to 33%), depending on the availability of electron donor, biomass concentration, and configuration (floccules and biofilm). A high removal was achieved in the hybrid system (> 80%) for 6 of the studied OMPs. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, naproxen, and estradiol were readily biotransformed under anaerobic conditions, whereas ibuprofen or bisphenol A were removed in the anoxic aerobic compartment. Evidence of the cometabolic biotransformation of OMPs has been found, such as the influence of nitrification activity on the removal of bisphenol A, and of the denitrification activity on ethinylestradiol removal.

AB The widespread occurrence of natural and synthetic organic chemicals in surface waters can cause ecological risks and human health concerns. This study measured a suite of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 8 around the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area. The results showed that 109 of 144 analyzed pharmaceutical compounds, 42 of 55 analyzed waste-indicator compounds (e.g., flame retardants, hormones, and personal care products), and 39 of 72 analyzed pesticides were detected in the water samples collected monthly between April and November in both 2014 and 2015. Pharmaceutical compounds were most abundant in the surface waters and their median concentrations were measured up to a few hundred nanograms per liter. The CEC concentrations varied depending on sampling locations and seasons. The primary source of CECs was speculated to be wastewater effluent. The CEC concentrations were correlated to streamflow volume and showed significant seasonal effects. The CECs were less persistent during spring runoff season compared with baseflow season at most sampling sites. These results are useful for providing baseline data for surface CEC monitoring and assessing the environmental risks and potential human exposure to CECs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of nanoconcentrations of persistent pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater effluent and in surface water has been frequently reported. A novel organic inorganic hybrid sorbent based on adsorbing quarternized poly vinyl-pyridinium-co-styrene (QPVPcS) to montmorillonite (MMT) was designed for the removal of the anionic micropollutants. QPVPcS-clay composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR., thermal gravimetric analysis, Zeta potential and element analysis. Based on these measurements polymer clay micro- and nanostructures, as a function of polymer loading, were suggested. The affinity of the anionic pharmaceutical, diclofenac (DCF), to the composite was high and did not decrease dramatically with an increase of ionic strength, indicating that the interactions are not only electrostatic. The presence of humic acid (HA) did not hinder DCF removal by the composite; whereas, its filtration by granulated activated carbon (GAG) was compromised in the presence of HA. The kinetics and adsorption at equilibrium of DCF to the composite and to GAG were measured and modeled by the time dependent Langmuir equation. The adsorption of DCF to the composite was significantly faster than to GAG. Accordingly, the filtration of micro- and nanoconcentrations of DCF by composite columns, in the presence of HA, was more efficient than by GAG columns.

AB Adsorbed polymers show stabilization-flocculation properties of colloidal suspension and they are widely used in technological applications (chemical and pharmaceutical industries, food processing, drinking water purification and wastewater treatment). Thus, the influence of polyacrylic acid (PM) addition on the stability of synthesized alumina suspension as a function of solution pH was studied. The changes of the examined systems stability in time were monitored using the turbidimety method. It was shown that the alumina suspension without the polymer is the most stable at pH 3 (electrostatic stabilization), whereas at the pH values 6 and 9 the systems are unstable (coagulation). The addition of PM with the lowest molecular weight (i.e. 2000) at pH 3 causes large deterioration of the system stability (destabilization by charge neutralization), whereas at the pH values 6 and 9 significant improvement of analogous system stability is observed (electrosteric stabilization). PAAs with higher molecular weights (100 000 and 240 000) cause stabilization of the alumina suspension in the whole range of studied pH. At pH 3 it is rather steric stabilization. On the other hand, at the pH values 6 and 9 the steric mechanism of stabilization is combined with the electric one, leading to electrosteric interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutants and micro-organisms are major concerns for indirect potable reuse of municipal wastewater. In this study, the retention of pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals and micro-organisms in real membrane bioreactor (MBR) permeate matrix and in ultrapure water matrix by nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) process, and the impact of their retention on NF/RO membrane fouling, were investigated. NF 90 and ESPA2 membranes were chosen for this work. The RO membrane showed high retention for most of the molecules tested, whereas the NF membrane exhibited some variation in the retention of pesticides. The retention of pesticides and metals was enhanced by their interactions with the MBR permeate, while an almost complete retention of PAHs and micro-organisms was observed in both matrices. The presence of PAHs in the MBR permeate increased the permeability of the RO membrane, whereas no such effect was observed for pesticides, metals and micro-organisms. Also, phage leakage was detected when the NF/RO membrane was contaminated by bacteria, which may have caused a slight membrane damage. Pesticide rejection was found to be related to LogKow and molecular weight in ultrapure water at low concentrations (mu g/L level).

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have emerged as a group of potential environmental contaminants of concern. PPCPs in soil may enter terrestrial food webs via plant uptake. We evaluated uptake of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and triclosan in bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown in sand and soil. The extent of uptake and accumulation of EE2 and triclosan in plants grown in sand was higher than in plants grown in soil. In sand (conditions of maximum contaminant bioavailability), bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of EE2 and triclosan in roots (based on dry weights) were 1424 and 16,364, respectively, whereas BCFs in leaves were 55 for EE2 and 85 for triclosan. In soil, the BCF of EE2 decreased from 154 in the first week to 32 in the fourth week while it fluctuated in leaves from 18 to 20. The BCF for triclosan in plants grown in soil increased over time to 12 in roots and 8 in leaves. These results indicate that the potential for uptake and accumulation of PPCPs in plants exists. This trophic transfer pathway should be considered when assessing exposure to certain PPCPs, particularly with the use of recycled wastewater for irrigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Degradation of the Fluoxetine, as commonly used antidepressant pharmaceutical, from aqueous media with different oxidation processes including ozonation and catalytic ozonation (in the presence of nano-boehmite and nano-gamma-alumina) was studied in a batch reactor. The catalysts were synthesized via the co-precipitation route. Then, kinetic study of catalytic ozonation process for elimination of Fluoxetine in water was performed. The kinetic of the degradation process was properly fitted to the pseudo first-order equation. The influence of operational parameters, such as pH of solution, scavenger compound (tert-butyl alcohol) and two-type anions (phosphate and nitrate), on Fluoxetine degradation efficiency was studied. The influence of water pH presented that hydroxyl groups of surface are considered as the major active site in the catalytic ozonation of Fluoxetine for the(center dot)OH radical production in water for nano-boehmite but not for nano-gamma-alumina. It was found that the Fluoxetine removal efficiency remarkably increased for catalytic ozonation in comparison with ozonation process in a batch reactor at pH 7. Finally, two-reaction mechanisms were offered for catalytic ozonation of Fluoxetine in aqueous medium by boehmite and gamma-alumina nanocatalysts.

AB The frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in domestic wastewater has caused great concern. In this study, the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals (Roxithromycin, ROX; Sulfamethoxazole, SMZ) in aerobic granular sludge (AGS) reactors was investigated under condition of different C/N (carbon to nitrogen) ratios. Results showed that higher removal efficiencies of ROX and SMZ (95.2 % and 92.9 %) were achieved in the AGS reactor fed with low C/N influent. Batch experiments further revealed that the removal of ROX was influenced by the adsorption ability of the AGS while SMZ removal was mainly enhanced by biodegradation process. Analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed that the humic acid-like substances were enriched under low C/N condition, which was in accordance with dynamic change of microbial community. The microbes, like Thauera spp. and Xanthomonadaceae, were highly enriched in the reactor with high nitrogen loading rate and functioned as refractory organics degrader. Overall, the AGS process could achieve enhanced pharmaceuticals removal performance by the regulation of microbial community under low C/N influent, which provides insights into a feasible solution for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and trace organic pollutants in AGS reactor.

AB Eliminating pharmaceutical active compounds from source-separated urine is essential for nutrient recovery and reducing the contaminant load to wastewater treatment plants. However, limited oxidation treatment processes have shown satisfactory performance due to strong scavenging effect of urine components. This study proposed a heterogeneous catalytic system by combining biochar with peroxydisulfate (PDS), which effectively removed sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its major human metabolite, N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (NSMX) in urine. The performance of biochar/PDS was investigated in both a complete-mixing reactor and a biochar-packed column. Interestingly, urine components slightly inhibited the degradation of sulfonamides in biochar suspension but significantly improved their removal in biochar-packed column. Further investigation elucidated the PDS activation process and the effects of the main urine components, which explained the different results in biochar suspension and biochar-packed column. The biochar/PDS system mainly produced center dot OH radical, singlet oxygen and surface-bound radicals (SBR), which transformed SMX to products of no apprarent antimicrobial properities. A cost-effective two-stage process was designed utilizing SBR as the major reactive species. This study may help to improve the understanding of the catalytic role of biochar and provide cost-effective treatment options for urine. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clean water became one of the major concerns of the 21st century. The occurrence of micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems poses serious public health and environmental problems, leading to true challenges in the development of sustainable and cost-effective alternative technologies for wastewater treatment processes. As a result, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been emerging as easy-to-prepare, inexpensive, and environmentally benign media showing a high potential for water applications. The main goal of this work is the development of hydrophobic DESs for the removal of ciprofloxacin, identified as one of the top 10 priority micropollutants, from water environments. In particular, DESs composed of natural neutral components, such as menthol and fatty acids, and also DESs based on the combination of quaternary ammonium salts and natural fatty acids were evaluated as potential extractants. The molar ratio of C-12:C-10 displays the second highest solubility value of ciprofloxacin and the lowest water solubility, which leads to the best extraction efficiency of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, extraction efficiencies were maximized by optimizing the experimental factors using a central composite design combined with a response surface methodology. Finally, aiming at full sustainability, a circular process was developed by recycling and reusing the hydrophobic DES through the use of activated carbon.

AB Plant uptake of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasingly leading to concerns about their potential exposure to humans and wildlife via dietary intake. Due to the extraordinary ability of biochars to bind organic compounds, plant uptake experiments were conducted to assess the effect of soil-amendment of three different biochars on the uptake of APIs from spiked soil.
   Pot experiments were undertaken to assess the extent of sorption and corresponding bioaccessibility of two APIs (carbamazepine - CBZ and propranolol -PRL) to ryegrass (Lolium perenne) grown in an API-spiked loamy sand, with and without biochar amendment (5 t/ha equivalent). The soil was amended with three different biochars produced from eucalyptus wood and wheat residues.
   Both APIs were taken up by ryegrass, with CBZ preferentially accumulated (14.3 mg/kg CBZ, 3.8 mg/kg PRL in unamended soil) due to its comparatively high concentration in porewater. Soil amendment with biochars increased partitioning of the two APIs by up to three- fold, with corresponding decreases in porewater (34-72 % of unamended soil) and plant tissue (17-64 %) concentrations.
   Biochars were effective in reducing the uptake of APIs into plant tissues from a contaminated soil and may be effective in the management of API residues in contaminated soils.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a pharmaceutical residue, which is persistent and mobile in soils, shows low biodegradability, and is frequently found in the different aquatic compartments, can be found at very low concentrations in water intended for human consumption. In conditions compatible with industrial practices, the kinetic reactivity and performance of tap water purification using activated carbon powder (ACP) are examined here using two extreme mass ratios of SMX to ACP: 2 mu g/L and 2 mg/L of SMX for only 10 mg/L of ACP. In response to surface chemistry, ACP texture and the intrinsic properties of SMX in water at a pH of 8.1, four kinetic models, and two monosolute equilibrium models showed a total purification of the 2 mu g/L of SMX, the presence of energetic heterogeneity of surface adsorption of ACP, rapid kinetics compatible with the residence times of industrial water treatment processes, and kinetics affected by intraparticle diffusion. The adsorption mechanisms proposed are physical mechanisms based mainly on pi-pi dispersion interactions and electrostatic interactions by SMX-/Divalent cation/ArO- and SMX-/Divalent cation/ArCOO- bridging. Adsorption in tap water, also an innovative element of this study, shows that ACP is very efficient for the purification of very slightly polluted water.

AB Unplanned and unmonitored developmental activities have resulted in a rapid emergence of pollutants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment. These PPCPs are considered as potential health hazards. A wide variety of physical, biological and chemical processes are presently being investigated for ensuring the efficient removal of such pollutants from effluents. The present study investigates the potential of graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) for removal of a common and extensively used drug, Carbamazepine (CBZ) from aqueous solutions. Batch studies were performed to assess the potential of graphene oxide for adsorption of CBZ under different conditions of initial CBZ concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature and solution pH. Process optimization was performed using Response Surface Methodology and Artificial Neural Network modelling. Results obtained indicated 99% CBZ removal under optimum solution pH, adsorbent dosage and treatment duration of 6, 1 g L(- 1)and 120 min respectively. Results revealed that CBZ adsorption by GONPs followed Temkin isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics. A subsequent reusability study established that the GONPs could be reused for up to 8 times without any loss of adsorption efficiency. Therefore, it can be concluded that graphene oxide reported herein has immense potential for adsorption of trace organic pollutants from aqueous phases.

AB Diclofenac (DC) is one of the most widely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one of the commonly found pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments and wastewater treatment plants. It possesses negative charges when solution pH is greater than its pKa value, while most of the soil components and sediment minerals bear negative charges, too, resulting in a net repulsion between the soil minerals and DC. Surfactant-modified zeolite (SMZ) has been studied extensively over the last 20 years for its effective removal of anionic contaminants tested under different experimental scales. However, its application for the removal of anionic drugs, such as DC, was less reported. This study focused on the sorption of DC by SMZ under different physic-chemical conditions, supplemented with instrumental analyses, in order to elucidate the mechanism of DC sorption by SMZ and to expand the SMZ application further. The results showed that the retention of DC was on the external surfaces of SMZ with extremely fast removal rate. Both anion exchange and partitioning of DC into the adsorbed surfactant micelles (admicelles) were responsible for the extended DC sorption. Interactions of DC with SMZ were facilitated with the benzene ring, the -C=O, and the CH2CH3 functional groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) film coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated, and the electrochemical oxidation of resorcinol (RS) was studied in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer (pH 6.0) using cyclic, square wave, and differential pulse voltammetry (CV, SWV, and DPV). The results revealed that the modified electrode shows an electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of RS by a marked enhancement in the current response in buffered solution. The oxidation of RS at this nano-structured film coated electrode was irreversible and diffusion-controlled. Under the optimum conditions, the anodic peak current showed a linear relation versus RS concentration in the range of 1.2 x 10(-6) to 1.9 x 10(-4) M with detection limits of 4.9 x 10(-7) and 1.1 x 10(-6) M (signal-to-noise = 3) for SWV and DPV, respectively. Moreover, the modified electrode demonstrated good reproducibility (RSD = 2.4%, n = 10) and long-term stability. This method has been applied to the determination of RS in wastewater, and the recoveries were from 93% to 104%. (C) 2012 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the efficacy of water treatment technologies: ultra-filtration (UF), powdered activated carbon (PAC), coagulation (COA) and a combination of these technologies (PAC/UF and COA/UF) to remove target pharmaceuticals (Acetaminophen, Bezafibrate, Caffeine, Carbamazepine, Cotinine, Diclofenac, Gemfibrozil, Ibuprofen, Metoprolol, Naproxen, Sulfadimethoxine, Sulfamethazine, Sulfamethoxazole, Sulfathiazole, Triclosan and Trimethoprim) was investigated. Samples of wastewater from municipal WWTPs were analyzed using direct aqueous injection High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) detection. On concentration basis, results showed an average removal efficiency of 29%, 50%, and 7%, respectively, for the UF, PAC dosage of 50 ppm, and COA dosage of 10 ppm. When PAC dosage of 100 ppm was used as pretreatment to the combined PAC and UF in-line membrane system, a 90.3% removal efficiency was achieved. The removal efficiency of UF in tandem with COA was 33%, an increase of 4% compared with the single UF treatment. The adsorption effect of PAC combined with the physical separation process of UF revealed the best treatment strategy for removing pharmaceutical contaminant from water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Photocatalysis employing TiO2 nanoparticles was studied to assess the effect of aqueous matrix nature in the degradation of clofibric acid (CFA) under UV-A radiation. Aeroxide TiO2-P25 at 0.50 g/L was the most effective catalyst among those tested, with a CFA degradation of 98.5% after 15 min. The CFA photodegradation in environmental waters (tap, mineral, river and recycled wastewater) and in the presence of inorganic (NaCl, FeCl3, FeCl2, AlCl3, CaCl2, Al-2(SO4)(3), Fe-2(SO4)(3), Na2SO4, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3) and organic compounds (humic acids, and a surfactant) commonly found in real waters was compared to that obtained in pure water. In general, the removal efficiency decreased with inorganic salts, especially with sulfates and carbonates (>70% deactivation), and also in environmental waters (>90%). A general kinetic model has been developed to describe the CFA photo degradation depending on the type and concentration of substances present in water. The first-order kinetic constants were estimated by defining a characteristic parameter for each ion species tested in the aqueous matrix. High correlation (R-2 >0.99 in most cases) was observed between experimental CFA concentrations and those predicted by the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) have drawn attention to many countries due to their persistent input and potential threat to human health and the environment. This article reviews the current contamination sources and their status for surface waters in China. The contamination levels of ECs in surface waters are in the range ng L-1 to mu g L-1 in China, apparently about the same as the situation in other countries. ECs enter surface water via runoff, drainage, rainfall, and wastewater treatment effluent. The frequency of occurrence of ECs increased rapidly from 2006 to 2011; a significant reason is the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. As for the distribution of EC pollution in China, the frequency of occurrence of ECs in eastern regions is higher than in western regions. A majority of EC studies have focused on surface waters of the Haihe River and Pearl River watersheds due to their highly developed industries and intense human activity. Legislative and administrative regulation of ECs is lacking in China. To remove ECs, a number of technologies, such as absorption by activated carbon, membrane filtration technology, and advanced oxidation processes, have been researched.

AB The UV-filter substance Sulisobenzone (BP-4) is widely employed in sunscreens and other personal care products. In the current study, its behavior during biological wastewater treatment was investigated. In contact with activated sludge BP-4 was degraded in aerobic batch experiments forming at least nine transformation products (TPs). The mass balance in the batch experiments was closed, as measurements with LC-UV underlined that the quantity of the TPs was comparable to the BP-4 quantity transformed. The chemical structures of the nine TPs could be proposed based on accurate mass measurements by high resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap-MS), several fragmentation experiments up to MS6 and synthesis of one TP. NMR analyses of the main TP confirmed its proposed chemical structure. At the beginning of the biotransformation of BP-4, a benzhydrol analogue was formed due to the reduction of the keto moiety. Further reactions (e.g, oxidation, demethylation, decarboxylation) led to the formation of extremely polar TPs. A biodegradation pathway was proposed based on the TP structures identified and the sequence of the TP formation. The isolated TPs exhibited higher toxic effects on Vibrio fischeri than BP-4. The results contribute to a better general understanding and prediction of the biotransformation of aromatic sulfonic acids in WWTPs.

AB The presence of triclosan, a widely-used antibacterial chemical, is currently unknown in higher trophic-level species such as marine mammals. Blood plasma collected from wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Charleston, SC (CHS) (n = 13) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) (n = 13) in 2005 was analyzed for triclosan. Plasma concentrations in CHS dolphins ranged from 0.12 to 0.27 ng/g wet weight (mean 0.18 ng/g), with 31% of the sampled individuals having detectable triclosan. The mean IRL dolphin plasma concentrations were 0.072 ng/g wet weight (range 0.025-0.11 ng/g); 23% of the samples having detectable triclosan. In the CHS area, triclosan effluent values from two WWTP were both 190 ng/L and primary influents; were 2800 ng/L and 3400 ng/L Triclosan values in CHS estuarine surface water samples averaged 7.5 ng/L (n = 18) ranging from 4.9 to 14 ng/L This is the first study to report bioaccumulation of anthropogenic triclosan in a marine mammal highlighting the need for further monitoring and assessment.

AB Antibiotics have been regarded as new emerging micro-pollutants due to their relatively stable structure and resistance to biodegradation. Rice straw, as a natural environmentally friendly biological carrier and available solid carbon source, was effective in improving the performance of membrane bioreactor (MBR). Parallel experiments of conventional MBR and two composite MBRs with addition of rice straw (unmodified or modified) were conducted to investigate the removal and biodegradation mechanisms of antibiotics. The results showed that the removal efficiency of COD and NH4+-N was both high irrespective of adding rice straw or not, while TN removal increased from 24.55% in conventional MBR to 44.48% in unmodified straw-added MBR and upto 54.47% in modified straw-added MBR. The addition of rice straw also significantly improved the removal of trirhethoprim, with the removal of 40.82% in conventional MBR while 82.10% in unmodified straw-added MBR and 87.50% in modified straw-added MBR. However, the removal of sulfamethoxazole in three MBRs was so high that there were no obvious differences among the removal of 91.92%, 95.79% and 95.77%. Trimethoprim removal was achieved by both the nitrification co-metabolism and denitrification co-metabolism, while sulfamethoxazole was mainly biodegraded by nitrification co-metabolism.

AB The monoterpene alcohol alpha-terpineol is extensively used as the foaming agent in mineral processing and can be released to environment along with the wastewater. This study evaluated the feasibility of eliminating alpha-terpineol in water by ultraviolet irradiation (UV) in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Within an H2O2 dose of 10 mg/L and an UV fluence of 64.8 J/cm(2), more than 95% of the alpha-terpineol can be removed. The reactions fitted well to pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the apparent rate constant was 0.0678 min(-1). The effects of matrix species including various anions and humic acid (HA), were evaluated. The degradation rate decreased significantly with the addition of bicarbonate and HA. Further verification was carried out with three types of real water samples. In the ground water and the surface water, the degradation rate decreased likely due to the presence of natural organic matter. Finally, possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the identification of transformation products, and the occurrence of two main transformation products were monitored. This study demonstrated that the UV/H2O2 is an effective technology for the degradation of alpha-terpineol in water.

AB This research was aimed to prepare a magnetically photocatalyst enabling to degrade pharmaceutical wastewater and detoxification of pollutant such as naproxen, by visible light irradiation. The nano-sized NiS and NiO photocatalysts exhibit higher reactivity than their microsized counterparts, but separation of the used photocatalyst from the degradation solution is hard and imperfect. To remove this difficulty, magnetic polypyrrole core-shell (Fe3O4@PPY) was synthesized and employed as catalyst support. The magnetization property of the synthesized photocatalysts measured by VSM technique indicated that the photocatalysts were sufficiently magnetized to be readily separated from degradation solution by use of external magnetic field. The DRS study showed that the band gap of the photocatalysts shifted to lower energy after immobilization on the support materials leading to higher degradation efficiency. The optimal efficiency was obtained with the catalysts loaded with 50% of NiO and 50% of NiS. The augmenting effect of H2O2 and the inhibition influence of some organic and inorganic compounds on the degradation process were studied. Regeneration of the used photocatalyst was performed by heat treatment, and the catalyst treated at 400 degrees C retained most of its initial capacity. The degradation capacity was kinetically fast, and the equilibrium was attained within 30min.

AB Human-used antibiotics are eliminated from the body with little or no transformation at all. Traces of eliminated antibiotics enter the receiving environment directly since they cannot be treated in prevalent wastewater treatment facilities. Thus, wastewaters containing traces of antibiotics have to be treated accordingly. Lincomycin is subsequently isolated from Streptomyces lincolnensis. Lincomycin and its derivatives are antibiotics exhibiting biological activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and are natural antibiotics in the environment as pollutants. This study aims to predict the degradation mechanism of lincomycin molecule in the gaseous phase and aqueous media. Probable reaction path of lincomycin molecule with OH radicals was analyzed. Optimized geometry was calculated via Gauss View 5. Subsequently, the lowest energy status was determined through geometric optimization via Gaussian 09 program. Aiming to determine the intermediates in photocatalytic degradation mechanism of lincomycin, geometric optimization of the molecule was realized through DFT method. Activation energy for the probable reaction path was calculated, and their most stable state from the thermodynamic perspective determined for the gaseous phase and aqueous media. Impact of water solvent was investigated using the conductor-like screening solvation model (COSMO). The predicted mechanism was confirmed by comparison with experimental results on simple structures reported in literature.

AB Antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing disease is an ever growing threat to the world. Recently, environmental bacteria have become established as important both as sources of antibiotic resistance genes and in disseminating resistance genes. Low levels of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are regularly released into water environments via wastewater, and the concern is that such environmental contamination may serve to create hotspots for antibiotic resistance gene selection and dissemination. In this study, microcosms were created from water and sediments gathered from a lake in Sweden only lightly affected by human activities. The microcosms were exposed to a mixture of antibiotics of varying environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e., concentrations commonly encountered in wastewaters) in order to investigate the effect of low levels of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance gene abundances and dynamics in a previously uncontaminated environment. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Abundances of seven antibiotic resistance genes and the class 1 integron integrase gene, intL1, were quantified using real-time PCR. Resistance genes sulI and ermB were quantified in the microcosm sediments with mean abundances 5 and 15 gene copies/10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Class 1 integrons were determined in the sediments with a mean concentration of 3.86x10(4) copies/10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies. The antibiotic treatment had no observable effect on antibiotic resistance gene or integron abundances.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds at trace concentrations are found in the environment, especially in drinking water and food, posing significant negative effects on humans as well as on animals. This paper aimed to examine the diagnostic catalytic properties and efficacy of a novel synthesized photocatalyst, namely FeNi3@SiO2@ZnO magnetic nanocomposite, for the removal of tamoxifen (TMX) from wastewater under simulated sunlight. According to the results, it was found that TMX was completely degraded operating under optimized conditions (i.e. pH = 7, catalyst dose = 0.01 g/L, initial TMX concentration = 20 mg/L and reaction time = 60 min). The reaction kinetics of TMX degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics model. The final by-products from the TMX photodegradation were water, carbon dioxide, acetic acid, nitroacetic acid methyl ester, 2-methyl-2-pentenal, and 4-methyl-2-pentanol. In addition, the synthesized photocatalyst could successfully performed five consecutive photodegradation cycles. The obtained results revealed that the synthesized FeNi3@SiO2@ZnO magnetic nanocomposite holds a great potential to be applied as a photocatalyst for the degradation of TMX on an industrial scale.

AB Recent studies have highlighted that antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) entering aquatic systems through wastewater discharges might impact organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, two snail species (Gibbula unbilicalis and Lymnea stagnalis) representing the marine and freshwater environments were exposed to a large range of fluoxetine concentrations (1 ng L-1-1 mg L-1) and two distinct behaviours (foot detachment and righting time) were recorded. Fluoxetine significantly caused foot detachment only at the higher of the concentrations (1 mg L-1) in both species during the course of this short term 1.5 h and 4 h exposures. In this study, lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) for foot detachment fell repeatedly within the range for other gastropod snails exposed to fluoxetine. Fluoxetine effected righting times in a concentration dependant manner but only significantly within G. unbilicalis in the highest concentration. Reviewing existing data on the effects of antidepressants on a range of endpoints in gastropod molluscs reveals wide variability of results. The importance of publishing 'negative' and/or non-dramatic results to aid risk assessment are discussed along with the variability between antidepressants, model species, experimental designs and endpoints.

AB Gemfibrozil is a widely used hypolipidemic and triglyceride lowering drug. Excess of the drug is excreted and discharged into the environment primarily via wastewater treatment plant effluents. Bacillus sp. GeD10, a gemfibrozil-degrader, was previously isolated from activated sludge. It is the first identified bacterium capable of degrading gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil degradation by Bacillus sp. GeD10 was here studied through genome sequencing, quantitative proteomics and metabolite analysis. From the bacterial proteome of Bacillus sp. GeD10 1974 proteins were quantified, of which 284 proteins were found to be overabundant by more than 2-fold (FDR corrected p-value <= 0.032, fold change (log(2)) >= 1) in response to gemfibrozil exposure. Metabolomic analysis identified two hydroxylated intermediates as well as a glucuronidated hydroxyl-metabolite of gemfibrozil. Overall, gemfibrozil exposure in Bacillus sp. GeD10 increased the abundance of several enzymes potentially involved in gemfibrozil degradation as well as resulted in the production of several gemfibrozil metabolites. The potential catabolic pathway/modification included ring-hydroxylation preparing the substrate for subsequent ring cleavage by a meta-cleaving enzyme. The identified genes may allow for monitoring of potential gemfibrozil-degrading organisms in situ and increase the understanding of microbial processing of trace level contaminants. This study represents the first omics study on a gemfibrozil-degrading bacterium.

AB A hydrophilic thin-film-composite (TFC) nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been developed through the interfacial polymerization (IP) of amino-functional polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trimesoyl chloride. The selective layer is formed on a polyethersullone (PES) support that is characterized using FTIR, XPS and SEM, and is dependent on monomer immersion duration, and the concentration of monomers and additives. The higher hydrophilicity alongside the larger pore size of the PEG-based selective layer is the key to a high water flux of 66.0 L m(-2) h(-1) at 5.0 bar. With mean pore radius of 0.42 nm and narrow pore size distribution, the MgSO4 rejections of the PEG based PA TFC NF membranes can reach up to 80.2%. The rejection rates for different salts of the novel membranes are in the order of R(MgCl2) > R(MgSO4) > R(NaCl) > R(Na2SO4); indicating a membrane with positive surface charges. The pore sizes and water permeability of these membranes are tailored by varying the molecular weight and molecular architecture of amino-functional PEG. These newly developed TFC NF membranes show great potential for water softening, wastewater treatment and separation and purification of active, pharmaceutical molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dyes are synthetically aromatic compounds used in various industries such as textile, plastics, pharmaceutical, paper, paint and food. The quality and quantity of wastewaters from these industries are a matter of concern for human health and environmental pollution.
   Different conventional methods have been developed for dye removal. However, due to the complex structure and recalcitrant nature of dyes, these methods appear to be ineffective in their complete removal.
   Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been considered as a promising alternative to treat wastewater containing dye residues. These processes are based on the production of highly reactive radicals, especially hydroxyl radicals, which promote destruction of the target pollutant until mineralization.
   This chapter addresses AOPs for removal of dyes from aqueous media by presenting background on advanced oxidation processes. The AOPs will be investigated in two categories: Nonphotochemical and Photochemical Processes. Among these processes, the main focus will be on ozonation, Fenton's reagent oxidation, wet air oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation, with only brief information given on electrochemical oxidation, ultraviolet irradiation and hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and photocatalytic ozonation (UV/O-3) processes.

AB Water sample storage and stabilisation may affect data quality, if samples are managed improperly. In this study three stabilising strategies are evaluated for 46 relevant organic micro-pollutants: addition of the biocides (i) copper sulphate and (ii) sodium azide to water samples directly after sampling with subsequent sample storage as liquid phase and (iii) direct solid phase extraction (SPE), stabilising the samples by reducing the activity of water. River water and treated effluent were chosen as commonly investigated matrices with a high potential of biotransformation activity. Analyses were carried out for sample storage temperatures of 4 and 28 degrees C for water samples stored as liquid phase and for sample storage temperatures of 4, 20 and 40 degrees C for SPE cartridges. Cooling of water samples alone was not sufficient for longer storage times (>24 h). While copper sulphate caused detrimental interferences with nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds, sodium azide proved to be a suitable stabilising agent. The best results could be obtained for SPE cartridges stored cool. Recommendations for samples preservation are provided. (C), 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tested PPCPs included acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, metoprolol, dilantin, DEET, diclofenac, pentoxifylline, oxybenzone, caffeine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, naproxen, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol-A and trimethoprim. Transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) caused by Fenton oxidation were also quantified. All tested PPCPs, except atrazine and iopromide, were completely removed by Fenton treatment carried out using a 20 mg/L Fe (II) concentration and a 2.5 H2O2/Fe (II) molar ratio. Up to 30% on the total carbon concentration was removed during Fenton treatment which was accompanied by the oxidation of EfOM molecules and formation of oxidation products such as oxalic, formic and acetic acids and, less prominently, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and glycolaldehyde. The absorbance of EfOM treated with Fenton reagent at varying Fe (II) concentration and contact time underwent a consistent decrease. The relative decrease of EfOM absorbance was strongly and unambiguously correlated with the removal of all tested PPCPs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trace chemicals are common in marine and freshwater ecosystems globally. It is recognized that in the environment, individual chemicals are rarely found in isolation. Insufficient work has examined which chemicals co-occur and which methods best identify these mixtures. Using an existing data set, we found evidence that simple correlation analysis is better at identifying mixtures of commonly co-occurring trace chemicals than more commonly used PCA methods. Moreover, simple correlation analysis, unlike PCA, can be used in cases with unbalanced designs and with data points below reportable limits. Application of this approach allowed identification of 10 groups of chemicals commonly found together in freshwaters of the continental US, representing common "chemical syndromes." Better identification of co-occurring chemical combinations could aid in our understanding of biological and ecological effects of aquatic contaminants. This research provides evidence of correlation analyses as a more effective method for identifying commonly co-occurring aquatic contaminants. We also examined the patterns of these mixtures with a dataset consisting of concentrations of 406 trace chemicals from 38 sample locations across the continental US. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Shortages in nutrients and freshwater for a growing population are critical global issues. Source separation of waste streams combined with decentralized resource recovery is a promising approach to address this problem. Urine contains within 1% of household wastewater up to 80% of nitrogen (N) and 50% of phosphorus (P). Since microalgae are efficient at nutrient uptake, growing them in urine is a promising technology to clean urine and produce biomass as fertilizer. The aim of this study was to develop a process for nutrient recovery from minimally diluted human urine using immobilized cultivation of microalgae on porous substrate photobioreactors (PSBRs). Treatment of urine, unamended except for a 1:1 dilution with tap water, was performed with the green alga Desmodesmus abundans, chosen among 96 algal strains derived from urine-specific enrichments and culture collections. A growth rate of 7.2 g dry weight m(-2) day(-1) and removal efficiencies for N and P of 13.1 and 94.1% were determined. Pre-treatment of urine with activated carbon was found to eliminate potentially detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals. In combination with other technologies, PSBRs could be applied in decentralized resource recovery systems, helping to close the link between sanitation and food production.

AB Verapamil (VRPM) is a kind of pharmaceuticals that widely used over the world and frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants effluents and downstream river waters. VRPM also can be a kind of precursor for carbonaceous (C-) and nitrogenous (N-) disinfection by-products (DBPs) during disinfection in water treatment. The formation of trihalomethanes, dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) from chlorination and chloramination of VRPM was firstly examined and compared in this study. The impacts of chlorine or monochloramine dose, contact time, pH, bromide, chloramination mode, temperature, and preoxidation were evaluated as well. It was found that chloroform (CF) was the major DBPs during chlorination, while N-DBPs became dominant in chloramination.
   The yields of CF, DCAN and TCNM were increased significantly with increasing monochloramine dose. Unlike CF and DCAN, the yield of TCNM increased firstly and then deceased with contact time. The effect of pH on DBPs formation was significant both for chlorination and chloramination of VRPM. Bromide was proposed to play an important role in DBPs formation during disinfection. Compared to ultraviolet/persulfate, ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide was a better pre-oxidation to not only efficiently oxidize VRPM, but also significantly reduce DBPs formation.

AB Atenolol is a beta-blocker drug widely consumed for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Approximately 50% of the amount ingested by humans is excreted without any change in its chemical structure. For this reason, this drug has been commonly found in many environmental matrices, like hospital wastewater. The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of atenolol in aqueous solutions by adsorption process using granular activated carbon as solid adsorbent. Adsorption experiments were performed in batch evaluating the effect of pH and contact time parameters. Kinetic of atenolol adsorption in granular activated carbon was evaluated using pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models. Equilibrium isotherms for this system were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The best results found in the adsorption experiments were pH 6, 90 min of contact time. Pseudo-second order was the kinetic model that best described the adsorption of atenolol. Under these conditions it was possible to obtain an efficiency removal of approximately 88%. Freundlich was the best model that fit the experimental data. Results indicate that the proposed process represents significant potential for removal of this contaminant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is a typical Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC), which is potentially harmful during wastewater reclamation. In this study, its degradation during Fenton's process under different operational conditions was investigated in combination with subsequent nanofiltration of low concentration remnant BPA and compounds derived from oxidation. The results indicate that BPA could be degraded efficiently in aqueous phase by Fenton, even at very low hydrogen peroxide doses. The treatment of up to 300 mg/L solutions of BPA with Fenton liquor at optimal conditions resulted in its complete removal in less than 2 min. The optimal conditions were found to be pH, = 3, H2O2/BPA = 020 and Fe2+/BPA = 0.012. Five NF polymeric membranes having different properties were used for the nanofiltration of treated and non-treated solutions. The nanofiltration of BPA solutions showed that rejection is related to adsorption ability of BPA on the membrane and size exclusion mechanism. In the nanofiltration of the effluent after Fenton oxidation, high TOC, COD, colour and Fe2+ (>77%) removal were achieved, although significant membrane fouling was also observed. The normalised water flux after membrane flushing with water was lower than 60% in almost all used membranes, which indicates significant non-easily removable fouling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The first large-scale assessment of pharmaceuticals in drinking water in the Czech Republic (CR) focused on the detection of five substances. Samples were collected from public water systems supplying 5.3 million people, 50.5% of the Czech population. In the initial survey of tap water from 92 major supply zones using mostly surface water, no pharmaceutical exceeded the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.5 ng/L). In a second survey, samples were collected from the outlet of 23 water treatment plants (WTPs) considered of high risk because they use surface waters influenced by wastewater. Ibuprofen was the most frequently found pharmaceutical (19 samples), followed by carbamazepine (12), naproxen (8), and diclofenac (3); concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 20.7 ng/L, with medians below 6 ng/L. Concentrations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were below the LOQ. A follow-up survey included tap and outlet samples from eight of the 23 WTPs with the highest concentrations. Pharmaceuticals were quantified in only three tap water samples. Regarding risks to consumers, these results suggest that a relatively small population (<10%) in the CR is exposed to quantifiable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in tap water and that an extremely high margin of safety (several thousand-fold to several million-fold) is associated with these exposures.

AB In the present study the mechanisms of solar photodegradation of H(2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine (RNTD) were studied in a well-defined system of a pilot plant scale Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) reactor. Two types of heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were performed: catalysed by titanium-dioxide (TiO(2)) semiconductor and by Fenton reagent (Fe(2+)/H(2)O(2)). each one with distilled water and synthetic wastewater effluent matrix. Complete disappearance of the parent compounds and discreet mineralization were attained in all experiments. Furthermore, kinetic parameters, main intermediate products, release of heteroatoms and formation of carboxylic acids are discussed. The main intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of RNTD have been structurally elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS(2)) experiments performed at quadrupole-time of flight (QqToF) mass analyzer coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC). RNTD displayed high reactivity towards OH radicals, although a product of conduction band electrons reduction was also present in the experiment with TiO(2). In the absence of standards, quantification of intermediates was not possible and only qualitative profiles of their evolution could be determined. The proposed TiO(2) and photo-Fenton degradation routes of RNTD are reported for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two nitrifying MBBR reactors were operated in parallel, one with PAC dosing and one without, to determine the effects of PAC dosing on nitrification and micropollutant adsorption in municipal wastewater. The removal of micropollutants was evaluated for several doses of PAC and batch experiments were performed to measure adsorption kinetics and nitrification rates. The influence of PAC on the nitrifying microbial community was examined by high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Long-term operation of the pilot reactors showed that nitrification could be maintained while supplying PAC at increasing doses, as confirmed by high nitrification rates and significant abundance of nitrifying bacteria. The adsorption of organic micropollutants could be controlled by the PAC dose, and increased dosing resulted in corresponding improvements in removal efficiency. Biomass, suspended or attached to carriers, did not interfere with the adsorption of organic micropollutants. Freundlich isotherms obtained from the batch experiments were used to predict removal of organic micropollutants in the pilot reactors, suggesting that batch adsorption experiments can be used to predict micropollutant removal on a full scale. Collectively, the results show that nitrification and adsorption of organic micropollutants can be performed simultaneously in an MBBR. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sulfonamide antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) has been frequently detected in the wastewater. It has been reported that part of SMX can be transformed by the co-metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during nitrifying process. However, previous studies reported inconsistent or even contradictory results in terms of SMX degradation and/or transformation. Literature study revealed that nitrite may play certain role in SMX transformation, which has been neglected previously. In this study, the transformation behavior of SMX was investigated with and without the presence of nitrite in an enriched nitrifying culture. The results clearly show that the elimination of SMX occurred with the presence/accumulation of nitrite, and a linear regression was observed between SMX elimination efficiency and free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration, indicating that FNA was the major factor responsible for the SMX transformation. By reacting with FNA, SMX transformation products, such as 4-nitro-SMX, desamino-SMX and hydroxylated SMX, were detected. However, when FNA concentration decreased, these intermediates may be retransformed back to SMX. These findings improved our understanding on SMX transformation in a biological system and highlighted the role of nitrite/FNA in the sulfonamide antibiotics degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of different membranes, membrane modules, feed temperatures, flow rates and solute concentrations on the permeate flux and salt rejection in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was first studied with synthetic seawater and compared to distilled water. After optimizing these operating conditions, DCMD was tested with real feed samples, namely river water (RW-R), seawater (SW-R), and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MW-R). The permeate flux achieved with MW-R was significantly lower than those obtained with the other feed samples. Two membrane module configurations (H-cell and W-cell) were then studied using SW-S, spiking diphenhydramine (DP) as model organic pollutant in some experiments. The H-cell performed better in terms of permeate quality for the same volume of permeate collected. A long experiment (500 h) was conducted with SW-R employing a larger H-cell. Severe fouling was observed, but high rejections of ion species (> 99%) were recorded together with complete rejections of pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin) detected in SW-R at 9.53-73.53 ng L-1 (detection limits < 0.16 ng L-1). Colonies of Escherichia colt or enterococci were not detected in 100 mL of permeate (distillate) solution, complying with the European Directive for drinking water.

AB In this work, the degradation and mineralization of ortho-toluidine (OT) that is one of the constituents of petrochemical wastewater was investigated by the TiO2/O-3 process. The influence of some operational parameters such as concentration of pollutant (30-90 mg L-1), initial pH and amounts of TiO2 was investigated. A radical mechanism with the formation of an anion radical superoxide radical prior to hydroxyl radical is suggested for describing the interaction between ozone and TiO2. These results were not similar to the ozonation process alone, in which higher pH had a positive effect on the removal of OT because of the generation of hydroxyl radicals. In optimum pH for the ozonation and O-3/TiO2 processes, the degradation efficiency of the OT was 89.5 and 96%, respectively, at 60 min of reaction. Furthermore, it was made clear that in catalytic ozonation, the degradation efficiency of the OT was higher at neutral pH conditions (pH = 7). The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased from 47.5% (only ozonation) to 73% (O-3/TiO2) after 90 min of reaction. The kinetics of degradation was pseudo-first order; the degradation and relative mineralization of the OT were calculated by HPLC and COD tests, respectively.

AB A Pseudomonas sp. strain WL2 that is able to efficiently metabolize ethyl mercaptan (EM) into diethyl disulfide (DEDS) through enzymatic oxidation was isolated from the activated sludge of a pharmaceutical wastewater plant. One hundred percent removal of 113.5 mg L-1 EM and 110.3 mg L-1 DEDS were obtained within 14 and 32 h, respectively. A putative EM degradation pathway that involved the catabolism via DEDS was proposed, which indicated DEDS were further mineralized into carbon dioxide (CO2), bacterial cells, and sulfate (SO4 (2-)) through the transformation of element sulfur and ethyl aldehyde. Degradation kinetics for EM and DEDS with different initial concentrations by strain WL2 were evaluated using Haldane-Andrews model with maximum specific degradation rates of 3.13 and 1.33 g g(-1) h(-1), respectively, and maximum degradation rate constants of 0.522 and 0.175 h(-1) using pseudo-first-order kinetic model were obtained. Results obtained that aerobic degradation of EM by strain WL2 was more efficient than those from previous studies. Substrate range studies of strain WL2 demonstrated its ability to degrade several mercaptans, disulfides, aldehydes, and methanol. All the results obtained highlight the potential of strain WL2 for the use in the biodegradation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs).

AB The objective of the present work is to evaluate the potential of a photosonolysis process for the degradation of butyl-paraben (BPB). After 120 min of treatment time, high removal of BPB was achieved by the photosonolysis (US/UV) process (88.0 +/- 0.65%) compared to the photochemical (UV) and the conventional ultrasonication (US) processes. Several factors such as calorimetric power, treatment time, pH and initial concentration of BPB were investigated. Using a 24 factorial matrix, the treatment time and the calorimetric power are the main parameters influencing the degradation rate of BPB. Subsequently, a central composite design methodology has been investigated to determine the optimal experimental parameters for BPB degradation. The US/UV process applied under optimal operating conditions (at a calorimetric power of 40 W during 120 min and under pH 7) is able to oxidize around 99.2 +/- 1.4% of BPB and to record 43.3% of mineralization. During the US/UV process, BPB was mainly transformed into 1 hydroxy BPB, dihydroxy BPB, hydroquinone and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Microtox biotests (Vibrio fisheri) showed that the treated effluent was not toxic. The pseudo-first order kinetic model (k = 0.0367 min(-1)) described very well the oxidation of BPB.

AB The fate and exposure risks of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in marine environments are not well-understood. In this study we developed a multi-residue analytical method for quantifying concentrations of forty target compounds in seawater from Singapore. Analyses of samples (n = 24) from eight sites showed the occurrence of several compounds, including gemfibrozil (<0.09-19.8 ng/L), triclosan (<0.55-10.5 ng/L), carbamazepine (<0.28-10.9 ng/L) and ibuprofen (<2.2-9.1 ng/L). A 3D hydrodynamic model for Singapore was used to predict residence time (t(R)). Principal Components Analysis revealed a strong relationship between t(R) and contaminant concentrations. While source emissions are undoubtedly important, proximate distance to a wastewater treatment plant had little influence on concentrations. The site with the greatest t(R), which exhibited the highest concentrations, is adjacent to Singapore's largest protected wetland reserve. The results highlight an important linkage between hydrodynamic behavior and contaminant exposure risks in complex coastal marine ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The newly synthesized magnetic nanocomposite (CDF@MF) was characterized using several analytical techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and etc. To investigate the applicability of CDF@MF, it was employed as an adsorbent for rapidly removal of an antibiotic, namely, tetracycline (TC), from aqueous solution using several factors such as pH, the adsorbent dose, the initial concentration and the contact time. The adsorption kinetics results exhibited that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-first-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity for TC was calculated to be 168.24 mg/g based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, with fitting correlation coefficient (R-2), 0.9955. The regeneration study advice that no major change in the adsorption capacity was noticed and show 157.97% adsorption performance after seven cycles. These results are standing to indicate that the prepared porous CDF@MF could be used as a low-cost, effective, reusable adsorbent for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this research, the degradation by heterogeneous photocatalysis of organic pharmaceutical waste compounds using TiO2 nanoparticles immobilized on polymeric commercial hollow fiber (HF) ultrafiltration membranes was studied. Three immobilization methods that were tested; spray-, vacuum-and sol-gel-coating. The latter was found most successful as it didn't compromise the permeability of the membrane as much as the other two methods. The sol-gel coated membranes were characterized by multiple analytical techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The compatibility of the membrane components with the aqueous feed containing pharmaceutical waste compounds was confirmed using the Hansen solubility parameters. The effectiveness of TiO2-coated membranes was then assessed in the degradation studies of two organic compounds; Methylene Blue (MB) and Chlorhexidine Digluconate (CHD), serving as the model and the target pharmaceutical compound, respectively. Spray and vacuum coating were unsuccessful in obtaining a stable TiO2 coated membranes, whereas sol-gel coating yielded a stable TiO2 layer and hence was chosen for further optimization. The immobilization of TiO2 was confirmed by SEM images and Raman spectra. Degradation of more than 30 and 40% of MB and CHD, respectively, was achieved under filtration conditions with simulated solar light radiation.

AB An extracellular, halophilic, alkalithermophilic serine protease from the halo-alkaliphilic Alkalibacillus sp. NM-Da2 was purified to homogeneity by ethanol precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified protease was a monomeric enzyme with an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa and exhibited maximal activity at 2.7 M NaCl, pH(55 A degrees C) 9 and 56 A degrees C. The protease showed great temperature stability, retaining greater than 80 % of initial activity after 2 h incubation at 55 A degrees C. The protease was also extremely pH tolerant, retaining 80 % of initial activity at pH(55 A degrees C) 10.5 after 30 min incubation. Protease hydrolyzed complex substrates, displaying activity on yeast extract, tryptone, casein, gelatin and peptone. Protease activity was inhibited at casein concentrations greater than 1.2 mg/mL. The enzyme was stable and active in 40 % (v/v) solutions of isopropanol, ethanol and benzene and was stable in the presence of the polysorbate surfactant Tween 80. Activity was stimulated with the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition with phenyl methylsulfonylfluoride indicates it is a serine protease. Synthetic saline wastewater treated with the protease showed 50 % protein removal after 5 h. Being halophilic, alkaliphilic and thermophilic, in addition to being resistant to organic solvents, this protease has potential for various applications in biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries.

AB Wildlife can be exposed to human pharmaceuticals via prey that have accumulated the compounds from wastewater, surface water, sediment, and soil. One factor affecting internal absorption of pharmaceuticals is bioaccessibility, the proportion of the compound that enters solution in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, the bioaccessibility of most pharmaceuticals in prey remains unknown for most wildlife species. The authors evaluated the potential of a 2-compartment in vitro gastrointestinal tract model to compare the bioaccessibility of the antidepressant fluoxetine from invertebrate prey for birds and mammals. Samples of gizzard (or stomach) and intestinal-phase digestive juices were obtained from the in vitro models along with the residual solid material. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the bioaccessibility of fluoxetine in the avian in vitro models was statistically significantly lower than that in the mammalian models as a percentage of what was recovered; however, there were no statistically or biologically significant interspecies difference in terms of the amount recovered per gram of "food" inserted at the start of the simulation. This in vitro model provides a useful method of comparing the bioaccessibility of pharmaceuticals in different prey for species with different gastrointestinal conditions. There is merit for ecological risk assessments in further developing this in vitro approach to improve estimates of internal exposure for organics. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB A nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was established to identify industrial emerging contaminants in the Rhine River. With this approach, quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds (R-Ph3P+) were identified as new emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. The suggested chemical structures were elucidated by MS fragmentation and chemical databank searches and eventually confirmed via authentic standards. R-Ph3P+ are used worldwide by the chemical industry to synthesize alkenes via the Wittig reaction. In total, five compounds [R = butyl (Bu), R = ethyl (Et), R = methoxymethyl (MeOMe), R = methyl (Me), and R = phenyl (Ph)] were found in German rivers and streams. R-Ph3P+ were detected only in those rivers and streams that received an appreciable portion of wastewater from the chemical industry. Up to 2.5 mu g/L Et-Ph3P+ was quantified in a small stream from the Hessian Ried, and in the Rhine, up to 0.56 mu g/L Me-Ph3P+ was detected. R-Ph3P+ were also identified in suspended particulate matter and sediments in the Rhine catchment, with MeOMe-Ph3P+ concentrations of up to 0.75 mg/kg and up to 0.21 mg/kg, respectively. Because of the lack of ecotoxicological studies, the environmental risks caused by R-Ph3P+ can be assessed for neither pelagic nor benthic organisms.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an environmentally recalcitrant compound highly stable in soil and during wastewater treatment. In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus metabolizes CBZ in liquid culture using a physiological approach. P. ostreatus PC9 was grown in media known to support different levels of a multiplicity of enzyme systems such as cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). When both CYP450 and MnP systems were active, 99% of the added CBZ was eliminated from the solution and transformed to 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine. High removal of CBZ was also obtained when either MnP or CYP450 was active. When both CYP450 and MnP were inactivated, only 10 to 30% of the added CBZ was removed. In this latter system, removal of CBZ might be partially attributed to the activity of versatile peroxidase. P. ostreatus was able to eliminate CBZ in liquid culture even when CBZ was added at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g L-1). On the basis of our study, we suggest that two families of enzymes are involved in the oxidation of CBZ in liquid culture: MnP in a Mn2+-dependent or independent manner and CYP450. Our study also highlights the potential of using P. ostreatus for bioremediation systems.

AB In this study, the effect of a high concentration of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on pollutant removal and microbial communities was systematically investigated. Micropollutant removal by the 'control' MBR (without PAC addition) was pollutant-specific and was mainly controlled by their molecular properties. The PAC-MBR achieved enhanced removal of micropollutant by 10% (ofloxacin) to 40% (caffeine). Analysis of the microbial communities in the sludge samples collected from both MBRs indicated an increase in the abundance of 24 (out of 31) genera following PAC addition. Notably, bacterial diversity enriched. particularly in the anoxic zone of the PAC-MBR, indicating a positive impact of recirculating mixed liquor containing PAC from the aerobic to the anoxic zone. In addition, PAC improved the abundance of Comamonas and Methanomethylovorans (up to 2.5%) that can degrade recalcitrant micropollutants. According to the quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, the copies of functional genes (nirS, nosZ and narG) increased in PAC-MBR. This study demonstrated that MBR could be operated at a high PAC concentration without compromising the pollutant removal and microbial community evolution during wastewater treatment.

AB Among all emerging contaminants, pharmaceutical compounds as tetracycline (TC) can cause potential environmental impact in water quality. In this work, the removal of TC drug on activated carbon from aqueous solution was studied and the best operating parameters were obtained. In addition, a real aqueous matrix was enriched with TC and the optimized conditions were applied to study the adsorption process efficiency. For this, the influence of pH, contact time between phases and dosage of adsorbent solid was evaluated. The investigation of kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamic was also performed. The adsorbent material was characterized by SEM analysis and N(2)adsorption/desorption isotherms to confirm its properties. Batch experiments showed that the most suitable experimental conditions for adsorption in aqueous solution were: pH 4.0, contact time 90 min and dosage of adsorbent solid 30 g.L-1. Under these conditions, it was possible to obtain 92.7% of TC removal with predominance of a spontaneous, favorable and endothermic chemisorption process. Adsorption experiments with real aqueous matrix provided 99.4% TC removal. These results show the potential of adsorption as a wastewater treatment applied to remove emerging pollutants as TC from real aqueous contaminated water.

AB This research proposes an environmental quality indicator to detect, predict and scientifically evaluate the environmental impact generated by chemical substances within the pollutant group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are categorized as emerging contaminants (ECs) with endocrine disruptive action. The present study was carried out in two coastal lagoons affected by wastewater produced by urban and rural settlements in the states of Colima and Jalisco. Four pharmaceutical compounds were analyzed: diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketorolac and naproxen. The muscle tissues of 14 fish species were analyzed; all had measurable concentrations of the four contaminants. The presence of the ECs was confirmed in all the samples collected. The bioaccumulative potential risk (BPR) of the ECs is estimated by calculating the environmental risk factors and the potential risks to human health, evaluating the concentration and assessing the risk involved in the incorporation of the pollutants into the environment. The BPR indicates the potential impact of NSAIDs on the ecology of these coastal lagoons, and predicts whether a contaminant is likely to act and persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in organisms. Additionally, it estimates the possibility of contamination and risks to human health caused by residues of the chemical contaminants.

AB The OECD 309 guideline uses spiked incubation tests to provide data on biodegradation kinetics in surface waters. However, potential limitations of spiking test chemicals into the studied water have not been investigated. We conducted the OECD 309 test with unspiked surface water relying on chemical residues present in the water. Parallel experiments were conducted with the same water spiked with 13 chemicals at higher concentrations (50 mu g L-1). Six chemicals detected in both the spiked and the unspiked systems were biodegraded. For each chemical the concentration change over time differed between the systems. Tramadol and venlafaxine showed constant concentrations in the spiked systems but increasing concentrations in the unspiked systems. Atenolol and metoprolol showed first-order elimination with no lag in the unspiked systems, compared to a lag of 15-28 d followed by zero-order elimination kinetics in the spiked systems. Acesulfame was only slightly degraded (<50%) in the unspiked system, while removal was complete (>99%) in the spiked systems. Gabapentin displayed a complex behavior where the features differed markedly between the spiked and the unspiked systems. We conclude that spiking can strongly influence biodegradation, reducing the environmental relevance of test results. Under some conditions biodegradation can be measured in unspiked natural waters instead.

AB An easy to synthesize amphiphilic dye is developed whose sensing behavior in surfactant assemblies can be modulated through surface-charge, micropolarity, and local pH, etc. Thus, the micelle-bound probe shows remarkable ion dependent bathochromic shifts in the charge-transfer band, enabling simultaneous ratiometric detection of four different metal ions, such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+, at parts per billion (ppb) level in water. This is indeed a striking observation since naked-eye sensing of multiple metal ions at the mesoscopic interface is not known to date. Moreover, the probe even shows distinct color response against copper ion in different oxidation states, which is also unheard of. Further, the in situ formed metal complexes can be employed for naked-eye screening of three different amino acids, such as histidine, cysteine, and aspartic acid, in aqueous medium. Probes of this class, which are capable of multiplexing, offer new ways of efficiently screening multiple analytes in complex, real-life samples (e.g., wastewater management, analysis of pharmaceutical drugs, etc.). Further, low-cost reusable dye-coated paper discs were also developed as an ecofriendly method for on-site sensing of metal ions.

AB The fate of four antimicrobials (cefadroxil, CFD; metronidazole, METRO; trimethoprim, TRI; sulfamethoxazole, SMX) was studied in Lemna minor systems and the role of different mechanisms on their removal was evaluated. All micropollutants were significantly removed in batch experiments with active Lemna minor; the highest removal was observed for CFD (100% in 14 d), followed by METRO (96%), SMX (73%) and TRI (59%) during 24 d of the experiment. Calculation of kinetic constants for hydrolysis, photodegradadon, sorption to biomass and plant uptake revealed significant differences depending on the compound and the studied mechanism. For METRO, TRI and SMX the kinetic constants of plant uptake were by far higher comparing to those of the other mechanisms. The transformation products of antimicrobials were identified using UHPLC-QToF-MS. Two were the main degradation pathways for TRI; hydroxylation takes place during both phyto- and photodegradation, while demethylation occurs only in absence of Lemna minor. The operation of a continuous-flow duckweed system showed METRO and TRI removal equal to 71 +/- 11% and 61 +/- 8%, respectively. The application of mass balance and the use of published biodegradation constants showed that plant uptake and biodegradation were the major mechanisms governing METRO removal; the most important mechanism for TRI was, plant uptake.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in water and wastewater has raised concerns because of potential environmental impacts and thus their removal is of high importance. The adsorption behavior of chlortetracycline (CTC) from aqueous solution on raw and activated pinewood biochar was studied at 298 K. The effect of initial pH of the solution was studied by performing the experiment at three different pHs (1,.5 and 9). At each pH, CTC showed varied electrostatic charge (+1, 0 and -1, respectively) which affected its adsorption. The results indicated that CTC followed Langmuir isotherm and the related parameters were calculated. Also, it was observed that the maximum adsorption occurred at pH 1. The adsorption capacity of CTC for raw and activated biochar was at least 2.1 and 208.3 mg/g adsorbent, respectively. The characteristics of biochars were studied using zeta potential analyzer, laser size analyzer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that raw and activated biochars are promising candidates for removal of CTC from water due to the acidic character of pinewood that can result in better interaction with ionizable compounds at lower pHs.

AB Endogenous progestogens and pharmaceutical progestins enter the environment through wastewater treatment plant effluent and agricultural field runoff. Lab studies demonstrate strong, negative exposure effects of these chemicals on aquatic vertebrate reproduction. Behavior can be a sensitive, early indicator of exposure to environmental contaminants associated with altered reproduction yet is rarely examined in ecotoxicology studies. Gestodene is a human contraceptive progestin and a potent activator of fish androgen receptors. Our objective was to test the effects of gestodene on reproductive behavior and associated egg deposition in the fathead minnow. After only 1 day, males exposed to ng/L of gestodene were more aggressive and less interested in courtship and mating, and exposed females displayed less female courtship behavior. Interestingly, 25% of the gestodene tanks contained a female that drove the male out of the breeding tile and displayed male-typical courtship behaviors toward the other female. Gestodene decreased or arrested egg deposition with no observed gonadal histopathology. Together, these results suggest that effects on egg deposition are primarily due to altered reproductive behavior. The mechanisms by which gestodene disrupts behavior are unknown. Nonetheless, the rapid and profound alterations of the reproductive biology of gestodene-exposed fish suggest that wild populations could be similarly affected.

AB The aim of present study is to develop a mathematical model to understand the photomineralization process for an antiseptic drug component, chlorhexidine digluconate using catalytic membrane. Overall process was executed in a photo reactor with immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles on the membrane surface, which gives the better recovery and reuse of the catalyst. To assess the overall process performance, a mathematical model has been developed for prediction of substrate concentration in the permeate stream and the theoretical build-up of the polarized layer in case of a membrane coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. In the developed mathematical model, the governing partial differential equation was solved with the help of initial boundary condition over the concentration boundary layer and Kozeny-Carmen equation. In this model the simultaneous change in the active surface area and the polarized layer thickness with the change in substrate concentration in the boundary layer was incorporated to enhance the accuracy of the model. The resulting non-linear partial differential equation, coupled with other nonlinear ordinary differential equation is solved using Runga Kutta fourth order method. Average deviation between theoretical results and the experimental data generated in this study was found to remain within +/- 5% and precision level was maintained at 0.01%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

DE humic substances; immobilization; contaminants of emerging concern;
   chromium; arsenic; pharmaceuticals
AB Environmental pollution with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is a worldwide problem that is receiving increasing attention. Although these substances have been released in the aquatic environment for a long time, wastewater treatment plants are still incapable of removing emerging contaminants completely. Consequently, trace metals, metalloids and pharmaceuticals, as well as surfactant leftovers, are often found in environmental samples. Environmentally friendly and cost-effective sorbents such as humic substances can be used for purification if their sorption properties are increased by immobilization. To our knowledge, immobilized humic substances have not been widely studied as sorbents up to now. In this study, humic substances were immobilized to obtain low-cost sorbents. The chosen methods for characterization of the obtained sorbents showed successful immobilization. Traditional pollutants, such as Cr(III) (a metal), As(V) (a metalloid) and chlorpromazine (a pharmaceutical), were used as representative contaminants. Sorption experiments were conducted using the batch system, and sorption was also studied based on the sorbent dosage, initial concentration of the studied element or substance, solution pH and sorption time. The results show that all the obtained immobilized humic substances in this study can be used as sorbents to remove contaminants from water. At the same time, from these humic substances, only those immobilized using iron compounds are suitable for the removal of arsenic.

AB In this study, it was demonstrated that the Fe ion was an effective promoter of bulk MoS2 for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade acetaminophen (ACT). ACT removal rate constant in the presence of 5 mg/ L FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O (0.1099 min(-1)) was approximately 20 times as that in the absence (0.0045 min(-1)) with 0.1 g/L MoS2 of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O at pH(0) 3. Both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization and quenching experiment suggested the key role of singlet oxygen (1O2), acting as dominant reactive species responsible for ACT degradation in the Fe2+/MoS2/PMS system. Besides, the chemical state and composition of MoS2, the ion (Fe and Mo) concentrations and the speciation of Mo(VI) were investigated. Results suggested that the promoting effect of Fe(II) ion originated from the regeneration of Fe2+ mediated by MoS2, and the formation of molybdenum(VI) peroxo complex species in Fe2+/MoS2/PMS system. The present study not only provides an insight into PMS activation by MoS2 accelerated by Fe(II) ion, but also suggests an high-efficiency, easy-to-handle and environmentally friendly method to treat refractory wastewater.

AB In the present study, the potential of Azolla filiculoides (A. filiculoides) was first investigated for degradation of Phenazopyridine (PhP), an analgesic drug. The effects of main variables such as initial pharmaceutical concentration, amount of plant, and pH were studied on the efficiency of the biological process. It was observed that A. filiculoides was able to remove pharmaceuticals from contaminated water up to 85.90% during 48 h. Then, the electro-Fenton (EF) method was applied for further removal of PhP yielding a removal rate of about 98.72% under optimum conditions during 2 h. The effects of variables including the current, amount of catalyst, and pH were also studied in this phase. Also, the probability of adsorption was investigated during this step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed for the used magnetite nanoparticles, total organic carbon (TOC) were performed to investigate PhP removal efficiency during the reaction time and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were performed to analyze degradation byproducts of PhP. Based on the results, it was found that a combination of these bioremediation and electrochemical removal steps were capable of PhP removal from contaminated water. Therefore, this approach may be effective for phytoremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated aquatic ecosystems.

AB While the use of transition metal oxides in catalyzing advanced oxidation reactions has been widely investigated, very few reports have focused on how the preliminary contact of oxides with target compounds may affect the succession of reaction. In this study, we examined the adsorption and electron transfer reactions of two fluoroquinolones, flumequine (FLU), and norfloxacin (NOR), with goethite (alpha-FeOOH) or manganese (Mn) oxide, and their impact on the subsequent mineralization of target compounds using H2O2 or S2O82- under UVA irradiation. Intriguingly, higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal was achieved when antibiotics and metal oxides were allowed for preequilibration before starting the oxidation reaction. The rate and extent of TOC removal are strongly dependent on the molecule structure and the redox-active mineral used, and much less on the preequilibration time. This high efficiency can be ascribed to the presence of reduced metal ions, chemically or photochemically generated during the first stage, onto oxide minerals. Oxide-bound Mn-II plays a crucial role in catalyzing oxidant decomposition and then producing greater amounts of radical species through a photoassisted redox cycle, regardless of the underlying surface, (MnO2)-O-IV or (MnOOH)-O-III. This finding will be of fundamental and practical significance to Mn-based oxidation reactions and wastewater treatment processes.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBP) adsorption onto acids (HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4) pre-treated onion skin (OS) was studied as a function of pH, adsorbent dosage, drugs initial concentrations and contact time. The H2SO4-OS (adsorbent) showed higher drugs adsorption efficiency followed by H3PO4- OS and HCl-OS and NAT-OS (native). The drugs loaded and un-loaded OS were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray and scanning electron microscope techniques, which revealed a considerable change in OS composition and changed surface morphology. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted well to both the drugs adsorption data. Freundlich isotherm explained well the drugs adsorption onto OS adsorbents. The optimum conditions of pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time were 6.5, 0.05 mg/g and 220 min, respectively. At optimum condition, the DCF and IBP adsorptions were 134.003 and 91.99 mg/g, respectively, which were 81.90% and 65.99% removal of the initial concentrations. Results revealed that OS pre-treated with mineral acids is a potential adsorbent and could possibly be used for the remediation of drugs wastewater.

AB Wastewater containing pharmaceutical residual components must be treated before being discharged to the environment. This study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of tungstencarbon nanocomposite in diclofenac removal using design of experiment (DOE). The 27 batch adsorption experiments were done by choosing three effective parameters (pH, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration) at three levels. The nanocomposite was prepared by tungsten oxide and activated carbon powder in a ratio of 1 to 4 mass. The remaining concentration of diclofenac was measured by a spectrometer with adding reagents of 2, 2'-bipyridine, and ferric chloride. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine the main and interaction effects. The equilibrium time for removal process was determined as 30 min. It was observed that the pH had the lowest influence on the removal efficiency of diclofenac. Nanocomposite gave a high removal at low concentration of 5.0 mg/L. The maximum removal for an initial concentration of 5.0 mg/L was 88.0% at contact time of 30 min. The results of ANOVA showed that adsorbent mass was among the most effective variables. Using DOE as an efficient method revealed that tungsten-carbon nanocomposite has high efficiency in the removal of residual diclofenac from the aqueous solution.

AB Advanced oxidation processes including UV, UV/H2O2, Fenton reaction (Fe(II)/H2O2) and Photo Fenton process (Fe(II)/H2O2/UV) for degradation of paracetamol, Bisphenol A, and dibutyl phthalate as endocrine disrupting chemicals(EDCs) are investigated in this study. A comparison among these techniques is undertaken with respect to the decrease of total organic carbon (TOC). Optimum operating conditions for each understudied process revealed the effect of the initial amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Among the tested processes, the Photo Fenton process was found to be the most efficient with respect to TOC reduction of the wastewater within 50 min reaction time under low amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide of 2.7 and 5 mmol/L respectively and amounted to 100% TOC removal for all the studied EDCs. Photo Fenton was followed by UV/H2O2, Fenton and UV only respectively in TOC removal.
   Paracetamol showed the highest removal followed by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) while, Bisphenol A came in the end. Scavenger experiment proved that the degradation takes place mainly through hydroxyl radical mechanism. As well, studying the toxicity of produced water showed that the treated water is non-toxic.

AB This study reports the efficiency of gamma-ray irradiation to degrade quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to determine the "pseudo-first" order degradation kinetics of norfloxacin in the concentration ranges of 3.4-16.1 mg L-1 by gamma-ray irradiation. The dose constant was found to be dependent on the initial concentration of norfloxacin and gammaray irradiation dose rate (D-r). The saturation of norfloxacin sample solutions with N-2, air or N2O, and the presence of tertbutanol and 2-propanol showed that (OH)-O-center dot played more crucial role in the degradation of norfloxacin. The second order rate constants of (OH)-O-center dot, c(aq)(-), and H-center dot with norfloxacin were calculated to be 8.81 x 10(9), 9.54x10(8), and 1.10 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The effects of various additives including CO32-, HCO3-, NO3-, NO2-, and thiourea and the pH of the medium on the degradation of norfloxacin were also investigated. Norfloxacin degradation was lower in surface water and wastewater than in ultrapure water. Several degradation byproducts of norfloxacin were identified from which the possible degradation pathway was proposed.

AB The ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to interact with target pollutants is crucial for efficient water treatment using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and inhibition by natural organic matter (NOM) can significantly reduce degradation efficiency. We compare OH center dot-based degradation (H2O2-UV) to O-1(2)-based degradation (Rose Bengal) of several probe compounds (furfuryl alcohol, ranitidine, cimetidine) interacting in water containing background constituents likely to be found in treatment water such as natural organic matter (NOM) and phosphate, as well as in effluent from a waste-water treatment plant (WWTP). Hydroxyl radicals were much more susceptible to hindrance by all three background matrices (NOM, phosphate and WWTP effluent) tested, while 102 was only slightly inhibited by NOM and not by phosphate or WWTP effluent. A mechanistic model accounting for this inhibition in terms of radical scavenging and inner filter effects was developed, and accurately simulated the results of the NOM interactions. These results underscore the importance of considering the effect of background constituents in the selection of photocatalysts and in the design of AOPs for emerging applications in tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent and disinfection of natural waters.

AB The accurate quantification of enantiomers is crucial for assessing the biodegradation of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment. Methods to quantify enantiomers in environmental matrices are scarce. Here, we used an enantioselective method, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD), to analyze two beta-blockers, metoprolol and atenolol, and the antidepressant fluoxetine in an activated sludge consortium from a wastewater treatment plant. The vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase was used under polar ionic mode to achieve the enantioseparation of target chiral pharmaceuticals in a single chromatographic run. The method was successfully validated over a concentration range of 20-800 ng/mL for each enantiomer of both beta-blockers and of 50-800 ng/mL for fluoxetine enantiomers. The limits of detection were between 5 and 20 ng/mL and the limits of quantification were between 20 and 50 ng/mL, for all enantiomers. The intra- and inter-batch precision was lower than 5.66 and 8.37 %, respectively. Accuracy values were between 103.03 and 117.92 %, and recovery rates were in the range of 88.48-116.62 %. Furthermore, the enantioselective biodegradation of atenolol, metoprolol and fluoxetine was followed during 15 days. The (S)-enantiomeric form of metoprolol was degraded at higher extents, whereas the degradation of atenolol and fluoxetine did not show enantioselectivity under the applied conditions.

AB Granular activated carbon (GAC) filters can be used to reduce emissions of organic micropollutants via municipal wastewater, but it is still uncertain to which extent biological degradation contributes to their removal in GAC filters. C-14-labeled organic micropollutants were therefore used to distinguish degradation from adsorption in a GAC-filter media with associated biofilm. The rates and extents of biological degradation and adsorption were investigated and compared with other biofilm systems, including a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and a sand filter, by monitoring C-14 activities in the liquid and gas phases. The microbial cleavage of ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and mecoprop was confirmed for all biofilms, based on the formation of (CO2)-C-14, whereas the degradation of C-14-labeled moieties of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine was undetected. Higher degradation rates for diclofenac were observed for the GAC-filter media than for the other biofilms. Degradation of previously adsorbed diclofenac onto GAC could be confirmed by the anaerobic adsorption and subsequent aerobic degradation by the GAC-bound biofilm. This study demonstrates the potential use of C-14-labeled micropollutants to study interactions and determine the relative contributions of adsorption and degradation in GAC-based treatment systems.

AB The global reliance on pharmaceuticals coupled with the lack of effective treatment methods has resulted in pseudo-persistence of pharmaceuticals within the environment. Globally, efforts to quantify and monitor pharmaceuticals within the environment have been well underway, however few studies have been made within small Pacific Islands. This study aims at screening for the occurrence and concentration of pharmaceutical residues within the southern coastal waters of Fiji's main island, Viti Levu. Water samples were collected from a depth of ca. 0.6 m from seven sites and were analyzed for 80 pharmaceuticals via a combination of chromatography and heated electrospray ionization. Seventy-two pharmaceuticals were quantified at least once with average concentrations ranging between 0.04 ng/L (diltiazem) and 19 ng/L (ketoconazole), and with all but two pharmaceuticals (trimethoprim and biperiden) being present in less than 50% of the samples. Findings suggest that even though the release of pharmaceuticals into the marine environment is sporadic and pharmaceuticals are diluted via turbulent mixing, there are measurable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in Fiji and these pollutants are not necessarily restricted to highly populated areas.

AB Dissipation potential of four algae viz. Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris was investigated against ten antibiotics (sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamonomethoxine, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, lomefloxacin, levofloxacin and flumequine) in a series of synthetic wastewater batch culture experiments, maintained at 20, 50 and 100 mu g L-1 initial concentration levels and incubated over a period of 40 days. Generally, the antibiotic removal was achieved with overall dissipation percentage (%) varying among the algal species and different antibiotics. Biodegradation was the major antibiotic removal mechanism from the dissolved fraction, with minor contributions of bioadsorption, bioaccumulation, and abiotic factors. The antibiotics dissipation followed the pseudo-first-order-kinetics with the fastest antibiotic degradation rate achieved by H. pluvialis. The Monod kinetics was successfully applied to explain the relationship between the algal growth and the removal of antibiotics and nutrients in the batch cultures. S. capricornutum and C. vulgaris showed more affinity for the macrolides and fluoroquinolones than sulfonamides, while, H. pluvialis and S. quadiricauda showed relatively higher preference for sulfonamides than the other antibiotic groups. A total of 10 transformation products were identified and the transformation pathway was proposed, accordingly. Most of the transformation products had lower toxicity compared with their parent antibiotics.

AB Considerable interest has been given to using nanofiltration (NF) in lieu of reverse osmosis for water reclamation schemes due to lower energy consumption, higher flux rates while ensuring good micropollutants rejection. The application NF results in the generation of a large concentrated waste stream. Treatment of the concentrate is a major hurdle for the implementation of membrane technologies since the concentrate is usually unusable due to a large pollutants content. This work focuses on the application of ozonation as pretreatment of urban NF concentrates, the generation of transformation products and their relative toxicity. Three pharmaceutical micropollutants largely encountered in water cycle were selected as target molecules: acetaminophen, carbamazepine and atenolol. Through accurate-mass Q-TOF LC-MS/MS analyses, more than twenty ozonation products were detected, structure proposals and formation pathways were elaborated. Attempts were made to understand the correlation between the transformation products and acute toxicity on Vibrio fischeri strain. It is the first time that an integrated study reported on the ozonation of pharmaceuticals in urban membrane concentrates, in terms of transformation products, kinetics, degradation mechanisms, as well as toxicity assessment.

AB The potential for nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) in secondary effluent reclamation is noteworthy, but both processes require extensive pre-treatment to prevent membrane fouling and promote system longevity. In this study, performance of direct ultrafiltration (UF) and tertiary membrane bioreactors (tMBRs) as feed pretreatments were assessed on a pilot scale. Both technologies achieved high organic matter removal (87 and 93% for UF and tMBR, respectively). Differences in efficiencies were related to suspended biomass in the tMBR, which enhanced degradation of the dissolved organic substances (<5 mg/L) and also stabilized process performance by minimizing residual fouling. Whichever pre-treatment was applied, RO reached higher rejection coefficients and low fouling levels. Nevertheless, lower normalized flux (12%) was achieved when the UF effluent was fed due to high concentration of organic substances. Membrane autopsies by scanning electron microscopy with dispersive X-ray and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed that organic fouling appears to be predominant on both NF/RO membranes. The main organic foulants identified were polysaccharides and proteins. Inorganic foulants mainly consisted of calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Complete removal of pharmaceutical active compounds was observed for RO, while NF presented moderate retention coefficients (94, 85, 70, and 27% for atenolol, paraxanthine, caffeine and clofibric acid, respectively).

AB Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease affecting a large portion of the world population and is treated by orally administered drugs. Since these drugs are often taken in high doses and are excreted unchanged or partially metabolised many of them are nowadays detected in surface waters or wastewater treatment plants effluents. Unmetabolised antidiabetics or some of their transformation products retain their pharmacological activity, therefore their presence in the environment is highly undesired. One of the main routes of elimination from wastewaters or surface waters is biodegradation. Within this work we tested primary biodegradation of: metformin and its metabolite guanylurea, acarbose, glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride. We also inspected what might be the extent of the degradation by examining the products formed during the degradation using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Transformation of diabetes staple drug metformin to dead-end product guanylurea was generally confirmed. An alternative, though rather minor pathway leading to complete mineralisation was also found. Complete primary degradation was observed for acarbose, glibenclamide and glimepiride whereas gliclazide was shown to be resistant to biodegradation. These results allow a preliminary assessment of environmental persistency of a very important group of pharmaceuticals and show need for implementing monitoring programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUNDSynthetic musks are massively used in personal care and cosmetic products and they reach the environment mainly because they are not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this work, an innovative and simple chemical scoring and ranking approach was developed as a screening tool to evaluate the overall impact of musks on the environment, identifying priority compounds. This system is idealised as an important tool for a subsequently feasible environmental risk assessment of musks that may represent the overall contamination on a regional scale.
   RESULTSPhysicochemical and toxicological properties of 18 synthetic musks estimated by (Q)SAR were successfully used for the chemical scoring and combined with observed data to estimate the environmental impact posed by these compounds on four environmental compartments.
   CONCLUSIONThe prioritisation approach for musks shows that the risk of a compound can vary depending on the compartments, although HHCB posed a high to very high risk to all of them. For instance, AHMI has a relevant risk to soil and air, but very low to low in water and sediments, while AHTN was considered to be of medium risk for water and soil, but of a very high risk to sediments and air.

AB The illicit manufacture of methamphetamine (MAP) produces substantial amounts of hazardous waste that is dumped illegally. This study presents the first environmental evaluation of waste produced from illicit MAP manufacture. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured to assess immediate oxygen depletion effects. A mixture of five waste components (10 mg/L/chemical) was found to have a COD (130 mg/L) higher than the European Union wastewater discharge regulations (125 mg/L). Two environmental partition coefficients, K-OW and K-OC, were measured for several chemicals identified in MAP waste. Experimental values were input into a computer fugacity model (EPI Suite (TM)) to estimate environmental fate. Experimental log K-OW values ranged from -0.98 to 4.91, which were in accordance with computer estimated values. Experimental K-OC values ranged from 11 to 72, which were much lower than the default computer values. The experimental fugacity model for discharge to water estimates that waste components will remain in the water compartment for 15 to 37 days. Using a combination of laboratory experimentation and computer modelling, the environmental fate of MAP waste products was estimated. While fugacity models using experimental and computational values were very similar, default computer models should not take the place of laboratory experimentation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Surface waters worldwide are contaminated by pharmaceutical products that are released into the environment from wastewater treatment plants. Here, we hypothesize that pharmaceutical products have effects on organisms as well as genes related to nutrient cycling in complex microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, biofilms were grown in reactors and subjected low concentrations of three antibiotics [erythromycin, ER, sulfamethoxazole, SL and sulfamethazine, SN) and a lipid regulator (gemfibrozil, GM). Total community RNA was extracted and sequenced together with PCR amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Exposure to pharmaceutical products resulted in very little change in bacterial community composition at the phylum level based on 16S rRNA gene amplicons, even though some genera were significantly affected. In contrast, large shifts were observed in the active community composition based on taxonomic affiliations of mRNA sequences. Consequently, expression of gene categories related to N, P and C cycling were strongly affected by the presence of pharmaceutical products, with each treatment having specific effects. These results indicate that low pharmaceutical product concentrations rapidly provoke a variety of functional shifts in river bacterial communities. In the longer term these shifts in gene expression and microbial activity could lead to a disruption of important ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling.

AB The evaluation of treatment costs is one of the aspects which need more attention for the complete introduction of electrochemical reactors as an attractive alternative in the field of advanced oxidation processes. This paper presents the derivation and application of an expression to determine the optimal current density in order to carry out the direct electroxidation process of two pharmaceutical-compound-containing aqueous solutions (50 mg dm(-3)) in a parallel plate divided cell using platinized titanium as the anode. The calculi are based on the classical definition of the total cost of electrolyzers, including the electrode service life and completed by one experimental value (obtaining a semi-empirical equation) related to the relationship between the abatement kinetics and the applied current density. The determined value of the optimal current density resulted to be far from the diffusion-limiting current density, consequently, far from the maximum current efficiency, since the experimental parameter includes all other phenomenologies associated with rising in the electrical field across the cell. The methodology could be useful to compare, in terms of cost, different electrochemical reactors and electrode materials for the treatment of a specific organic pollutant. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

AB LaFeO3/Diatomite porous disk composites have been successfully prepared by sol-gel method for the photocatalytic oxidative degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) compounds. The structure of the porous disc plays an important role in improving the photocatalytic activity by increasing the contact area between the photocatalyst and CIP to enhance CIP molecule adsorption. Meanwhile, the porous disk composite photocatalysts can effectively prevent the recombination of light-induced electron-hole pairs. A photo-Fenton-like reaction is triggered by addition of H2O2, which further remarkably improves the photocatalytic activity of LaFeO3/Diatomite. Then, the factors like catalyst concentration, H2O2 dosage, initial pH and CIP concentration of the solution responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the reaction system are investigated. The optimal degradation rate of ciprofloxacin by the LaFeO3/Diatomite catalyst is 99.02 % after visible light irradiation for 150 min, which is 1.22 times of the pure LaFeO3. The catalysts have a much high stability which can be recycled for many times and the degradation rate of four cycles is still about 98 %. The excellent performance and high photocatalytic efficiency of the LaFeO3/Diatomite photocatalyst make it have potential application foreground in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB In this study, modeling and simulation of removing a common pharmaceutical contaminant by a hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC) were carried out. For this purpose, a model was presented for separation of ibuprofen from wastewater in the membrane contactor. The suggested model was developed by coupling the mass and momentum equations. The partial differential equations (PDEs) and the corresponding boundary conditions of the model were solved using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The results showed that the predictions of this model were in close agreement with experimental data obtained from the literature. Moreover, the effects of different design and operating parameters on the removal of ibuprofen were studied. The simulation results revealed that the removal of ibuprofen was increased by increasing the membrane porosity and the length of fibers. The ibuprofen removal efficiency was also enhanced up to 93.2 and 90.2% by increasing the inner radius and the number of fibers from 110 to 145 mu m and 3,000 to 15,000, respectively. As a result, this study illustrates the successful development of the CFD model for prediction of ibuprofen removal using HFMC according to which removal efficiency of more than 95% was achieved.

AB The membrane aerated biofilms reactor (MABR) is an emerging technology in wastewater treatment with particular advantages including high rate nitrification, and very high oxygen transfer efficiencies. In this study a synthetic feed water incorporating tetracycline (TC) was investigated in a MABR. Simultaneous removal of ammonium and tetracycline (TC) in the reactor, formation of TC transformation products (TPs), and microbial community analysis in the biofilm growing on the membrane were performed. A range of TC and ammonium loading rates and the effect of different infra-membrane oxygen pressures were on treatment performance were systematically investigated. Successful nitrification and TC degradation were achieved with the highest TC removal (63%) obtained at a HRT of 18 h HRT and 0.41 bar gas pressure. It has shown that different operating conditions (HRT and gas pressure) do not cause a significant change in ammonium removal. The concentration of TPs such as ETC, EATC, and ATC was determined to be at the ppb level. Molecular results showed that MABR reactor was mainly dominated by beta-proteobacteria. The relative abundance of this group decreased in parallel with the increasing ammonium and TC loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel magnetic MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 composite was synthesized for photo degradation of tetracycline (TC) under solar light. The composite was characterized by XRD, TGA, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, FTIR, XPS, VSM, ESR, and PL. The resultant composite was environment friendly material, which exhibited high TC degradation efficiency and excellent reusability. In the meantime, it could be separated easily from TC solution by using magnet, which would save significant time and cost of preparation and degradation, having broad prospect in application. Using 1 g L-1 magnetic MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 at pH = 7, 92.76% degradation efficiency was achieved under solar light irradiation in 10 min for 20 mg L-1 TC. Further experiments indicated that TiO2 introduced in the composite played an important role in the degradation process, which could be activated by the UV light in solar light to generate large amount of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals. The degradation efficiency of TC in this paper was significantly higher than other research papers reported in last three years. This study put forward new magnetic Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)/TiO2 composite for degrading pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Dyes have been used for more than twenty thousand years in textile, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and photographic industries, among others. Despite their importance in these applications, dyes can be toxic and resistant to many degradation processes used in wastewater treatment plants. Although a large number of dyes have been released in the environments in high amounts, studies into the environmental toxicity of these substances are still scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxic effects of textile dyes Disperse Red 60, Disperse Red 73 and Disperse Red 78 in zebrafish early life stages. To this end, biochemical biomarkers were selected to evaluate non-enzimatic antioxidant (Total Glutathione), antioxidant enzymes (Glutathione S-transferase and Catalase), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase) and energetic metabolism parameters (energy available and energy consumed) after 96 h exposure to these dyes. Our results demonstrated that these disperse dyes induce biochemical alterations in zebrafish embryos at environmental realistic concentrations and that the discharge of these disperse dyes into water bodies should be carefully evaluated. The selected biomarkers were sensitive as early-warning endpoints of disperse dyes toxicity on zebrafish embryos. Implications for risk assessment and indications for future research are discussed.

AB The hypoglycemic pharmaceutical glibenclamide (GLB) is widely used around the world. This medication is released into the environment by municipal, hospital and industrial wastewater discharges. Although there are reports of its environmental occurrence in the scientific literature, toxicity studies on aquatic species of commercial interest such as the common carp Cyprinus carpio are scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced on C carpio by environmentally relevant concentrations of GLB. Biomarkers of oxidative damage such as hydroperoxide content, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content were evaluated as well as the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. The concentration of GLB was determined in water as well as in gill, liver, muscle, brain and blood of carp at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The findings obtained in the study prove that GLB induces increases in biomarkers of oxidative damage and antioxidant enzyme activity in the teleost C. carpio, that this response is not concentration dependent and that the organs evaluated bioconcentrate this hypoglycemic agent. These findings permit us to conclude that the presence of GLB in water bodies represents a risk for aquatic species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A major environmental concern has recently developed due to emerging pollutants (EC) that are nowadays being detected in the effluents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) at very low concentrations, thanks to improved analytical techniques. Pharmaceutical compounds (PhACs) are some of the most hazardous EC. These compounds can be retained into the water cycle (from users to WWTP, and then to water sources by discharge) virtually endlessly. Thus innovative solutions are required, such as the advanced oxidation processes (AOP). Among them, combined treatments based on UV light appear to be eco-friendly, giving very interesting removal efficiencies if opportunely devised. In this paper, the removal of diclofenac, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), from synthetic water streams was explored by using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at fixed wavelength and intensity (254 nm; 400 mJ m(-2)). The experimental tests have been carried out to evaluate the effect of treatment time and to verify the possibility of further degrading the obtained compound. The preliminary results confirm what has been recently and unexpectedly found in literature, that is the formation of a dimer during the first minutes of photolysis, carbazole, a very stable coloured intermediate.

AB Bulky organic pollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceutical residues are found in wastewater and are difficult to remove by microporous adsorbents because of their large size. Hierarchical zeolites as potential adsorbents for removal of heavy organic pollutants from aqueous phase are investigated. Hierarchical HMOR and HZSM-5 samples were obtained by post-synthesis desilication by alkaline treatment followed or not by acid leaching of the microporous parent zeolites. The obtained materials have been fully characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 physisorption, elemental analysis, pyridine adsorption followed by FTIR. Alkaline treatments lead to a framework desilication creating mesopores with the preservation of the Bronsted acidity. Material adsorption behaviors are studied in pesticide, mesosulfuron-methyl (MM), removal from aqueous phase. For all the materials, adsorption kinetics are well described by a pseudo-second order model indicating that MM molecules are chemisorbed via acido-basic interaction of the neutral form. Sorption isotherms are S-shape isotherms for the parent samples and evolve to more favorable concave isotherms for highly mesoporous samples. Thus hierarchical zeolites exhibit higher sorption rate and capacities than microporous ones. Soft acid leaching treatments carried out after alkaline one help to clean the zeolite porosity from silica debris and to enhance significantly zeolite adsorption efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plants and surface waters has been detected worldwide, constituting a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems. Adult zebrafish, of both sexes, were exposed to three common pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, ketoprofen and diclofenac) and their UV photolysis by-products over seven days. The results show that diclofenac was removed to concentrations < LOD after 5 min of UV irradiation. The oxidative stress response of zebrafish to pharmaceuticals and their photolysis by-products was evaluated through oxidative stress enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase) and lipid peroxidation. Results suggest that the photolysis by-products of diclofenac were more toxic than those from the other compounds tested, showing an increase in GST and CAT levels, which are also supported by higher MDA levels. Overall, the toxicity of waters containing atenolol and ketoprofen was reduced after the parent compounds were transformed by photolysis, whereas the toxicity increased significantly from the by-products generated through diclofenac photolysis. Therefore, diclofenac photolysis would possibly necessitate higher irradiation time to ensure that the associated by-products are completely degraded to harmless form(s). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to provide insights into the fate and effects of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on nitrogen transformation processes in integrated vertical-flow constructed wetlands (IVCW), which is useful to create strategies to improve their degradation and combat antibiotic resistance dissemination. Findings indicated chronic exposure to SMX to cause moderate deterioration of IVCW performance for nitrogen removal (p < 0.05), with average TN removal efficiency reductions of circa 10%. High-throughput sequencing and network analysis demonstrated chronic exposure of antibiotics to impact functional bacteria, ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ANAMMOX, significantly. ANNAMMOX emerged as a potential pathway of nitrogen removal in the IVCW, albeit with considerable accumulation of NO3--N (12.76 mg/L) and carbon deficiency (C/N = 0.99). Nonetheless, IVCW provides a promising technology for the advanced treatment of antibiotic-containing wastewater, demonstrated by a high and stable removal efficiency (circa 95%) of sulfamethoxazole. Biodegradation, primarily in the first stage of the IVCW, represented the major removal pathway of SMX. Microbial network analysis and the enrichment of Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas and Luteimonas demonstrated potential for the biodegradation of SMX. These results provide a theoretical reference for the enhancement of nitrogen and antibiotics removal in constructed wetlands.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the top 100 pharmaceutical prescribed annually worldwide and consequently is often detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent and surface waters, in concentrations up to 2.7 and 0.33 mu g/L, respectively. Despite the presence of FLX in surface waters, little is known about its chronic effects in fish. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the chronic toxicity of FLX to Danio rerio adults. Rate of weight gain, behavior (feeding and swimming activity) and tissue organization (liver and intestine) were evaluated, after 30 days exposure. A lower rate of weight gain was observed at 100 mu g/L FLX. The food intake time decreased, showing a decrease in fish appetite. The preference for the upper aquarium layer was observed at 10 and 100 mu g/L of FLX, indicating an inhibition of the stress level (anxiolytic effect). Mild to moderate damage of hepatic tissue and a decrease epithelium height and increase in villus height of intestine were observed in fish exposed to concentrations as low as 0.01 mu g/L. Based on obtained results, chronic exposure of fish to FLX could affect swimming and feeding behavior and alter morphological structure of liver and intestine tissues at environmental levels.

AB The importance of stereochemistry on the behaviour and effects of chiral pharmaceutical and illicit drugs in amended agricultural soils has been over looked to date. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the enantiospecific behaviour of a chemically diverse range of chiral drugs including naproxen, ibuprofen, salbutamol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, acebutolol, atenolol, chlorpheniramine, amphetamine, fluoxetine and citalopram in soil microcosms. Considerable changes of the enantiomeric composition of ibuprofen, naproxen, atenolol, acebutolol and amphetamine were observed within 56 d. This is significant as enantiomer enrichment can favour the pharmacologically active (e.g., S(-)-atenolol) or less/non-active forms of the drug (e.g., R(-)-amphetamine). Single enantiomer microcosms showed enantiospecific degradation was responsible for enantiomer enrichment of atenolol and amphetamine. However, naproxen and ibuprofen enantiomers were subject to chiral inversion whereby one enantiomer converts to its antipode. Interestingly, chiral inversion was bidirectional and this is the first time it is reported in soil. Therefore, introduction of the less active enantiomer to soil through irrigation with reclaimed wastewater or biosolids as fertiliser can result in the formation of its active enantiomer, or vice versa. This phenomenon needs considered in risk assessment frameworks to avoid underestimating the risk posed by chiral drugs in amended soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of pharmaceuticals from contaminated water has remained a major challenge in recent times. This present work reports the solar photoelectrocatalytic removal of ciprofloxacin using n-n heterojunction BiVO4/MnO2 prepared by electrodeposition on a FTO glass as anode. The semiconductor photoanodes were characterised with XRD, SEM, EDS, diffusive reflectance UV-vis, voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The calculated charge carrier density of BiVO4/MnO2 from Mott-Schottky plot as well as its photocurrent response were greater than those of pristine BiVO4 and MnO2 revealing that the band alignment between the two semiconductors resulted in inhibition of rapid recombination of electron - hole pairs. A degradation efficiency of 76 % was achieved in the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of ciprofloxacin using a bias potential of 1.5 V within 2 h with holes and hydroxyl radicals playing predominant roles. The highest degradation efficiency obtained with photoelectrocatalytic oxidation was due to synergistic effect of both electrochemical and photocatalytic degradation. The degradation of ciprofloxacin on the electrode proceeded through the rapid oxidation of piperazine ring of ciprofloxacin within a short time as indicated by chromatographic analysis of the degradation products. The electrode has excellent stability and reusability suggesting its suitability as photoanode for the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater.

AB Hybrid CO2-activated system, which consists of precipitation and adsorption was utilized for removal of diclofenac (DCF) from aqueous solution. Diclofenac in CO2-activated system was precipitated by the solubility reduction in water. The effects of temperature, initial DCF concentration and CO2 flow rate on the precipitation efficiencies are investigated. The precipitation of DCF in CO2-activated system results in the reduction of DCF concentration in the aqueous solution less than 5 mg L-1. High initial DCF concentration and high CO2 flow rate achieve a rapid precipitation of DCF in the aqueous solution. Three kinds of adsorbents, chitosan, carbon nanotube and carbon nanofiber were used for the DCF adsorption in CO2-activated system. The carbon-based materials as adsorbents lead to the high adsorption efficiencies of DCF by the protonation of DCF and pi-electron on the aromatic rings of the carbon-based absorbents. Carbon nanofiber in CO2-activated system results in the adsorption efficiency 97.6% and the reduction of DCF concentration less than 0.115 mg L-1. Characterizations of the adsorbents with the zeta-potential, Fourier Transform Infrared spectra and thermogravimetric analysis were also conducted to discuss the DCF adsorption mechanism in CO2-activated system.

AB A novel cryptomelane-Ir (cry-Ir) electrode is prepared for Ir to enter into the cryptomelane (named as cry-Mn) structure and used for aspirin degradation. This catalyst can efficiently reduce the Ir usage from 85 to 34%. Also, the onset potential of cry-Ir is about 1.40 V and the over potential is about 0.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating that cry-Ir has an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity to produce oxidizing species and can decrease electrolytic voltage during the electro-oxidation process. So, the electrical efficiency per log order (EE/O) for cry-Ir electrode is only 5% of PbO2 electrode, which is the best electrode for organic degradation. Also, cry-Ir has large tunnel size which favors insertion of aspirin molecule into cry-Ir structure and enhances the contact between reactive intermediates and the contaminant. Using cry-Ir as anode, 100% aspirin removal and 55% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal could be obtained at 4 V. We also compare cry-Ir electrode with IrO2 and find that IrO2 anode can only eliminate 20% aspirin under the same condition. As a result, cry-Ir is a promising anode material for organic pollutant degradation.

AB Water shortage is becoming more common due to droughts and global population increases resulting in the increasing popularity of water reuse to create new water sources. Reverse osmosis (RO) membrane systems are popular in these applications since they can produce drinking water quality effluent. Unfortunately, RO systems have the drawback of generating concentrate streams that contain contaminants rejected by the membrane including chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). CECs are chemicals such as hormones, steroids, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products that are used for their intended purpose and then released into wastewater. CECs are believed to be detrimental to aquatic wildlife health and pose an unknown human health risk. This research gathered the existing knowledge on CEC presence in concentrate, available proven concentrate treatment methods, their CEC removal abilities, and current CEC regulations. It was found that 127 CECs have been measured in RO concentrate with 100 being detected at least once. The most potent treatment process available is UV/H2O2 as it offers the highest removal rates for the widest range of chemicals. The less expensive process of ozone/biologically activated carbon offers slightly lower removal abilities. This comprehensive report will provide the groundwork for better understanding, regulating and treating concentrate stream CECs.

AB This study examines the degradation of the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) by sonolysis, TiO2-based heterogeneous photocatalysis under UV-A and simulated solar irradiation, and by the combined use of UV-A and ultrasound irradiation (i.e. sonophotocatalysis) in demineralized water, ground water and effluent wastewater. The processes were compared with respect to substrate conversion rate and the extent of DOC reduction as a measure of mineralization. CBZ was degraded following a pseudo-first order kinetics. Sonophotocatalysis provided the highest rate of CBZ transformation over the time-course of the experiment while the degree of DOC removal in pure water was similar for all the studied treatments (around 40%), and always lower than CBZ conversion. This indicated that a considerable organic load remained in the treated solutions that could also be attributed to the presence of persistent oxidation products. UPLC-(+ESI)-QToE-MS was employed to determine major CBZ-related transformation products. Several recalcitrant hydroxy- and keto-derivatives of CBZ were tentatively identified. A Daphnia magna bioassay was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the samples collected at different time points showing that the mixtures were highly toxic to D. magna.

AB The traditional wastewater treatment plants are mostly not designed to deal with polar micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals. Therefore, antibiotics must be completely removed before their emission to ecosystems. Catalytic ozonation is used to increase the efficiency of sole ozonation further. In the present study, semi-batch experiments were conducted to investigate the efficiency of sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation in the degradation of oxy-tetracycline (OTC) as an environmental hazards contaminant in an aqueous solutions. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) were used as a catalytic agent with ozone (ZnO/O-3). The influence of operational parameters such as pH (3-11), initial oxy-tetracycline concentration (10-100) mg/l, temperature (15-35)degrees C, ozone generation rate (0.138-1.38)mg/s and catalyst dosage (25-200) mg/l on the ZnO/O-3 process was investigated. Ozone dosage was found to have the noticeable effect on the degradation process; however, the ZnO dosage was found to be less effective. The optimum condition was 1.38 mg/s at pH = 7, and after 35 min, a 94% of OTC removal was achieved. The results demonstrated that catalytic ozonation was a very effective method for degradation and mineralization of OTC in aqueous solution.

AB Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain reliever, is among pharmaceutical residues of environmental concern ubiquitously detected in wastewater effluents and receiving rivers. Thus, ibuprofen removal potentials and associated bacteria in the hyporheic zone sediments of an impacted river were investigated. Microbially mediated ibuprofen degradation was determined in oxic sediment microcosms amended with ibuprofen (5, 40, 200, and 400 mu M), or ibuprofen and acetate, relative to an un-amended control. Ibuprofen was removed by the original sediment microbial community as well as in ibuprofen-enrichments obtained by re-feeding of ibuprofen. Here, 1-, 2-, 3-hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen were the primary transformation products. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher 16S rRNA abundance in ibuprofen-amended relative to un-amended incubations. Time-resolved microbial community dynamics evaluated by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses revealed many new ibuprofen responsive taxa of the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Latescibacteria, and Proteobacteria. Two ibuprofen-degrading strains belonging to the generaNovosphingobiumandPseudomonaswere isolated from the ibuprofen-enriched sediments, consuming 400 and 300 mu M ibuprofen within three and eight days, respectively. The collective results indicated that the hyporheic zone sediments sustain an efficient biotic (micro-)pollutant degradation potential, and hitherto unknown microbial diversity associated with such (micro)pollutant removal.

AB In this study, an electrochemical sensor has been introduced by incorporating Pd-doped ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-Pd/NPs) into a carbon paste (CP) matrix amplified by a conductive binder (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (1H3MIBTMSI), in this case) to determine the concentration of the sulfisoxazole (SFX) drug in urine, tablet, and pharmaceutical wastewater samples. ZnO-Pd/NPs were successfully synthesizedviaa one-pot procedure based on the precipitation strategy, and characterizedviaFE-SEM, TEM, EDAX, MAP, and XRD methods. Using ZnO-Pd/NP/1H3MIBTMSI/CPE as the working electrode, a dramatic increase in the oxidation current of SFX was observed, and the sensor was used for determining SFX within the concentration range of 0.009 mu M to 430 mu M (R-2= 0.9981). Due to the high conductivity of ZnO-Pd/NP/1H3MIBTMSI/CPE, the sensor showed a limit of detection of 5.0 nM and was introduced as the first analytical sensor for determining SFX at the nanomolar level. The real sample analysis results showed a recovery range of 98.8-104.15% for the determination of SFX, which confirms the potential of ZnO-Pd/NP/1H3MIBTMSI/CPE for the determination of SFX in urine and pharmaceutical samples.

AB Hydrogels are three dimensional materials with modifying surface which containing more functional groups and it is used in many applications such as hygienic products, agriculture, drug delivery systems, sealing, coal dewatering, food additives and pharmaceuticals. Mostly, it is implemented in biomedical applications like tissue engineering and regenerative medicines, diagnostics, wound dressing, separation of biomolecules or cells and barrier materials to regulate biological adhesions and in biosensors. Herein we report the preparation of aminated guar gum/graphene oxide (AGG/GO) hydrogel using borax as a crosslinker, which has a high surface area with a crosslinked structure for enhanced removal of dyes and heavy metals. The chemical moieties, morphological and structural properties of the AGG/GO hydrogel were examined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis respectively. The swelling properties of hydrogels were demonstrated, followed by viscoelastic studies using rheological analysis found that the material is stable up to an applied frequency of 10 Hz. Interestingly, removal efficiency of the AGG/GO hydrogels for Cu(II), Malachite green, Methylene blue and Rhodamine B dyes were found to be 88, 98, 90, and 75% respectively from aqueous solutions.

AB The highly prescribed antidepressant, citalopram, as one of newly emerging pollutants, has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Citalopram oxidation was examined during sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) chlorination processes since conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot remove citalopram effectively. Citalopram has been demonstrated to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during chlorination in our previous study. Further investigation on NDMA formation kinetics was conducted in the present study. Influences of operational variables (disinfectant dose, pH value) and water matrix on citalopram degradation, as well as NDMA generation, were evaluated. The results indicated high reactivity of citalopram with NaOCl and ClO2. NDMA formation included two stages during CIT oxidation, which were linear related with reaction time. NaOCl was more beneficial to remove CIT, but it caused more NDMA formation. Increasing disinfectant dosage promoted citalopram removal and NDMA formation. However, no consistent correlation was found between citalopram removal and pH. Contrary to the situation of citalopram removal, NDMA generation was enhanced when citalopram was present in actual water matrices, especially in secondary effluent. DMA, as an intermediate of citalopram chlorination, contributed to NDMA formation, but not the only way.

AB To address the issue of global freshwater shortages, wastewater has become an increasingly valuable alternative for crop irrigation. As a result, trace levels of emerging contaminants, including antibiotics, may occur in water used for food production. The objective of this study was to investigate how soil texture affected the availability and uptake of three chemically diverse antibiotics (lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole) by lettuce grown in soils comprised of silt clay and increasing percentages of sand. Lettuce was irrigated routinely with antibiotic-amended water (1mg/L) from seed germination through the first harvest (40 days), switched to control water, and fate monitored at days 45 and 50. Sulfamethoxazole was the only compound where tissue concentrations increased with increasing sand concentrations to 24.7ng/g fresh weight (FW). Lincomycin was most readily accumulated with increasing concentrations observed at the second harvest in both the loam (68.3ng/g FW) and sandy soils (66.6ng/g FW). Apparent toxicity of the antibiotic mixture resulted in decreasing plant mass (37-72%) with increasing sand content. Results from this study show that soil texture impacts plant growth, contaminant transport, plant uptake, and toxic effects, which all contribute to, observed concentrations in edible plant portions.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are inefficient for the removal of parabens. The aim of this study was finding a suitable solution using ozone and UVA irradiation combined with TiO2 catalysts doped with different noble metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic ozonation required lower amounts of ozone for higher efficiency on the removal of parabens, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC). The best catalyst for the initial contaminants degradation was 05% Ag-TiO2 leading to total parabens removal using 46 mgO(3)/L. Due to the relative low mineralization achieved, the toxicity of the treated solutions was still compared with the initial one over several species Vibriofscheri, Lepidiurn sativurri and Corbic-ula fluminen). All the treatments applied led to a clear decrease on the toxicity compared with initial mixture of parabens. From an economical point of view, it was concluded that the presence of UVA irradiation increased the energy consumption compared with catalytic ozonation with these catalysts but it can decrease the time of reaction. From the by-products analysis, it was concluded that hydroxylation appears to be the most significant reaction pathway and the main responsible for parabens degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The continuous release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into freshwater systems impacts the health of aquatic organisms. This study evaluates the concentrations and bioaccumulation of PPCPs and the selective uptake of antidepressants in fish from the Niagara River, which connects two of the North American Great lakes (Erie and Ontario). The Niagara River receives PPCPs from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) situated along the river and Lake Erie. Of the 22 targeted PPCPs, 11 were found at part-per-billion levels in WWTP effluents and at part per-trillion levels in river water samples. The major pollutants observed were the antidepressants (citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion, and their metabolites norfluoxetine and norsertraline) and the antihistamine diphenhydramine. These PPCPs accumulate in various fish organs, with norsertraline exhibiting the highest bioaccumulation factor (up to about 3000) in the liver of rudd (Scardinius elythrophthalmus), which is an invasive species to the Great Lakes. The antidepressants were selectively taken up by various fish species at different trophic levels, and were further metabolized once inside the organism. The highest bioaccumulation was found in the brain, followed by liver, muscle, and gonads, and can be attributed to direct exposure to WWTP effluent.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial ingredient found in personal care products that include soaps, shampoos, and other sanitation goods. TCS is moderately hydrophobic and has been shown to be resistant to wastewater treatment and thus accumulates in biosolids. Biosolids are commonly applied to agricultural land but little is known about the risk that TCS in biosolids poses to soil fungal communities following land application. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of TCS on the symbiotic colonization of roots in three field crops (soybean, corn, and spring wheat) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils amended with four different types of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, composted, alkaline and hydrolyzed). Crops were grown to maturity in pot-exposure systems under controlled temperature settings. Biosolids treatments were spiked with concentrations of TCS typically found in amended fields. Analysis of AMF colonization by hyphae, and the production of arbuscules and vesicles indicated no significantTCS concentration -dependent effects in the three plant species for any of the biosolids formulations. The data indicate that TCS present in municipal biosolids applied to agricultural lands likely poses minimal risks to AMF or its establishment of a symbiotic relationship in the three species tested.

AB The increase use of pharmaceutical compounds in veterinary practice and human population results in the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. Because pharmaceuticals are highly bioactive, there is concern about their toxicological effects in aquatic organisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of an effluent from a psychiatric hospital (containing a complex mixture of 25 pharmaceutical compounds from eleven therapeutic classes) on the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea using a proteomic approach. The exposure of C. fluminea to this complex effluent containing anxiolytics, analgesics, lipid regulators, beta blockers, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, antiplatelets and antiarrhythmics induced protein changes after 1 day of exposure in clam gills and digestive gland more evident in the digestive gland. These changes included increase in the abundance of proteins associated with structural (actin and tubulin), cellular functions (calreticulin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), T complex protein 1 (TCP1)) and metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). Results from this study indicate that calreticulin, PCNA, ALDH and alcohol dehydrogenase in the digestive gland and T complex protein 1 (TCP1)) and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the gills represent useful biomarkers for the ecotoxicological characterization of psychiatric hospital effluents in this species.

AB Water reuse is becoming a common practice in several areas in the world, particularly in those impacted by water scarcity driven by climate change and/or by rising human demand. Since conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not able to efficiently remove many organic contaminants and pathogens, more advanced water treatment processes should be applied to WWTP effluents for water reclamation purposes. In this work, a pilot plant based on microfiltration (MF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) filtration was applied to the effluents of an urban WWTP. Both the WWTP and the pilot plant were investigated with regards to the removal of a group of relevant contaminants widely spread in the environment: 28 pharmaceuticals and 20 pesticides. The combined treatment by the MF RO system was able to quantitatively remove the target micropollutants present in the WWTP effluents to values either in the low ng/L range or below limits of quantification. Monitoring of water quality of reclaimed water and water reclamation sources is equally necessary to design the most adequate treatment procedures aimed to water reuse for different needs.

AB N-Nitrosamines such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) are organic compounds of environmental concern in groundwater, wastewater and potable water due to their potent carcinogenicity in laboratory animal studies and probable human carcinogenicity. While passive sampling techniques have become a widely used tool for providing time-averaged estimates of trace pollutant concentration, for chemicals such as NDMA that have relatively high water solubility, the selection of a suitable sorbent is difficult. This work is a proof of principle study that investigated for the first time the use of coconut charcoal as a passive sampler sorbent. Apparent charcoal/water sorption coefficients for NDMA were >551 mL g(-1) at environmentally relevant aqueous concentrations of less than 1 mu g L-1. Under the experimental conditions employed, a sampling rate of 0.45 Ld(-1) was determined and for an aqueous concentration of 1000 ng L-1, it is predicted that the sampler remains in the linear uptake stage for approximately 4 d, while equilibrium attainment would require about 26 d. The presence of humic acid, used as a surrogate for DOC, enhanced NDMA sorption on the coconut charcoal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 15 antibiotics belonging to three different groups, tetracyclines (TCs), sulfonamides (SAs), and macrolides (MLs), mainly used to prevent or treat illness for humans and also to control disease or to promote the growth for animals was studied in aqueous and sediment matrices. The result of spatial and temporal statistical analysis revealed that measured concentrations of individual antibiotics were significantly different depending on sampling location and time periods for aqueous and sediment samples. High concentrations of human-used antibiotics were detected downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, and animal-used antibiotics were mainly found in a region with significant agricultural activity. Generally, the highest concentrations of antibiotics for both water and sediment samples were measured in winter indicating that low flow conditions and cold-water temperatures might enhance the persistence of these compounds. Furthermore, a pseudo-partitioning coefficient (P-PC) was introduced to provide a better understanding of the partitioning of antibiotics into the sediment. Different P-PC values were found depending on the sorption characteristics of the individual antibiotics. Sediment samples showed a greater detection frequency and a much higher concentration compared to aqueous samples taken at the same site. Since microorganism antibiotic resistance can develop in sediments, the importance of analyzing this matrix is underscored.

AB Naproxen (NPX) is a common PPCPs in wastewater treatment plants which is influenced by the coexistence on its photodegradation. Most research on reasons for NPX photodegradation has focused on the soluble substances in water mainly, and the adsorption effect of solid particles is less. The effects of initial concentration, temperature, and pH on the adsorption of NPX on gamma-FeOOH were studied. It was found that the equilibrium time of gamma-FeOOH adsorbed NPX was 240 min. The increase of initial concentration and temperature were favorable for the adsorption. The optimal adsorption pH was 7.0, and the adsorption capacity attained 28.05 mg.g(-1). It was learned, through model fitting, that the adsorption reaction was in accordance with the Laggenren quasi-second-order kinetic model; the internal diffusion process was the control step, where the adsorption was close to the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. The thermodynamic calculation showed that Delta G < 0, Delta H < 0, Delta S < 0, which inferred that the adsorption was a spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy increasing process, which is the common action of chemical bond forces and static electricity.

AB The sorption behavior of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) on graphene was investigated and compared with that on activated carbon. The kinetic studies showed that BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon reached equilibrium within 240 min, whereas TCS sorption on these two materials achieved equilibrium in 60 and 120 min. The maximum sorption capacity (q(m)) of BPA on graphene or activated carbon reached approximately 2.0 x 10(3) mu g/g, which indicated that graphene was not superior to traditional activated carbon for BPA removal. By contrast, the strong partitioning ability of TCS on graphene suggested the potential use of graphene materials to remove TCS from wastewater. Although the pH change from 4.0 to 7.0 did not greatly affect BPA or TCS sorption, the sorption decreased dramatically when the pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0. This phenomenon should be attributed to the establishment of electrostatic repulsion between anionic BPA (or TCS) molecules and the graphene (or activated carbon) surface under higher pH conditions. The increase of ion (NaCl and CaCl2) concentrations may lead to substantial increase of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon due to the salting-out effect. By contrast, ion concentrations had no significant effect on TCS sorption because of the dominant hydrophobic interaction.

AB Dioscorea zingiberensis is the main plant source of diosgenin, a precursor for the production of steroid hormones used in the pharmaceutical industry. The extraction process of diosgenin from D. zingiberensis can generate high-acid and high-strength wastewater on a large scale and can threaten the environment. Bioengineering microorganisms to produce diosgenin is an effective way to avoid pollution. However, little is known about the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of diosgenin. We obtained 85,010 unigenes (average length of 1142 bases) from the D. zingiberensis transcriptome through RNA-seq. A large number of unigenes (59,368; 69.83%) were annotated, and 2488 unigenes were assigned to 27 secondary-metabolite pathways. In our database, 66 unigenes encoding up to 40 key enzymes were found to be present in diosgenin biosynthesis pathways. In addition, we found 203 unigenes encoding CYP450 proteins and 47 unigenes encoding UGT proteins that may be involved in modifications of a downstream pathway. The expression patterns of key diosgenin biosynthesis genes were studied to identify the most important members of the enzyme family. These results add to the available genetic data of D. zingiberensis and lay the foundation for the further production of diosgenin using genetic engineering.

AB Naproxen-C14H14O3 is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which has been found at detectable concentrations in wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. Naproxen is relatively hydrophilic and is in anionic form at pH between 6 and 8. In this study, column experiments were performed using an unconsolidated aquifer material from an area near Barcelona (Spain) to assess transport and reaction mechanisms of Naproxen in the aquifer matrix under different pore water fluxes. Results were evaluated using HYDRUS-1D, which was used to estimate transport parameters. Batch sorption isotherms for Naproxen conformed with the linear model with a sorption coefficient of 0.42 (cm(3) g(-1)), suggesting a low sorption affinity. Naproxen breakthrough curves (BTCs) measured in soil columns under steady-state, saturated water flow conditions displayed similar behavior, with no apparent hysteresis in sorption or dependence of retardation (R, 3.85-4.24) on pore water velocities. Soil sorption did not show any significant decrease for increasing flow rates, as observed from Naproxen recovery in the effluent. Sorption parameters estimated by the model suggest that Naproxen has a low sorption affinity to aquifer matrix. Most sorption of Naproxen occurred on the instantaneous sorption sites, with the kinetic sorption sites representing only about 10 to 40% of total sorption.

TI Pharmaceuticals in surface waters: sources, behavior, ecological risk,
   and possible solutions. Case study of Lake Geneva, Switzerland
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Nowadays, pharmaceuticals are present in surface waters as well as in groundwaters of developed countries. In the middle of Lake Geneva, for example, one of the largest European lakes, 14 pharmaceuticals are regularly detected in concentrations up to 0.37 mu g/L. This pollution is due to the human consumption of drugs and also veterinary use and industrial releases during production. In the case of Lake Geneva, this latter pollution is significant for some specific compounds. But, as shown in this overview, environmental toxicity data are lacking for most of the pharmaceuticals detected in the aquatic environment. For example, the ecotoxicity of metformin, one of the main compounds detected in Lake Geneva, is mostly unknown for the moment. Furthermore, specific effects like endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, or antibioresistance induction, which may be expected because of the mode of action of some drugs, have not yet been investigated for aquatic species. Ecological risk assessment of pharmaceuticals is therefore tricky and most of the time is not feasible. Owing to this lack of knowledge, also due to high biological potency of the pharmaceuticals, it is critical to reduce the release of these compounds to the aquatic system. This may be achieved by 'at source' (e.g., urine collection) methods or 'end of pipe' (e.g., wastewater treatment) solutions. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Amoxicillin(AMX) and ampicillin (AMP), penicillin class p-lactam antibiotics, have been detected in wastewater effluents and their release into the environment may involve long-term risks such as toxicity to aquatic organisms and endocrine disruption in higher organisms. This paper demonstrates the removal of AMX and AMP by ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)) by performing kinetics and stoichiometric experiments. The dependence of the second-order rate constants of the reaction between Fe(VI) and AMX (or AMP) on pH was explained using acid-base equilibria of Fe(VI) and organic molecules. The kinetics study with the model compound, 6-aminopencillanic acid and the pH dependence behavior suggested that Fe(VI) reacted with the amine moieties of the studied beta-lactams. The reactivity of different oxidants with AMX have been shown to follow the sequence:.(OH)-O-center dot approximate to SO4 center dot- > bromine > ozone > chlorine > Fe(VI). The required molar stoichiometric ratios ([Fe(VI)]:[beta-lactam]) for the complete removal of AMX and AMP by Fe(VI) were about 4.5 and 3.5, respectively. The Fe(VI) is able to eliminate AMX and AMP and hence is likely to also oxidize other p-lactams effectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A main source of surface water pollution in Western Europe stems from combined sewer overflow. One of the few technologies available to reduce this pollution is the retention soil filter. In this research project, we evaluated the cleaning efficiency of retention soil filters measuring the concentration ratio of standard wastewater parameters and bacteria according to factors limiting efficiency, such as long dry phases or phases of long-lasting retention. Furthermore, we conducted an initial investigation on how well retention soil filters reduce certain micropollutants on large-scale plants. There was little precipitation during the 1-year sampling phase, which led to fewer samples than expected. Nevertheless, we could verify how efficiently retention soil filters clean total suspended solids. Our results show that retention soil filters are not only able to eliminate bacteria, but also to retain some of the micropollutants investigated here. As the filters were able to reduce diclofenac, bisphenol A and metoprolol by a median rate of almost 75%, we think that further investigations should be made into the reduction processes in the filter. At this point, a higher accuracy in the results could be achieved by conducting bench-scale experiments.

AB An ozone and ozone/peroxide oxidation process was evaluated at pilot scale for trace organic contaminant (TOrC) mitigation and NDMA formation in both drinking water and water reuse applications. A reverse osmosis (RO) pilot was also evaluated as part of the water reuse treatment train. Ozone/peroxide showed lower electrical energy per order of removal (EEO) values for TOrCs in surface water treatment, but the addition of hydrogen peroxide increased EEO values during wastewater treatment. TOrC oxidation was correlated to changes in UV254 absorbance and fluorescence offering a surrogate model for predicting contaminant removal. A decrease in N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential (after chloramination) was observed after treatment with ozone and ozone/peroxide. However, during spiking experiments with surface water, ozone/peroxide achieved limited destruction of NDMA, while in wastewaters net direct formation of NDMA of 6-33 ng/L was observed after either ozone or ozone/peroxide treatment. Once formed during ozonation, NDMA passed through the subsequent RO membranes, which highlights the significance of the potential for direct NDMA formation during oxidation in reuse applications.

AB Removal and fate of 18 pharmaceuticals of different compound classes and 11 human metabolites were investigated in a subsurface flow constructed wetland (SSF), a pond and a pond with floating plants. Equal in surface area and flow rate, they functioned as the advanced treatment stage following conventional biological wastewater treatment in a municipal wastewater treatment plant equipped for nutrient removal. The influent and the effluents of the three treatment wetlands were measured in two studies during summer and one study during winter. The influence of the treatment design and the inherent environmental conditions (redox potential and irradiation) on the range of compounds removed as well as on the removal efficiency was investigated. This field-site study was accompanied by an in situ degradation experiment to assess the influence of photodegradation and biodegradation on the overall removal of pharmaceuticals.
   In total, 13 compounds (diclofenac, 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (3-OH-CBZ), venlafaxine (VLX), O-desmethylvenlafaxine (O-DM-VLX), tramadol (TMD), trimethoprim, erythromycin, clarithromycin, metoprolol, atenolol, bezafibrate, acyclovir and codeine) were consistently removed in quantities more than 70% in at least one of the treatment systems during summer. In the open water pond, photodegradation was found to be an important process for the removal of diclofenac, Odesmethyltramadol (O-DM-TMD), O-DM-VLX as well as 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (2-OH-CBZ) and 3-OH-CBZ. In contrast to the field-site study, no removal of target compounds by biodegradation was observed in the in situ degradation experiments without sediment additions except for metoprolol. This suggests that biodegradation of most substances is improved by the presence of microbially active surfaces such as those provided by the sediment in the pond and, to a higher extent, by the filter passage in the SSF.
   Low redox conditions (absence of nitrate) within the SSF and the pond with floating plants in summer were favourable for the anaerobic degradation of some compounds that are aerobically quite persistent, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diatrizoate. During winter, the increase of redox conditions (presence of oxygen) in the SSF consistently led to an enhanced removal of aerobically degradable compounds such as iopromide. In contrast, the removal of the target pharmaceuticals in the open water pond was generally lower during winter. This could be attributed to a decrease of photodegradation and biodegradation due to the lower global radiation and microbial activity, respectively.
   Based on the conclusion drawn from the influence of constructed wetland design and season on the compound specific removal, a hybrid constructed wetland is suggested. The combination of an inundated SSF followed by a shallow open water pond would steadily remove a wide range of aerobically degradable pharmaceuticals throughout the year. Additionally during summer, the open water pond would allow for photodegradation and the SSF for partial degradation of anaerobically degradable pharmaceuticals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic tyre char (MTC), activated tyre char (ATC) and commercial activated carbon (CAC) were used as packing materials in lab-scale column study for the adsorption of three pharmaceuticals: propranolol (PRO), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and clomipramine (CLO), from aqueous solution. The obtained breakthrough curves (BTCs) suggest that, lower flow rate, greater bed height, higher pH and nano particle size led to increased adsorption of PRO. The lowest adsorption capacity was observed for CIP either from single or ternary solution while it was significantly higher for CLO. Surface area of ATC increased nearly twelve-fold (38.17 to 453.81 m2/g), after thermal and chemical activation and adsorption capacity was comparable to commercial activated carbon. The suitability of Hydrus-1D model incorporating chemical non-equilibrium process to simulate the pharmaceutical transport and fit experimental BTCs was demonstrated (97.29 <R2 <99.22) in comparison to other common models (Adams-Bohart, Thomas and Yoon-Nelson). The modelling suggests the existence of non-equilibrium conditions and rate-limited sorption sites and the effect of dispersion and mass transfer mechanisms in the solute transport under dynamic conditions. The cost analysis showed that unit cost for treatment of wastewater using fixed-bed columns of tyre char was calculated to be 1.57 US$/m3 which can be deemed as commercially feasible.

AB The use of reclaimed water in agriculture represents a promising alternative to relieve pressure on freshwater supplies, especially in arid or semiarid regions facing water scarcity. However, this implies introducing micropollutants such as pharmaceutical residues into the environment. The fate and the ecotoxicological impact of valsartan, an antihypertensive drug frequently detected in wastewater effluents, were evaluated in soil-earthworm microcosms. Valsartan dissipation in the soil was concomitant with valsartan acid formation. Although both valsartan and valsartan acid accumulated in earthworms, no effect was observed on biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase activities). The geometric mean index of soil enzyme activity increased in the soils containing earthworms, regardless of the presence of valsartan. Therefore, earthworms increased soil carboxylesterase, dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, urease and protease activities. Although bacterial richness significantly decreased following valsartan exposure, this trend was enhanced in the presence of earthworms with a significant impact on both alpha and beta microbial diversity. The operational taxonomic units involved in these changes were related to four (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) of the eight most abundant phyla. Their relative abundances significantly increased in the valsartan-treated soils containing earthworms, suggesting the presence of potential valsartan degraders. The ecotoxicological effect of valsartan on microbes was strongly altered in the earthworm-added soils, hence the importance of considering synergistic effects of different soil organisms in the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceutical active compounds.

AB Chloramination of drinking water and wastewater can generate carcinogenic nitrosamines, among which, nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA) with large molecular weight and weak polarity has been commonly found. However, knowledge on the formation of NDPA remains highly limited. Laboratory tests were conducted to quantify NDPA formation during chloramination of nitrogenous precursors, including dipropylamine and methyldipropylamine, and pesticides such as trifluralin, oryzalin, and vernolat. Results showed that all precursors exhibited > 10.0% NDPA yields after 24 h. Oryzalin and trifluralin accomplished the highest (13.63%) and lowest (11.31%) yield, respectively. Maximal yields of all precursors were observed at pH 9.0 and temperature 288 K. Maximums of NDPA yield from oryzalin (18.27%) and vernolat (19.54%) were formed at Cl:N of 0.7:1.0, but maximal yields of dipropylamine (18.44%), methyldipropylamine (22.98%), and trifluralin (33.06%) were achieved at Cl:N of 1.2:1.0. Maximal NDPA yields of dipropylamine (37.14%), methyldipropylamine (32.84%), and vernolat (49.02%) were observed at [NH2Cl](0):[precursor](0) = 500, but highest yields of trifluralin (30.24%) and oryzalin (25.53%) were accomplished at [NH2Cl](0):[precursor](0) = 50. Bromide and organic contents in tap and raw water reduced NDPA due to competition for NH2Cl. Chloramination of water impacted by amines and pesticides should be careful of NDPA formation.

AB When using municipal wastewater as a potable water source, advanced treatment is mandatory for the removal of trace organic contaminants, including pharmaceuticals. UV-radiation (254 nm) is frequently used in combination with hydrogen peroxide at the end of the advanced treatment train for simultaneous disinfection and degradation of trace organic contaminants. In this work, a comprehensive study on the direct UV photolysis of eleven organic compounds (including ten pharmaceuticals and N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)) was conducted at varying pH of 5-8 using a collimated beam apparatus. Molar extinction coefficient (epsilon) and quantum yield (QY) values of different ionic forms (cationic, neutral and anionic) for eleven organic compounds were estimated in the tested pH range. Furthermore, direct UV photolysis at a full-scale UV photoreactor with 30 low-pressure UV lamps was performed at pH 6.2 and 7.8 by varying water flow rates (375-2700 L min(-1)) and UV fluences (400-4000 mJ cm(-2)). A process model was developed to determine the log reduction of the test compounds. The model combines a Lagrangian fluence model in the photoreactor with a pH-dependent photochemical kinetic model that ulilized the measured molar extinction coefficient and quantum yield values. The observed log reductions matched well with the model predictions for most of the tested compounds.

AB This study presents an investigation on the flow of two non-Newtonian fluids. These materials can be found in industrial environment, such as pharmaceutical and food industries, and also in wastewater treatment. In industrial environment, these fluids are usually driven by pumps between two workstations in the system, which represents a significant proportion of the costs. In order to operate the system cost-efficiency and environment friendly accurate sizing is necessary, which requires data on the hydraulic resistance of the elements. In the case of Newtonian fluids, these parameters are well-known. However, the non-Newtonian fluids have a considerably narrower literature, so laboratory and numerical tests are desirable. In our work, the hydraulic losses of two real non-Newtonian fluids were studied which can be described with the power law rheological model. These studies included laboratory measurements and numerical simulations (Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD), respectively. We investigated the friction factor of a straight pipe and loss coefficient of an elbow (R/D=2). The calculations were validated with our laboratory measurements and compared with the literature. Furthermore, the flow pattern in the pipe bend was also examined. The study presents the applicability and importance of the modification of the Reynolds number. Furthermore, the velocity profiles and the secondary flow structure in the elbow are also presented.

AB Abacavir is an antiretroviral drug (ARVD), which has been identified as a water pollutant. To find a selective adsorbent for its extraction from water, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) is proposed for its selective uptake. A 24-hour bulk polymerization process was performed for imprinting abacavir with aliquat 336 and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, as functional monomer and cross-linking agent, respectively. Uptake of abacavir from 10 mL of aqueous solutions was performed with 40 mg of MIP at pH 5 within 60 min of contact time. MIP selectively adsorbed abacavir from water in the presence of other ARVDs (tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz). The maximum adsorption capacity obtained for abacavir was 5.98 mg g(-1). The adsorption mechanism was best described by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which were translated to multilayer coverage and chemisorption influenced by electrostatic attractions, respectively. The extraction efficiencies achieved for abacavir in wastewater influent, effluent and estuarine water were 67, 74 and 76 %, respectively. The synthesized MIP can be reused at least 10 consecutive times for adsorption of abacavir from polluted water without losing its extraction efficiency. This is the first study to report the application of aliquat 336 as the functional monomer in the synthesis of MIP for selective extraction of abacavir from water.

AB The environment is contaminated by a number of micropollutants and their degradation products, many of which still remain undetected. Nowadays, several European regulations require the inclusion of transformation products in environmental risk assessment and monitoring. In the last decade, intense efforts have been taken to recognize the identity, quantity, and toxicity of unknown transformation products. Liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry has become a key technique for environmental analysis, now allowing the development of screening, identification, confirmatory and quantitative methods for the trace analysis of polar compounds in complex environmental matrices. The combination of modern technologies comprising high resolution, high mass accuracy and mass fragmentation enables the identification of compounds without having the authentic standards or even the detection of unknown analytes. However, a reliable confirmation of proposed structures using NMR spectroscopy or available standards is still desirable. This chapter presents new analytical strategies to identify and quantify transformation products generated by human metabolism, microbial degradation, or other environmental breakdown processes. Various hyphenated mass spectrometric techniques used for structure elucidation, such as liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, quadrupole-time-of-flight and linear ion trap-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometry are presented on three case studies of pharmaceutical and pesticide transformation products in environmental matrices, such as wastewater and groundwater.

AB Pharmaceutical waste is a source of dangerous pollutants that can be carcinogenic to humans. Therefore, the removal of these residues from wastewater is a priority in environmental engineering. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a FeNi3/chitosan/BiOI nanocomposite as a photocatalyst for metronidazole (MTZ) degradation under simulated sunlight. The morphological and structural properties of the nanocomposite were determined using advanced characterization techniques including X-ray diffractometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and vibrating-sample magnetometry analyses. The kinetics of MTZ degradation and the effect of physicochemical parameters such as pH (3-11), reaction time (5-200 min), initial MTZ concentration (10-30 mg/L), and catalyst dosage (0.005-0.1 g/L) on the MTZ degradation process were studied. The applied treatment process achieved 100% MTZ degradation under the following conditions: pH = 7, FeNi3/chitosan/BiOI dose = 0.04 g/L, MTZ concentration = 20 mg/L, and reaction time = 200 min. The used catalyst can be regenerated and reused six times with only slight losses in its activity. The final by-products of MTZ degradation were mineralized products. Therefore, the FeNi3/chitosan/BiOI nanocomposite used in the present study for MTZ removal is a promising practical catalyst.

AB This study compared the degradation efficiency of diatrizoate (DTA) by UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes. DTA could be effectively degraded by the UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes compared with chlorination and chloramination solely. Although the UV/chlorine process was more sensitive to the variations of oxidant dosages, solution pH, the concentration of bicarbonate and chloride, UV/chlorine degraded DTA more efficiently than UV/chloramine process. The reactive chlorine species (RCS) and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) are predominant contributors to DTA degradation in the UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes respectively, and the specific contribution of each reactive specie changed with solution pH. The performance of UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes on DTA degradation was obviously inhibited in natural waters (e.g., wastewater, rainwater, river water and tap water), however, degradation of DTA in the UV/chlorine are still satisfactory compared with UV/chloramine process. Formation of chloroform, dichloroacetonitrile, and iodoform (IF) from DTA was observed in both UV/chlorine and UV/chloramine processes. It is notable that formation potential of IF from DTA was significantly enhanced in UV/chloramine process, and thus the overall cytotoxicity of generated DBPs in UV/chloramine process is far greater than that in UV/chlorine process.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are mainly composed of products used in large quantities in everyday life such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, plasticizers, and different industrial additives. Some of the emerging contaminants are persistent and their complete removal is hard to achieve using conventional wastewater treatment processes. The current study focused on the application of classical Fenton process for the removal of selected pharmaceutical compounds (a sub-category of CECs). Acetaminophen was selected to represent this class of compounds and Fenton oxidation was carried out in a column packed with synthetic Zeolites analcime. Face-centered central composite design strategy was adopted to design and perform the experimentation. Three factors, pH, Fe2+:H2O2, and empty bed contact time, were used with three levels of each for experimental design. Quadratic model (with reduced terms) was observed to best fit the experimental data. Experimental results supported with ANOVA indicated that pH and Fe2+:H2O2 ratio had significant effect on removal of acetaminophen whereas empty bed contact time did not. pH (3-6) and Fe2+:H2O2 ratio (1.5-3) is available to achieve complete removal of acetaminophen. Acidic pH of 3, a limitation of homogeneous Fenton process, could be subdued by increasing the Fe2+:H2O2 ratio. The mechanism of removal of acetaminophen were observed to be Fenton oxidation as well as the adsorption on zeolites packed in column.

AB Organic cyanide are widely used as an ingredient in the production of plastics, synthetic rubbers, polymers, pharmaceuticals and pesticides or used in laboratories and industries as solvents. Although nitrile-containing wastewater is subjected to primary and secondary treatments, residual nitriles may slowly seep and further migrate through groundwater, resulting in the micropollution of groundwater by organic pollutants. In this study, water samples were collected from different study areas in North China during a period of 3y (from 2013 to 2015) and analyzed to evaluate organic cyanide (CN-) contamination in groundwater. Three parallel lab-scale fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) were tested for their ability to remove organic cyanide from groundwater. The organic cyanide concentration in groundwater increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 2013 to 2015. With an optimal hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 54 min, reactor R3 (inoculated with a nitrile-degrading bacterium, BX2, and a biofilm-forming bacterium, M1) effectively removed 99.8% of CN- under steady operation, which was better than that of other reactors. Short-term shutdowns of FBRs had no serious effects on the efficiency of treating organic cyanide. This work demonstrated that the biofilm-forming bacterium could facilitate the fixation of nitrile-degrading bacterium and enhance the efficiency of removing organic cyanide from groundwater.

   Environmental risk assessment
AB Potential environmental risks of the old antiviral pharmaceuticals ganciclovir (GCV) and valganciclovir (VGCV) were reassessed based on new environmental fate and chronic ecotoxicity tests and on actual use data for Europe. Valganciclovir is hydrolyzed to GCV by intestinal and hepatic esterases, and hence the new environmental tests only refer to GCV. A sorption study showed that GCV will not sorb significantly, excluding the soil as a relevant environmental compartment. Despite earlier data suggesting nondegradability, a new water/sediment fate test showed GCV to be primarily and ultimately degraded and to be nonpersistent. The chronic ecotoxicity tests with algae and daphnids resulted in no inhibition at the highest tested concentrations, whereas a fish partial life cycle test, selected in view of mammalian mutagenicity and reprotoxicity data, showed effects on growth of the young fish, but not on gametogenesis, fertilization, embryogenesis, or teratogenicity. Predicted environmental concentrations were derived based on actual per capita use data for European countries for 2004 to 2014, and the highest was selected for the risk assessment. A comparison of predicted environmental concentrations with predicted no-effect concentrations shows no significant risk for wastewater treatment, surface waters, groundwater, or sediment. In addition, potential risks to (semi) aquatic top predators or to human consumers of water and fish are exceedingly low. (C) 2017 The Author.

AB A continuous-flow ion exchange (IE) process for phenols recovery from olive mill waste-waters was examined through both strong-base and weak-base anion exchange resins. The effect of initial pH showed that phenols removal efficiency increased with an increase in the pH value up 7 and efficiency remains constant at higher pH values for Amberlyst A26. On the other hand, phenols removal efficiency for Amberlite IRA-67 also increased with an increase in the pH value up 7, reaching phenols removal efficiencies close to 57%. In addition, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Clark models were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves. The simulation of the best-performing operational condition was used to evaluate the process performances for different inlet phenols concentrations (5, 25 and 100 mg L-1) The results showed an increase in initial phenols concentration improved the adsorption capacity. In both cases, the Thomas model was found to give best fit to experiment data for the three initial phenols concentrations, followed by the Yoon-Nelson and Clark models. Finally, column regeneration studies showed almost 100% phenols recovery efficiencies were obtained. IE process led to a phenols solution susceptible to be concentrated and used in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical sectors. (C) 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental analytical chemists face the challenge of investigating thousands of potential organic pollutants that may be present in the aquatic environment. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) hyphenated to chromatography offers the possibility of detecting a large number of contaminants without pre-selection of analytes due to its accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition at good sensitivity. Interestingly, large screening can be made even without reference standards, as the valuable information provided by HRMS allows the tentative identification of the compound detected. In this work, hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS was combined with both liquid and gas chromatography (using a single instrument) for screening of around 2000 compounds in waters. This was feasible thanks to the use of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source in GC. The screening was qualitatively validated for around 300 compounds at three levels (0.02, 0.1, 0.5 mu g/L), and screening detection limits were established. Surface, ground water and effluent wastewater samples were analyzed, detecting and identifying a notable number of pesticides and transformation products, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and illicit drugs, among others. This is one of the most universal approaches in terms of comprehensive measurement for broad screening of organic contaminants within a large range of polarity and volatility in waters.

AB Widespread use of azole fungicides and low removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have led to the elevated concentration of azole fungicides in receiving environment. However, there was limited research about the removal mechanism of azole fungicides in the biological treatment of WWTPs. Imidazole fungicide climbazole and triazole fungicide fluconazole were selected to investigate the biodegradation mechanism of azole fungicides in activated sludge under aerobic conditions. Climbazole was found to be adsorbed to solid sludge and resulted in quick biodegradation. The degradation of climbazole in the aerobic activated sludge system was fitted well by the first-order kinetic model with a half-life of 5.3 days, while fluconazole tended to stay in liquid and had only about 30% of loss within 77 days incubation. Ten biotransformation products of climbazole were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry using suspect and non-target screening method. But no biodegradation products of fluconazole were identified due to its limited removal. The possible biodegradation pathways for climbazole were proposed based on the products identification and pathway prediction system, and involves oxidative dehalogenation, side chain oxidation and azole ring loss. The findings from this study suggest that it should be a concern for the persistence of fluconazole in the environment.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals in aquatic means presents as a serious threat, since their real consequences for the environment and human health are not well known. Therefore, this work consisted of preparing and characterize sludge-derived activated carbons (beverage sludge activated carbon - BSAC and acid-treated beverage sludge activated carbon - ABSAC) to investigate their use in the pharmaceuticals adsorption in aqueous media. The morphology study has demonstrated that ABSAC, unlike BSAC, exhibited an abundant porous structure, with smaller particles and bigger roughness. Adsorption results indicated that the ABSAC was more effective that BSAC, since it presented superior surface area (642 m(2) g(-1)) and total pore volume (0.485 cm(3) g(-1)) values. Pseudosecond-order kinetic model was more suitable to predict experimental data. Sips model best described the equilibrium data, with maximum adsorption capacities of 145, 105, and 57 mg g(-1) for paracetamol, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, respectively. Besides, the sludge-derived adsorbent was highly efficient in the treatment of a simulated drug effluent, removing 85.16% of the pharmaceutical compounds. Therefore, the material prepared in this work possesses intrinsic characteristics that make it a remarkable adsorbent to be applied in the treatment of pharmaceutical contaminants contained in industrial wastewater.

AB Mucilage (represented as CEM) is abundantly present in Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott or taro and is a water-soluble neutral polysaccharide that can act as a binder, thickening agent, and matrix agent in the pharmaceutical fields of research. Presence of hydroxyl groups on its surface structure allows chemical modification. This study describes in details the synthesis and characterization of its graft copolymer with polylactide (CEM-g-PLA). The polymerization has performed using both the microwave irradiation and conventional methods. Ring opening polymerization of lactide onto the mucilage carried out in presence of stannous octoate as catalyst in chloroform medium produced CEM-g-PLA copolymer under optimum condition. The structure of CEM-g-PLA copolymers obtained from both the methods were comprehensively characterized for their physicochemical and thermal properties by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning colorimetric (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG) and Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Grafting of lactide onto CEM backbone has changed its water absorption capacity, solubility and swelling power, morphology, crystalline structure, and thermal property of the mucilage. The newly synthesized CEM-g-PLA copolymer may find potential applications in wastewater treatment and for sustained and controlled drug delivery systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of nano-TiO2 as adsorbent combined with ultrasound for the degradation of N-acetylpara-aminophenol (AAP) from aqueous solution was investigated. The nano-TiO2 was characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflectionFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Experimental results revealed that the adsorption of AAP by nano-TiO2 fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, the equilibrium could be explained by the Freundlich isotherm and the treatment process is exothermic. The optimum removal efficiency of AAP (128.89 mg/g (77.33%)) was achieved at pH 4 when 0.03 g of nano-TiO2 was mixed with 50 mL of 100 mg/L AAP aqueous solution at ambient temperature, 60 min contact time, and a stirring speed of 120 rpm. Ultrasound at 20 kHz and pH 3 was favorable and it resulted in 52.61% and 57.43% removal efficiency with and without the addition of nano-TiO2, respectively. The degradation of AAP by ultrasound followed by nano-TiO2 treatment resulted in approximately 99.50% removal efficiency. This study showed that a sequential ultrasound and nano-TiO2 treatment process could be employed for the removal of AAP or other emerging water and wastewater contaminants.

AB By synthesizing GO-Fe3O4 nanocomposites (graphene oxide coated with magnetite), this study investigated chlorpheniramine (a widely used pharmaceutical) adsorption on magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influences of using the nanocomposite suspension or particles, mass ratios of Fe3O4/GO in the synthesis, pH, and contact time. GO-Fe3O4 was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory. Nano-sized Fe3O4 anchored on GO uniformly, resulting in hybrid structures with well combination between GO and Fe3O4. By fitting to the pseudo 2nd-order model, chlorpheniramine adsorption onto GO-Fe3O4 likely occurred due to a chemical adsorption. The adsorption maximums decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 particles > GO-Fe3O4 suspension > activated carbon. With Fe3O4 changing the surface charge of GO-Fe3O4 suspension, pH variation enhanced chlorpheniramine adsorption on. GO-Fe3O4 suspension. The GO-Fe3O4 particles exhibited a relatively better but slow chlorpheniramine adsorption. More importantly, additional nanopore volumes and surface areas were created in GO-Fe3O4 particles due to low Fe3O4 contents to more effectively capture and remove chlorpheniramine, as Fe3O4 crystals on the GO surface potentially prevented the compaction of GO sheets. These factors interactively affected and determined the approach of using GO for removing chlorpheniramine or other pharmaceuticals with similar molecular characteristics in wastewater treatment.

AB Triclosan (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]-phenol) is an antimicrobial agent found in a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products. Numerous studies have examined the occurrence and environmental fate of triclosan in wastewater, biosolids, biosolids-amended soils, and plants and organisms exposed to biosolid-amended soils. Triclosan has a propensity to adhere to organic carbon in biosolids and biosolid-amended soils. Land application of biosolids containing triclosan has the potential to contribute to multiple direct and indirect human health exposure pathways. To estimate exposures and human health risks from biosolid-borne triclosan, a risk assessment was conducted in general accordance with the methodology incorporated into the US Environmental Protection Agency's Part 503 biosolids rule. Human health exposures to biosolid-borne triclosan were estimated on the basis of published empirical data or modeled using upper-end environmental partitioning estimates. Similarly, a range of published triclosan human health toxicity values was evaluated. Margins of safety were estimated for 10 direct and indirect exposure pathways, both individually and combined. The present risk assessment found large margins of safety (>1000 to >100 000) for potential exposures to all pathways, even under the most conservative exposure and toxicity assumptions considered. The human health exposures and risks from biosolid-borne triclosan are concluded to be de minimis. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Biomixtures comprise the active part of biopurification systems (BPS) for the removal of pesticide-containing wastewater from agricultural origin. Considering that biomixtures contain an important amount of lignocellulosic substrates, their bioaugmentation with degrading ligninolytic fungi represents a promising way to improve BPS. The fungus Trametes versicolor was employed for the bioaugmentation of rice husk-compost-soil (GCS) biomixtures in order to optimize the removal of the highly toxic insecticide/nematicide carbofuran (CFN). Composition of biomixtures has not been optimized before, and usually, a volumetric composition of 50: 25: 25 (lignocellulosic substrate: humic component: soil) is employed. Optimization of the biomixture composition was performed with a central composite design, using the volumetric content of rice husk (pre-colonized by the fungus) and the volumetric ratio compost/soil as design variables. Performance of biomixtures was comprehensively assayed considering CFN removal, the production of toxic transformation products (3-hydroxycarbofuran/3-ketocarbofuran), the ability to mineralize [C-14] carbofuran, and the residual toxicity in the matrix. According to the models, the optimal volumetric composition of the GCS biomixture is 30: 43: 27, which maximizes removal and mineralization rate, and minimizes the accumulation of transformation products. Results support the value of assessing new biomixture formulations according to the target pesticide in order to obtain their optimal performance, before their use in BPS.

AB In-stream attenuation was determined for 14 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites. Lagrangian sampling, which follows a parcel of water as it moves downstream, was used to link hydrological and chemical transformation processes. Wastewater loading of neuro-active compounds varied considerably over a span of several hours, and thus a sampling regime was used to verify that the Lagrangian parcel was being sampled and a mechanism was developed to correct measured concentrations if it was not. In-stream attenuation over the 5.4-km evaluated reach could be modeled as pseudo-first-order decay for 11 of the 14 evaluated neuro-active pharmaceutical compounds, illustrating the capacity of streams to reduce conveyance of neuro-active compounds downstream. Fluoxetine and N-desmethyl citalopram were the most rapidly attenuated compounds (t(1/2) = 3.6 +/- 0.3 h, 4.0 +/- 0.2 h, respectively). Lamotrigine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, and carbamazepine were the most persistent (t(1/2) = 12 +/- 2.0 h, 12 +/- 2.6 h, 21 +/- 4.5 h, respectively). Parent compounds (e.g., buproprion, carbamazepine, lamotrigine) generally were more persistent relative to their metabolites. Several compounds (citalopram, venlafaxine, O-desmethyl-venlafaxine) were not attenuated. It was postulated that the primary mechanism of removal for these compounds was interaction with bed sediments and stream biofilms, based on measured concentrations in stream biofilms and a column experiment using stream sediments.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfamethazine (SMT) has received little attention in the water treatment literature. Yet, SMT is among the non-biodegradable substances increasingly found in aqueous media and affecting both public health and wastewater treatments. For a long time, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were studied via pure empirical modeling, although the surface response models resulting from lumped information (TOC, COD, etc.) present limitations regarding extrapolation and optimization. Conversely, detailed first-principles modeling may not be affordable due to the computational burden and the chemical analysis needs. Thus, a balanced approach may be practical in many cases.
   RESULTS: Experiments on SMT solutions (500 mL, 50 mg L(-1)) were performed under conditions set by an experimental design. A set of replicated degradation time-profiles (TOC and SMT concentrations) was obtained and a semi-empirical kinetic model was fitted to these data to determine maximum conversion and kinetic rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: SMT can be completely degraded from water via photo-Fenton treatment. Conditions for this treatment were investigated and its outcomes were systematically characterized by a simple kinetic model and two lumped parameters, conversion and kinetic rate. Both, the model and the corresponding parametrical characterization are introduced as a means to discriminate the most efficient treatment conditions in a practical and efficient way.

AB A pilot-scale plant was employed to validate the performance of a proposed full-scale advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) in Sydney, Australia. The primary aim of this study was to develop a chemical monitoring program that can demonstrate proper plant operation resulting in the removal of priority chemical constituents in the product water. The feed water quality to the pilot plant was tertiary-treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. The unit processes of the AWTP were comprised of an integrated membrane system (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis) followed by final chlorination generating a water quality that does not present a source of human or environmental health concern. The chemical monitoring program was undertaken over 6 weeks during pilot plant operation and involved the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, steroidal hormones, industrial chemicals, pesticides, N-nitrosamines and halomethanes. The first phase consisted of baseline monitoring of target compounds to quantify influent concentrations in feed waters to the plant. This was followed by a period of validation monitoring utilising indicator chemicals and surrogate measures suitable to assess proper process performance at various stages of the AWTP. This effort was supported by challenge testing experiments to further validate removal of a series of indicator chemicals by reverse osmosis. This pilot-scale study demonstrated a simplified analytical approach that can be employed to assure proper operation of advanced water treatment processes and the absence of trace organic chemicals.

AB Phenolic environmental estrogens (PEEs) are ubiquitous in most rivers worldwide and may cause potential endocrine-disrupting effects in aquatic organisms. Three typical PEEs (bisphenol A, BPA; 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-t-OP; and nonylphenol, NP) were investigated in the rivers of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, which is the most urbanized and industrialized area in North China. The target PEEs were detected in 100% of river water samples, and the concentrations ranged from 23 to 255 ng L-1. The concentrations of NP in most river sections were higher than those of BPA and 4-t-OP. The spatiotemporal variations in PEEs indicated that both domestic and industrial wastewater were main sources of PEEs in river water. In addition, rainfall runoff might be an important source of PEEs in the receiving waters, especially in the wet season. The ecotoxicological risk assessment of individual PEE revealed a moderate to high risk for aquatic organisms at most sampling sites. The mixture risk prediction based on the concentration addition method indicated a potential cumulative risk of PEEs in the study area, highlighting the importance of mixture risk assessment in the aquatic environment.

AB Manganese dioxide has been widely recognized as catalyst in catalytic ozonation for organic pollutants removal from wastewater in recent decades. However, few studies focus on the structure-activity relationship of MnO2 and catalytic ozonationmechanismin water. In the present study, the oxidative reactivity of three different crystal phases of MnO2 corresponding to alpha-MnO2, beta-MnO2 and gamma-MnO2 towards metoprolol (MET) and ibuprofen (IBU) were evaluated. alpha-MnO2 was found to contain the most abundant oxygen vacancy and readily reducible surface adsorbed oxygen (O-2(-), O-, OH-), which facilitated an increase of ozone utilization and the highest catalytic performance with 99% degradation efficiency for IBU and MET. alpha-MnO2 was then selected to investigate the optimum key operating parameters with a result of catalyst dosage 0.1 g/L, ozone dosage 1 mg/min and an initial pH 7. The introduction of alpha-MnO2 promoted reactive oxygen species (O2-, O-, OH-) generation which played significant roles in IBU degradation. Probable degradation pathways of MET and IBU were proposed according to the organic intermediates identified and the reaction sites based on density function theory (DFT) calculations. The present study deepened our understanding on the MnO2 catalyzed ozonation and provided reference to enhance the process efficiency. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, synthetic and natural hormones and industrial chemicals, are frequently released into the environment because of the inability of conventional processes in municipal wastewater treatment plants to remove them. Some examples of alternative options to remove such pollutants are photo-Fenton and ozone-based processes, which are two techniques widely studied in Ibero-American countries. In fact, this region has been responsible for delivering frequently publications and conferences on advanced oxidation processes. This work is a critical review of recent developments in the intensification of the two aforementioned advanced oxidation techniques for CECs elimination in the Ibero-American region. Specifically for the photo-Fenton process (pF), this study analyses strategies such as iron-complexation with artificial substances (e.g., oxalic acid and ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid) and natural compounds (such as humic-like substances, orange juice or polyphenols) and hybrid processes with ultrasound. Meanwhile, for ozonation, the enhancement of CECs degradation by adding hydrogen peroxide (i.e., peroxone), ultraviolet or solar light, and combining (i.e., photolytic ozonation) with catalysts (i.e., catalytic ozonation) was reviewed. Special attention was paid to how efficient these techniques are for removing contaminants from water matrices, and any potentialities and weak points of the intensified processes.

AB Pharmaceuticals are an integral part of modern medicine. We can hardly imagine the functioning of modern society without them. Thanks to medicines we can eradicate serious pandemic illnesses, help people overcome serious psychological or psychiatric problems, prolong life by lowering high levels of cholesterol and the occurrence of diabetes, offer comforting benefits like pain relief, and provide hormonal drugs to prevent unwanted conception. Pharmacology underwent a boom in the second half of the nineteenth century. Drugs continued to be developed in the twentieth century. It was only in 1965 that scientists noticed substances were finding their way into the environment, with a number of studies identifying pharmaceuticals in surface water. It was only in the 1990s that scientists began to draw attention to the impact of pharmaceuticals on fish and biota in watercourses. At the turn of the millennium, drug concentrations were found in drinking water and groundwater. Currently, we know that most persistent drugs are already distributed throughout the water cycle. We know they affect the environment but we are not clear as to what extent this impacts us as a human beings-we can only speculate about such impacts and hope that rising numbers of cancers and increasing infertility are not the consequences of this. This chapter aims to summarize the existing knowledge about entry pathways, occurrence, degradation, and behavior of drugs in the water cycle.

AB To further improve the electrochemical performance of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode, a two-dimensional, macroporous, Sb-doped SnO2 film is constructed on BDD to obtain a bifunctional electrode interface (denoted Mp-SnO2/BDD) with an ordered, monolayer, photonic-crystal template using a sol-gel method. SEM images confirm that the SnO2 film consisted of innumerable, uniform, nanosized SnO2 particles and numerous macropores with diameters of 200-300 nm, and some BDD polycrystallites are exposed in those macropores. The microstructure endows Mp-SnO2/BDD with a high oxygen evolution potential (2.23 V), good conductivity (175 O), and excellent electrocatalytic activity. To evaluate the degradation capability, the electrocatalytic oxidation of a high concentration of clofibric acid (CA) is studied in detail. The CA and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals on Mp-SnO2/BDD are above 90% after 240 min. The degradation rate constant on Mp-SnO2/BDD is 1.6 times that on BDD. Compared with BDD and traditional SnO2/Ti, Mp-SnO2/BDD exhibites a higher instantaneous current efficiency and lower electrochemical energy consumption. In addition, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the intermediates in the degradation process and proposed three possible oxidative decomposition pathways for CA. Mp-SnO2/BDD is expected to be a promising anode for organic wastewater treatment.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is one of the most widely used pharmaceutically active compounds and frequently detected in treated wastewater and the impacted aquatic environment. However, the fate and toxicity of TCS in aquatic organisms is poorly known, including in particular the potential for the formation of incomplete biological transformation products. In this study, TCS posed high toxic effects (e.g., growth inhibition and damage of photosynthesis) to typical freshwater diatom Navicula sp., with the 24 h and 72 h EC50 values of 173.3 and 145.6 mu gL(-1), respectively. The bioaccumulation of TCS in diatom cells increased with the increasing exposure to TCS and showed to be time-dependent. The higher intracellular. TCS lead to higher toxicity on Navicula sp. The intracellular TCS concentration and the growth inhibition of TCS in Navicula sp. at pH 7.5 was obviously higher than that at pH 8.3, which was likely due to the higher abundance of unionized TCS in the culture. KMnO4 reduced both bioaccumulation and toxicity of TCS in Navicula sp., especially at pH 8.3. A total of seven products were detected by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These findings will provide a reference for the risk assessment of TCS in aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in freshwater ecosystems, and several studies have reported bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms in those ecosystems. River biofilms are exceptional indicators of pollution, but very few studies have focused on the accumulation of these emerging contaminants. The objectives of this study were first to develop an efficient analytical methodology for the simultaneous analysis of 44 pharmaceuticals and 13 endocrine disrupting compounds in biofilm, and second, to assess persistence, distribution, and bioaccumulation of these contaminants in natural biofilms inhabiting a WWTP-impacted river. The method is based on pressurized liquid extraction, purification by solid-phase extraction, and analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in tandem. Recoveries for pharmaceuticals were 31-137%, and for endocrine disruptors 32-93%. Method detection limits for endocrine disruptors were in the range of 02-2.4 ng g(-1), and for pharmaceuticals, 0.07-6.7 ng g(-1). A total of five endocrine disruptors and seven pharmaceuticals were detected in field samples at concentrations up to 100 ng g(-1). (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This is a comparative study of photolytic degradation under exposure to UV254 nm and solar-simulator irradiation of a mixture of eight equally concentrated micropollutants in the presence of H2O2 and Fe(II) in ultra-pure water, Lake Geneva water, and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
   The electron spin resonance experiments point to a low singlet oxygen formation efficiency by the micropollutant mixture. This finding corroborates the micropollutants' chemical stability under UVC irradiation (in decreasing order: gabapentin, metformin, metoprolol, atenolol, clarithromycin, primidone, methylbenzotriazole, and benzotriazole). The oxidation rate increased in the presence of low-concentration H2O2 and Fe(II), except for metformin and gabapentin. Gabapentin and metformin were the most persistent compounds, with less than 24% being removed after 60 min of UV254/H2O2/Fe(II) treatment. The low removal rates were observed in WWTP effluent and lake water, and using sunlight simulation.
   Guanylurea, phenol, oxalic acid, tartronic acid, glycolic acid, oxamic acid, and maleic acid, could also be detected as fragmental oxidation products. Furthermore, up to 300 mu g/L of nitrate and ammonia were identified as final degradation products. Ecotoxicological tests showed that the degradation products are more toxic for algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii than the parent compounds themselves. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential development of antibacterial resistance and endocrine disruption has led to increased research investigating the removal of contaminants from wastewater (WW) such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). These compounds react quickly with ozone (O-3), thus ozonation during WW treatment may result in their complete removal. Also, O-3 has demonstrated the ability to increase the biodegradability of WW and certain pharmaceuticals, suggesting its potential as a pretreatment to activated sludge (AS, biological treatment). The objective of this study was to determine whether ozonation, conducted at doses lower than commonly applied to treated WW, would lead to an increased biodegradability of SMX and EE2. The results show that after ozonation performed at lab-scale the bacterial mixtures removed 5 % to 40 % more SMX; however, 2 % to 23 % less EE2 was removed, which was attributed to the observed preferential degradation of a by-product of EE2 ozonation. These results suggest that although ozonation, used as a pretreatment, was shown in literature to increase the overall biodegradability of AS as well as some specific antibiotic compounds and a blood lipid regulator, the potential for increased removal of pharmaceuticals seems to be compound-dependent and cannot yet be extrapolated to this entire class of compounds.

AB Scientific researchers and regulators are focusing attention on trace quantities of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and surface waters, resulting in an increased level of concern regarding the potential environmental impact of these compounds. The current European regulatory guideline requires evaluation of the chronic effects of active pharmaceutical ingredients on Daphnia magna. Based on the life cycle of D. magna, chronic studies to establish survival and reproductive endpoints require a 21 d exposure period. A similar organism, Ceriodaphnia dubia, has a shorter life cycle and therefore survival and reproductive endpoints may be established following 7 d of exposure. No observed effect concentrations and lowest observed effect concentrations for survival and reproduction were obtained for D. magna and C. dubia following exposure to six human pharmaceuticals and two metabolites (i.e. celecoxib, linezolid, varenicline, sunitinib, Compound A, ziprasidone and the M1 and M4 metabolites of torcetrapib). These data were evaluated to determine whether one organism may be considered more sensitive. Survival and reproduction data obtained from the C. dubia study provide similar outcomes to D. magna when determining the predicted environmental concentration/predicted no effect concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratios for surface water. Based on these data, C. dubia may be used as a cost-effective alternative and representative invertebrate species when assessing the potential risk of human pharmaceuticals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Both biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS) and biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes, and physico-chemical treatment processes including ozonation process and Title 22 process consisting of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration followed by UV or chlorination disinfection after the above biological processes, were compared from the viewpoint of removal efficiency. 66 pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, analgesics, psychoneurotic agents were measured with SPE-LC/MS/MS. 26 compounds Out Of 66 were detected in the influent ranging ng/L to mu g/L order. Particularly, disopyramide, sulpiride, and dipyridamole that have been rarely detected before in the WWTP, occurred at concentration levels of more than 100 ng/L. The total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the influent was efficiently removed by 80% during the biological treatment. But removal efficiencies of carbamazepine and crotamiton were less than 30%. The total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the effluent from CAS process was 1.5 times higher than that from BNR process. Further, the total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the discharge from WWTPs applying ozonation following activated sludge process was reduced to less than 20%. Physico-chemical treatment train called Title 22 treatment after CAS could not efficiently remove the pharmaceuticals. However, ozonation process followed by biological activated carbon process could efficiently reduce all the residual pharmaceuticals below their quantification limits.

AB Laboratory wastes containing Cd2+ and water polluted by pharmaceuticals represent an environmental concern. In this work, a proof concept, consisting of the use of teaching-laboratory wastes to synthesize CdS and its subsequent use as a photocatalyst to degrade fluoroquinolone antibiotics, was developed. The CdS was prepared by extraction with thioacetamide and calcination (at 450 degrees C) and characterized using several techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the CdS, to degrade levofloxacin and norfloxacin, was tested, and the routes involved in the process and the primary transformations of the fluoroquinolones were established. Moreover, the ability of CdS-photocatalysis to eliminate levofloxacin in simulated matrices of fresh urine and hospital wastewater was evaluated. The characterization analyses indicated that the CdS semiconductor was synthesized successfully. Effectively, the CdS acted as a photocatalyst toward degradation of levofloxacin, involving the action of superoxide anion radical, holes, and singlet oxygen mainly. The process induced transformations on the methyl-piperazyl moiety, plus hydroxylation of the fluoroquinolone nucleus on levofloxacin. Additionally, CdS-photocatalysis was highly selective for the elimination of the target pollutant in both tested matrices. Our research indicated the good potentiality of recycling teaching-laboratory wastes to generate photocatalysts to degrade organic pollutants. This work was presented at 4 degrees Congreso Colombiano de Procesos Avanzados de Oxidacion (4CCPAOx).

AB In this work, we have investigated the stability of pindolol (PIN), a non-selective beta(1)-blocker detected in the river and wastewater of hospitals, in water solution under solar irradiation. Further, detailed insights into the stability of PIN were obtained by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The kinetics of PIN photocatalytic degradation and mineralization has been studied using four commercial photocatalysts ZnO and TiO2 (P25, Hombikat, and Wackherr). It was found that the major role in degradation of PIN play the reactive hydroxyl radicals. The structures of degradation intermediates were suggested by LC-ESI-MS/MS and DFT calculations. Also, DFT calculations were used to refine molecular structures of intermediates and obtain their geometries. Toxicity of PIN and its mixtures formed during photocatalytic degradation were investigated using mammalian cell lines (H-4-II E, HT-29, and MRC-5). The H-4-II E cell line was the most sensitive to PIN and its photodegradation mixtures. The computational results were combined with the experimental data on the amounts of degradation intermediates for determination of the intermediates that were principally responsible for the toxicity. Intermediate with two hydroxyl groups, positioned on indole ring in meta and para positions, was proposed as the one with the highest contribution to toxicity.

AB Various types of micropollutants, e.g., pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms, are usually found in hospital wastewaters. The aim of this paper was to study the presence of 74 frequently used pharmaceuticals, legal and illegal drugs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 5 hospital wastewaters in Slovakia and Czechia and to compare the efficiency of several advanced oxidations processes (AOPs) for sanitation and treatment of such highly polluted wastewaters. The occurrence of micropollutants and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was investigated by in-line SPE-LC-MS/MS technique and cultivation on antibiotic and antibiotic-free selective diagnostic media, respectively. The highest maximum concentrations were found for cotinine (6700 ng/L), bisoprolol (5200 ng/L), metoprolol (2600 ng/L), tramadol (2400 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (1500 ng/L), and ranitidine (1400 ng/L). In the second part of the study, different advanced oxidation processes, modified Fenton reaction, ferrate(VI), and oxidation by boron-doped diamond electrode were tested in order to eliminate the abovementioned pollutants. Obtained results indicate that the modified Fenton reaction and application of boron-doped diamond electrode were able to eliminate almost the whole spectrum of selected micropollutants with efficiency higher than 90%. All studied methods achieved complete removal of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria present in hospital wastewaters.

AB Complete removal of estrogens such as estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and ethinylestradiol (EE2) in wastewater treatment is essential since their release and accumulation in natural water bodies are giving rise to environment and health issues. To improve our understanding towards the estrogen bioremediation process, a mathematical model was proposed for describing estrogen removal by nitrifying activated sludge. Four pathways were involved in the developed model: i) biosorption by activated sludge flocs; ii) cometabolic biodegradation linked to ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) growth; iii) non growth biodegradation by AOB; and iv) biodegradation by heterotrophic bacteria (HB). The degradation kinetics was implemented into activated sludge model (ASM) framework with consideration of interactions between substrate update and microorganism growth as well as endogenous respiration. The model was calibrated and validated by fitting model predictions against two sets of batch experimental data under different conditions. The model could satisfactorily capture all the dynamics of nitrogen, organic matters (COD), and estrogens. Modeling results suggest that for El, E2 and EE2, AOB-linked biodegradation is dominant over biodegradation by HB at all investigated COD dosing levels. However, for E3, the increase of COD dosage triggers a shift of dominant pathway from AOB biodegradation to HB biodegradation. Adsorption becomes the main contributor to estrogen removal at high biomass concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (TCEP), an emerging contaminant of concern, is largely recalcitrant to removal due to its relatively high water solubility and non-degradability. Adsorption from wastewater is an option for separation, with a suitable adsorbent. In this study, equilibrium adsorption of TCEP onto zeolite-beta (300: 1 Si: Al ratio) is reported for simulated environmental waters with commonly occurring competing adsorbates. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent to TCEP in pure water which is about 103 mg/g is reduced by approximately 30% in the presence of natural organic material (NOM) and several common salts. The data show that increasing NOM and salt concentrations do not have a proportionately increased effect. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of TCEP was reduced, by up to 70% under competitive conditions with methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), another common contaminant in industrial wastewaters. Solid state NMR analyses of the zeolite subsequent to TCEP adsorption provide insight to the preferred zeolite adsorption sites. The NMR data for both Si and C appear to indicate that a hydrophobic surface interaction between the organic carbon and zeolite silica surfaces is the most likely adsorption mechanism.

AB This paper deals with raceway pond reactors (RPRs) as an alternative photoreactor for solar photo-Fenton applications. Raceway pond reactors are common low-cost reactors which can treat large volumes of water. The experiments were carried out with Fe3+:EDDS complex in the secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with a mixture of 100 mu g/L each of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) at circumneutral pH. In a preliminary stage, two operating strategies, sequential addition of iron sulfate and Fe3+:EDDS complex at a 1:2 molar ratio were compared, and Fe3+:EDDS complex was found to be the best option. The effect of liquid depth (10, 15 and 20 cm) was also explored. 90% pharmaceutical removal was achieved with accumulated solar UV energy of around 1 kJ/L. Finally, RPRs and tubular photoreactors with compound parabolic collectors (CPC) were compared under realistic conditions. Pharmaceutical removal efficiency was four times higher, increasing from 0.26 mg/kJ with CPC reactors to 1.07 mg/kJ in the 15-cm-deep RPR. As far as the authors know, this is the first detailed study on the effect of liquid depth in RPRs at circumneutral pH. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles were reported to be effective for removal of aqueous pharmaceutical chemicals. However, little is known about its potential application in removing the sediment-sorbed contaminants. To bridge this knowledge gap, we synthesized stabilized Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles using water-soluble carboxymethyl celluloses (CMC) as a stabilizer and tested their effectiveness for removal of aqueous and sediment-sorbed ciprofloxacin (CIP). Fully stabilized Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles (0.05 g/L as Fe) were obtained in the presence of 0.5 g/L of CMC. When compared with non-stabilized Fe-Mn nanoparticles (FMBO), CMC-stabilized Fe-Mn nanoparticles (CMC-FMBO) showed relatively more favorable removal performance and particles stabilization facilitated delivering nanoparticles into sediment for in situ removal of CIP. The CIP removal by CMC-FMBO was highly pH dependent and the optimum pH was 6.0. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model was able to interpret the removal kinetics. When CIP-spiked sediment was treated with the CMC-FMBO, CMC-FMBO exhibited more excellent resistance to the sediment inhibitive effects and higher removal efficiency of CIP, compared to FMBO. This primary research suggests that CMC-FMBO hold the potential for facilitating removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater and sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater from a large number of manufacturing units is extremely contaminated by ciprofloxacin (CIP), an antibiotic drug. In this work, aqueous CIP solution was treated by Fenton oxidation (FO). The effects of typical process parameters on drug mineralization have been reported. The optimal Fe2+/H2O2 molar ratio of 0.125 and pH of 3.5 were determined with 15 mg L-1 initial CIP at 25 degrees C temperature. Maximum CIP, COD and TOC removal of 74.4, 47.1 and 37.9% were obtained under the optimal conditions. The mean oxidation number of carbon determined in terms of COD and TOC values was in accordance with that from the oxidation number of individual carbon atom. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals was measured using the N, N-dimethyl phenyl hydrazine method using dimethyl sulphoxide as a probe. Thirteen fragments appeared in the mass spectra and the proposed mechanism explored the routes of daughter ion formation. The cleavage of the piperazine ring was more effective in CIP oxidation due to high nucleophilic character of lone pair of electrons present on the nitrogen atom. A simple 2nd order kinetic model was proposed for the oxidation of CIP and degradation products (DPs) with respect to OH concentration. The rate constants of 3.13 x 10(3), 4.89 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) were estimated for CIP and DPs. The initial concentration of OHc was found to be 11.67 mu M.

AB The aim of the present research is to develop economic, fast, and versatile method for the removal of toxic organic pollutant phenol from wastewater using eggshell. The batch experiments are conducted to evaluate the effect of pH, phenol concentration, dosage of adsorbent, and contact time on the removal of phenol. The paper includes in-depth kinetic studies of the ongoing adsorption process. Attempts have also been made to verify Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The morphology and characteristics of eggshell have also been studied using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence analysis. At ambient temperature, the maximum adsorption of phenol onto eggshells has been achieved at pH 9 and the contact time, 90 min. The experimental data give best-fitted straight lines for pseudo-first-order as well as pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Furthermore, the adsorption process verifies Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms, and on the basis of mathematical expressions of these models, various necessary adsorption constants have been calculated. Using adsorption data, various thermodynamic parameters like change in enthalpy (a dagger H (0)), change in entropy (a dagger S (0)), and change in free energy a dagger G (0) have also been evaluated. Results clearly reveal that the solid waste material eggshell acts as an effective adsorbent for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions.

AB The photo-Fenton degradation of paracetamol (PCT) was evaluated using FeSO4 and the iron complex potassium ferrioxalate (FeOx) as iron source under simulated solar light. The efficiency of the degradation process was evaluated considering the decay of PCT and total organic carbon concentration and the generation of carboxylic acids, ammonium and nitrate, expressed as total nitrogen. The results showed that the degradation was favored in the presence of FeSO4 in relation to FeOx. The higher concentration of hydroxylated intermediates generated in the presence of FeSO4 in relation to FeOx probably enhanced the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) improving the degradation efficiency. The degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although at different concentrations, the same intermediates were generated using either FeSO4 or FeOx, which were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions and acetamide. The toxicity of the sample for Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna decreased from 100% to less than 40% during photo-Fenton treatment in the presence of both iron species, except for D. magna in the presence of FeOx due to the toxicity of oxalate to this organism. The considerable decrease of the sample toxicity during photo-Fenton treatment using FeSO4 indicates a safe application of the process for the removal of this pharmaceutical. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two up-flow fixed bed reactors (UFBR) were operated for 8 months treating a model synthetic wastewater containing 2-fluorobenzoate (2-FB) and dichloromethane (DCM). The stability of the reactors under dynamic conditions, that is, sequentially alternating pollutants (SAP), shock loads, and starvation periods was assessed. Two support materials were used: expanded clay (EC) that does not adsorb 2-FB or DCM, and granular-activated carbon (GAC) that adsorbs 180 mg g(-1) of 2-FB and 390 mg g(-1) of DCM. The reactors were inoculated with a 2-FB-degrading strain (FB2) and a DCM degrader (TM1). 2-FB was fed at organic loads ranging from 0 to 800 mg L-1 d(-1), while DCM was fed at 0-250 mg L-1 d(-1). 2-FB or DCM were never detected at the outlet of the GAC reactor, while in the EC reactor outlet small amounts were observed. Nevertheless, the highest biological elimination capacity was observed in the EC reactor (over 700 mg L-1 d(-1) of 2-FB). DGGE analysis revealed a fairly stable bacterial community with the largest shifts occurring during starvation periods and changes in feed composition. Several bacterial strains isolated from the reactors showed capacity for 2-FB degradation, while only strain TM1 degraded DCM.

AB This study focused on the effect of salinity on the performance of a pilot-scale nanofiltration (NF) for preconcentration of microcontaminants (MCs) in combination with solar photo-Fenton or photo-Fenton-like treatment for their elimination from NF permeate and concentrate streams. Photo-Fenton was carried out in a solar simulator at pH of 3 and at natural pH using Ethylenediamine-N, N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) as an iron complexing agent Degradation efficacy was tested with MCs commonly found in urban wastewater treatment plant effluents (caffeine, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, carbamazepine and diclofenac). Hydrogen peroxide and persulfate were compared in solar processes. Increase in salinity and pressure had a negligible influence on MC permeability order and NF selectivity. Solar photo-Fenton was able to degrade MCs present in the concentrated stream, and rapidly eliminate any residual MCs that might finally be present in permeate streams. Persulfate used instead of hydrogen peroxide was shown to be inefficient for the selected MCs. Fe(Ill):EDDS at circumneutral pH was able to remove MCs as quickly as classical photo-Fenton at acid pH, or even faster. This effect supports use of Fe(III):EDDS at natural pH for treating NF concentrates or polishing NF permeates when NF membranes are operated under extreme conditions of salinity.

AB Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller headwater streams. In 2014-2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111 pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites sampled 3-5 times, 47 putative lowimpact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32 low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75% of sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates) space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination.

AB The aim of this study is the assessment of the impact of mixture of three pharmaceutical substances (ciprofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 5-fluorouracil) on aquatic animals, cyanobacteria and plants. Based on previous work and literature data, three concentrations of each substance were used to prepare mixtures: predicted or measured environmental concentrations (PEC/MEC), predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC), concentrations that induced a response of 10% in bioindicators (EC10). Immobilization tests with crustaceans (Daphnia magna and Artemia salina), growth tests with cyanobacteria (Cyanosarcina sp.), algae (Desmodesmus quadricauda, Raphidocelis subcapitata) and plants (Lemna minor), enzymatic test Fluotox and reproduction test with D. magna were performed. The results of this work confirm the importance of low concentration mixture exposure. Effect in PEC/MEC concentrations of the mixture of tested compounds was equal 15% in R. subcapitata growth test. As expected, effects obtained for mixtures of pharmaceuticals in their EC10 concentrations were frequently higher than 10%. The obtained results were compared with the concept of independent action, which either underestimated or overestimated the effects in concentrations used. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exposure to tested mixtures of pharmaceuticals even in low concentrations of components, that individually cause no harm to organisms, may trigger adverse effects in aquatic environment.

AB The Santa Ana River (SAR) is the primary source of groundwater recharge for the Orange County Groundwater Basin in coastal southern California. Approximately 85% base flow in the SAR originates from wastewater treatment plants operated by three dischargers. An on-line, flow-through bioassay using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a means of judging potential public health impacts was employed to evaluate the water quality of the surface water and shallow groundwater originating from the SAR. Three chronic (3-4.5 mo) exposures using orange-red (outbred, OR) and see-through (color mutant, ST-II) Japanese medaka as bioindicators were conducted to evaluate endocrinologic, reproductive, and morphologic endpoints. No statistically significant differences in gross morphological endpoints, mortality, gender ratios, and vitellogenin induction were observed in fish from SAR groundwater treatment compared to the group tested in solute reconstituted reverse osmosis-treated or granular activated carbon (GAC)-treated control waters. Significant differences were observed in egg reproduction and the time to hatch in SAR groundwater; however, total hatchability was not significantly lower. To evaluate the estrogenic activity of the surfacewater source of the groundwater, SAR surface water was evaluated for vitellogenin and gonadal histopathology in juvenile medaka with no effects observed. These results demonstrate that OR Japanese medaka may be a sensitive strain as an on-line monitor to predict potential impacts of water quality, but further studies are needed to elicit causative agents within the water mixture.

AB The ability of ferrate (Fe(Vl)) to oxidize phenolic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and phenols during water treatment was examined by determining the apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) for the reaction of Fe(VI) with selected environmentally relevant phenolic EDCs(17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, beta-estradiol, and bisphenol A) and 10 substituted phenols at pH values ranging from 6 to 11. The three selected groups of EDCs showed appreciable reactivity with Fe(VI) (k(app) at pH 7 ranged from 6.4 x 10(2) to 7.7 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)). The kapp for the substituted phenols studied at pH 7 ranged from 6.6 to 3.6 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), indicating that many other potential phenolic ENS can be oxidized by Fe(VI) during water treatment. The Hammett-type correlations were determined for the reaction between HFeO4- and the undissociated (log(k) = 2.24-2.27 sigma(+)) and dissociated phenol (log(k) = 4.33-3.60 sigma(+)). A comparison of the Hammett correlation obtained for the reaction between HFeO4- and dissociated phenol with those obtained from other drinking water oxidants revealed that HFeO4- is a relatively mild oxidant of phenolic compounds. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) for the oxidative removal of phenolic EDCs was also confirmed in both natural water and wastewater.

AB Metformin is a glucose-lowering drug taken for diabetes. It is excreted by humans in urine and detected inmunicipal wastewater effluents and rivers. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed over a life cycle to measured concentrations of metformin: 3.0, 31, and 322 mu g/L. No significant changes were observed in survival, maturation, growth, condition factor, or liver size. Relative ovary size of females exposed to 322 mu g/L metformin was significantly larger than controls. There was no induction of vitellogenin in plasma of minnows, and gonad maturation was not statistically different from controls. The start of breeding was delayed by 9-10 d in the mid- and high metformin treatments (statistically significant only in the mid-concentration), but numbers and quality of eggs were not statistically different from controls. There were no effects of metformin on survival or growth of offspring. Exposure to metformin at environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e., 3.0 and 31 mu g/L metformin) caused no adverse effects in fathead minnows exposed for a life cycle, with the exception of a delay in time to first breeding (that did not impact overall egg production). The results of the study are important to help understand whether metformin concentrations in rivers and lakes can harm fishes.

AB High-performance novel iron oxyhydroxide (limonite) nanostructure, with improved surface reactive sites, was prepared via one-pot, eco-friendly, free precursor and cold glow discharge N-2-plasma technique. Natural and plasma treated (PTNL/N-2) limonite samples were characterized by FESEM, XPS, XRD, FTIR, AAS, EDX, BET/BJH and pH(pzc) to confirm the successful synthesis. Central composite design (CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN, topology of 4:8:1) methods were utilized to study the oxidation/mineralization of phenazopyridine (PhP) as a hazardous contaminant by heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process (HCOP). The obtained results indicated that PTNL/N-2 had the highest catalytic performance in PhP degradation (98.6% in 40 min) and mineralization (80.4% in 120 min). The degradation mechanism in different processes was investigated by dissolved ozone concentration, various organic scavengers (BQ and TBA) and inorganic salts (NaNO3, NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaH2PO4). Moreover, reusability-stability, Fe and nitrogen (NO3- and NH4+) ions release were assessed during different AOPs. Furthermore, toxicity tests indicated that the HCOP using PTNL/N-2 was able to detoxify the PhP solutions efficiently. Finally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies were employed to introduce the most plausible contaminant degradation pathway, reactive sites and byproducts. This research provided a new insight into the improvement of wastewater treatment studies by a combination of experiment and computer simulation.

AB With increasing population growth and climate change, de facto reuse practices are predicted to increase globally. We investigated a longitudinal gradient within the Uhlava River, a representative watershed, where de facto reuse is actively occurring, during Fall and Spring seasons when instream flows vary. We observed human pharmaceutical levels in the river to continuously increase from the mountainous areas upstream to downstream locations and a potable intake location, with the highest concentrations found in small tributaries. Significant relationship was identified between mass flow of pharmaceuticals and the size of human populations contributing to wastewater treatment plant discharges. Advanced ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration effectively removed pharmaceuticals from potable source waters. We observed a higher probability of encountering a number of targeted pharmaceuticals during colder Spring months when stream flows were elevated compared to warmer conditions with lower flows in the Fall despite a dilution paradigm routinely applied for surface water quality assessment and management efforts. Such observations translated to greater water quality hazards during these higher Spring flows. Future water monitoring efforts should account for periods when higher chemical uses occur, particularly in the face of climate change for regions experiencing population growth and de facto reuse.

AB This work presents the main results regarding the use of solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO(2)on the removal of Benzophenone-1 and Benzophenone-2 (BP1 and BP2) in aqueous samples at lab and pilot scale. BP1 and BP2 are two UV-filters that have been classified as potential endocrine disruptors, and their presence in water has been reported by different researches. Experiments were conducted at lab scale using simulated sunlight radiation, while at pilot scale a solar compound cylinder-parabolic (CCP) collector and direct sunlight were employed. Effects of catalyst concentration and solution pH on contaminants elimination were assessed. Pollutants were completely removed at lab conditions in just 60 min of reaction, while under pilot scale tests elimination was around 90.0% in 360 min. Mineralization of treated samples was around 60%. In general, it was found that the photo-generation of hydroxyl (HO center dot) radicals contributes to BP1 and BP2 removal, and that higher doses of TiO(2)could have an inhibitory effect. Additionally, presence of some inorganic ions on the aqueous matrix (drinking water) used in the pilot-scale tests would be associated to a reduction on the extent of pollutants degradation, which together with aspects such as the type of reactor and the atmospheric and climate conditions would limit the process efficiency in comparison with results at lab-scale experiments.

AB Permeability loss and the low retention efficiency of soluble organics significantly restrict the application of ultrafiltration (UF) for water reclamation. In this work, the tertiary treatment of secondary effluent using UF was investigated under a variety of transmembrane pressures (TMPs) (20-150 kPa) to obtain more insight into fouling by effluent organic matter (EfOM) and its impact on organic rejection, particularly for hydrophobic pharmaceuticals represented by carbamazepine and naproxen. The flux decline and the reversible fouling during secondary effluent filtration were substantially aggravated with increasing TMP, whereas the irreversible fouling was generally reduced, as attributed to restriction of EfOM adhesion to the membrane surface by the fouling layer. The fouling process was successively dominated by pore blocking and cake layer filtration, and the shift in the dominant mechanism was accelerated under higher TMPs. The rejection of EfOM was improved in the presence of a fouling layer, which acted as a secondary filtration medium, particularly at higher TMPs. The maximum rejection of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals by UF was observed in a moderate TMP range (40-60 kPa), probably due to a trade-off between increased fouling layer retention and reduced rejection due to increased wall shear and aggravated cake-enhanced concentration polarization with increasing TMP. The results would encourage the strategy of utilizing the fouling layer for irreversible-fouling restriction and better rejection of hydrophobic PhACs.

AB UV absorbers developed for finishing of textile materials play a significant role in protection against UV radiations but their discharge in wastewater during processing and laundry action also retain serious concern to living species due to their recalcitrant nature. The current study examined the mineralization and degradation of two vinylsulfone and nitrogen (N-) containing UV absorber compounds (1a, 2a) via two effective Fenton and UV/H2O2 oxidation. The results showed that both the Fenton and UV/H2O2 processes mineralized the synthesized UV absorbers effectively; however the mineralization process with Fenton oxidation was more effective than the UV/H2O2. The mineralization of synthesized UV absorbers was affected by process parameters (dosage of Fe2+ and H2O2, pH and reaction time). Under attained optimum conditions of Fenton oxidation, dose of Fe2+ (15 mg/L), H2O2 (500 mg/L), pH (3.0) and contact time (120 minutes), 75.43 and 77.54% of Chemical Oxygen Demand removal was achieved for la and 2a, respectively. Whereas, the optimum conditions of UV/H2O2 process were H2O2 (700 mg/L), pH(3.0) and irradiation time (200 minutes) that brought 54.33 and 57.65% COD removal in case of 1a and 2a, respectively. The results indicated that the Fenton oxidation can be successfully employed for the mineralization of triazine based UV absorbers.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are chemicals of a synthetic origin or deriving from a natural source that has recently been discovered and for which environmental or public health risks are yet to be established. This is due to limited available information on their interaction and toxicological impacts on receptors. Several types of ECs exist such as antibiotics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, effluents, certain naturally occurring contaminants and more recently nanomaterials. ECs may derive from a known source, for example released directly to the aquatic environment from direct discharges such as those from wastewater treatment plants. Although in most instances the direct source cannot be identified, ECs have been detected in virtually every country's natural environment and as a consequence they represent a global problem. There is very limited information on the fate and transport of ECs in the environment and their toxicological impact. This lack of information can be attributed to limited financial resources and the lack of analytical techniques for detecting their effects on ecosystems and human health on their own or as mixture. We do not know how ECs interact with each other or various contaminants. This paper presents an overview of existing knowledge on ECs, their fate and transport and a risk-based analysis for ECs management and complementary strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Phytoremediation technologies such as constructed wetlands have shown higher efficiencies in removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters than conventional wastewater treatment processes, and plants seem to have an important role in the removal of some of those compounds. In this context, a study was conducted to assess tolerance, uptake, and metabolism of the epilepsy drug, carbamazepine, by the macrophyte Typha spp. This evaluation was conducted in hydroponic solutions with 0.5-2.0 mg/L of this pharmaceutical for a maximum period of 21 days. The removal of carbamazepine from nutrient solutions by the plants reached values of 82% of the initial contents. Furthermore, a metabolite (10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxycarbamazepine) was detected in leaf tissues indicating carbamazepine translocation and metabolism inside plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and guaiacol peroxidase generally increase (after some mild initial inhibition in the case of the latter enzyme) as result of the abiotic stress caused by the exposure to carbamazepine, but ultimately Typha seemed able to cope with its toxicity. The results obtained in this study suggest the ability of Typha spp., to actively participate in the removal of carbamazepine from water when used in phytotreatment systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen (APAP) in TiO2 suspended solution under a 250W metal halide lamp. The influence of some parameters on the degradation of acetaminophen was studied and described in details, such as initial APAP concentration, initial pH value and TiO2 dosage. After 100 min irradiation, about 95% of APAP is decomposed in the 1.0 g L-1 TiO2 aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 100 mu mol L-1. The effect of adsorption at three different pH values has also been analyzed and it has been conducted that pH 3.5, at which APAP was readily adsorbed also degraded at a faster rate. Reaction rate at pH 6.9 and pH 9.5 was 2.84 and 2.96 mu M min(-1), respectively. Direct hole (h(+)) oxidation and ipso-substitution was found to be the main initial step for APAP degradation. Main reaction intermediates and products were identified by GC/MS analysis. The mechanism of acetaminophen photocatalytic degradation in TiO2 suspended solution was studied not only experimentally but also theoretically by calculating the frontier electron density of APAP. The results obtained indicated that TiO2 photocatalytic degradation is a highly effective way to remove APAP from wastewater and drinking water without any generation of more toxic products.

AB The triclosan (TC) is classified as antibacterial compound as an emerging pollutant, which is extensively used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The present study evaluated the degradation efficiency of TC by combination of persulfate radical and electrocoagulation (PS-EC) process from synthetic industrial wastewater. To obtain optimum condition, the effect of influencing parameter on PS-EC process including solution pH, reaction time, current density, PS dose, concentration of electrolyte, initial concentration of TC, and electrode arrangement were systematically investigated. The increase of the current densities from 0.67 to 2.71 mA/cm(2) resulted in an increase of TC degradation efficiency from 58.7% to 65.9% after 35 min of reaction time. Up to 99.5% of TC was degraded by PS-EC process after 35 min reaction time at optimum condition including PS dose: 250 mg/L, current density: 2.71 mA/cm(2), electrolyte concentration: 2.5 g/L, and solution pH: 7. The operating cost including electrode and energy was calculated as 164,782 Rial/m(3). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis of produced sludge during PS-EC process indicated that the specific surface area, total pore volume, and mean pore diameter were 97.8 m(2)/g, 0.19 cm(3)/g, and 7.8 nm, respectively.

AB Although conventional biological treatment plants can remove basic pollutants, they are ineffective at removing recalcitrant pollutants. Membrane bioreactors contain promising technology and have the advantages of better effluent quality and lower sludge production compared to those of conventional biological treatment processes. In this study, the removal of pharmaceutical compounds by membrane bioreactors under different solid retention times (SRTs) was investigated. To study the effect of SRT on the removal of emerging pharmaceuticals, the levels of pharmaceuticals were measured over 96 days for the following retention times: 20, 30, and 40-day SRT. It was found that the 40-day SRT had the optimum performance in terms of the pharmaceuticals' elimination. The removal efficiencies of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) for each selected SRT were higher than 96% at steady-state conditions. The highest degradation efficiency was observed for paracetamol. Paracetamol was the most removed compound followed by ranitidine, atenolol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and carbamazepine. The microbial community at the phylum level was also analyzed to understand the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals. It was noticed that the Proteobacteria phylum increased from 46.8% to 60.0% after 96 days with the pharmaceuticals. The Actinobacteria class, which can metabolize paracetamol, carbamazepine, and atenolol, was also increased from 9.1% to 17.9% after adding pharmaceuticals. The by-products of diclofenac, bezafibrate, and carbamazepine were observed in the effluent samples.

DE Emerging contaminants; Ampicillin; CoFe2O4; Peroxymonosulfate; Removal
AB Emerging contaminants (EC) are classified as major leading issues in treating wastewater, especially drugs and pharmaceuticals in the urban regions, and the detection and degradation of these pollutants have become an arduous task. Ampicillin is one such portentous beta- lactam antibiotic compound used extensively in the medical field for their antimicrobial and growth-enhancing properties in humans as well in veterinary sectors. Due to continuous exposure, the microbes in due course developed a shield towards the implication of antibiotics. The degradation of Ampicillin has also been succeeded by mixed metal oxides nanoparticles generally specified as AxB(2-x)O(4), which has been a fundamental catalyst in the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOPs). Magnetic nanoparticles, Cobalt Ferrite nanoparticles (CoFe2O4) were synthesized by the coprecipitation method further; it has employed in the activation of oxidizing agent Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in the Ampicillin degradation. The material and chemical characterization of synthesized nanoparticles using XRD, TEM, SEM-EDX, and FTIR analysis were done. From the investigation, the nanoparticles were found to exhibit a cubic spinel configuration with a crystallite size of 10.10 nm. The impact of working parameters, such as the presence/absence of catalyst, pH, PMS concentration, and the time required for ampicillin degradation, were investigated. At neutral pH with 0.1 g/L of catalyst measure, 0.2 mM of PMS, 90 +/- 1.94 % Ampicillin degraded over 25 mM of contact time. The degraded intermediate products of Ampicillin were identified using LC-MS analysis.

AB Clofibric acid, the main pharmacologically-active metabolite of pharmaceutical products used as antilipaemic agent has received, in last years, an increased interest because of its well-known recalcitrance to biodegradation and its high persistence in the aquatic environment. This molecule passes unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants. An indigenous strain of Streptomyces, named MIUG 4.89 was previously selected, exhibited the ability to favor clofibric acid biodegradation within submerged cultivation in controlled biotechnological conditions. Thus, in order to enhance the biodegradation of this refractory molecule, mathematical modeling and statistical optimization designs associated to PlackettBurman Design and Response Surface Methodology were used to evaluate and optimize the effects of different major culture conditions of this bacterial isolate. According to the results, under optimized culture conditions (5 g L-1 glucose, inoculation level 4.7 %, 27.5 C and 20 days of incubation) the strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 exhibited a successful removal of clofibric acid with a biodegradation yield of 54 %, which is in agreement with model prediction. Thus, under optimized conditions, the removal yield was enhanced, which is very promising accounting for the refractory character of this water pollutant. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Cyclohexane and sec-butyl alcohol are widely used in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The separation of cyclohexane/sec-butyl alcohol/water azeotropic mixture is of great significance for mitigating environmental risk, recycling solvents, and maintaining developmental sustainability. Based on the COSMO-SAC model, the infinite dilution activity coefficients of the components were calculated, and the final solvent was further obtained by relative volatility and solvent power screening. Taking the total annual cost as the objective function, the extractive distillation process is optimized based on a sequential iterative optimization algorithm. To further reduce the process energy consumption, several energy-saving processes were explored. Energy-saving processes are compared in terms of total annual cost, CO2 emissions, and thermodynamic efficiency. It was found that the total annual cost and thermodynamic efficiency of the processes show an increasing trend, while CO2 emissions show a decreasing trend. The results of stage-exergy indicate that the processes with heat pump are relatively small. The heat pump combined with the thermal coupling extractive distillation process exhibits better thermoeconomic and environmental performance. It provides theoretical guidance for improving the separation and recovery of value organics and energy-saving optimization of processes, which conforms to the theme of sustainable and environmental development.

AB The elimination or degradation of micropollutants from wastewater is becoming ever more important nowadays. Using oxidoreductase enzymes to treat different micropollutants seems a promising solution. However, the viability of the process is highly dependent on the availability and stability of the applied enzymes. In order to improve the stability and provide faster reaction rates, enzymes can be immobilized in various carriers. Properties such as simple production, easy retention and biodegradable carrier material are advantageous, e.g. entrapping laccase in alginate beads. This paper shows the results of the preparation and characterization of immobilized laccase entrapped in calcium alginate beads. The technique of adding a mixture of sodium alginate and laccase dropwise into calcium chloride has been applied, improved and standardized to produce laccase-containing beads of uniform size and activity. For the purpose of characterization, a widely used substrate, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, was used to evaluate the performance of the laccase-containing alginate beads. In addition to the characterization of the laccase-containing alginate beads, the enzyme kinetic constants (K-M = 26.43 mu M, V-max = 0.23 mu M/min) were determined. The reduction in the activity during storage has been described by a decay constant (0.26 d(-1)) that provides information concerning the design constraints of the process. Results will be used to test the method in terms of the removal of organic micropollutants in continuous systems.

AB Contamination of water resources by emerging contaminants, radionuclides, heavy metals and nitrate is a critical problem that adversely affects the biotope. Constructed wetlands, as one of the least energy consuming methods have become an interesting option for wastewater treatment. In this study, terrestrial plants were used for phytoremediation of important pollutants from waste water. Therefore, uptake rates of cesium, metformin, arsenic and nitrate in hydroponic mesocosem constructed wetland were studied. When initial Cs concentrations were 2.35, 7.90 and 19.75 mg l(-1) in mesocosem constructed wetland, 89.36 +/- 0.42, 88.56 +/- 0.19 and 84.72 +/- 0.15% of cesium were remediated by Amaranthus chlorostachys plants. In the same cesium concentrations in mesocosem constructed wetland, 18.43 +/- 2.76, 78.98 +/- 0.25 and 89.35 +/- 0.25% cesium found to be remediated by Calendula alata plants. When exposed to 20 and 50 mg l(-1) metformin solutions 63 +/- 14 and 58.4 +/- 8.60% metformin were remediated by Amaranthus retroflexus plants. When exposed to 0.3 mg l(-1) sodium arsenate solution, 85.5 and 93.1% of arsenic were remediated after 14 and 21 days by Vetiveria zizanioides. In the case that initial concentrations of nitrate in hydroponic mesocosem constructed wetland were 32.7, 40.08 and 47.37 mg l(-1), 40.27, 26.64 and 70.02% of nitrate were removed, respectively, after 14 days.

Ferrate.VI) had the highest reactivity with CIP, with a second-order rate constant of 89 +/- 2 M-1 s(-1) at pH 10.3 +/- 0.3. The rate constants of ferrate.VI) with MET and CBZ under the same conditions were 3.7 +/- 0.3 M-1 s(-1) and 13.1 +/- 0.8 M-1 s(-1), respectively, while no reaction took place with OH-IBU. We also evaluated the removal efficiencies of nine selected pharmaceuticals, including MET, CBZ, CIP and OH-IBU, detected in a real hospital wastewater (HWW) with concentrations ranging from 73 +/- 4 ng L-1 to 159 +/- 8 mu g L-1 by applying Fe.VI) technology. The abatement of the targeted pharmaceuticals depends on their structures. Because Fe.VI) captures electrons during the oxidation process, we proposed to correlate the reactivity of Fe.VI) with the first ionization potential (IP) of the pharmaceuticals. The first IP values of MET, CBZ, CIP, OH-IBU and diclofenac (DFC) were determined by gas-phase UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UV-PES). The UV-PES data were also interpreted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

AB BACKGROUND: Decomposition of amoxicillin (AMX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in aqueous suspensions by two forms of ferrate (VI) were investigated. The effect of the initial concentration of antibiotics, pH, and ferrate (VI) dosage were examined. Model calculations were made by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method (RB3LYP) taking into account the environmental parameters. LanL2DZ and 6-311G(++)(d, p) were taken as basic functions for the calculations. This was followed by analysis of two redox decomposition mechanisms of the ferrate ion, with the O-2 molecule formation and electron density distribution, and the reaction mechanism of superoxide particle formation, which participates in the AMX and CIP oxidation process.
   RESULTS: Ferrate (VI) degraded CIP more effciently than AMX in both forms. Electrogenerated ferrate (VI) was more efficient than direct use of its solid form. The removal efficiencies of CIP and AMX by electrogenerated ferrate (VI) were 80.9% and 63.7%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ferrate (VI), with its high oxidizing capacity and coagulation effect, could be applied to the removal of antibiotics in wastewater treatment. The results of the AMX and CIP electron structure calculations demonstrate that electron transfer to the molecules leads to the formation of meta-stable states and causes the molecules to fragment.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are sources for emerging pollutants, including organic compounds and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which then flow into aquatic systems. In this article, natural attenuation of pollutants by constructed wetland plants was investigated using lab-scale microcosm and batch sorption studies. The microcosms were operated at varying hydraulic residence times (HRTs) and contained decaying plant materials. Representative organic compounds and ENMs were simultaneously spiked into the microcosm influent, along with a conservative tracer (bromide), and then monitored in the effluent over time. It was observed that a more hydrophobic compound-natural estrogen achieved better removal than a polar organic compound - para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), which mimics the behaviour of the tracer. Batch sorption experiments showed that estrogen has higher sorption affinity than pCBA, highlighting the importance of sorption to the plant materials as a removal process for the organic contaminants in the microcosms. Wetland plants were also found a potential sorbent for ENMs. Two different ENMs (nano-silver and aqueous fullerenes) were included in this study, both of which experienced comparable removal in the microcosms. Relative to the tracer, the highest removal of ENMs and trace organics was 60% and 70%, respectively. A more than two-fold increase in HRT increased the removal efficiency of the contaminants in the range of 20-60%. The outcome of this study supports that plant materials of wetlands can play an important role in removing emerging pollutants from WWTP effluent.

   adsorbents
AB The amount of sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has increased over the years, and the methods used to reduce this waste, such as incineration, agricultural use, or disposal in landfills, cause problems of secondary pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to find sustainable and low-cost solutions to manage this waste. Additionally, emerging and priority pollutants are attracting attention from the scientific community as they can generate health problems due to inadequate removal in conventional WWTPs. In this work, a pharmaceutical industry sludge was used as a precursor in the synthesis of four activated carbons (ACs) using different activating agents (ZnCl2, FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O, Fe(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O, and Fe(SO4)(3)center dot H2O), to be used for the removal by adsorption of three neonicotinoid pesticides included in latest EU Watch List (Decision 2018/840): acetamiprid (ACT), thiamethoxam (THM), and imidacloprid (IMD). The prepared ACs showed micro-mesoporous properties, obtaining relatively slow adsorption kinetics to reach equilibrium, but despite this, high values of adsorption capacity (q(e)) were obtained. For example, for AC-ZnCl2 (S-BET = 558 m(2)/g), high adsorption capacities of q(e) = 128.9, 126.8, and 166.1 mg/g for ACT, THM, and IMD, respectively, were found. In most cases, the adsorption isotherms showed a multilayer profile, indicating an important contribution of the mesoporosity of the activated carbons in the adsorption process.

AB In this study, a hydrophilic resin named GCHM was fabricated based on poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-co-divinylbenzene), characterized, and applied as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) material. Up to 44 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to 10 classes were recovered in environmental water samples. Different variables affecting extraction, such as adsorbent amount, sample pH, and loading speed, were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the average absolute recovery of 44 PPCPs was 75.6% using GCHM, indicating a better performance than the commercial Oasis(R) HLB. SPE with home-made hydrophilic polymeric sorbent followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was validated, and the method achieved good linearity (r(2) >0.991, for all analytes). In addition, the method detection limits of target compounds ranged from 0.03 to 0.6 ng/L. The developed method was applied to determine PPCPs in 10 environmental water samples taken from the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Taihu Lake, 1 groundwater sample from Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, 1 wastewater sample from Xiamen and 2 seawater samples from the Jiulong River in Fujian Province, China. In these samples, 22 compounds were determined at levels ranging from 0.5 to 1590 ng/L.

AB The removal of antibiotics has attracted much attention due to their extremely high adverse impacts on the environment. However, the potential risks of degradation intermediates are seldom reported. In this work, the influence of different factors on the electro-catalytic degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) by the prepared carbon nanotubes/agarose/indium tin oxide (CNTs/AG/ITO) electrode was investigated. Under optimal conditions (10 wt% CNTs dosage, pH = 7), the maximum degradation efficiency for TCH (10 mg L-1) reached up to 96% within 30 min treatment with 4 V potential. Superoxide anions (center dot O-2(-)) played an important role in the electro-catalytic degradation. Totally 10 degradation intermediates were identified using HPLC-MS/MS, and the degradation pathway was proposed. Toxicities of the parent antibiotic and the identified intermediates were calculated using the ECOSAR (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship) program in EPISuite, and results showed that more toxic intermediates were generated. The maximal chronic toxicity for green algae of the intermediate increased 1439.92 times. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity was further verified by disk agar biocidal tests with Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and higher biotoxicity intermediates compared with parent compounds were confirmed to be formed. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the potential risk of degradation intermediates in the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Porous polymeric membranes are widely used in potable water purification, wastewater treatment, the food and the pharmaceutical industries, and haemodialysis. However, producing specialized membranes with diverse transport properties is challenging. A method for fabricating membranes with controllable transport properties is described here by stepwise synthesis of aromatic oligoamide on a porous polymeric support. The use of aromatic oligoamide affords good water permeance due to its hydrophilic character. Alternate couplings of trimesoyl chloride and meta-phenylenediamine yielded an oligoamide dendrimer that was covalently bonded to the support. The water permeance and molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the synthesized membranes were controlled (with values of 4.6 to 543 L.m(-2) h(-1).bar(-1) and 22.6 to 332 kDa, respectively) by adjusting the number of oligoamide synthesis cycles in the range of 2.5-20.5. The oligoamide membrane with 5.5 synthetic cycles showed a high rejection of the negatively charged rose bengal dye (95% rejection) with high flux (126.4 +/- 4.2L.m(-2) h(-1) at 5.2 bar), as compared with other membranes reported in the literature. The fabricated membranes are potentially highly useful for the separation of macromolecules with specific ranges of molecular weight, for industrial separations that require membranes with tunable MWCO ranges, or for the separation of charged macromolecules.

AB Foams are concentrated dispersions of gas bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. They are ubiquitous in nature and familiar from beet, frothed milk, and bubble baths; moreover, they play important roles in industrial applications ranging from petrochemicals to pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetics. Recently, we reported the discovery of "capillary foams", a new class of stable foams obtained by frothing a suspension of colloidal particles in the presence of a small amount of oil. In this study, we explored in more detail the formation stages of capillary foams and found that particle networks are formed first, which then entrap the gas bubbles (in this case, air bubbles). We further investigated the influence of particle concentration and wettability on the formation of capillary foams. As the fraction of particles is increased, the foam volume first increases and then reaches a plateau value. Finally, capillary foams were prepared at different oil fractions, using oils with different interfacial properties. Our study shows that oil spreading has a strong effect on both the amount of oil needed to obtain stable foams and on the foam stability. A detailed understanding of the foam formation and the effects of material and process parameters lays a foundation for the targeted development of capillary foams toward future applications, which may range from the fabrication of load-bearing, lightweight porous materials, to enhanced oil recovery, advanced froth flotation, wastewater treatment, and oil spill remediation.

AB Forest-water reuse systems infiltrate municipal, industrial, and agricultural Wastewaters through forest soils to shallow aquifers that ultimately discharge to surface waters. Their ability to Mitigate regulated nutrients, metals, and organic chemicals is well known, but the fate of non-regulated chemicals in these systems is largely unstudied. This study quantified 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in soils, groundwaters, and surface waters in a 2000-hectare forest that receives similar to 1200 mm/year of secondary-treated, municipal Wastewater in addition to natural rainfall (similar to 1300 mm/year). This forest-water reuse system does contribute PPCPs to soils, groundwater, and surface waters. PPCPs were more abundant in soils versus underlying groundwater by an order of magnitude (5-10 ng/g summed PPCPs in soil and 50-100 ng/L in groundwater) and the more hydrophobic chemicals were predominant in soil over water. PPCP concentrations in surface waters were greater at the onset of significant storm events and during low-rainfall periods when total summed PPCPs were >80 ng/L, higher than the annual average. With few exceptions, the margins of exposure for PPCPs in groundwater and surface waters were several orders of magnitude above values indicative of human health risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The youth festival as we refer to Spring Scream, a large-scale pop music festival, is notorious for the problems of drug abuse and addiction. The origin, temporal magnitudes, potential risks and mass inputs of emerging contaminants (ECs) were investigated. Thirty targeted ECs were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Sampling strategy was designed to characterize EC behavior in different stages (before and after the youth festival), based on multivariate data analysis to explore the contributions of contaminants from normal condition to the youth festival. Wastewater influents and effluents were collected during the youth festival (approximately 600?000 pop music fans and youth participated). Surrounding river waters are also sampled to illustrate the touristic impacts during peak season and off-season. Seasonal variations were observed, with the highest concentrations in April (Spring Scream) and the lowest in October (off-season). Acetaminophen, diclofenac, codeine, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin-H2O, and gemfibrozil have significant pollution risk quotients (RQs > 1), indicating ecotoxicological concerns. Principal component analysis (PCA) and weekly patterns provide a perspective in assessing the touristic impacts and address the dramatic changes in visitor population and drug consumption. The highest mass loads discharged into the aquatic ecosystem corresponded to illicit drugs/controlled substances such as ketamine and MDMA, indicating the high consumption of ecstasy during Spring Scream.

AB Trace amounts of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in waters across the United States. Many compounds are released as the result of human ingestion and subsequent excretion of over-the-counter and prescription medications, and illicit drugs. This research utilized columns (30 x 30 cm) of sand and undisturbed fine-grained sediments to simulate injection of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and an illicit drug, such as would be found in a septic system, leaky sewer, or landfill. The columns were placed in a temperature-controlled laboratory and each was injected with natural groundwater containing known concentrations of caffeine, methamphetamine, and acetaminophen. Natural attenuation of each chemical was observed in all columns. The highest amount removed (approximately 90%) occurred in the undisturbed column injected with methamphetamine, compared with little reduction in the sand column. When the suite of drugs was injected, loss of methamphetamine was less than when methamphetamine was injected alone. The subsurface sediments exhibit the ability to remove a substantial amount of the injected pharmaceuticals and illicit drug; however, complete removal was not achieved. There was little attenuation of injected pharmaceuticals in the sand column which demonstrates a concern for water quality in the environment if pharmaceuticals were to contaminate a sandy aquifer. Understanding the transport of pharmaceuticals in the subsurface environment is an important component of protecting drinking water supplies from contamination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work explores the competitive removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic and environmental waters by combined adsorption-photolysis treatment. Five drugs usually present in waterways have been used as target compounds, some are pseudo-persistent pollutants (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and sulfamethoxazole) and others are largely consumed (diclofenac and ibuprofen). The effect of the light source on adsorption of drugs onto activated carbons followed by photolysis with TiO2 was assessed, being UV-C light the most effective for drug removal in both deionized water and river water. Different composites prepared from titania nanoparticles and powdered activated carbons were tested in several combined adsorption-photocatalysis assays. The composites prepared by calcination at 400 degrees C exhibited much better performance than those synthesized at 500 degrees C, being the C400 composite the most effective one. Furthermore, some synthetic waters containing dissolved species and environmental waters were used to investigate the effect of the aqueous matrix on each drug removal. In general, photocatalyst deactivation was found in synthetic and environmental waters. This was particularly evident in the experiments performed with bicarbonate ions as well as with wastewater effluent. In contrast, tests conducted in seawater showed adsorption and photocatalytic degradation yields comparable to those obtained in deionized water. Considering the peculiarities of substrate competition in each aqueous matrix, the combined adsorption-photolysis treatment generally increased the overall elimination of drugs in water.

AB The trace amount of micro-pollutants (organic mostly) those still remain in the final effluent of any industry even after the tertiary treatment is a serious matter of concern and needs special treatment strategy to address the same. Advanced oxidation processes have emerged as the best suited remedy for that. However, among all the AOPs, cavitation process is till now one of the most unattempted technologies in spite of inherent enormous potential. The present work reports a study with the degradation of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (CIP) using a novel skid-mounted rotating hydrodynamic cavitation (RHC) reactor. Using only hydrodynamic cavitation, 44.8% CIP degradation was achieved within 60 min. Now RHC combined with oxidizing agents like O-3 (0.75 g/ h), H2O2 (0.3 g/L) and Fenton's reagent (1:3) resulted in 91.4%, 85.6%, and 87.6% degradation within 30 min. The HC+H2O2 (0.3 g/L) surpassed the performances of other combinations from energetic and economic viewpoint. Liquid chromatography-mass spectra (LC-MS) studies were performed to evaluate the degradation mechanism. Lastly, a pilot scale study (400 L) with real life water sample post tertiary treatment collected from pharmaceutical industry was carried out to understand the techno-economic feasibility.

AB The transformation that pharmaceuticals can undergo during the water reclamation cycle, or by biotic/abiotic reactions when reclaimed water (RW) is used for irrigation, can lead to the presence of transformation products (TPs) in agricultural environments. However, data on TPs in real crops are scarce. Herein, a suspect screening approach was applied for the comprehensive investigation of 262 potential TPs, associated with 20 prioritised pharmaceuticals found in real tomato crops exposed to long-term RW irrigation. The occurrence and fate of the TPs was evaluated by the retrospective analysis of RW, soil, leave and tomato samples from 4 intensive production greenhouses. Sample analysis was accomplished by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-timeof-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Up to 18 TPs were tentatively identified, of which 2 were not previously reported. 7 TPs were finally confirmed with analytical standards. 5 TPs were determined in RW, 15 TPs in soil and 2 TPs in leaves. Remarkably, the investigated TPs were not found in tomato fruits. These results shed light on the variety of TPs that can be found in the water reuse cycle and contribute to the assessment of the global risks of wastewater reuse and the safety of the vegetable and fruit production system.

AB The design of stable and highly efficient photocatalysts had emerged as an economic and promising way for eliminating harmful pharmaceutical pollutants. In this study, a series of Ag2O-modified g-C3N4 composites with different Ag2O amounts (denoted as Ag2O-CNx) were fabricated via a facile reflux condensation methodology. Ofloxacin (OFL) was chosen as a model pollutant to evaluate the degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic system. The optimal photocatalytic activity was achieved with Ag2O-CN1.0, which reached up to 99.1% removal of OFL after 15-min reaction and the pseudo-first-order constant was 0.469 min(-1), approximately 42 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Considering the complexity of the actual environment, the important influential factors such as catalyst dosage, initial OFL concentration, solution pH, and natural organic matter on the OFL degradation were systematically investigated. Additionally, Ag2O-CN1.0 showed good stability and recyclability in multiple cycle experiments. The feasible photodegradation mechanism of OFL was proposed with radical scavenger experiments, and the degradation products were determined. Furthermore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to not only the high photogenerated charge separation efficiency and the surface plasmon resonance effect of metallic Ag, but also the p-n heterojunction formed between Ag2O and g-C3N4. Therefore, Ag2O-CN1.0 was a treatment material possessing great application prospects for eliminating OFL in wastewater.

AB Ornidazole is a well-known antibiotic which has been widely used for both human and veterinary treatments. The present study investigated the degradation of ornidazole using TiO2 as a photocatalyst with UV light irradiation. Artificial neural network (ANN) was applied for the modeling of the photocatalytic degradation of ornidazole. In slurry mode, the input parameters were pH, ornidazole concentration, TiO2 dose, treatment time and % degradation as output. Parametric optimization was performed by Box-Behnken design (BBD). At optimum conditions the % degradation was found to be 84.02, 82.63 and 77.7% as predicted by BBD, simulated by ANN and by experimental run respectively. The results showed that the predictions agreed with the experimental results. The degradation of ornidazole follows the second-order reaction kinetics. For fixed-bed studies, TiO2 immobilized spherical cement beads were used to carry out the degradation of ornidazole at laboratory scale as well as at pilot scale with volume handling of 5 L. The catalyst immobilized beads were successfully recycled for at-least 40 runs without any significant reduction in the degradation efficiency of ornidazole. The activity as well as stability of immobilized catalyst over the surface of beads was confirmed through SEM/EDS, XRD and DRS analysis. Bioassay test was conducted for the safe disposal of treated wastewater and was found to be non-toxic.

AB Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 mu g/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male Betta splendens. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 mu g/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.

AB Batch and column experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of organic matter, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals and to identify the removal mechanisms of the target contaminants. The sands used in the experiments were obtained from the Youngsan River located in South Korea. Neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals (iopromide, estrone, and trimethoprim) were removed with efficiencies greater than 80% from different sand media during experiments, due to the effect of sorption between sand and pharmaceuticals. However, the anionic pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac) were more effectively removed by natural sand, compared to baked sand. These observations were mainly attributed to biodegradation under natural conditions of surface organic matter and ATP concentrations. The removal of organic matter and nitrogen was also found to increase under biotic conditions. Therefore, it is indicated that biodegradation plays an important role and act as major mechanisms for the removal of organic matter, nutrients, and selected pharmaceuticals during sand passage and the managed aquifer recharge, which is an effective treatment method for removing target contaminants. However, the low removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals (e.g., carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole) require additional processes (e.g., AOPs, NF and RO membrane), a long residence time, and long travel distance for increasing the removal efficiencies.

AB Diclofenac sodium, a widely detected pharmaceutical drug in wastewater samples, has been selected as a model pollutant for degradation using novel combined approach of hydrodynamic cavitation and heterogeneous photocatalysis. A slit venturi has been used as cavitating device in the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor. The effect of various operating parameters such as inlet fluid pressure (2-4 bar) and initial pH of the solution (4-7.5) on the extent of degradation have been studied. The maximum extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium was obtained at inlet fluid pressure of 3 bar and initial pH as 4 using hydrodynamic cavitation alone. The loadings of TiO2 and H2O2 have been optimised to maximise the extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium. Kinetic study revealed that the degradation of diclofenac sodium fitted first order kinetics over the selected range of operating protocols. It has been observed that combination of hydrodynamic cavitation with UV, UV/TiO2 and UV/TiO2/H2O2 results in enhanced extents of degradation as compared to the individual schemes. The maximum extent of degradation as 95% with 76% reduction in TOC has been observed using hydrodynamic cavitation in conjunction with UV/TiO2/H2O2 under the optimised operating conditions. The diclofenac sodium degradation byproducts have been identified using LC/MS analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Many pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are found in surface and ground waters suggesting their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation/reduction processes (AO/RPs), which utilize free radical reactions to directly degrade chemical contaminants, are alternatives to traditional water treatment. This study reports the absolute rate constants for reaction of diclofenac sodium and model compound (2, 6-dichloraniline) with the two major AO/RP radicals: the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)). The bimolecular reaction rate constants (M-1 s(-1)) for diclofenac for center dot OH was (9.29 +/- 0.11) x 10(9), and for e(aq)(-) was (1.53 +/- 0.03) x 10(9). To provide a better understanding of the decomposition of the intermediate radicals produced by hydroxyl radical reactions, transient absorption spectra are observed from 1 - 250 mu s. In addition, preliminary degradation mechanisms and major products were elucidated using Co-60 gamma-irradiation and LC-MS. The toxicity of products was evaluated using luminescent bacteria. These data are required for both evaluating the potential use of AO/RPs for the destruction of these compounds and for studies of their fate and transport in surface waters where radical chemistry may be important in assessing their lifetime.

AB The technical feasibility and performance of photocatalytic degradation of anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen (ACTP) and beta-blocker atenolol (ATL) have been studied in a well-defined system of a pilot-plant scale Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPCs) under natural illumination. Heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO2) and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton were investigated with two different matrices: distilled water and synthetic municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent (S.E.). The initial concentrations of the pharmaceuticals studied were 10 mg L-1, whereas the concentrations of the catalysts employed were 200 mg L-1 of TiO2 and 5 mg L-1 of iron. Total disappearance of the parent compounds and discreet mineralization were attained in all experiments. Furthermore, kinetic parameters, release of heteroatoms and formation of carboxylic acids are discussed. The main intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of atelonol has been structurally elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) experiments performed at quadrupole-time of flight (QqToF) mass analyzer coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC). Six transformation products were characterized, formed by consecutive attacks of hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) radical in concomitance with the disappearance of the primary compound. The proposed TiO2 and photo-Fenton degradation route of ATL is reported for the first time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Occurrence and fate of the pharmaceutical drug diclofenac in surface
   waters: Rapid photodegradation in a lake
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATRAZINE
AB The pharmaceutical drug diclofenac (2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid) was detected in rivers and lakes in Switzerland. The data strongly suggest inputs of diclofenac from human medical use via wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, the concentrations in a major tributary to a lake (Greifensee) were significantly higher (up to 370 ng/L) than those in the outflow of this lake (up to 12 ng/L). It is estimated that more than 90% of the diclofenac entering the lake is eliminated in the lake, most likely by photolytic degradation. Diclofenac was not detected in the sediments of the lake, and in a laboratory experiment, it showed negligible adsorption onto sediment particles. Incubation of lake water, fortified with diclofenac, showed no degradation in the dark, suggesting minimal chemical and biological degradation. However, when the fortified water was exposed to sunlight, rapid photodegradation was observed with a (pseudo) first-order kinetic and a half-life of less than 1 h (October and 47 degrees N latitude). Modeling these experimental data for the situation of Greifensee, the data indicated that photodegradation can account for the rapid elimination of diclofenac in the lake. Several photoproducts were characterized in the laboratory experiments but were so far not detected under the natural conditions in the lake. Whereas photodegradation is often one among several degradation pathways for environmental contaminants, the photolysis experiments and the computer simulation suggested this process to be the predominant one for diclofenac in the lake.

AB Micro/nanoplastics have raised worldwide concern with extensive research on its transfer, toxicity and removal. However, the primary environmental process-adsorption of nanoplastics has not been uncov-ered since the discovery of nanosized plastics. Here, we synthesized nanoscale polystyrene (PS) particles with mean diameter of similar to 40 nm to avoid unknown properties from purchased ones, and thoroughly investigated its adsorption towards two typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) with distinct characteristics, which are antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) and endocrine disruptor (bisphenol-A). Moreover, UV radiation is applied to simulate aging process in natural cases, and the carbonyl index derived from FTIR spectra increased clearly from 0.183 to 0.387. The adsorption capacity at equilibrium of CIP and BPA increased from 0.15 to 4.07 to 4.92 and 8.71 mg/g after weathering, respectively. Besides, the effect of environmental factors (pH, humic acid, salinity and cations) was also studied. Furthermore, electrosorption technology is applied to remove nanoplastics in solution for the first time, with the capacity of 0.707 g nano-polystyrene/g AC and 0.322 g aged-nano-polystyrene/g AC, suggesting that adsorption under electric field is presumably a feasible tertiary treatment method targeted at nano plastics in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

AB Tourist activity has a number of impacts on the destinations in which it takes place, among which are the environmental ones. A particular problem is the increase in water demand and wastewater production, which can compromise the balance of ecosystems. As many authors point out, there is a research gap in the comparative analysis between available water resources and the demand associated with tourism. In this respect, the main objective of this work is, on the one hand, to assess the water needs linked to the tourism industry and the capacity of natural resources to meet such a demand and, on the other hand, to estimate the economic cost of the water supply associated with the growing tourist demand in a territory, such as the island of Ibiza in Spain. It has been determined that the resources available are not sufficient to meet the water demand of the resident population at this destination, which is why it is necessary to resort to producing desalinated water. Therefore, the additional requirements associated with tourism must be met fully with desalinated water, which results in an increased cost of water management for the region. This paper also points at water losses in distribution networks and tourism seasonality as two phenomena that aggravate this issue.

AB We analyzed bat carcasses (Myotis lucifugus, M. sodalis, M. septentrionalis, and Eptesicus fuscus) from the northeastern United States for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The CECs detected most frequently in samples were PBDEs (100 %), salicylic acid (81 %), thiabendazole (50 %), and caffeine (23 %). Other compounds detected in at least 15 % of bat samples were digoxigenin, ibuprofen, warfarin, penicillin V, testosterone, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). The CECs present at the highest geometric mean wet weight concentrations in bat carcasses were bisphenol A (397 ng/g), I PDBE pound congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 (83.5 ng/g), triclosan (71.3 n/g), caffeine (68.3 ng/g), salicylic acid (66.4 ng/g), warfarin (57.6 ng/g), sulfathiazole (55.8 ng/g), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (53.8 ng/g), and DEET (37.2 ng/g). Bats frequently forage in aquatic and terrestrial habitats that may be subjected to discharges from wastewater-treatment plants, agricultural operations, and other point and nonpoint sources of contaminants. This study shows that some CECs are accumulating in the tissue of bats. We propose that CECs detected in bats have the potential to affect a number of physiological systems in bats including hibernation, immune function, and response to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease causing population-level impacts to bats.

AB Effective oil/water separation and removal of organic molecules from water are of worldwide importance for water source protection. Multifunctional sorbent materials with excellent sorption capacity, stability, and recyclability properties need to be developed. Here, flexible and multifunctional polymer/porous boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) membranes with high water permeability, exhibiting high effectiveness and stability in the purification of simulated wastewater tainted with either oil/water emulsion or organic molecules, are reported. Remarkably, the flexible nature of these porous membranes enables simplicity of operation for water remediation processing and ease of post-processing collection. The composite membrane also displays a remarkably high permeability of 8 x 10(4) L m m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), roughly three orders of magnitude higher than pure polymer, and excellent filter efficiencies for the pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin, chlortetracycline, and carbamazepine (up to 14.2 L g(-1) of BNNSs in the composite membrane for a concentration of 10 mg L-1 ciprofloxacin) and the dye methylene blue (up to 9.3 L g(-1) of BNNSs in the composite membrane at a concentration of 30 mg L-1). Exhausted membranes can be readily rejuvenated by simple washing with retention of their high-performance characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential efficacy and practicality of these membranes for water cleaning.

AB Increasing evidence indicates that pharmaceutical bioaccumulate in fish collected downstream from municipal wastewater effluent discharges. However, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation by other aquatic organisms, including primary producers (e.g., periphyton) and grazers (e.g., snails), are lacking in wadeable streams. Here, we examined environmental occurrence and bioaccumulation of a range of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern in surface water, a common snail (Planor-bid sp.) and periphyton from an effluent-dependent stream in central Texas, USA, during a historic drought, because such limited dilution and instream flows may represent worst-case exposure scenarios for aquatic life to pharmaceuticals. Water and tissue samples were liquid-liquid extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization. Target analytes included 21 pharmaceuticals across multiple drug classes and 2 pharmacologically active metabolites. Several pharmaceuticals were detected at up to 4.7 mu g kg(-1) in periphyton and up to 42 mu g kg(-1) in Planorbid sp. We then identified limitations of several bioconcentration factor and bioaccumulation factor models, developed for other invertebrates, to assist interpretation of such field results. Observations from the present study suggest that waterborne exposure to pharmaceuticals may be more important than dietary exposure for snails. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical method was developed and validated for the target screening of triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC) and its lesser and higher chlorinated congeners namely, 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (3-Cl-TCC) and 2,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (2-Cl-TCC) in river sediment. Sediment samples were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction and quantification and identification of target compounds were carried by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The overall method recoveries were 89% with relative standard deviations below 6%. Method detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 ng/g. The usefulness of the method was demonstrated on sediment samples collected downstream of three wastewater treatment plants in an attempt to provide with a set of occurrence data of these biocides in France and for a better understanding of their fate in river. Major results are the following: TCC, DCC and 3-Cl-TCC were ubiquitously detected demonstrating that these emerging contaminants have been probably overlooked in France. Reductive dechlorination of TCC into DCC was also ubiquitous but predominated in anoxic sediment. 3-Cl-TCC is probably more persistent than TCC and LC-HRMS enabled the detection and identification of a suite of other chlorinated biocides in river sediment.

AB Thiamphenicol and florfenicol are two phenicol antibiotics widely used in aquaculture and are ubiquitous as micropollutants in surface waters. The present study investigated their photodegradation kinetics, hydroxyl-radical ((OH)-O-.) oxidation reactivities and products. Firstly, the photolytic kinetics of the phenicols in pure water was studied as a function of initial concentrations (C-0) under UV-vis irradiation (lambda > 200 nm). It was found that the kinetics was influenced by C-0. A linear plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constant vs C-0 was observed with a negative slope. Secondly, the reaction between the phenicol antibiotics and (OH)-O-. was examined with a competition kinetic method under simulated solar irradiation (lambda > 290 nm), which quantified their bimolecular reaction rate constants of (2.13 +/- 0.02) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and (1.82 +/- 0.10) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for thiamphenicol and florfenicol, respectively. Then the corresponding (OH)-O-. oxidated half-lives in sunlit surface waters were calculated to be 90.5-106.1 h. Some main intermediates were formed from the reaction, which suggested that the two phenicols underwent hydroxylation, oxygenation and dehydrogenation when (OH)-O-. existed. These results are of importance to assess the phenicol persistence in wastewater treatment and sunlit surface waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID METHANOGENIC ACTIVITY
AB The success of the newly developed methodology to evaluate anaerobic biodegradability of organic compounds using the Micro Oxymax respirometer and TOC analyzer made this method potentially useful for a variety of investigations. Regarding the many parameters measured during the experiment in the liquid and gas phases, the method provides good insight into the kinetics of anaerobic process and accurate mass balance, which could be obtained at any time during the assay. This method was used for determining of anaerobic biodegradability of the waste from the pharmaceutical industry-waste fermentation broth, and for the proposal of operational parameters for the start-up of the continuous process. The tests were performed in 250 ml vials at a wide range of initial substrate loading ratios (0.05-4.6 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1)). The average biodegradability of the substrate was 92% at initial loading ratios between 0.05 and 1.7 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1). At higher initial loading ratios 2,3 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1) and more, the inhibition of anaerobic biodegradation was detected. Retention times needed for a 70% and 85% degradation efficiency were evaluated and used as a proposal for the starting-up substrate loading rate of the continuous reactor operation. An optimum initial substrate mass concentration without an inhibition effect was estimated and the fraction of methane gas in produced biogas was calculated for each initial loading.

AB The present work focused on the use of high-silica commercial zeolites as sorbent media for pharmaceuticals in an aqueous matrix. As drug probes, ketoprofen, hydrochlorothiazide, and atenolol were selected, because of their occurrence in surface waters and effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals adsorption was evaluated for two Faujasite topology zeolites with Silica/Alumina Ratio 30 and 200. The selected zeolites were demonstrated to be efficient sorbents towards all investigated pharmaceuticals, thanks to their high saturation capacities (from 12 to 32% w/w) and binding constants. These results were corroborated by thermal and structural analyses, which revealed that adsorption occurred inside zeolite's porosities, causing lattice modifications. Finally, zeolites have been tested as a pre-concentration media in the dispersive-solid phase extraction procedure. Recoveries higher than 95% were gained for ketoprofen and hydrochlorothiazide and approximately 85% for atenolol, at conditions that promoted the dissolution of the neutral solute into a phase mainly organic. The results were obtained by using a short contact time (5 min) and reduced volume of extraction (500 mu L), without halogenated solvents. These appealing features make the proposed procedure a cost and time saving method for sample enrichment as well as for the regeneration of exhausted sorbent, rather than the more energetically expensive thermal treatment.

AB Beta adrenergic antagonists like carvedilol are typical environmental pollutants detected in wastewater and surface water. Human metabolism of carvedilol is well investigated, while its environmental fates are still unknown. In recent years, there have been appearing reports on high toxicity of beta-blockers toward aquatic organisms. In this paper the ability of the filamentous fungus C echinulata to eliminate the beta-blocker has been described for the first time. An 83% loss of carvedilol was observed after 120 h incubation of the tested fungus with the compound, where hydroxylated carvedilol metabolites were identified as the major biotransformation products. Carvedilol degradation by C. echinulata was proceeded by hydroxylation and conjugation reactions similar to its mammalian metabolism. Glucose conjugate was found in the fungi cultures, whereas glucuronide conjugates were detected in mammals. The impact of carvedilol on the functionality of fungal cells was also evaluated. A 2-fold decrease in the PC/PE ratio was noticed in the C. echinulata cell membrane after the exposition to carvedilol compared to control mycelium incubated without the beta-blocker. The change can denote perturbation of fungal cell membrane integration by carvedilol. Moreover, 2.8-fold lower toxicity of postcultures supernatants toward D. magna were shown in contrast to abiotic control. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eight commercially available powdered activated carbons (PAC) were examined regarding organic micro-pollutant (OMP) removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. PAC characteristic numbers such as B.E.T. surface, iodine number and nitrobenzene number were checked for their potential to predict the OMP removal of the PAC products. Furthermore, the PAC-induced removal of UV254 (nm) absorption (UVA(254)) in WWTP effluent was determined and also correlated with OMP removal. None of the PAC characteristic numbers can satisfactorily describe OMP removal and accordingly, these characteristics have little informative value on the reduction of OMP concentrations in WWTP effluent. In contrast, UVA(254) removal and OMP removal correlate well for carbamazepine, diclofenac, and several iodinated x-ray contrast media. Also, UVA(254) removal can roughly describe the average OMP removal of all measured OMP, and can accordingly predict PAC performance in OMP removal. We therefore suggest UVA(254) as a handy indicator for the approximation of OMP removal in practical applications where direct OMP concentration quantification is not always available. In continuous operation of large-scale plants, this approach allows for the efficient adjustment of PAC dosing to UVA(254), in order to ensure reliable OMP removal whilst minimizing PAC consumption.

AB Naproxen and bezafibrate fall into the category of pharmaceuticals that have been widely detected in the aquatic environment, and one of the major sources is the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants. This study investigated the sorption and degradation kinetics of naproxen and bezafibrate in the presence of activated sludge under aerobic conditions. Experimental results indicated that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by activated sludge was rapid, and the relative adsorbabilities of the two-target compounds were based on their log K-ow and pK(a) values. The adsorption data could be well interpreted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The degradation process could be described by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, whereas the pseudo-second-order kinetics were also well suited to describe the degradation process of the selected compounds at low concentrations. Bezafibrate was more easily degraded by activated sludge compared with naproxen. The spiked concentration of the two-target compounds was negatively correlated with k(1) and k(2s), indicating that the substrate inhibition effect occurred at the range of studied concentrations. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) did not associate with naproxen degradation; thus, COD is not an alternative method that could be applied to investigate natural organic matter's impact on degradation of pharmaceuticals by activated sludge.

AB Carbon nanotube-supported manganese oxides (MnOx/MWCNT) were used as catalysts to assist ozone in degrading ciprofloxacin in water. Manganese oxides were successfully loaded on multi-walled carbon nanotube surfaces by simply impregnating the carbon nanotube with permanganate solution. The catalytic activities of MnOx/MWCNT in ciprofloxacin ozonation, including degradation, mineralization effectiveness, and antibacterial activity change, were investigated. The presence of MnOx/MWCNT significantly elevated the degradation and mineralization efficiency of ozone on ciprofloxacin. The microbiological assay with a reference Escherichia coli strain indicated that ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT results in more effective antibacterial activity inhibition of ciprofloxacin than that in ozonation alone. The effects of catalyst dose, initial ciprofloxacin concentration, and initial pH conditions on ciprofloxacin ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT were surveyed. Electron spin resonance trapping was applied to assess the role of MnOx/MWCNT in generating hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) during ozonation. Stronger 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide-OH signals were observed in the ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT compared with those in ozonation alone, indicating that MnOx/MWCNT promoted the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The degradation of ciprofloxacin was studied in drinking water and wastewater process samples to gauge the potential effects of water background matrix on MnOx/MWCNT catalytic ozonation.

AB The challenges encountered in solid-liquid separation hinder the wide applications of carbon nanotube adsorbents. To overcome this problem, MnFe2O4/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs) that combined the satisfactory adsorption properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with the magnetic separation of nanoparticles (MnFe2O4) was developed. MMWCNTs with a size of 10-50 nm exhibited remarkable magnetic separability (10.8 emu/g) and high adsorption capacity (q(m) = 494.91 mg/g, 308 K). Batch experiments to study the effect of pH on tetracycline (TC) adsorption showed that when the TC concentration was less than 80 mg L-1, the MMWCNTs could effectively adsorb TC in the pH range of 2-10, with a removal efficiency greater than 80%. The well fitted pseudo-second-order dynamic adsorption model and Langmuir isotherm indicated that the TC adsorption onto MMWCNTs mainly involved chemical and monolayer adsorption. Since the TC adsorption process was endothermic, increasing temperature could favor TC removal. Besides, after six cycles of regeneration with the NaOH solution, the removal efficiency could be maintained at 70% of the original, which indicated that the MMWCNTs had an excellent regeneration performance. At the same time, the results of our research showed that MMCWNT could not only be used as a good adsorbent for TC treatment, but also could be applied to other types of wastewater treatment.

AB The diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) passive sampling technique has been increasingly used to provide time-weighted average concentrations of the biorelevant fraction of organic contaminants in waters, with high spatial and temporal resolutions at low cost. This study was tested for the effects of biofouling and compound degradation/loss during sample handling/storage on the DGT measurement of a range of emerging organic pollutants. Biofouling was tested using biofilms collected from the influent and effluent of a typical urban wastewater treatment plant. Most (85%) target compounds showed no detectable effect on the DGT measurement when 8-and 15-day biofouled membrane filters were used. Four storage methods were designed to test for within-sampler degradation/loss for up to 2 months. Intact samplers can be simply stored in polyethylene bags at ambient temperature (18-26 degrees C) with most compounds stable (mass loss <20%) for at least 1 week. Keeping intact samplers at 4 degrees C or binding gels in solvent gave good recoveries, with most chemicals being stable for up to 2 months, although the best results were obtained when binding gels were kept in solvent at 4 degrees C. Recommendations are made for sample handling and storage of DGT samplers used for determination of trace organics in monitoring and surveillance campaigns.

AB A nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction was proposed to synthesize porous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to avoid their aggregation in solution. Hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs-OH) were reacted with different concentrations of rigid decafluorobiphenyl (DFB) to form the different CNTs-based adsorbents (CNT-DFB0.9, CNT-DFB1.8, CNT-DFB2.7 and CNT-DFB3.6). Among them, CNT-DFB1.8 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for carbamazepine (CBZ) and tetracycline (TC) due to its higher specific surface area and pore volume than powdered CNTs. The proposed reaction was verified and the textural properties of the CNT-DFB adsorbent were characterized. The CNT-DFB1.8 adsorbent exhibited faster adsorption for CBZ than TC, and the maximum adsorption capacities for CBZ and TC were 403.0 and 456.5 mu mol/g respectively, according to the Langmuir fitting. With the increase of solution pH, TC adsorption on CNT-DFB1.8 decreased while CBZ adsorption increased. In addition, a simple thermal method was applied to regenerate the spent CNT-DFB1.8 by heating in air at 400 degrees C, and the adsorption capacity changed little in the five adsorption cycles. This study provided a novel method to increase the dispersion of CNTs in the prepared adsorbent, showing the potential application for the removal of pharmaceuticals in water or wastewater treatment.

AB The co-exposure to UV irradiation and free chlorine may occur in certain drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. This study investigated the effects of simultaneous low pressure ultraviolet (LPUV) irradiation and free chlorination on the formation of chloroform from triclosan which is a commonly used antibacterial agent. Different treatment systems (i.e., combined UV/chlorine, UV alone, and chlorine alone) were applied to examine the degradation of triclosan and formation of chloroform. The fate of representative intermediates, including chlorinated triclosan, dechlorinated triclosan intermediates and 2,4-dichlorophenol, were tracked to deduce the effect of combined UV/chlorine on the transformation of chloroform formation precursors. The relation between intermediates degradation and chloroform formation was investigated in depth by conducting stepwise experiments with UV and chlorine in different sequences. Results indicate that the combined UV/chlorine notably enhanced the chloroform formation from triclosan. From the reaction mechanism perspective the combined UV/chlorine, where the direct photolysis may play an important role, could accelerate the decay of intermediates and facilitate the generation of productive chloroform precursors. The radicals had modest influence on the degradation of triclosan and intermediates and partly hindered the formation of chloroform. These results emphasize the necessity of considering disinfection by-products formation in the application of combined UV/chlorine technology during water treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical compound possessing eco-toxicological effects in the aqueous system have been a growing concern over the few decades. The present work investigates the use of low cost mung bean husk (MBH), an agriculturalwaste, for the preparation of superheated steam activated carbon towards removal of ranitidine hydrochloride (RH) from synthetic wastewater. The adsorbent was examined as a function of dosage (0.010-1 g), pH (2-12), agitation (40-120 rpm) and temperature (303-318 K) for the optimization of operational parameters. The experimental equilibrium data were evaluated by non linear Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Redlich-Peterson models. The Sips model was found to express high level of agreement with experimental data. The maximum sorption of 100 ppm RH onto MBH derived steam activated carbon (MBH-SAC) was estimated to be 99.16% at 298 K. The kinetic study conducted at four temperatures indicates that the adsorption process follows the fractionary order kinetics. A negative value (-11.307 kJ mol (1)) of enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) suggests that the adsorption process was exothermic. Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees) confirms that the reaction of the adsorption process was spontaneous and feasible in nature. The results suggest that MBH-AC can be used as an efficient and low cost adsorbent for the removal of RH from aqueous solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chlortetracycline (CTC) is a hazardous material in aquatic environments. This study was focused on optimization of photocatalytic ozonation processes for removal of CTC from wastewater at pH 2.2 and 7.0. In this study, the tested processes for CTC removal were arranged from the least efficient to the most efficient as: UV, UV/TiO2, O-3, O-3/UV and O-3/UV/TiO2. Ozonation efficiency was due to ozone affinity for electron-rich sites on the CTC molecule. In the O-3/UV and O-3/UV/TiO2 processes, efficiency was increased by the photolysis of CTC and generation of (OH)-O-center dot. At pH 7.0, all the processes were more efficient for CTC degradation than at pH 2.2 due to CTC speciation, ozone decay to (OH)-O-center dot and the attractions between ionized CTC and TiO2 particles. UV/O-3 at pH 7.0 showed an additive effect while other combination processes showed a synergistic effect that resulted in higher rates of reactions than the sums of individual reaction rates. The TOC removal ranged from 8% to 41% after one hour of reaction, with the above-mentioned order of efficiency. The biodegradability increased rapidly during the early minutes of the reaction. A reaction time of 10-15 min was sufficient for near maximum biodegradability, making these processes good pretreatments for the biological processes.

AB Common wastewater treatment plants often do not eliminate endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Aqueous solutions of three EDCs were treated with an enhanced corona discharge technology. The three EDCs were clofibric acid, a blood lipid regulator, carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug, and iopromide, a contrast media. To simulate real conditions, EDC solutions containing landfill leachate were also used. In our setup, two barrier electrodes provided an atmospheric pressure corona discharge over a thin water film, in which the counter-electrode was submerged. Clofibric acid, carbamazepine, and iopromide were effectively removed from a single solution. After a treatment of 15 min, there were no traces of iopromide estrogen activity either as a single substance or as degradation products when using an E-Screen Assay. Continuous treatment was compared with pulsed treatment using carbamazepine solutions mixed with pretreated landfill leachate. Best degradation results were achieved with a 500 W continuous duty cycle treatment. Counter-electrodes from materials such as boron doped diamond (BDD), titanium iridium oxide, and iron were investigated for their influences on the process effectivity. Significant improvements were achieved by using an enclosed reactor, BDD electrodes, and circulating only a fresh air or argon/air mixture as cooling gas through the barrier electrodes.

AB Antibiotics in water and wastewater have been determined extensively. The treatment of antibiotics in water needs evaluation of possible harmful effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper presents the toxicity evaluation of antibiotics after their treatment with ferrate (VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)) in water. The antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ERY), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TET), oxytetracycline (OXY), and trimethoprim (TMP)) were treated at pH 8.0 by applying two concentrations of Fe(VI) to have molar ratios of 5:1 and 10:1 ([Fe(VI)]:[antibiotic]). Under the studied conditions, incomplete removal of antibiotics was observed, suggesting that the treated solutions contained parent antibiotics and their transformation products. The toxicity of antibiotics without Fe(VI) treatment was tested against freshwater green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata and cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, which were determined to be generally sensitive to antibiotics, with EC50 < 1.0 mg/L. The toxicity of Fe(VI) treated solution was tested against R. subcapitata. Results found no toxicity for the treated solutions of OFL, CIP, and OXY. However, SMX, ERY, and TET remained toxic after Fe(VI) treatment (i.e., more than 75% growth inhibition of R. subcapitata). Results demonstrated that R. subcapitata may be applied to test the toxicity of antibiotics after oxidative treatments. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics (plastic particles < 5 mm) is a pollution of growing concern. Microplastic pollution is a complex issue that requires systematic attempts to provide an overview and avoid management solutions that have marginal effects or only move the pollution problem. Substance flow analysis (SFA) has been proposed as a useful tool to receive such an overview and has been put forward as valuable for substance management. However, as the research on microplastics has only emerged recently, detailed and reliable SFAs are difficult to perform. In this study, we use three SFA studies for three pollutants (cadmium, copper and pharmaceuticals) to compare flows and strategies to control the flows. This in order to seek guidance for microplastic management and evaluate potential strategies for controlling microplastics. The analysis shows that there has been rigorous control on different levels to abate pollution from cadmium, copper and pharmaceuticals, but where in the system the major control measures have been carried out differ. For microplastics, there are many potential solutions, both in terms of preventive actions and treatment depending on the type of source. When forming management plans for microplastics, the responsibility for each measure and the impact on the whole urban system should be taken into consideration as well as which receiving compartments are particularly valuable and should be avoided.

AB The pollution of pharmaceuticals has attracted a lot of concerns during recent years. The goal of this study was to identify targets of ecological concern considering human use pharmaceuticals marketed in China. We constructed a database for 593 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) by collecting their information on use and emission (e.g. production, human excretion, and removal by wastewater treatment) to calculated predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) by using an adapted European Medicines Agency method. PECs were comparable to the reported measurements for most APIs, demonstrating that the adapted method is reliable for the prioritization practice. Then PECs were compared to toxicity thresholds of three aquatic taxa (algae, daphnia, and fish). As a result, a total of 31 APIs, which were potentially risky and should be taken into consideration in future studies, were identified. Three APIs would pose a high risk with risk quotient (RQ) greater than 10. Six APIs were identified with moderate risks (1 < RQ < 10), and four of them were not reported before: rifaximin, griseofulvin, amikacin, and niclosamide. Of the 22 APIs with low risks (0.1 < RQ < 1), 17 have never been monitored previously in China and even worldwide. This study has yielded some probable antibiotics that should be considered as monitoring targets in China in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The complex nature of diclofenac limits its biological degradation, posing a serious threat to aquatic organisms. Our present work aims to eliminate diclofenac from wastewater through photocatalytic degradation using TiO2-SnO2 mixed-oxide catalysts under various operating conditions such as catalyst loading, initial diclofenac concentration and initial pH. Different molar ratios of Ti-Sn (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1) were prepared by the hydrothermal method and were characterized. The results indicated that addition of Sn in small quantity enhances the catalytic activity of TiO2. Energy Band gap of the TiO2-SnO2 catalysts was found to increase with an increase in Tin content. TiO2-SnO2 catalyst with a molar ratio of 20:1 was found to be the most effective when compared to other catalysts. The results suggested that initial drug concentration of 20 mg/L, catalyst loading of 0.8 g/L and pH 5 were the optimum operating conditions for complete degradation of diclofenac. Also, the TiO2-SnO2 catalyst was effective in complete mineralization of diclofenac with a maximum total organic carbon removal of 90% achieved under ultraviolet irradiation. The repeatability and stability results showed that the TiO2-SnO2 catalyst exhibited an excellent repeatability and better stability over the repeated reaction cycles. The photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac resulted in several photoproducts, which were identified through LC-MS.

AB The efficiency of adsorption of two photosensitive fluoroquinolones; Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Moxilloxacin (MOX), on the surface of synthesized magnetite/pectin nanoparticles (MPNPs) and magnetite/silica/pectin nanoparticles (MSPNPs) was studied from aqueous solution under varying experimental conditions. A validated spectrofluorimetric assay was developed for monitoring of CIP and MOX intact drugs and their photodegraded molecules concentrations. To optimize the working conditions which influence the drugs sorption, a 2(4) full factorial experimental design was implemented. The maximum percentage of removal was attained as 89% (type of sorbent = MSPNPs, pH = 7.0, initial drug concentration = 5 mg/L, and contact time = 30 min). The studied factors-pH, NPs loading initial drug concentration, and contact time-were significant for both types of sorbents. The most significant variable was pH, and the highest CIP and MOX adsorption occurred at pH = 7.0. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips equations, and the Sips model showed the best fit with equilibrium isotherm data. Furthermore, pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were used to analyze sorption kinetics, and it was found that adsorption of the investigated fluoroquinolones followed pseudo second-order kinetics. We believe that our synthesized NPs can be used as effective adsorbents for fluoroquinolones and their photodegraded molecules removal from aqueous solutions.

AB Antibiotics existing in wastewaters must be degraded to eliminate its antibacterial activity before discharging into the environment. Electrochemical reduction by continuous electrons supply can degrade various refractory pollutants, however, the information about the feasibility and characterization of the cathodic degradation of nitrofurans antibiotic furazolidone (FZD) is scarce. Here, we investigated the degradation of FZD using a poised cathode electrochemical reactor. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) preliminarily proved the feasibility of FZD degradation on cathode. In contrast to the different buffer solutions concentrations, buffer types, and initial FZD concentrations which only had obvious impact on the FZD degradation efficiency, different cathode potentials had significant effects both on the FZD degradation efficiency and degradation products composition. Catholyte PBS could be replaced by Na2CO3-NaHCO3 and NaCl buffer solution for the FZD degradation. The cathodic degradation pathway of FZD was proposed based on intermediate products analysis. When the cathode potential was lower than 0.75 V, both the furan ring and oxazole ring of FZD were destroyed to generate linear chain products after N-N bond disconnection, suggesting that the high toxic biological metabolite of FZD, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ) could be detoxified by cathodic degradation. This study suggests that the electrochemical reduction could serve as a potential strategy for the treatment of FZD and AOZ containing wastewater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During wastewater treatment, many organic micropollutants undergo microbially mediated reactions resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs). Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides. The results showed that the complementary use of the target and non-target screening methods allowed for a more comprehensive interpretation of the TPs generated than either would have provided individually.

AB To compare the performance and antibiotic-resistance character in different process configurations under different levels of antibiotics, anoxic/oxic-membrane bioreactors (MBR) 1#, MBR2# and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were operated with identical operating parameters. MBR1# and SBR were operated under high and increasing levels of antibiotics, MBR2# received constant and low concentration of antibiotics. Microbiological community and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated using 16S rDNA gene high-throughput sequencing and qPCR. More than 90% of penicillin and chlortetracycline were removed due to strong hydrolysis, followed by sulfamethoxazole (69.27%-86.25%) through biodegradation and norfloxacin (28.66%-53.86%) through adsorption. Process configuration affected total nitrogen removal more, while antibiotics concentration affected total phosphorus removal more. MBR1# outperformed SBR in reducing sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and ARGs due to the retention effect of the membrane module. Retention efficiency of ARGs in MBRs increased along the operation. Compared to the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number before antibiotics addition, the OTU number in MBR1# and SBR decreased by 23.7% and 28.7%, while that in MBR2# kept relatively stable. Process configuration contributed to higher dissimilarity of microbial community than antibiotics concentration. The research provides an insight into the influence factors of antibiotics-containing wastewater treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutically active compounds, emerging extensively in ecosystems as pollutants, have become an important environmental and public health issue, since they can contaminate drinking water and pose threats to wildlife and human health. As a result, efforts should be made to develop methods to inactivate or eliminate this class of substance in the environment.
   RESULTS: The photocatalytic degradation of psychoactive drug Fluvoxamine has been investigated. In the case of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation, the effect of TiO2 P25 concentration (0.1-1 g L-1), initial concentration of H2O2 (0.25-0.2 g L-1) and Fe3+ (0.00175-0.014 g L-1) and pH of the solution on initial reaction rates were evaluated, while for homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation the effect of the amount of H2O2 (0.25-0.2 g L-1) and Fe3+ (0.00175-0.014 g L-1) were investigated. In addition, the conversion of the heteroatoms in the FVX molecule to inorganic ions (NO3-, NH4+, F-) during the photocatalytic process has been observed and phytotoxicity testing, using three plant species, was carried out in order to examine the effect of photocatalytic oxidation on the toxicity of FVX.
   CONCLUSION: According to the results presented in this study, both heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation is an efficient methodology for FVX degradation. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in the natural water sources has been reported as early as in the year 1980. Until now, the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment has been frequently reported in the literature. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that these contaminants have posed a threat to both humans and ecosystems. In this regard, the present review paper seeks to offer an overview of this environmental issue of pharmaceutical pollution where the subject matters to be reviewed include the effects, sources and mitigation strategies of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Besides, a review of the fundamentals and mechanisms of heterogeneous photocatalysis technology is also presented in this paper. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a rapidly expanding technology which has been extensively investigated and applied in wastewater treatment for the remediation of persistent pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds during the last decade. Furthermore, the ideal photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO2), which can collaborate and perform well in the photocatalysis treatment process, is also discussed. The advantages and limitations associated with the application of this treatment method are summarized and discussed in details. Finally, this review paper focuses on the future trend of the photocatalysis technology and identifies the barriers and lacking parts which need to be resolved in the near future.

AB For photocatalytic degradation of organic pharmaceutical pollutants in wastewater, an important limitation is low photonic efficiency. To solve this problem, using periodic illumination is a good option. However, due to the nature of widely applied traditional mercury lamp, which cannot be turned on and off efficiently, the study of periodic illumination was limited. In this research, ultraviolet-A/light emitting diode (UVA/LED) lamp was introduced and a TiO2/UVA/LED photocatalytic system was setup for acetaminophen (Ace) degradation study. The background study was conducted, which included the effects of H2O2, humic acid and bicarbonate ion concentrations. Different periodic pulse frequencies were applied, results in this study shows that smallest duty cycle (0.2) and shortest cycle time (20 ms) gave the highest photonic efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of Ace in the studied range. The effect of additional H2O2 was also studied. H2O2 added into the heterogeneous reaction system enhanced both decomposition rate and photonic efficiency under both continuous illumination mode and periodic illumination mode. The enhancement effect of H2O2, however, was found more obvious for controlled periodic illumination, especially for small duty cycles and short cycle times. In addition, by the addition of H2O2, the mineralization of Ace was accelerated probably due to the increase of hydroxyl radical concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Production in the pharmaceutical industry has increased and along with it, the amount of wastewater of various characteristics and contaminant concentrations. The main chemicals in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants-such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)-and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced in the amphipod Hyalella azteca by the effluent from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. The median lethal concentration (72 h-LC50) was determined and H. azteca were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (0.0732 %) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, and biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated [hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the superoxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)]. Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P < 0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC in H. azteca at all exposure times. Antioxidant enzymes activity SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to the control group. In conclusion, the industrial effluent analyzed in the present study contains NSAIDs and NaClO, and induces oxidative stress in H. azteca.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING

DE Diclofenac; Photoelectrocatalysis; Mechanism; Kinetics; Reactive species
AB Diclofenac is a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which has been widely used in clinic that leads to the frequently detection in the freshwater bodies. In the present study, we explored the visible-light-driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) degradation of diclofenac solution by the as-fabricated N, STiO2/TiO2 NTs photoelectrode. Meanwhile, the PEC degradation performance and kinetics were also investigated. It was found that 73.3% of diclofenac could be degraded within 12 h visible light irradiation with the help of external potential (+ 0.4V vs SCE). Additionally, the PEC processes followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model, in which the highest apparent rate constant of 0.101 h (1) could be achieved. Moreover, the further study of reactive species indicated that both H2O2 and center dot OH radicals were responsible for the major degradation of diclofenac molecule. Besides, five degradation intermediates were elucidated by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Based on these results, three tentative pathways for the PEC degradation of diclofenac solution were proposed, for example hydroxylation addition to parent pharmaceuticals, C-N cleavage of side chain from the diclofenac attacked by photogenerated holes and directly decarboxylation, subsequently dechlorination and oxidation processes. This study provides an effective strategy for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater or freshwater bodies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this series of studies was to identify commercial chemicals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (PB) and that were not being considered in, current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. In this,study, we focus on chemicals that are not on commercial chemical lists such as U.S. EPA's Inventory Update Rule but may be found as byproducts or impurities in commercial chemicals or are likely transformation products from commercial chemical use. We evaluated the 610 chemicals from our earlier publication as well as high production volume chemicals and, identified 320 chemicals (39 byproducts and impurities, and 281. transformation products). that could be potential PB chemicals. Four examples are discussed in detail; these chemicals had a fair amount of information on the commercial synthesis and byproducts and impurities that might be found in the commercial product. Unfortunately for many of the 610 chemicals, as well as the transformation products, little or no information was available. Use of computer-aided software to predict the transformation. pathways in combination., with the biodegradation rules of thumb. and some basic organic chemistry has allowed 281 potential PB transformation products to be suggested for some of the 610 commercial chemicals; more PB transformation products were:not selected, since microbial, degradation often results in less persistent and less bioaccumulative metabolites.

AB N-substituted aromatics are important priority pollutants entering the environment primarily through anthropogenic activities associated with the industrial production of dyes, explosives, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, Anaerobic treatment of wastewaters discharged by these industries could potentially be problematical as a result of the high toxicity of N-substituted aromatics. The objective of this study was to examine the structure-toxicity relationships of N-substituted aromatic compounds to acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria, The toxicity was assayed in serum flasks by measuring methane production in granular sludge, Unacclimated cultures were used to minimize the biotransformation of the toxic organic chemicals during the test. The nature and the degree of the aromatic substitution were observed to have a profound effect on the toxicity of the test compound. Nitroaromatic compounds were, on the average, over 500-fold more toxic than their corresponding aromatic amines. Considering the facile reduction of nitro groups by anaerobic microorganisms, a dramatic detoxification of nitroaromatics towards methanogens can be expected to occur during anaerobic wastewater treatment. While the toxicity exerted by the N-substituted aromatic compounds was closely correlated with compound apolarity (log P), it was observed that at any given log P, N-substituted phenols had a toxicity that was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorophenols and alkylphenols. This indicates that toxicity due to the chemical reactivity of nitroaromatics is much more important than partitioning effects in bacterial membranes.

AB In the past few decades, new contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the air, water, and soil have gained significant attention due to their adverse impact on human health and the environment. The sources of CECs have been identified in different forms from domestic and industrial activities such as personal care products and pharmaceuticals. It has been established that aqueous medium plays a major role in the dissemination of various contaminants, like drinking water, reservoirs, lakes, rivers and waste with water medium. There remains inadequate technology for the treatment of CECs in the wastewater systems. Though different techniques have advanced for the treatment of CECs, they still pose a severe threat to human health and disturb the ecological balance. In this review, the characteristics, recent technologies, risk assessment and management of CECs have been discussed. The primary aim is to highlight the new innovative and cost-effective technologies for the remediations of CECs in all forms. Biochar is readily and economically available in abundance and an economical adsorbent with 100% adsorptive removal for H2PO4- . The bibliometric analysis also performed to understand the emerging research trends on the treatment techniques, which can help in developing a guiding pathway to modern research in academia and industry.

AB The adverse effects of diclofenac (DCF) on ecosystems and human health have induced increasing in-terest in its elimination in environment. DCF can be removed to some extent by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes during wastewater treatment process. However, the actual roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of DCF remain unclear. In this study, batch experiments were conducted to explore the biological transformation of DCF in enriched nitrifying sludge (NS), heterotrophic sludge (HS) and activated sludge (AS) systems. DCF was removed three times faster in enriched NS than in HS. Three transformation pathways of DCF in enriched NS, HS, and AS were proposed and compared. Hydroxylation was the crucial transformation step in the three transformation pathways. A faster hydroxylation reaction contributed to the faster removal of DCF in enriched NS. More transformation products (TPs) and reaction types (i.e. reductive dechlorination, sulphidation and methylation reactions) were observed in HS. Furthermore, some TPs that were resistant to degrade in enriched NS, such as DCF-benzoic acid, could be further transformed in HS. Accordingly, enriched NS could remove DCF more rapidly while HS could further transform some TPs resistant to degrade in enriched NS. Nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes may cooperatively and rapidly eliminate not only DCF, but also its TPs. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decades, awareness regarding personal care products (PCP), i.e. synthetic organic chemicals frequently used in cosmetic and hygienic products, has become a forward-looking issue, due to their persistency in the environment and their potential multi-organ toxicity in both human and wildlife. Seafood is one of the most significant food commodities in the world and, certainly, one of the most prone to bioaccumulation of PCP, what can consequently lead to human exposure, especially for coastal population, where its consumption is more marked. The aim of this work was to evaluate the co-occurrence of musk fragrances and UV-filters in both seafood and macroalgae collected in different European hotspots (areas with high levels of pollution, highly populated and near wastewater treatment plants). Despite the fact that UV-filters were detected in three different kind of samples (mussel, mullet, and clam), in all cases they were below the limit of quantification. Galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) were the musk fragrances most frequently detected and quantified in samples from the European hotspots. Cashmeran (DPMI) was also detected in most samples but only quantified in two of them (flounder/herring and mullet). The highest levels of HHCB and AHTN were found in mussels from Po estuary.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals in our environment is a very important issue for environmental and health research. Although these substances have been detected in environmental compartments in low concentration until now, they will pose considerable environmental risk to ecosystems, animals and human due to their biological activity. Alternative plant based removal technologies that make use of some potential wetland species like Phragmites or Typha within traditional wastewater treatment plants have to be established to cope with this "new generation" of pollutants.
   We investigated uptake and translocation of diclofenac (1 mg l(-1)) in the macrophyte Typha latifolia L. during one week exposure in greenhouse experiments. Detoxification products and involved key enzymatic processes were identified. We also examined the oxidative stress induced by the treatment and the defense capacity of the plants.
   Rapid uptake and effective metabolism were observed, where glycoside and glutathione conjugates represent dominant metabolites. Up to seven-fold induction of glycosyltransferase activity was observed in roots, but not in shoots. Glutathione S-transferase activity was also induced, but to a lower extent. The activity changes of defense enzymes points to oxidative stress in the plants.
   Our results show that human pharmaceuticals can be metabolized by plants similar to xenobiotics, but that similarities to human metabolism are limited. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pilot-scale solar degradation of trimethoprim (TMP) in different water matrices (demineralized water: DW, simulated natural freshwater: SW; simulated wastewater: SWW; and real effluent: RE) was investigated in this study. DOC removal was lower in the case of SW compared to DW, which can be attributed to the presence of inorganic anions which may act as scavengers of the HO center dot. Furthermore, the presence of organic carbon and higher salt content in SWW and RE led to lower mineralization per dose of hydrogen peroxide compared to DW and SW. Toxicity assays in SWW and RE were also performed indicating that toxicity is attributed to the compounds present in RE and their by-products formed during solar Fenton treatment and not to the intermediates formed by the oxidation of TMP. A large number of compounds generated by the photocatalytic transformation of TMP were identified by UPLC-QToF/MS. The degradation pathway revealed differences among the four matrices; however hydroxylation, demethylation and cleavage reactions were observed in all matrices. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that TMP degradation products have been identified by adopting a solar Fenton process at a pilot-scale set-up, using four different aqueous matrices.

AB Aims: To investigate whether the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) communities of replicate nitrifying bioreactors (i) co-evolve or diverge over time and (ii) are stable or dynamic during periods of complete nitrification.
   Methods and Results: Three sequential batch reactors (SBR) were inoculated with sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, fed with ammonium- enriched tap water and operated in parallel for 134 days. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) demonstrated co-evolvement of the AOB communities over time. During start-up, temporary decreases in nitrification were noticed, and the AOB community rate of change values (Delta(t(week))) were medium to high (12-22%). During the adjacent period of complete nitrification, low AOB community dynamics were observed (Delta(t)(week) < 5%). Further pragmatic processing of the DGGE profiles revealed a high range-weighted richness and a medium functional organization of the AOB communities.
   Conclusions: After a start-up period, high functional stability and low dynamics of the AOB communities were observed. Deterministic rather than stochastic driving forces led to AOB community co-evolvement in the replicate SBR.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Replicates in identical set-ups are reproducible, and pragmatic processing of DGGE patterns is a straightforward tool to score and compare the functionality of the bacterial communities.

The present study has investigated a novel Graphitic Carbon Nitride/ Mesoporous Nano-Silica (g-C3N4/KCC-1) nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of PG in aqueous solutions. A facile method applied for catalyst synthesis in different condition, and it was structurally and morphologically characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) which showed successful synthesis of g-C3N4/KCC-1 nanocomposite. The degradation process was examined as a function of pH (3-11), catalyst dose (0.2-0.8 g/L), contact time (10-120 min) and initial PG concentration (10-100 mg/L) under UV radiation. The results demonstrated that maximum degradation of PG was 93.98% in optimized environmental conditions including pH: 7, nanocomposite dosage: 0.6 g/L, contact time: up to 120 min and initial PG concentration: 10 mg/L. Also, datasets were better explained by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model to defining the kinetic of PG degradation in examined conditions.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) to treat effluents from a fruit processing factory, for the removal of pesticides, on its own, and combined with other treatment technologies. The stability of the MBR was monitored by the parameters chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, total suspended solids (TSS) and permeability. The addition of pesticides was established to generate concentrations of 20 mu g.L-1 for 2,4-D, carbendazim and diuron, and 1.5 mu g.L-1 for atrazine in the bioreactor. The removal of pesticides by the MBR was evaluated by two experiments with variations in HDT (20 and 25 h) and operation of post-treatments with either activated carbon (AC), reverse osmosis (RO) or ozonation (O-3). The MBR demonstrated robustness and stability in maintaining the quality of the permeate even under high variations of COD and biomass content. However, the removal of the pesticides was only partial. Among the hybrid systems, comprising a combination of the MBR and a post-treatment, the MBR/AC and MBR/RO presented excellent results, proving to be efficient for pesticides removal. The MBR/O-3 system, however, did not perform as well as the others, which can be explained by the low ozone doses applied.

AB This study evaluated, through a central composite experimental design, the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) deposition, synthesized at different pH and silver concentration [Ag+], on the photocatalytic efficiency of self-assembled thin films (SATFs) of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and TiO2 over bezafibrate (BZF) drug. The SATFs were produced by dip coating on glass substrates using the layer-bylayer technique and were characterized by ultraviolet and visible absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with a field emission gun and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results revealed that the SATF that represents the optimum point of the central composite design (pH = 7.0 and [Ag+] = 0.46 mmol L-1) reduced the initial concentration of BZF by 81.4 %. The presence of AgNPs on the polyelectrolytes/TiO2 thin film was responsible for an increase of 64 % in its photocatalytic efficiency when compared to the film containing only polyelectrolytes and TiO2. Silver is present mostly in the form of nanoparticle agglomerates with sizes under 90 nm. Moreover, the optimized SATF showed no reduction in its photocatalytic efficiency after four reuse cycles. Finally, the data set showed that the SATFs of this work possess a high potential for photo-oxidation, which makes them attractive for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.

AB BiOBr-based composite photocatalysts had attracted extensive attention for efficient photocatalytic degradation aqueous organic pollutants in the past decade. However, the catalysis ability of photocatalyst is greatly limited by their intrinsic high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers. Herein, we solve this problem by constructing a novel 2D/3D Bi5O7Br/BiOBr heterojunction photocatalyst that was prepared via one-step facile hydrolysis process. The pure Bi5O7Br and pure BiOBr photocatalysts were also obtained by only adjusting the pH value of the mixed solution. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical and electric property analysis and etc. The results suggested that 2D Bi5O7Br nanosheets tightly attached to the surface of BiOBr 3D structure with nanoflakes self-assembled microsphere, which could increase the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated charges. Furthermore, the 2D/3D Bi5O7Br/BiOBr heterojunction exhibited superior visible light photocatalytic performance for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation than pure BiOBr and pure Bi5O7Br, which owing to the enhanced separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. At last, the underlying photocatalytic mechanism is elucidated based on the band structure and radical scavenging experiments. This work provided a feasible design idea to one-step construct 2D/3D nanocomposite for pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is an antimicrobial compound widely used in personal care products such as soaps, toothpaste, and shampoo. This agent is incompletely removed by wastewater treatment and represents an environmental contaminant. Recent studies have shown that TCC is associated with some endocrine disruptions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if TCC exposure during critical periods of development (gestation and lactation) could lead to adverse effects on reproductive and behavior parameters of female offspring. Pregnant female Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8-11/group): Control; TCC 0.3 mg/kg (TCC 0.3); TCC 1.5 mg/kg; TCC 3.0 mg/kg (TCC 3.0); and treated daily by oral gavage from gestational day 0 to lactational day 21. The female pups (F1 generation) were weaned on post-natal day 21 and included in the study. No litter-mates were used for the same group. There was a decrease in estradiol levels in the TCC 0.3 and TCC 3.0 groups. Moreover, there was a decrease in progesterone levels and an increase in pre-implantation loss in the TCC 3.0 group in adulthood. It is suggested, in this study, that the decrease in progesterone biosynthesis could interfere with implantation process. The exposure window to TCC is an important factor, as we found alterations only in the offspring.

AB In this study, a novel Fe-Mn binary oxide (FMBO), which combined the oxidation capability of iron and manganese oxides, was constructed to remove sulfamethoxazole (SMX) effectively using the simultaneous co-precipitation and oxidation methods, and the reaction products were probed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Particularly, FMBO-mediated transformation mechanisms of SMX were explored using radical scavengers and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Results indicated that the best removal efficiency was obtained at a pH of 4.0, with the H2O2 of 6.0mmol/L and the FMBO dosage of 2.0g/L, giving 97.6% removal of 10mg/L SMX within 60min. More importantly, we found that the hydroxyl (center dot OH) radicals generated by FMBO through Fenton-like reaction were responsible for the SMX oxidation. EPR studies were confirmed that the peak intensities of hydroxyl adduct decreased remarkably with increasing pH values. Moreover, the four SMX degradation intermediate products were detected by LC/MS and a reaction pathway for the possible mineralization of SMX, with center dot OH radicals as the main oxidant, was proposed. These findings provide a novel insight into the removal of SMX by FMBO-mediated radical reactions in aquatic environments. Moreover, this research suggested that FMBO can act as an efficient catalyst to remove SMX in hospital wastewater.

AB Antibiotic concentrations in surface waters far exceed the pollution limit due to the abuse of pharmaceuticals, resulting in an urgent need for an approach with potential efficiency, sustainability and eco-friendliness to remove antibiotic pollutants. A novel biochar-based nanomaterial was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis and was investigated for its removal potential for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) from both artificial and real wastewater. The associative facilitation between biochar and g-MoS2 nano-sheets was proposed, revealing the favorable surface structures and adsorption properties of the composite. The related adsorption kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics were studied by several models with adsorption experimental data, turning out that biochar decorated by g-MoS2 exhibited optimum TC removal with adsorption capacity up to 249.45 mg/g at 298 K. The adsorption behavior of TC molecules on g-MoS2 BC can be interpreted well by three-step process, and it is dominated by several mechanisms containing pore-filling, electrostatic force, hydrogen bond and pi-pi interaction. In addition, the cost-effective g-MoS2-BC nanocomposites demonstrated excellent adsorption and recycling performance in TC-contaminated river water, which might provide the underlying insights needed to guide the design of promising approach for contaminant removal on a large scale in practical application.

AB Since the detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in various environmental media, research has explored the potential uptake and toxicity of these chemicals to species inhabiting these matrices. Specifically, pharmaceuticals, including the antiepileptic API carbamazepine (CBZ), are taken up from soil by a range of plants. Many short-term studies have also suggested that certain APIs induce toxicity in plants. However, the effects of APIs on fruiting plants remain relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the uptake, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of CBZ in Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) from seed to full maturity across a range of CBZ exposure concentrations in soil (0.1-20mg/kg). Results of biomass, chlorophyll, starch and total nitrogen (N) concentration in C. pepo indicated toxicity at soil concentrations of >= 10mg/kg. There were clear visual indications of increasing toxicity on leaves, including chlorosis and necrosis, from soil concentrations of 1 up to 20mg/kg. The present study also revealed novel insights into the effect of CBZ accumulation on C. pepo fruiting: female C. pepo flowers were unable to set fruit when leaf concentrations were >= 14mg/kg. These findings may have implications for future agricultural productivity in areas where reclaimed wastewater containing APIs is a source of irrigation. Detectable CBZ concentrations were found in edible C. pepo fruit, indicating the possibility of trophic transfer. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The effect of granular activated carbon (GAC) addition on the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, metoprolol, galaxolide and triclosan in a up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was studied. Prior to the reactor studies, batch experiments indicated that addition of activated carbon to UASB sludge can decrease micropollutant concentrations in both liquid phase and sludge. In continuous experiments, two UASB reactors were operated for 260 days at an HRT of 20 days, using a mixture of source separated black water and sludge from aerobic grey water treatment as influent. GAC (5.7 g per liter of reactor volume) was added to one of the reactors on day 138. No significant difference in COD removal and biogas production between reactors with and without GAC addition was observed. In the presence of GAC, fewer micropollutants were washed out with the effluent and a lower accumulation of micropollutants in sludge and particulate organic matter occurred, which is an advantage in micropollutant emission reduction from wastewater. However, the removal of micropollutants by adding GAC to a UASB reactor would require more activated carbon compared to effluent post-treatment. Additional research is needed to estimate the effect of bioregeneration on the lifetime of activated carbon in a UASB-GAC reactor.

AB The transformation of two X-rays contrast media iopromide (IOPr; non-ionic) and diatrizoate (DTZ; ionic) in reverse osmosis (RO) brines during UVA-TiO2 oxidation was investigated. The scavenging effect of chlorides, alkalinity and fulvic acid (HA) was comparatively evaluated against ultrapure water. The transformation of both compounds followed a pseudo-first reaction order, but rate of IOPr oxidation was higher than DTZ regardless of the water matrix. In ultrapure water, 98% IOPr transformation was achieved compared to only 42% for DTZ after a 6 h experiment. In contrast, transformation was significantly reduced in RO brines with only 18 and 9% transformation for IOPr and DTZ, respectively, whereas chlorides displayed very low to none scavenging effect, fulvic acid and alkalinity decreased rate constants by about 50% due to competitive radicals scavenging. The scavenging effect of HA was more evident for DTZ than IOPr. The ratio of deiodination/transformation was higher in DTZ, indicating that the initial transformation involves deiodination, e.g. takes place predominantly in the triiodinated skeleton. In contrast, the ratio of deiodination/transformation was lower in IOPr, indicating that the initial transformation proceeds without deiodination, e.g. takes place predominantly in the side chains. Finally, in both cases, kinetic experiments showed that oxidation leads to iodide evolution without iodate formation.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a typical sulfonamide antibiotic, has been widely detected in secondary wastewater effluents and surface waters. In this work we investigated the oxidative degradation of SMX by commonly used oxidants of chlorine, ozone and permanganate. Chlorine and ozone were shown to be more effective for the removal of SMX (0.05-5.0 mg/L), as compared with permanganate. Higher pH enhanced the oxidation of SMX by ozone and permanganate, but decreased the removal by chlorine. Moreover, the ozonation of SMX was significantly influenced by the presence of humic acid (HA), which exhibited negligible influence on the oxidation by chlorine and permanganate. Fairly lower mineralization of SMX occurred during the oxidation reactions, with the highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal of 13% (for ozone). By using LC-MS/MS, 7, 5 and 5 oxidation products were identified for chlorine, ozone and permanganate and possible transformation pathways were proposed. It was shown that different oxidants shared some common pathways, such as the cleavage of S-N bond, the hydroxylation of the benzene ring, etc. On the other hand, each of the oxidants also exhibited exclusive degradation mechanisms, leading to the formation of different transformation products (TPs). This work may provide useful information for the selection of oxidants in water treatment processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, chitin (CT) has been used as a potential sorbent for the removal of antibiotic drug Gatifloxacin (GF) from aqueous solutions using batch experiments. The equilibrium drug uptake was studied as a function of sorbent dose, pH of sorbate solution and temperature. The experimental data was analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. It was found that to some extent, all the models showed their suitability. The equilibrium sorption capacity obtained at 18, 28 and 37 degrees C was 97.108 +/- 2.35, 100.0 +/- 3.23 and 181.818 +/- 5.58 mg g(-1) respectively. The optimum uptake was found to be in the drug solution with pH value of nearly 6.0. The thermodynamic parameters, free energy change (Lambda G degrees(sorp)), change in enthalpy (Lambda H degrees) and change in entropy (Delta S degrees) of sorption, were evaluated using equilibrium uptake data obtained at three temperatures. Delta G degrees(sorp) was calculated from Langmuir, Frumkin and modified Frumkin models. The negative value of Delta G degrees(sorp) and positive. Delta H degrees indicated that drug uptake process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature respectively. The mean sorption energy E, as determined using Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model, was found to be 7.424 +/- 0.03 kJ mol(-1) thus, indicating physical sorption process. Finally, the sorption of drug was also confirmed by antimicrobial test.

AB Fish in many surface freshwaters are exposed to a range of pharmaceuticals via wastewater treatment works effluent discharges. In mammals the pregnane X receptor (PXR) plays a key role in the regulation of a suite of genes involved in drug biotransformation, but information on the role of this response pathway in fish is limited. Here we investigated the effects of exposure of carp (Cyprinus carpio) primary hepatocytes to the human PXR agonist rifampicin (RIF) on expression of target genes involved in phase I (cyp2k, cyp3a) and phase II (gst alpha, gst pi) drug metabolism and drug transporters mdr1 and mrp2. RIF induced expression of all target genes measured and the PXR antagonist ketoconazole (KET) inhibited responses of cyp2k and cyp3a. Exposure of the primary carp hepatocytes to the pharmaceuticals ibuprofen (IBU), clotrimazole (CTZ), clofibric acid (CFA) and propranolol (PRP), found responses to IBU and CFA, but not CTZ or PRP. This is in contrast with mammals, where CTZ is a potent PXR-agonist. Collectively our data indicate potential PXR involvement in regulating selected genes involved in drug metabolism in fish, but suggest some divergence in the regulation pathways with those in mammals. The carp primary hepatocyte model serves as a useful system for screening for responses in these target genes involved in drug metabolism.

AB Phenol and its homologues are aromatics containing hydroxyl, methyl, amide and sulphonic groups attached to the benzenoid molecules. These molecules are, both, anthropogenic and xenobiotics. Phenols are environmental pollutants discharged through wastewaters from fossil fuel refining processes, phenol manufacturing plants, pharmaceutical and a variety of other industries. Phenols are toxic to several biochemical reactions. However, biological transformation of phenols, to non-toxic entities exists in specialized microbes, having enzymes of aromatic catabolic pathways. Transformation of phenols is also inhibited by the presence of other toxic materials such as cyanides and sulphides that are present in the industrial wastes having phenols as the dominant carbonaceous material. Kinetics of the biotransformation of phenols using pure cultures isolated in the laboratory, mixture of a consortium of the pooled cultures and enriched activated sludge biomass in pure substrates, mixed substrates and actual phenolic waste has been estimated under varying input concentrations. Experimental results from these studies have been subjected to analysis by mathematical models using Monod's and Haldane's equations to test the validity of these models in interpreting the data on inhibitory substances under steady as well as unsteady state operations of wastewater treatment plants. Comparative evaluation of the kinetic parameters reveals that Monod's model can be employed for the estimation of the kinetic constant mu only while Haldane's model has to be used for the calculation of mu(max) and K-1.

AB Chlorination is a common disinfection method in water treatment. This method can be converted into an advanced oxidation process by incorporating UV irradiation during water treatment. This study investigated the degradation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) by chlorination and UV/chlorination in water. HCTZ is a diuretic medication that has been frequently detected in wastewater. For chlorination, the second-order rate constant for the reaction between HCTZ with free available chlorine was found to increase with increasing pH from 5 to 8 due to the increase of the anionic HCTZ fraction. UV/chlorination was found to be more efficient in removing HCTZ as compared with chlorination due to the presence of reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radicals. For transformation by-products, chlorination was found to produce two by-products via chlorination and hydroxylation reactions that occurred at the aromatic ring of HCTZ. For UV/chlorination, an additional by-product formed through a radical reaction at the heterocyclic moiety of HCTZ was detected. Based on the Escherichia coli inhibition study, chlorination and UV/chlorination were found to increase the toxicity of the HCTZ solution. This result indicated that even UV/chlorination showed higher effectiveness in removing HCTZ; however, it also has the potential to generate toxic by-products and effluent. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals in water have adverse effects on aquatic environment. Anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation coupled to dissimilatory manganese(Mn) (IV)- or iron(Fe) (III)-oxides reduction is potentially efficient but unexplored. In this study, batch experiments were performed using different Mn(IV) and Fe(III) species with a microbial inoculum pre-cultivated with 15 mM chemically-synthesized Mn(IV) and 10 mg L-1 metoprolol. Results show 26% caffeine and 52% naproxen are degraded with Mn(IV) as terminal electron acceptor and insignificant biodegradation for other pharmaceuticals tested. Reduction of Mn(IV) from drinking water treatment is coupled to anaerobic biodegradation of metoprolol and propranolol, resulting in removal efficiencies of 96% and 31%, respectively. The results indicate that adsorption contributes to the pharmaceutical removal during the first 10 days of incubation, while biodegradation is the main removal mechanism in the whole period. Fe(III) can also be used as electron acceptor in anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation. Over half of the added metoprolol is degraded with both chemically-synthesized Fe(III) and Fe(III)-citrate as terminal electron acceptors. However, this process did not occur when using Fe(III) from drinking water treatment or Fe(III)-based sorbents. This study indicates that anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation coupled to dissimilatory Mn(IV) or Fe(III) reduction is possible, and promising for application to cleaning wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB In recent years, heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors has proved to be efficient for the treatment of wastewater containing organic pollutants, such as drugs. Among some photocatalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been studied and applied for this purpose. Therefore, this work investigated the photocatalytic degradation of the antipsychotic clozapine under ultraviolet irradiation, using suspended and supported TiO2 in polystyrene material. Some experimental parameters were evaluated through a factorial design 2(3); a higher degradation rate of the compound was verified using 0.15 g of the immobilized catalyst, [H2O2] of 340 mg L-1 and pH 9, after 6 h of treatment. It was possible to obtain degradations above 93.48% and a two-stage model was proposed to describe the reaction kinetics. An artificial neural network was used to model the photocatalytic process and to determine the importance of the operational variables. It was also established that the use of this treatment resulted in 78.30% removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) under optimized conditions. In addition, the stability of TiO2 support after five consecutive cycles was verified from reuse tests. However, by means of toxicological tests with Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis, it was observed that the products generated by the reaction were more toxic than the original compound.

AB In order to develop an efficient electrode to remove pharmaceutical and personal care products from wastewater, copper and antimony doped Ti/SnO2 electrode were prepared by thermal decomposition. Electrochemical characterization was undertaken on Ti/SnO2-Cu using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, indicating an ultra-high 2.1 V of oxygen evolution potential, better stability, and superior corrosion resistance rather than traditional Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Competitive degradation experiments showed more efficient removal rate was achieved on Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode, which could remove more than 90% ceftazidime within 60 min. The microstructure and crystal orientation of the modified electrodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, which indicated that the crystal of the Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode grew in more porous and uniform condition, covered with closely arranged layers of the coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffractions suggested that Cu2O was successfully coated on the Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode surface. The operating parameters of electrochemical degradation process were also investigated, including current density, initial concentration, electrode distance, stirring rate and supporting electrolyte. Consequently, the intermediate products of electrochemical degradation were monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and a major degradation pathway was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The antibiotic contaminants from drug abuse, aquaculture wastewater and pharmaceutical industry effluent have enormous threat to microecology and human beings. In this paper, a porous hexagonal boron nitride (p-BN), which has high surface area up to 1062.88 m(2) g(-1) and abundant pore structure, was prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR and physical-chemical isothermal adsorption. A systematical and comprehensive study of the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics and isotherms of tetracycline (TC) on p-BN has been completed. Meanwhile, the effects of pH, temperature and salinity were also considered. It still had a rapidly adsorption rate and effective removal percentage (94.25%) to TC at high concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity can achieve to 322.16 mg g(-1) at the concentration of 160 mg L-1. Pseudo-second-order model and intra-particle diffusion model correlate with the experiment data better, the molecular diffusion of TC in the p-BN micropores is the rate-limiting step. Adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic due to the thermodynamic calculation, lower temperatures is favorable to the adsorption process. Salting out effect made the adsorption capacity increases with the added Na+ ion. The adsorption isotherms were more accordant with the Freundlich and Tempkin model. The adsorption mechanisms were mainly pi-pi interaction and electrostatic force. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread occurrence of trace pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments is of great concerns due to the potential chronic toxicity of certain pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen on aquatic organisms even at environmental levels. In this study, the phytoextraction, phytotransformation and rhizodegradation of ibuprofen associated with Typha angustifolia were investigated in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system. The experimental wetland system consisted of a planted bed with Typha angustifolia and an unplanted bed (control) to treat ibuprofen-loaded wastewater (similar to 107.2 mu g L-1). Over a period of 342 days, ibuprofen was accumulated in leaf sheath and lamina tissues at a mean concentration of 160.7 ng g(-1), indicating the occurrence of the phytoextraction of ibuprofen. Root-uptake ibuprofen was partially transformed to ibuprofen carboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen and 1-hydroxy ibuprofen which were found to be 1374.9, 235.6 and 301.5 ng g(-1) in the sheath, respectively, while they were 1051.1, 693.6 and 178.7 ng g(-1) in the lamina. The findings from pyrosequencing analysis of the rhizosphere bacteria suggest that the Dechloromonas sp., the Clostridium sp. (e.g. Clostridium saccharobutylicum), the order Sphingobacteriales, and the Cytophaga sp. in the order Cytophagales were most probably responsible for the rhizodegradation of ibuprofen.

AB The objective of this paper was to evaluate the efficiency of micropollutant removal, such as Cu, Zn, carbamazepine, and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), through the use of a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland system with ornamental plants. Zantedeschia aethiopica, Canna indica, Carex hirta, Miscanthus sinensis, and Phragmites australis were selected and planted in lysimeters filled up with gravel. The lysimeters were completely saturated with synthetic wastewater (N 280 mg L-1, P 30 mg L-1, Cu 3.6 mg L-1, Zn 9 mg L-1, carbamazepine 5 mu g L-1, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates 14 mg L-1), and the leaching water was collected for analysis after 15, 30, and 60 days in winter-spring and spring-summer periods. Nutrients (N and P) and heavy metals decreased greatly due to both plant activity and adsorption. C. indica and P. australis showed the highest metal content in their tissues and also the greatest carbamazepine and LAS removal. In these plants, the adsorption/degradation processes led to particularly high oxidative stress, as evidenced by the significantly high levels of ascorbate peroxidase activity detected. Conversely, Z. aethiopica was the less efficient plant in metal and organic compound removal and was also less stressed in terms of ascorbate peroxidase activity.

AB Researchers have used mixed microbial cultures to degrade various pollutants such as domestic effluents, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbon molecules, etc. The use of a mixed microbial culture induces synergistic associations between different microorganisms by producing multiple enzymes that can effectively degrade refractory molecules such as azo and anthraquinone dyes. It is in this context that we have been interested in the biological decolorization of contaminated water with an anthraquinone dye Remazol Blue Brilliant R (RBBR), by using microorganisms from activated sludge taken at the outlet of the aeration basin of the wastewater treatment plant from Reghaia (Algeria). In order to stimulate the development of the microorganisms responsible for the secretion of ligninolytic enzymes, we have introduced date pedicels cut into small pieces into the bioreactors. These will serve as co-substrate and support for the microorganisms present in the reaction medium. The parametric study is performed by varying the concentration of activated sludge, the concentration of date pedicels, the pH, the temperature and the initial concentration of the Remazol Blue Brilliant R (RBBR) dye. A maximum elimination yield of 82% is obtained. For an activated sludge/pedicel ratio of dates equals 2 at a neutral pH, T = 30 degrees C and an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L. We also note that this promising technique has achieved a yield of 53% for an initial concentration of Remazol Blue Brilliant R of 3500 mg/L.

AB The silver nanoparticles were prepared in the membrane by employing graphene oxide as a carrier. The structure and properties of GO-Ag/PVDF/F127 modified membrane were regulated by using isopropanol (IPA) as the coagulation bath based on the principle of non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The modified membrane prepared by the 50% IPA coagulation bath owned a well-distributed spongy-like pore morphology. Meanwhile, the modified membrane showed excellent hydrophilicity, permeability and optimum mechanical properties. In summary, the membrane MPGOAg-50% possessed the better performance with pure water flux of 87.10 L.m-2.h(-1), the BSA rejection rate of 94.7% and the contact angle of 70. 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) was a typical contaminant in the wastewater, its reduction product 4-aminophenol (4-AP) played a vital role in the preparation of some antipyretic and analgesic drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the performance of modified membranes controlled by coagulation bath was investigated by filtration reduction of 4-nitrophenol. The calculated reaction rate constant was higher than that reported under the same conditions. The modified membrane controlled by the IPA coagulation bath hold a reduction efficiency of 85% and remained stable for at least 1 h.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are not usually effective in the remediation of specific landfill leachates due to their high content in toxic and recalcitrant compounds. Advanced and intensive treatments are needed for the decontamination and possible recycling of these effluents. Here, the combination of advanced oxidation processes (solar photo-Fenton) and an aerobic biological reactor have been applied to treat urban landfill leachates. The effectiveness of the proposed treatment line was also evaluated considering the removal of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) identified in the different phases, which is an innovative practice. The analytical strategy included: (i) a target approach (115 analyzes) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); and two suspect approaches using (ii) LC-high-resolution MS (database with > 1300 compounds) and (iii) gas-chromatography-MS (database with > 900 compounds). OMCs on the treated landfill leachate was reduced up to 94% of the initial concentration. 8 target compounds (mainly pharmaceuticals) out of 115 target analyzes represented 85% of the OMC concentration in the raw leachate: cotinine, diclofenac, gabapentin, ketoprofen, lidocaine, mecoprop, nicotine and trigonelline. 3 non-previously reported OMCs were confirmed: di-n-nonyl phthalate, o-phenylphenol and tonalide. Leachate partially oxidized by solar photo-Fenton process can be successfully incorporated to biological systems to complete the treatment by means of specifically adapted biomass.

AB Hollow microsphere structure cobalt hydroxide (h-Co(OH)(2)) was synthesized via an optimized solvothermal-hydrothermal process and applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degradation of a typical pharmaceutically active compound, ibuprofen (IBP). The material characterizations confirmed the presence of the microscale hollow spheres with thin nanosheets shell in h-Co(OH)(2), and the crystalline phase was assigned to alpha-Co(OH)(2). h-Co(OH)(2) could efficiently activate PMS for radicals production, and 98.6% of IBP was degraded at 10 min. The activation of PMS by h-Co(OH)(2) was a pH-independent process, and pH 7 was the optimum condition for the activation-degradation system. Scavenger quenching test indicated that the sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) was the primary reactive oxygen species for IBP degradation, which contributed to 75.7%. Fukui index (f(-)) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted the active sites of IBP molecule for SO4 center dot- attack, and then IBP degradation pathway was proposed by means of intermediates identification and theoretical calculation. The developed hollow Co(OH)(2) used to efficiently activate PMS is promising and innovative alternative for organic contaminants removal from water and wastewater.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical and hormone residues in water bodies is a matter of recent global concern. This study investigated the presence of such contaminants in two urban water bodies located in the city of Santa Maria, in southern Brazil. Two urban catchments, characterized by anthropogenic influences and poor household waste collection and treatment systems, were investigated. The Cancela-Tamandai catchment covers an area of 2.7 km(2), 50% of which is impervious soil, and is home to 14,300 inhabitants. The Joao Goulart catchment area covers 5.5 km(2), 40% of which is impervious soil, and houses 11,900 inhabitants. Ten sampling campaigns were conducted in each catchment. Samples were checked for diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, ethisterone, estrone, and megestrol acetate. Four of the hormones (17 beta-estradiol, estriol, estrone, and megestrol acetate) were not detected in either catchment. Ethisterone was detected in a single sampling campaign in Cancela-Tamandai. Ibuprofen and paracetamol were detected in several samples, while diclofenac was absent. The mean concentration of ibuprofen in the Joao Goulart catchment was 0.51 mu g L-1 and in the Cancela-Tamandai it was 1.26 mu g L-1. Mean paracetamol concentrations were 0.4 mu g L-1 in the Joao Goulart catchment and 3.0 mu g L-1 in the Cancela-Tamandai.

AB The Concern on the availability of clean and safe fresh water and the quality of recycled wastewater are important issues, which require a suitable technology to restore the water quality. Pharmaceuticals in waste water are not easily degraded by conventional water treatment technology. Advanced oxidation processes have been applied to eliminate traces of these compounds from aquatic environments. This study was focused on the degradation of ibuprofen (IBU) in aqueous solutions by catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation. Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize the ozone concentration in water and to investigate other operation parameters. The operation parameters were: temperature, stirring rate, gas flow rate, pH, and use of Spinchem stirrer to reach higher concentrations of dissolved ozone. In general, the initial concentration of IBU was 10 mg/L, and about 93% of IBU was degraded after 4 h of ozonation under optimal conditions. Additional experiments were carried out to investigate the benefit of applying a solid catalyst. H-Beta and Fe-H-Beta type catalysts were immobilized in the Spinchem rotating bed device. The catalytic experiments illustrated a significant improvement in the degradation rate of IBU. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption- desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and FTIR.

AB A screening approach was applied to influent and effluent wastewater samples. After injection in a LC-LTQ-Orbitrap, data analysis was performed using two deconvolution tools, MsXelerator (modules MPeaks and MS Compare) and Sieve 2.1. The outputs were searched incorporating an in-house database of >200 pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs or ChemSpider. This hidden target screening approach led to the detection of numerous compounds including the illicit drug cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, gemfibrozil and losartan. The compounds found using both approaches were combined, and isotopic pattern and retention time prediction were used to filter out false positives. The remaining potential positives were reanalysed in MS/MS mode and their product ions were compared with literature and/or mass spectral libraries. The inclusion of the chemical database ChemSpider led to the tentative identification of several metabolites, including paraxanthine, theobromine, theophylline and carboxylosartan, as well as the pharmaceutical phenazone. The first three of these compounds are isomers and they were subsequently distinguished based on their product ions and predicted retention times. This work has shown that the use deconvolution tools facilitates non-target screening and enables the identification of a higher number of compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Determining the fate of emerging organic contaminants in an aquatic ecosystem is important for developing constructed wetlands (CWs) treatment technology. Experiments were carried out in subsurface flow CWs in Singapore to evaluate the fate and transport of eight pharmaceutical compounds. The CW system included three parallel horizontal subsurface flow CWs and three parallel unplanted beds fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The findings of the tests at 2-6 d HRTs showed that the pharmaceuticals could be categorized as (i) efficiently removed compounds with removal higher than 85% (ketoprofen and salicylic acid); (ii) moderately removed compounds with removal efficiencies between 50% and 85% (naproxen, ibuprofen and caffeine); and (iii) poorly removed compounds with efficiency rate lower than 50% (carbamazepine, diclofenac, and clofibric acid). Except for carbamazepine and salicylic acid, removal efficiencies of the selected pharmaceuticals showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement in planted beds as compared to the unplanted beds. Removal of caffeine, ketoprofen and clofibric acid were found to follow first order decay kinetics with decay constants higher in the planted beds than the unplanted beds. Correlations between pharmaceutical removal efficiencies and log K-ow were not significant (p > 0.05), implying that their removal is not well related to the compound's hydrophobicity.

AB The growing demand on water resources has increased interest in wastewater reclamation for potable reuse, in which rejection of organic micropollutants such as disinfection by-products (DBPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is of great concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the rejection of DBPs, EDCs, and PhACs by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes as a function of their physico-chemical properties and initial feed water concentration. Experimental results indicated that negatively charged compounds could be rejected very effectively (i.e., >90%) regardless of other physico-chemical properties of the tested compounds due to electrostatic exclusion. No time-dependency was observed for rejection of charged compounds. In contrast, rejection of non-charged compounds was generally lower (<90% except for one case) and influenced mainly by the molecular size of the compounds. A clear time-dependency was observed for rejection of non-charged compounds, attributable to compound adsorption on the membrane. It was demonstrated that feed water concentration influenced rejection efficiency of the membrane. Experiments conducted at a low ng/l concentration range resulted in lower rejection efficiency as compared to experiments conducted at a mug/l range, suggesting the need to conduct experiments at the relevant concentration of interest.

AB The release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is one of the most concern issues which affect the stability of environment. In this study, the transformation, typical metabolites and risk evaluation of five dominating PPCPs (acetaminophen, triclosan, caffeine, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and sulfamethoxazole) were investigated in a pilot sewer. Firstly, the mass balance analysis indicated, although the PPCPs have the peculiarity of degradation-resistant, the biodegradation of PPCPs still plays a more important role in sewers, and then, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q Exactive MS) methods were utilized to reveal their fate during pipeline transportation. In total, six transformation products (TPs) were detected and identified. The transformation occurring in sewers involved rearrangement of the aminobenzene moiety, ether bond breaking, hydrolysis of hydroxy compounds and dealkylation. Finally, risk(s) were estimated by calculating risk quotients (RQs). TCS is "high risk" (RQ > 200), SMX is "minimal risk" (RQ < 0.3), and the other compounds examined are "low or medium risk" and vary widely (RQ approximate to 3.75-98.19). Thus, based on this investigation, insights into PPCPs bioconversions in sewers were revealed, which could improve the understanding of subsequent treatment process of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and reduced environmental risks caused by micropollutants.

AB The integration of metal nanoparticles into carbon materials has catch considerable attention. In this study, we have successfully fabricated the N-doped porous carbon encapsulated magnetic Co nanoparticles (Co@NC-800) through a two-step pyrosis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67). The obtained Co@NC-800 exhibited excellent stability in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) towards tetracycline (TC) degradation without obvious Co leaching and magnetically separable. The removal efficiency reached up to 90.1% within 3 min and 74.7% of total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency could be obtained in 30 min towards TC by Co@NC800/PMS system. Mechanism explorations revealed the encapsulated Co nanoparticles in the porous N-doped carbon promoted the catalytic activity and stability. The two-pathway mechanism study indicated that radical and non-radical oxidations acted together in TC degradation. Moreover, some potential factors, including PMS dosage, TC concentration, solution pH value, anion/organic matters and temperature were investigated. The Co@NC-800/PMS system exhibited high efficiency in removal of various antibiotics (oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and deoxytetracycline). Even in actual water bodies (tap water, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater), the Co@NC-800/PMS system displayed excellent performance. This study proposed a design of metal nanoparticles under confinement for fabricating highly active catalysts towards PMS activation.

AB To develop a metal-free biochar with high and inherent catalytic activity towards refractory and highly toxic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes, it is necessary to explore its reaction pathways and responsible catalytic sites. Herein, a metal-free biochar derived from corn cob (CCBC) was prepared and used for reaction pathway analysis during peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. The pyrolysis temperature played an important role for regulating the biochar structure and properties, and CCBC obtained at 800 degrees C showed the best adsorption capacity and catalytic activity towards five typical organic pollutants, including 2, 4-dichlorophenol, Tetracycline hydrochloride, Ciprofloxacin, Methyl orange and Rhodamine B, due to its richer pore and defect structure. Further treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater demonstrated the good efficiency and potential of this metal-free catalyst for practical application. Radical (58% contribution) and non-radical (42% contribution) pathways were both found in CCBC/PDS system. More importantly, further redox experiments manifested that the carbon framework (defects, sp(2)-hybrid carbon, etc.) only made a contribution to the free radical pathway, while the ketone group (C=O) of CCBC was proved to be mainly responsible for the non-radical pathway, namely the generation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)).

AB The rising trend of depletion in global water supplies and the consistent accumulation of emerging environmental contaminants in water, soil and plant have become an international concern during the past decade. In recent years, the removal of personal care products (PCPs) from greywater has inspired a great attention for facile water recycling. In this study, the performance of a specially designed submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) system toward high-efficiency degradation of PCPs released through household greywater was investigated. The influent PCP-rich greywater was prepared by mixing commercial PCPs and the SMBR operated under different hydraulic retention time (HRT) values for 150 days of continuous operation. The results revealed that HRT has a striking influence on the treatment performance of the SMBR for PCP contaminants while the SMBR displayed a superior degradation capability for all categories of PCP contaminants (including antimicrobial agent, preservative, fragrance and UV Filter) at the effluent stream. Triclosan, methylparaben and propylparaben as the contaminants with the highest concentration at prepared PCP-rich greywater were removed up to 98.20%, 99.96% and 99.97%, respectively and other ones had more than 64% removal efficiency at HRT of 16 h. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) at the optimum HRT value were negligible.

AB This study investigates the potential of fluorescence excitation/emission matrices (EEM) measurement as a tool to predict N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation in water reuse applications. In particular, samples from a pilot-scale membrane biological reactor (MBR) followed by nanofiltration (NF) advanced water treatment plant, are used for the study. Concentrations of both, specific NDMA precursors and NDMA formation potential (FP) are correlated with different EEM peaks. The specific precursors investigated are: erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, venlafaxine, o-desmethylvenlafaxine, ranitidine and citalopram, while the NDMA FP is conventionally measured by the NDMA formation potential test. EEM peaks investigated are obtained by fluorescence regional integration as well as by the peak picking method generating I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, and I-5 peaks. Results showed that protein-like materials are correlated with the bulk NDMA FP and specific NDMA precursors. Additionally, selected fluorescence peaks such as I-1, I-2 and I-4 are strongly correlated with NDMA precursors throughout the MBR-NF pilot plant. The removal of NDMA precursors and EEM peaks also correlated well (R-2 > 0.8). This data shows that fluorescence EEM can be a promising tool to monitor the concentration of NDMA precursors and their removal in water reuse application. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is significant interest in increasing the microalgal efficiency for producing high-quality products that are commonly used as food additives in nutraceuticals. Some natural substances that can be extracted from algae include lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, carotenoids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamins. Generally, microalgal photoautotrophic growth can be maximised by optimising CO2 biofixation, and by adding sodium bicarbonate and specific bacteria to the microalgal culture. Recently, to enhance CO2 biofixation, a thermostable carbonic anhydrase (SspCA) encoded by the genome of the bacterium Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense has been heterologously expressed and immobilised on the surfaces of bacteria. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes, which catalyse the physiologically reversible reaction of carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons: CO2 + H2O reversible arrow HCO3- + H+. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that the fragments of bacterial membranes containing immobilised SspCA (M-SspCA) on their surfaces can be doped into the microalgal culture of the green unicellular alga, Chlorella sorokiniana, to significantly enhance the biomass, photosynthetic activity, carotenoids production, and CA activity by this alga. These results are of biotechnological interest because C. sorokiniana is widely used in many different areas, including photosynthesis research, human pharmaceutical production, aquaculture-based food production, and wastewater treatment.

AB Investigating the biodegradation of ozonation products of trace organic contaminants is important to further elucidate their fate and to assess the efficiency of advanced water treatment processes. In this study, a continuous ozonation merged with biofiltration (COMBI) laboratory system based on an electrochemical ozone generation method was developed. The system can be operated continuously and resource-efficiently over several months by supplying ozone doses typically used for water treatment and providing stable conditions for the establishment of microbial communities in biofiltration columns. Five trace organic contaminants, acesulfame, carbamazepine, diclofenac, dimethylsulfamide and fluoxetine, were investigated under drinking water and secondary treated wastewater ozonation conditions. After an equilibration time of three weeks, biodegradable ozonation products, for example N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and an acesulfame product, were removed in the filtration columns. Recalcitrant oxidation products such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and two products of diclofenac either passed through the columns at unchanged concentration or were removed to a minor extent. The formation of a secondary biotransformation product from carbamazepine ozonation products could be also observed. In summary, the results show that the developed system is a valuable tool to investigate complex transformation processes of ozonation products during biofiltration. COMBI will simplify future ozonation-biotransformation studies and enable more comprehensive investigations with a wider range of contaminants under different conditions.

AB The transfer of 23 antibiotics from domestic and hospital sources was investigated in two elementary river watersheds receiving wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges, in relation with the hydrological cycle and seasonal conditions. Antibiotic concentrations in the effluent of a WWTP. treating wastewaters from both hospital and domestic sources (18-12 850 ng L-1) were far higher than those from domestic sources exclusively (3-550 ng L-1). In rivers, upstream of the WWTP discharges, fluoroquinolones only were found at low concentrations (<= 10 ng L-1). Their presence might be explained by transfer from contaminated agricultural fields located on the river banks. Immediately downstream of the WWTP discharge, antibiotic occurrence increased strongly with mean concentrations up to 1210 ng L-1 for ofloxacin and 100% detection frequencies for vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and three fluoroquinolones. Dilution processes during high-flow periods led to concentrations 14 times lower than during low-flow periods. Downstream of the discharge, the antibiotic dissipation rate from the water column was higher for fluoroquinolones, in relation with their high sorption upon suspended matter and sediment. Only five antibiotics (vancomycin and four fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin) were partly distributed (11%-36%) in the particulate phase. Downstream of the discharge, antibiotic contents in sediment ranged from 1700 to 3500 ng g(-1) dry weight, fluoroquinolones accounting for 97% of the total. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) have emerged as a new class of contaminants due to their massive use as flame retardants and plasticizers. These contaminants are toxic to aquatic organisms and some of them are not biodegradable in wastewater treatment plants. This study investigated the degradation kinetics of eight typical OPEs during ozone and UV/H2O2 treatments in Milli-Q water, humic acid (HA) solution, and municipal secondary effluent. The studied OPEs included three chlorinated: tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCP); two aromatic: triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and tricresyl phosphate (TCrP); and three aliphatic: tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP). Results indicate that the degradation of target OPEs conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetics and UV/H2O2 was more effective than ozone for their elimination by comparing the overall removal efficiencies and energy consumptions. Two aromatic and two aliphatic OPEs (i.e., TPhP, TCrP, TnBP and TBEP) were effectively degraded by ozone and UV/H2O2 in the test water matrices, while all chlorinated and one aliphatic OPEs (i.e., TCEP, TCPP, TDCP and TEHP) were found to be recalcitrant to oxidation. Moreover, the presence of HA significantly enhanced the degradation of reactive OPEs in ozone treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals consumption in Poland is high. One of the most frequently prescribed is cardiovascular drugs. Due to their relatively high hydrophilic properties, they are not completely eliminated during wastewater treatment processes. In contrast to parent compounds, the presence of cardiovascular metabolites is rarely investigated in surface waters.
   The goal of this paper was to develop the methodology for detection of metabolites of selected beta-blockers: metoprolol, bisoprolol and propranolol. These metabolites were obtained by the incubation of parent compounds with S9 rat's liver fraction and used for the development and optimization of the low resolution LC-MS/MS method. Accurate mass spectrometry measurements were applied for validation of this method.
   The incubation of the parent compound with S9 fraction resulted only in propranolol's metabolites generation. However, on the basis of hydroxypropranolol, theoretically transitions for mono- and dihydroxy-metoprolol and bisoprolol derivatives were generated for MRM mode and applied for surface water analysis. The analysis revealed the presence of some of the target metabolites in the Vistula river. This work is the first one proposing the application of biotrasformation in the methodology of low resolution LC-MS-MS analysis of metabolites of cardiovascular drugs in surface water.

AB The pollution of aquatic bodies by drugs is an emerging environmental problem, because of their extensive use in animal and human context. Ibuprofen, 2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]propanoic acid, is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly present both in wastewater and in rivers and lakes in Europe. Since in literature there is little information about the effects of ibuprofen on microalgae, in this paper we presented the results on the effects of this molecule at different concentrations (62.5 mu g L-1, 250 mu g L-1 and 1000 mu g L-1) on cultures of the freshwater microalga Scenedesmus rubescens (P.J.L. Dangeard) E. Kesslet et al. Ibuprofen effects on the alga were assayed at first through analyses of the growth curve. Moreover, analyses of cell morphology, ultrastructure, and photosynthetic pigments were additionally performed. The first negative effect of the drug was on the microalga growth, suggesting a drug action dose-dependent mechanism type, more evident at the concentration of 1000 mu g L-1 ibuprofen and in the last phase of the growth curve. In support of this, following ibuprofen exposure, the cells exhibited morphological and ultrastructural alterations, mainly consisting in large cytoplasmic inclusions, probably of lipids and/or carotenoids. The decrease of chlorophyll amounts and, on the contrary, the increase of carotenoids were correlated with a stressful condition induced by drug. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation is known as an efficient treatment to reduce the concentration of many trace organic compounds from WWTP effluents, but the formation of unknown and possibly persistent and toxic transformation products has to be considered. In this paper tertiary treatment of wastewater by the combination of ozone and soil aquifer treatment was investigated with respect to the removal of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ, 10 mu g/L) and its transformation products. Batch tests and pilot experiments confirmed efficient removal of carbamazepine from secondary effluent by ozone. With typical ozone consumption of 0.7 mg O-3/mg DOC0, approx. 50% of the transformed CBZ was detected as its primary product 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM). Structure proposals and a formation pathway were elaborated for a total of 13 ozonation products of CBZ. In subsequent biological treatment BQM turned out to be more effectively biodegraded than CBZ. Its aldehyde group was quickly oxidized to a carboxylic acid (BaQM which was removed in sand column experiments. Most of the minor ozonation products of CBZ persisted in sand column experiments with residence times of 5-6 days. Non-target screening of column effluent revealed no formation of persistent biotransformation products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Titanium dioxide is widely used as an effective catalyst in wastewater treatment. The effects of drug carriers (cyclodextrins, 100 mu M) or dissolved humic acids (0-50 mg/L) or pH (3.0-11.0) on adsorption of norfloxacin to two TiO2 (Hombikat UV-100 and Anatase TiO2) surfaces were systematically studied. Norfloxacin shows high adsorption affinity to TiO2 surface. Specific surface area of TiO2 shows great influence on norfloxacin adsorption especially in acidic solutions. The effect of pH on norfloxacin adsorption originates from the changes of TiO2's surface charge and speciation of norfloxacin. The presence of humic acids (50 mg/L) suppresses the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Hombikat UV-100 and Anatase TiO2 prominently. The co-effect of heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (methyl-beta-CD) and humic acid is similar to the solo effect of humic acid on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Hombikat UV-100, while the co-effect shows a more retardation effect on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Anatase TiO2. Humic acid and beta-CD show a synergetic depressed effect on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto both TiO2 surfaces. These results show that both aquatic solution chemistry and drug carrier are important to norfloxacin adsorption on TiO2, which could alter the environmental fate and transport of norfloxacin.

AB Pharmaceutical products are used tremendously worldwide and subsequently released into wastewater even at very low concentration caused serious environmental problem due to their high activity. Therefore, the present work focuses on remarkable removal of paracetamol as one from the most used pharmaceutical intermediates, by using porous film based on cellulose acetate@metal organic framework (CA@Ti-MIL-NH2). The film was designed to achieve extreme removal of paracetamol by action of both of adsorption and degradation. Metal organic frame work was directly synthesized and inserted within the pre-prepared porous CA film to obtain porous CA@Ti-MIL-NH2 film. The synthesized films were applied in adsorption and photo-degradation of paracetamol separately and together. Due to the photocatalytic activity of Ti-MIL-NH2, the photo-degradation of paracetamol in visible-light was much effective and considerably high degradation of paracetamol was observed (k(1) = 760.0 m(-1)) comparing to the adsorption (k(1) = 160.0 m(-1)). The overall removal of paracetamol was significantly enlarged from 82.7 mg/g for CA film to 519.1 mg/g for porous CA@Ti-MIL-NH2 film. The used film exhibited quite good reusability and the removal of paracetamol was lowered from 96% to 85% after 5 regeneration cycles. Results of total organic carbon confirmed that paracetamol was fully degraded to CO2 and water.

AB The photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) toward sulfamethoxazole (SMX) elimination was investigated. BiOCl was synthesized according to a simple method using thiourea. Its physicochemical characteristics were determined by nitrogen physisorption, X-Ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Simulated solar irradiation and 1 g/L BiOCl, could effectively remove 0.5 mg/L SMX in less than 90 min. An increase in SMX concentration from 0.25 mg/L to 4 mg/L decreased the observed kinetic constant. Concerning the pH effect, it was found that under alkaline conditions SMX removal was slightly hindered. The water matrix's influence on SMX removal was explored, carrying out experiments in real water matrices, (bottled water (BW) and secondary effluent (WW)). Interestingly SMX removal was not practically altered in WW secondary effluent, but it was slightly hindered in BW bottled water. Experiments, performed in synthetic matrices, revealed that the presence of bicarbonates and chlorides slightly slowed down degradation kinetics, while humic acid enhanced SMX removal at concentrations up to 10 mg/L. Finally, an enhancement on SMX degradation was observed in the presence of persulfate. Quenching experiments of potential reactive species revealed that SMX degradation takes place mainly through reaction with hydroxyl radicals and photogenerated electrons.

AB Preparation of biochar from kaolinite and coconut husk (KCB) and further activated with HCl (KCB-A) and KOH (KCB-B) via a microwave technique for the remediation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TET) from water was carried out. Characterization using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed the successful synthesis of functionalized biochars. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated the potential of the adsorbents for fast and efficient removal of CIP and TET from solution. The adsorption capacities were found to be 71, 140 and 229 mg g(-1) for CIP and 118, 117 and 232 mg g(-1) for TET removal on KCB, KCB-A and KCB-B, respectively. For KCB, KCB-B and KCB-B, CIP adsorption best followed the pseudo second order kinetic model (PSOM), pseudo first order kinetic model (PFOM) and intraparticle diffusion (IDP) respectively. TET adsorption followed PSOM for KCB, IPD for KCB-B and PFOM for KCB-A. CIP adsorption on KCB, KCB-A and KCB-B best fit the Temkin, Langmuir and Brouers-Sotolongo isotherms, respectively, and TET adsorption on KCB best fit Brouers-Sotolongo while KCB-A and KCB-B best fit Langmuir-Freundlich. Adsorption of both contaminants was thermodynamically feasible showing that these materials are excellent adsorbents for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in water.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical that is resistant to photodegradation and biodegradation in conventional wastewater treatment plants. In this research, the degradation of commercial CBZ was studied using a boron-doped diamond-Fe system in continuous flow. A response surface model was created to determine the contributions of the current intensity (0.39, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.10 A) or current density (1.69, 2.16, 3.25, 4.33, and 4.76 mA/cm(2), respectively), support electrolyte (NaCl and CaCl2), and initial CBZ concentration ([CBZ](0)) (0.1, 1.0, 5.5, 10.0, and 11.8 mg/L). The highest CBZ removal (%) was achieved with NaCl as a support electrolyte at a current intensity of 0.64 A (2.77 mA/cm(2)) and [CBZ](0) of 4.5 mg/L at a neutral pH (6-7) and a treatment time of 120 min. The electro-oxidation (EO) process achieved a removal efficiency of 77.25%, whereas solar EO removed 90.77% of CBZ in the presence of ultraviolet radiation (536.37 W/m(2)). CBZ degradation was fitted to the Behnajady-Modirshahla-Ghanbery kinetic model with constant values of 1/m = 0.31 and 1/b = 0.93, thereby indicating the fast decomposition of CBZ. The toxicity was significantly reduced in the effluent.

AB BACKGROUNDOfloxacin is a frequently detected fluoroquinolone antibiotic in wastewater treatment plant effluents, sea waters and surface waters. Photocatalytic technology is considered to be the most promising treatment technology for the removal of ofloxacin. However, it is a big challenge to exploit a novel sunlight-driven photocatalyst and reveal the mechanism of ofloxacin degradation.
   RESULTSCo3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 composites were prepared using a facile hydrothermal synthesis method. The structural, morphological and optical properties of the composites were well characterized. Both the degradation efficiency and cyclical stability of the Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 composites increased significantly under simulated sunlight irradiation when ofloxacin (OFX) or methyl orange (MO) was used as the target molecule, as compared with single-phase Ag3PO4 and Co-3(PO4)(2). The reduction of antimicrobial activity for 8%Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 reached 88.8% after 5min of sunlight irradiation.
   CONCLUSIONCo3(PO4)(2) played a critical role in suppressing carrier recombination and provided a large number of photogenerated holes and O-center dot(2)- to oxidize OFX or MO. The OFX degradation mechanism included piperazinyl dealkylation, decarboxylation and defluorination. The reduction of antimicrobial activity for degradation byproducts was obvious after simulated sunlight irradiation over Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4. Therefore Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 is an attractive candidate for the removal of OFX. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In the present work, the adsorptive removal of diclofenac from water by biosorption onto non-living microalgae biomass was assessed. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out using biomass of two different microalgae strains, namely Synechocystis sp. and Scenedesmus sp. Also, for comparison purposes, a commercial activated carbon was used under identical experimental conditions. The kinetics of the diclofenac adsorption fitted the pseudo-second order equation, and the corresponding kinetic constants indicating that adsorption was faster onto microalgae biomass than onto the activated carbon. Regarding the equilibrium results, which mostly fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, these pointed to significant differences between the adsorbent materials. The Langmuir maximum capacity (Q(max)) of the activated carbon (232 mg.g(-1)) was higher than that of Scenedesmus sp. (28 mg.g(-1)) and of Synechocystis sp. (20 mg.g(-1)). In any case, the Qmax values determined here were within the values published in the recent scientific literature on the utilization of different adsorbents for the removal of diclofenac from water. Still, Synechocystis sp. showed the largest KL fitted values, which points to the affinity of this strain for diclofenac at relative low equilibrium concentrations in solution. Overall, the results obtained point to the possible utilization of microalgae biomass waste in the treatment of water, namely for the adsorption of pharmaceuticals.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a pharmaceutical frequently categorized as a recalcitrant pollutant in the aquatic environment. Endophytic bacteria previously isolated from reed plants have shown the ability to promote growth of their host and to contribute to CBZ metabolism.
   In this work, a horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) hairy root (HR) culture has been used as a plant model to study the interactions between roots and endophytic bacteria in response to CBZ exposure. HRs could remove up to 5% of the initial CBZ concentration when they were grown in spiked Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Higher removal rates were observed when HRs were inoculated with the endophytic bacteria Rhizobium radiobacter (21%) and Diaphorobacter nitroreducens (10%). Transformation products resulting from CBZ degradation were identified using liquid chromatography ultra high-resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-UHR-QTOF-MS). CBZ metabolism could be divided in four pathways. Metabolites involving GSH conjugation and 2,3-dihydroxylation, as well as acridine related compounds are described in plants for the first time.
   This study presents strong evidence that xenobiotic metabolism and degradation pathways in plants can be modulated by the interaction with their endophytic community. Hence it points to plausible applications for the elimination of recalcitrant compounds such as CBZ from wastewater in CWs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate from wastewater reuse facilities contains concentrated emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. In this research, a paper-like composite sheet consisting of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zeolite was synthesized, and removal of the antipruritic agent crotamiton from RO concentrate was studied using the TiO2/zeolite composite sheet. The RO concentrate was obtained from a pilot-scale municipal secondary effluent reclamation plant. Effective immobilization of the two powders in the sheet made it easy to handle and to separate the photocatalyst and adsorbent from purified water. The TiO2/zeolite composite sheet showed excellent performance for crotamiton adsorption without obvious inhibition by other components in the RO concentrate. With ultraviolet irradiation, crotamiton was simultaneously removed through adsorption and photocatalysis. The photocatalytic decomposition of crotamiton in the RO concentrate was significantly inhibited by the water matrix at high initial crotamiton concentrations, whereas rapid decomposition was achieved at low initial crotamiton concentrations. The major degradation intermediates were also adsorbed by the composite sheet. This result provides a promising method of mitigating secondary pollution caused by the harmful intermediates produced during advanced oxidation processes. The cyclic use of the HSZ-385/P25 composite sheet indicated the feasibility of continuously removing crotamiton from RO concentrate.

AB The degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous solution was investigated on alpha-(Cu,Fe)(2)O-3 catalyst under visible irradiation. The material was prepared by a hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, BET analysis, electrical conductivity, diffuse reflectance and photo-electrochemistry. alpha-(Cu,Fe)(2)O-3 crystallizes in the corundum structure and exhibit n-type conductivity with activation energy of 0.41 eV. It exhibits a direct optical transition at 2.02 eV; further transitions, indirectly allowed, occur at 1.93 and 1.69 eV. These bands located between those of CuO (similar to 1.46 eV) and Fe2O3 (similar to 2 eV) confirm the presence of the solid solution (Cu,Fe)(2)O-3; the BET surface area of the sample averages 10 m(2) g(-1). The IBP photo-degradation, monitored by high performance liquid chromatography was found to have overall high conversion rates. The optimal performance was observed for a catalyst dose of 0.25 g L-1 and IBP concentration of 200 mg L-1 at pH similar to 11. By applying the optimal operating conditions, IBP conversion of 88% was obtained after 240 min under visible illumination.

AB The occurrence of five pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, was studied by passive sampling and grab sampling in northern Lake Paijanne and River Vantaa. The passive sampling was performed by using Chemcatcher (R) sampler with a SDB-RPS Empore disk as a receiving phase. In Lake Paijanne, the sampling was conducted during summer 2013 at four locations near the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant and in the years 2013 and 2015 at four locations along River Vantaa. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in Lake Paijanne determined by passive sampling ranged between 1.4-2.9 ng L-1, 15-35 ng L-1, 13-31 ng L-1, 16-27 ng L-1, and 3.3-32 ng L-1, respectively. Similarly, the results in River Vantaa ranged between 1.2-40 ng L-1, 15-65 ng L-1, 13-33 ng L-1, 16-31 ng L-1, and 3.3-6.4 ng L-1. The results suggest that the Chemcatcher passive samplers are suitable for detecting pharmaceuticals in lake and river waters.

AB A comparative analysis of photocatalytic efficiency has been carried out with both TiO2 P25 and a home-made catalyst at a solar radiation pilot plant constituted by Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) systems. The effect of the chemical nature of three different substrates (phenol, dichloroacetic acid and pyrimethanil) and the impact of inorganic ions in natural waters, on their final photo-efficiencies was also analyzed. Subsequently, this solar photocatalytic process was applied to the photodegradation of a mixture of emerging contaminants considering the separation and recovery of catalysts by sedimentation. Although TiO2 P25 showed better results during phenol and dichloroacetic acid photodegradation, both photocatalysts presented similar photo-efficiencies in pyrimethanil mineralization and, specially, in the treatment of emerging pollutants. The presence of high concentrations of inorganic ions in natural waters constitutes a limiting factor for solar photocatalytic activity, but this process successfully photodegraded the mixture of micropollutants (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, flumequine) in natural water matrix using both TiO2 catalysts, at very short irradiation times (t(30w) < 35 min). Therefore, solar assisted heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a very efficient, promising and competitive AOP to remove emerging contaminants like the pharmaceutical micropollutants studied here and frequently detected in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants.

AB In this study, the performance of bezafibrate (BZF) degradation and detoxification in the aqueous phase using cerium-modified red mud (RM) catalysts prepared using different cerium sources and synthesis methods were evaluated. Experimental results showed that the surface cerium modification was responsible for the development of the catalytic activity of RM and this was influenced by the cerium source and the synthesis method. Catalyst prepared from cerium (IV) by precipitation was found to show the best catalytic activity in BZF degradation and detoxification. Reactive oxygen species including peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, and super oxide ions were identified in all reactions and we proposed the corresponding catalytic reaction mechanism for each catalyst that prepared from different cerium source and method. This was supported by the intermediates profiles that were generated upon BZF degradation. The surface and the structural properties of cerium-modified RM were characterized in detail by several analytical methods. Two interesting findings were made: (1) the surface texture (specific surface area and mesoporous volume) influenced the catalytic reaction pathway; and (2) Ce(III) species and oxygen vacancies Were generated on the surface of the catalyst after cerium modification. This plays an important role in the development of the catalytic activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical carbon materials with ultrahigh specific surface area and high porosity were synthesized by KOH activation from sustainable alpha-cellulose and employed as adsorbents to study adsorption performance of tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) from aqueous solutions. The physical and chemical properties of the as-prepared materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XPS, Raman and a surface area analyzer. The obtained porous carbon exhibited a hierarchical pore structure, large BET specific surface area (3187.91 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.781 cm(3) g(-1)) when the activation temperature reached 850 degrees C. The maximum adsorption capacities were 1072.86 and 786.18 mg g(-1) for TC and SMZ removal at 298 K, respectively. Moreover, TC and SMZ showed similar adsorption features, kinetic results could fit well using a pseudo-second-order model, intraparticle diffusion was not the rate-controlling step and adsorption isotherm results fit well with the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacities increased with contact time and adsorption temperature and, moreover, pH and external ionic species have a significant effect on adsorption efficiency. Thermodynamic studies implied that physisorption might dominate adsorption and the adsorption process is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable. The results are of importance to indicate that the as-prepared porous carbon could be used as a low-cost and effective adsorbent in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Free chlorine is extensively used for water and wastewater disinfection nowadays. However, it still remains a big challenge to determine the rate constants of rapid chlorination reactions although competition kinetics and stopped-flow spectrophotometric (SFS) methods have been employed individually to investigate fast reaction kinetics. In this work, we proposed an SFS competition kinetics method to determine the rapid chlorination rate constants by using a common colorimetric reagent, N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD), as a reference probe. A kinetic equation was first derived to estimate the reaction rate constant of DPD towards chlorine under a given pH and temperature condition. Then, on that basis, an SFS competition kinetics method was proposed to determine directly the chlorination rate constants of several representative compounds including tetracycline, ammonia, and four a-amino acids. Although Cl2O is more reactive than HOCl, its contribution to the overall chlorination kinetics of the test compounds could be neglected in this study. Finally, the developed method was validated through comparing the experimentally measured chlorination rate constants of the selected compounds with those obtained or calculated from literature and analyzing with Taft's correlation as well. This study demonstrates that the SFS competition kinetics method can measure the chlorination rate constants of a test compound rapidly and accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing concern over the presence of pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and other chemicals collectively known as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in municipal effluents, yet knowledge of potential environmental impacts related to these compounds is still limited. The present study used laboratory exposures to examine estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid-related endocrine responses in marine hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) exposed to CECs from municipal effluents with 2 degrees of treatment. Fish were exposed for 14 d to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent (0.5%) and to a higher concentration (5%) to investigate dose responses. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), vitellogenin (VTG), 11-keto testosterone, and thyroxine were measured to assess endocrine responses. Contaminants of emerging concern were analyzed to characterize the effluents. Diverse types of effluent CECs were detected. Statistically significant responses were not observed in fish exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent. Elevated plasma E2 concentrations were observed in males exposed to ammonia concentrations similar to those found in effluents. However, exposure to ammonia did not induce VTG production in male fish. The results of the present study highlight the importance of conducting research with sentinel organisms in laboratory studies to understand the environmental significance of the presence of CECs in aquatic systems.

AB The removal of antibiotic metronidazole (MNZ) in aqueous solution by nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) particles was investigated. The experimental results showed that MNZ was completely removed by NZVI. MNZ solution at 80 mg L-1 was rapidly removed by NZVI within 5 min, at initial solution pH 5.60. NZVI dose of 0.1 g L-1. Influencing factors such as NZVI dosage, initial MNZ concentration and initial solution pH were systematically studied, and the removal process of MNZ followed a pseudo-first order kinetics model. The removal efficiency was enhanced with increasing NZVI dosage while it was decreased with the increase of initial MNZ concentration and initial solution pH. The removal of MNZ in a nitrogen bubbling system (NZVI/N-2 process) and in an air bubbling system (NZVI/air process) was compared, and the results showed that the removal rate in the NZVI/air process was slightly higher than that in the NZVI/N-2 process. The removal efficiencies of MNZ by using NZVI and commercial iron powder were investigated as well, indicating that MNZ removal efficiency by NZVI was about 49 times higher than that by commercial iron powder under the same dosages. This study demonstrates that the NZVI technology could be a promising approach for antibiotic wastewater treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical products are released at low concentrations into aquatic environments following domestic wastewater treatment. Such low concentrations have been shown to induce transcriptional responses in microorganisms, which could have consequences on aquatic ecosystem dynamics. In order to test if these transcriptional responses could also be observed in complex river microbial communities, biofilm reactors were inoculated with water from two rivers of differing trophic statuses and subsequently treated with environmentally relevant doses (ng/liter to mu g/liter range) of four pharmaceuticals (erythromycin [ER], gemfibrozil [GM], sulfamethazine [SN], and sulfamethoxazole [SL]). To monitor functional gene expression, we constructed a 9,600-feature anonymous DNA microarray platform onto which cDNA from the biofilms was hybridized. Pharmaceutical treatments induced both positive and negative transcriptional responses from biofilm microorganisms. For instance, ER induced the transcription of several stress, transcription, and replication genes, while GM, a lipid regulator, induced transcriptional responses from several genes involved in lipid metabolism. SN caused shifts in genes involved in energy production and conversion, and SL induced responses from a range of cell membrane and outer envelope genes, which in turn could affect biofilm formation. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that low concentrations of small molecules can induce transcriptional changes in a complex microbial community. The relevance of these results also demonstrates the usefulness of anonymous DNA microarrays for large-scale metatranscriptomic studies of communities from differing aquatic ecosystems.

AB Sericin protein, although a valuable resource for many industries including cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biomedical, has been discarded as a waste in silk industry, causing environmental pollution. This paper describes determination of a membrane-based process for sericin recovery from cocoon cooking wastewaters (CCW) that will enable value-added utilization of waste sericin. The iso-electric point (pI) of sericin was found as 5-6, whose MW was distributed as 180-200, 70-80, 30-40 and 10-25 kDa. Prior to membrane filtration. sericin was separated from other impurities via centrifugation (CFG) followed by microfiltration (MF) in the pre-treatment stage, which also helped minimize post membrane fouling. Ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) were adopted at a pH equal to pI of sericin. UF achieved partial recovery of sericin polypeptides at 37-60%, which was attributed to increased transmission of uncharged sericin polypeptides at their pI. On the other hand, NF achieved sericin recovery as high as 94-95%, containing all MW fractions. Severe flux decline was the major problem due to protein-membrane interactions and high sericin concentrations, where concentration polarization mainly had a dominant effect. Although flux declines were as high as 58-88% in UF and 70-75% in NF, flux recovery by at least 83% was achieved by chemical cleaning using NaOH and free chlorine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The study aims to simultaneously control micropollutants and bromate formations by using ozonation and peroxone process. The batch experiments were run with variations in specific ozone dose (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-to-ozone (H2O2/O-3) ratio. Based on the removal by ozonation and peroxone, micropollutants were categorized into three groups: non-reactive compounds (i.e. amidotrizoate), moderately reactive compounds (i.e. metoprolol, acesulfame potassium, bezafibrate, and benzotriazole), and highly reactive compounds (i.e. carbamazepine and diclofenac). For ozonation and peroxone process, the removals for highly reactive compounds and moderately reactive compounds were 82-99% and 29-99%, respectively. The removal of amidotrizoate was not observed in this study. The effect of ozonation on micropollutant removals was similar to the peroxone process. However, differences in bromate formation were observed. Bromate formation depended on the SOD, while addition of hydrogen peroxide suppressed the bromate formation. The peroxone process at the H2O2/O-3 ratio of 0.3 was recommended to bromide-containing water below 100 mu g.L-1 for simultaneous control of micropollutants and bromate. Enhancement in micropollutant removals, except for the non-reactive groups, was achieved with either higher SOD or the addition of hydrogen peroxide to ozonation. The micropollutant removal predicted from the second-order kinetic reaction with ozone and center dot OH exposures was higher than the observed data.

However, accurate and quantitative kinetic data regarding virus inactivation by ozone are scarce, because of the experimental challenges associated with the high reactivity of ozone toward viruses. Here, we established an experimental batch system that allows tailoring and quantifying of very low ozone exposures and simultaneously measuring virus inactivation. Second-order ozone inactivation rate constants (k(O3-virus)) of five enteric viruses [laboratory and two environmental strains of coxsackievirus B5 (CVF, CVEnv1, and CVEnv2), human adenovirus (HAdV), and echovirus 11 (EV)] and four bacteriophages (MS2, Q beta, T4, and Phi 174) were measured in buffered solutions. The k(O3-virus) values of all tested viruses ranged from 4.5 x 10(5) to 3.3 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1). For MS2, k(O3-MS2) depended only weakly on temperature (2-22 degrees C; E-a = 22.2 kJ mol(-1)) and pH (6.5-8.5), with an increase in k(O3-MS2) with increasing pH. The susceptibility of the selected viruses toward ozone decreases in the following order: Q beta > CVEnv2 > EV approximate to MS2 > Phi 174 approximate to T4 > HAdV > CVF approximate to CVEnv1. On the basis of the measured k(O3-Virus) and typical ozone exposures applied in water and wastewater treatment, we conclude that ozone is a highly effective disinfectant for virus control.

AB The effective treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) contained wastewater remains a significant but challenging task for the environmental restoration. In this work, a novel Pd@MIL-100(Fe) nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated via a facile alcohol reduction approach. The resulting Pd@MIL-100(Fe) has exhibited superior photoactivity toward degradation of three typical PPCPs, that is theophylline, ibuprofen and bisphenol A, under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). Its photoactivity is also much higher than that of original-MIL-100(Fe). Combining with photoelectrochemical analyses, it could be revealed that the introduction of Pd NPs would minimize the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the effects of different kinds of metals, the loading amount of noble-metal, the pH value of reaction solution and initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the photocatalytic degradation activities have been measured in detail. In addition, a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism has been investigated. This work has not only represented the first example of using the MOFs photocatalysts to remove the aqueous PPCPs, but also offered useful information on the fabrication of efficient MOF photo catalysts for environmental restoration.

AB Surfactants are used in almost all branches of industry, in everyday life as home and industrial cleaning compounds, in cosmetics, in pharmaceuticals, in foods, in crop protection, etc. Their waste belongs to the most widespread organic pollutants, representing a global environmental problem, giving thus a great importance for their monitoring in the environment. The existing methodology for the monitoring of anionic and nonionic surfactants in effluents is based on the time-consuming extraction-spectrophotometric procedures connected with numerous drawbacks: considerable chemicals consumption, use and disposal of toxic organic solvents, etc. Potentiometric methods with surfactant sensors (surfactant-selective electrodes) sensitive to the surfactants overcome almost all of these disadvantages offering an attractive alternative to the existing methods. The biggest challenge in surfactant analysis is the determination of low levels in environmental samples.
   This review outlines the principles of response mechanisms of these sensors and their application for the determination of anionic and nonionic surfactants in surface waters and effluents. Advantages of the use of surfactant-selective electrodes vs. classical methods and their limitations are also outlined. The potentiometric methods mentioned can be used for simple determination of anionic and nonionic surfactants in the Sava River in Zagreb and downstream, at inflow of wastewater from the treatment plants.

AB Overall photodegradation of pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and pharmaceutical metabolites were investigated in order to evaluate their photochemical fate in aquatic environments in various natural organic matter (NOM) enriched solutions. Tested PPCPs exhibited different rates of loss during direct and indirect photolysis. Here, only ultraviolet (UV) light source was used for direct photolysis and UV together with (DOM)-D-3* for indirect photolysis. Diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole were susceptible to photodegradation, whereas carbamazepine, caffeine, paraxanthine and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) showed low levels of photodegradation rate, reflecting their conservative photoreactivity. During indirect photodegradation, in contrast to the hydrophilic autochthonous NOM, allochthonous NOM with relatively high molecular weight (MW), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and hydrophobicity (e.g., Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA)) revealed to significantly inhibit the photolysis of target micropollutants. The presence of Typha wetland NOM enhanced the indirect photolysis of well-known conservative micopollutants (carbamazepine and paraxanthine). And atenolol, carbamazepine, glimepiride, and N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole were found to be sensitive to the triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*) with Typha wetland NOM under deoxygenated condition. This suggests that photolysis in constructed wetlands connected to the wastewater treatment plant can enhance the degradation of some anthropogenic micropollutants by the interaction with (DOM)-D-3* in wetlands.

AB Many studies have shown the occurrence of antibiotics and degradation products in streams; however, relatively little work has applied a functional perspective to antibiotic transport and uptake. This study examined tier changes in antibiotic concentrations downstream from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharge and estimated net uptake length (S-net), net uptake velocity (v(f-net)), and net areal uptake rate (U-net) of antibiotics over a 3-km stream reach at Mud Creek, northwest Arkansas, USA, during June, September, and December 2006. Ten antibiotics and one degradation product (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, erythromycin-H2O, ofloxacin, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, oxyterracycline, and trimethoprim) were found at least once at Mud Creek downstream from the effluent discharge. All chemicals persisted in measurable concentrations in the water column over the 3-km stream reach, and we observed significant net retention of some antibiotics and one degradation product across the sampling events. Antibiotics that were significantly retained traveled kilometer-scale distances (S-net: 1.8 to 51.5 km) with relatively low uptake velocities (v(f-net): 1.6 to 33.9 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) and rates (U-net: 0.01 to 38.4 x 10(-6) mu g m(-2) s(-1)). This stud), illustrates that some antibiotics do not travel conservatively in streams and that uptake processes occur over the scale of kilometers, linking upstream effluent Sources to downstream processing over large spatial scales.

AB Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most consumed anti-cancer drugs in the pharmaceutical market around the world. The widespread occurrence of MTX in aquatic environment through hospital effluent has attracted increasing concern due to its potential to induce water pollution. In the present study, the degradation of MTX in aqueous medium was investigated by UV-activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS). A significant improvement in degradation rate by increasing UV intensity and PMS concentration while the decrease in degradation efficiency with the increase of solution pH and initial concentration of MTX was observed. The proposed UV/PMS process could achieve more than 90% MTX degradation in 30 min with a good mineralization degree (65%). A pseudo-first order kinetic model was employed and successfully predicted the degradation of MTX. The effect of other operational parameters such as the initial concentration of the targeted compound, dosage of oxidant (PMS), solution pH and UV intensity on the degradation rate were investigated. At the last, the main transform intermediates were identified using LC-MS and possible degradation pathways were proposed. The results show that UV/PMS can be used as an efficient technology to treat pharmaceuticals such as methotrexate containing water and wastewater.

AB The widespread distribution of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), particularly in the built environment, has led to increased concern about their effects on both human and ecosystem health. In this research, we investigated the role of algae species Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris in governing PPCP transfer and transformation mechanisms in algae-containing environments. Lab-scale algal bioreactors were created under various conditions of light, water matrix, and sterilization method to isolate and elucidate reaction mechanisms affecting carbamazepine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan. The parent compounds and their potential transformation products were analyzed in both the water and algae phases. The results showed that ibuprofen was primarily biotransformed due to synergistic relationships between the algae and the bacteria. Ibuprofen biotransformation products tentatively identified as hydroxy-ibuprofen, carboxy-ibuprofen, and 4-isobutylcatechol were detected in several samples. In all the reactors exposed to light, triclosan underwent both phototransformation and biotransformation. Triclosan biotransformation took place in Scenedesmus obliquus, as demonstrated by the presence of triclosan-O-sulfate in the algae extracts. No evidence of significant carbamazepine and gemfibrozil transfer or transformation was observed under the experimental conditions tested. These results suggest that microalgal-bacterial consortia can facilitate PPCP transformation in algae-based passive water treatment systems. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In term of pharmaceutical and their intermediate compounds analysis, UPLC/MS method is a valuable equipment to achieve better confirmation on their biodegradation by fungi. The T47D-KBluc reporter gene assay is an appropriate tool to investigate to removal of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from a synthetic wastewater. A consortium of isolated South African indigenous fungi Aspergillus niger, Mucor circinelloides, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Trametes polyzona and Rhizopus microspores was found to perform a removal of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and to reduce their estrogenic activity below the limit of detection in a sequencing batch reactor. Here are presented data regarding the phenolic compounds list and the method validation for UPLC/MS analysis used for selected pharmaceutical compounds namely carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen and their metabolites, as well as the T47D-KBluc bioassay using as positive control, the agonist E-2 for estrogenic activity and the antagonist ICI 182,780 for antiestrogenic activity.

AB Health concerns have been raised over the excessive occurrences of antibiotics such as tetracycline in aquatic environments. Adsorption is a simple and cheap technique for the removal of pharmaceuticals from industrial wastewater. To date, limited information exists on the fate, economical treatment and safe disposal of spent adsorbents in the environment, and this is often consideredas the main drawback of adsorption. In this article, an alternative strategy to dispose and reuse spent inorganic adsorbents is proposed. We synthesized CoO/CuFe2O4 mixed metal oxide from layered double hydroxides by a modified co-precipitation and calcination method at 500 degrees C for 5h. CoO/CuFe2O4 has a 348.5m(2)/g surface area, pH point zero charge of 5.8 and an average pore diameter of 5.8nm. Results show that the tetracycline removal efficiency at pH 6 reached 96.6% and 84-87.3% in the absence and in the presence of 4g/L competing ions (Cl- and NO3-), respectively. Moreover, CoO/CuFe2O4 retained stable activities, of about 90%, over five consecutive recycling runs. Spent CoO/CuFe2O4 was reused as a catalyst in the presence of sunlight for degradation of azo dye, and this is the first report of achieving similar to 77% discolouration of eriochrome black T dye using a recycled adsorbent.

AB In this study, the impact of dead cells on biofouling and consequent biofouling effects on three pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) retention by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane were systematically studied through inoculating live and dead Pseudomonas aeruginosa into artificial wastewater, respectively. The biofilm was characterized by quantifying the surface properties, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and total organic carbon (TOC) amount, biomass activity, total live/dead cells and biofilm thickness. The solution-diffusion model was applied to identify the role of biofilm on the solute retention. The results showed that dead cells in feed water had the same potential to cause biofouling as live cells. After excluding the flux effect, we observed an increase in PhAC rejection during biofouling with live cells due to the dominant steric exclusion. However, PhAC rejection decreased significantly during biofouling with dead cells. It was explained that dead cells could enhance cell activity in feed water and increase total biomass, cell counts and biofilm thickness on membrane surfaces, which improved the biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure (BEOP). Our study will give implication in further research on the dead cells in feed water and the removal of PhACs by NF/RO membrane under the biofouling condition.

AB The use of consumer products and pharmaceuticals that act as contaminants entering waterways through runoff and wastewater effluents alters aquatic ecosystem health. Traditional toxicological endpoints may underestimate the toxicity of contaminants, as lethal concentrations are often orders of magnitude higher than those found within freshwater ecosystems. While newer techniques examine the metabolic responses of sublethal contaminant exposure, there has been no direct comparison with ontogeny in Daphnia. It was hypothesized that Daphnia magna would have distinct metabolic changes after 3 different sublethal contaminant exposures, because of differences in the toxic mode of action and ontogeny. To test this hypothesis, the proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiles were measured in D. magna aged day 0 and 18 after exposure to 28% of the lethal concentration of 50% of organisms tested (LC50) of atrazine, propranolol, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) for 48 h. Principal component analysis revealed significant separation of contaminants from the control daphnids in both neonates and adults exposed to propranolol and PFOS. In contrast, atrazine exposure caused separation from the controls in only the adult D. magna. Minimal ontogenetic changes in the targeted metabolites were seen after exposure to propranolol. For both atrazine and PFOS exposures ontogeny exhibited unique changes in the targeted metabolites. These results indicate that, depending on the contaminant studied, neonates and adults respond uniquely to sublethal contaminant exposure. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Laboratory tests were conducted with four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and ketoprofen) under different redox conditions (aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic and sulfate reducing conditions) in order to assess abiotic and biotic degradation in a river water/sediment system. The river water was sampled from Sperchios River and the sediment was collected from the banks of a rural stream where the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant is located. To quantitatively describe degradation kinetics of the selected compounds, pseudo first-order kinetics were adopted. According to the results, it can be stated that the concentration of the substances remained constant or decreased only marginally (p >= 0.05) in the sterile experiments and this excludes abiotic processes such as hydrolysis or sorption as major removal mechanisms of the target compounds from the water phase and assign their removal to microbial action. Results showed that the removal rate of the compounds decreases as dissolved oxygen concentration in the river water/sediment system decreases. All compounds were found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions at dissipation half-lives between 1.6 and 20.1 days, while dissipation half-lives for naproxen and ketoprofen increase by a factor of 2 under all tested conditions in the absence of oxygen.

AB The present study evaluates the effect of integrated nanobio approach involving nanoscale magnesium oxide (n-MgO) and yeast Candida sp. SMN04 on cefdinir degradation in aqueous medium. The nanoparticle was chemically synthesized and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDAX analysis, and particle size analyser. Nano-bio integrated system was prepared using chemically synthesized n-MgO (10 mg mL(-1)), coated onto the surface of yeast cells without causing any lethal effects to the cell. Cefdinir (250 mg L-1) degradation was studied using individual and nano-bio integrated system both. Nano-bio integrated system was found to be more effective for cefdinir degradation compared to native yeast cell. The adherence of nanoparticles on the surface of the yeast cells increased the permeability of the cell membrane, thereby enhancing the entry of cefdinir into the cell. The kinetic data showed the half-life of cefdinir, which was 1.46 days for integrated system and 2.97 days for native yeast, which confirmed that the integrated approach reduced the half-life to less than half of the time taken by the yeast alone. This study signifies the potential efficacy of the nanobio integrated approach to serve as an effective remedial tool for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The influence of iron species on amoxicillin (AMX) degradation, intermediate products generated and toxicity during the photo-Fenton process using a solar simulator were evaluated in this work. The AMX degradation was favored in the presence of the potassium ferrioxalate complex (FeOx) when compared to FeSO4. Total oxidation of AMX in the presence of FeOx was obtained after 5 min, while 15 min were necessary using FeSO4. The results obtained with Daphnia magna biossays showed that the toxicity decreased from 65 to 5% after 90 min of irradiation in the presence of FeSO4. However, it increased again to a maximum of 100% after 150 min, what indicates the generation of more toxic intermediates than AMX, reaching 45% after 240 min. However, using FeOx, the inhibition of mobility varied between 100 and 70% during treatment, probably due to the presence of oxalate, which is toxic to the neonates. After 240 min, between 73 and 81% TOC removal was observed. Different pathways of AMX degradation were suggested including the opening of the four-membered beta-lactamic ring and further oxidations of the methyl group to aldehyde and/or hydroxylation of the benzoic ring, generating other intermediates after bound cleavage between different atoms and further oxidation to carboxylates such acetate, oxalate and propionate, besides the generation of nitrate and ammonium.

AB Degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol by ozonation in aqueous solution was studied in a semi batch reactor under constant ozone dosage and variable pH conditions. The effectiveness of the process was estimated based on the degree of conversion of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol. It was observed that ozonation is more effective at alkaline reaction of medium than other conditions. The degree of conversion achieved (at the first 5 minutes of the process) at pH 9 was 99.64% compared to 99.03% and 77.35% at pH 7 and 3, respectively. Another parameter used to quantify the 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol during ozonation was the pseudo first order rate constant k [min(-1)]. Results showed that the rate constant of the process was approximately much higher at the alkaline pH compared to acidic ones. A considerable improvement in chemical oxygen demand removal was observed at pH above 7. At pH 9, the reduction in chemical oxygen demand at the end of the process reached 56.9 %. The degree of organically bounded nitrogen conversion to nitrate was higher at pH 3. Of the total organic carbon reduction, 15.89 % was observed at pH 9. The 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol degradation intermediate products were analyzed by mass-spectrometry. The main intermediate product was chlorophenol.

AB Nanomolar concentrations of steroid hormones such as 17 beta-estradiol can influence the reproductive development and sex ratios of invertebrate and vertebrate populations. Thus their release into surface and ground waters from wastewater facilities and agricultural applications of animal waste is of environmental concern. Many of these compounds are chromophoric and susceptible to photolytic degradation. High intensity UV-C radiation has been demonstrated to degrade some of these compounds in engineered systems. However, the degradation efficacy of natural solar radiation in shallow fresh waters is less understood. Here photolytic experiments with 17 beta-estradiol demonstrated modest photodegradation (similar to 26%) when exposed to simulated sunlight between 290 and 720 nm. Photodegradation significantly increased (similar to 40-50%) in the presence of 2.0-15.0 mg/l of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from humic acids of the Suwannee River, GA. However, rates of photodegradation reached a threshold at approximately 5.0 mg/l DOC. Observed suppression of photolysis in the presence of a radical inhibitor (i.e. 2-propanol) indicated that a significant proportion of the degradation was due to radicals formed from the photolysis of DOC. Although photodegradation was greatest in full sunlight containing UV-B (290-320 nm), degradation was also detected with UV-A (320-400 nm) and visible light (400-720 nm) alone. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals and many other chemicals are an important basis for nearly all sectors including for example, food and agriculture, medicine, plastics, electronics, transport, communication, and many other products used nowadays. This comes along with a tremendous chemicalization of the globe, including ubiquitous presence of products of chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the aquatic environment. Use of these products will increase with population growth and living standard as will the need for clean water. In addition, climate change will exacerbate availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality. Since its implementation, conventional wastewater treatment has increasingly contributed to environmental protection and health of humans. However, with the increasing pollution of water by chemicals, conventional treatment turned out to be insufficient. It was also found that advanced effluent treatment methods such as extended filtration, the sorption to activated charcoal or advanced oxidation methods have their own limitations. These are, for example, increased demand for energy and hazardous chemicals, incomplete or even no removal of pollutants, the generation of unwanted products from parent compounds (transformation products, TPs) of often-unknown chemical structure, fate and toxicity. In many countries, effluent treatment is available only rarely if at all let alone advanced treatment. The past should teach us, that focusing only on technological approaches is not constructive for a sustainable water quality control. Therefore, in addition to conventional and advanced treatment optimization more emphasis on input prevention is urgently needed, including more and better control of what is present in the source D water. Measures for input prevention are known for long. The main focus though has always been on the treatment, and measures taken at the source have gained only little attention so far. A more effective and efficient approach, however, would be to avoid pollution at the source, which would in turn allow more targeted treatment to meet treated water quality objectives globally. New developments within green and sustainable chemistry are offering new approaches that allow for input prevention and a more targeted treatment to succeed in pollution elimination in and at the source. To put this into practice, engineers, water scientists and chemists as well as microbiologists and scientists of other related disciplines need to cooperate more extensively than in the past. Applying principles such as the precautionary principle, or keeping water flows separate where possible will add to this. This implies not minimizing the efforts to improve wastewater treatment but to design effluents and chemicals in such a way that treatment systems and water environments can cope successfully with the challenge of micropollutants globally (Kummerer et al., 2018).
   This paper therefore presents in its first part some of the limitations of effluent treatment in order to demonstrate the urgent need for minimizing water pollution at the source and, information on why source management is urgently needed to improve water quality and stimulate discussions how to protect water resources on a global level. Some principles of green and sustainable chemistry as well as other approaches, which are part of source management, are presented in the second part in order to stimulate discussion.

AB This research investigates atenolol (ATL) removal from the aqueous solution by a combination of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) and sodium persulfate (HC-PS) as zero-waste discharge process. The effect of pH, reaction time, PS dose, initial ATL concentration, coexisting anions and natural organic matters (NOMs) has been studied. The highest ATL removal by HC and HC-PS processes was obtained at pH 3 and 6, respectively. The presence of coexisting anions viz., Cl-, NO3?, I? , SO42? , and PO43?promoted the degradation of ATL, while the efficiency of ATL degradation was inhibited by the presence HCO3? and CO32? anions and NOMs. The highest synergetic and strongest inhibition effect of ATL degradation by the HC-PS process was observed in the presence of SO42?ions (synergetic index value, 4.61) and CO32? ions (synergetic index value, 0.44). Radical trapping experiments showed that the relative contributions of hydroxyl and sulfate radical to degrade ATL were 41.7% and 58.3%, respectively. In case of HC-PS process, degradation initiated with the protonation of ATL in the presence of free active radicals was followed by the ether bond cleavage, oxidation of primary and secondary amine moieties, and finally mineralization. The HC-PS process is proved to be a potential treatment method to destroy pharmaceutical pollutants from water and wastewater sources.

AB Four bench-scale sponge-based aerobic nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were used to treat municipal wastewater containing typical pharmaceuticals (1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L). This preliminary research aims to investigate the effects of sulfadiazine (SDZ), ibuprofen (IBU) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on nitrification performance and explore specific microbial diversity and functional gene (Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), amoA) of MBBRs. After 90 days of operation, the MBBR without pharmaceuticals could remove up to 97.4 +/- 1.5% of NH4+-N while the removals of NH4+-N by the MBBRs with SDZ, IBU and CBZ were all suppressed to varying degrees. Based on the Shannon and Chao 1 index, the specific microbial diversity and richness in biofilm samples increased at a range of 1 mg/L to 2 mg/L pharmaceuticals (SDZ, IBU or CBZ) and started decreasing after the pharmaceutical concentration was higher than 2 mg/L. The determination of functional gene (AOB amoA) showed that Proteobacteria was the most dominant bacteria within all biofilms with the relative abundance ranging from 24.81% to 55.32%. Furthermore, Nitrosomonas was the most numerous genus in AOB, followed by Campylobacter and Thauera, whose relative abundance shifted under the pressure of different pharmaceuticals.

AB Water pollution due to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has been gaining attention of researchers all over the world. The heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation in the presence of semiconductor and UV radiation has been getting much more attention because it is an efficient, inexpensive, eco-friendly method and doses not left any waste material in water/wastewater. In the present study, photocatalytic degradation of rizatriptan benzoate (RTB) has been investigated using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst. The photocatalytic degradation activity of the nanocatalyst has been evaluated on the basis of Langmuir kinetic model. The effects of pH, concentration of H2O2 added, initial drug concentration and dosage of the catalyst have also been investigated. The best possible conditions for the degradation of the drug have been evaluated and found drug concentration 0.3 mg/mL, pH 11.5, and dose of catalyst 10 mg was optimum for this experiment. The effect of hydrogen peroxide on the degradation process was also done to study the effect of the electron acceptor and it was found that in the following process generation of hydroxyl radicals and retardation of electron-hole recombination both takes place. It was found by this study that photocatalytic degradation by titanium dioxide is a proficient, cost-effective and more rapidly form of degradation rizatriptan benzoate from aqueous solution.

AB The purpose of this research was the preparation and photocatalytic evaluation of a novel nanocomposite (NC) based on Fe3O4/ZnO, to eliminate four persistent antibiotics in surface waters: sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin and roxithromycin. Prior to the operation of the photocatalytic reactor, the influence of pH (3-9), catalyst concentration (50-800 mg L-1), oxidant dose (0-100 mg L-1) and concentration of different targets (10-100 mu g L-1) on the catalytic efficiency was evaluated. The analysis of reaction kinetics showed that degradation processes of the four antibiotics followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Antibiotics adsorption onto the nanocomposite surface depended on their electrostatic nature and played an important role when decreasing the initial concentration of antibiotics. In this context, kinetic rates were higher at lower initial levels of organic pollutants, which is a favourable effect from a practical application perspective. On the other hand, a synergistic effect of the available Fe in the nanocomposite was found, contributing to the oxidation of antibiotics by photo-Fenton as a secondary reaction. Then, a magnetic photocatalytic reactor was operated under optimal conditions. The enhanced photonic efficiency of Fe3O4/ZnO in the system, as well as the ease of the magnetic separation and catalyst reusability, indicate the viability of this reactor configuration.

AB In the present study, snO(2) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by chemical precipitation method using anhydrous aspartic acid and surfactant at two annealing temperatures, 300 degrees C and 600 degrees C. The effect of surfactants cationic CTAB and anionic SDS on the synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were studied elaborately. In this article, for the first time, SnO2 NPs were employed as an excellent photo catalyst in the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a popular antiepileptic drug which is most commonly detected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in municipal wastewater under UV-C light irradiation. Comparative studies between the photocatalytic activity of SnO2 NPs synthesized with CTAB (SC1) and SDS (SS1) on the degradation of the CBZ drug were investigated. Parameters like the effect of catalytic loading, initial concentration, pH and contact time were also studied for optimization. The results indicate that SC1 is a better photocatalyst with rate constant 6.66 x 10(-2) min(-1) than SS1 with rate 5.7 x 10(-2) min(-1). To determine the transformation product formed on the photodegradation LCMS (ESI) analysis was done. The synthesized SnO2 NPs can be recycled up to 8th cycles without any notable alteration in its photocatalytic activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Amoxicillin is widely used as an antibiotic in the modern medicine. Due to its chemical structure, polarity, activity level, antibiotic specifications, and environmental sustainability, Amoxicillin leaks into the ground waters, surface waters, and drinking water wells. Many physical and chemical methods have been suggested for removing Amoxicillin from aquatic environments. However, these methods are very costly and have many performance problems. In this study, biodegradation of Amoxicillin by submerged biological aerated filter was evaluated in the aquatic environment. In order to assess the Amoxicillin removal from the aquatic environment, this bioreactor was fed with synthetic wastewater based on sucrose and Amoxicillin at three concentration levels and four hydraulic retention times. The maximum efficiencies for Amoxicillin and soluble chemical oxygen demand removal were 50.7 and 45.7%, respectively. The study findings showed that Stover-Kincannon model had very good fitness in loading Amoxicillin in the biofilter (R-2 > 99%). There was no accumulation of Amoxicillin in the biofilm and the loss of Amoxicillin in the control reactor was negligible. This shows that Amoxicillin removal from the system was due to biodegradation. It can be concluded that there was no significant inhibition effect on mixed aerobic microbial consortia. It was also observed that Amoxicillin degradation was dependent on the amount of Amoxicillin present in the influent and by increasing the initial Amoxicillin concentration, Amoxicillin biodegradation increased as well.

AB The emulsion liquid membrane technique was used for the extraction of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution of waste sodium clichromate recovered from the pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, Span-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent. Trioctyl amine and Aliquat-336 were used as carriers. The emulsion stability was carried out at different surfactant concentration, agitation speed and emulsification time. Statistical experimental design was applied for the optimization of process parameters for the extraction of chromium by emulsion liquid membrane. The effects of process parameters namely, agitation speed, membrane to emulsion (M/E) ratio and carrier concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using a response surface method. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium (VI) using response surface methodology for Trioctyl amine were: agitation speed - 201.369 rpm, M/E ratio - 0.5887% (v/v) and carrier concentration - 4.0932% (v/v) and for Aliquat-336: agitation speed 202.097 rpm, M/E ratio - 0.5873% (v/v) and carrier concentration - 3.9211% (v/v). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 89.2% and 96.15% using Trioctyl amine and Aliquat-336, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) inhabiting UK rivers contaminated with estrogenic effluents from wastewater treatment works show altered sexual development, including intersex, and this can impact negatively on their reproductive capabilities. The molecular events underlying these disruptions in gender assignment, however, are still poorly understood. In this study, two isoforms of aromatase (cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b) were cloned from the roach, and effects of exposure to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) during early life were determined on the expression of both aromatases and on the estrogen receptors (ERs) (subtypes esr1 and esr2b) and analyzed against effects on the progression of gonadal sex differentiation. Exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 during the critical period of sex differentiation resulted in gonadal feminization and all roach exposed to 4 ng EE2/l were females. These effects on gonadal development were associated with alterations in the expression of both esr and cyp19a1 genes in bodies and heads of exposed fish with the most marked effects on the expression of esr1 and cyp19a1b. Our findings show that both aromatase isoforms and both ER subtypes are associated with sexual differentiation in roach, and alterations in their expression can signal for disruptions in sexual development.

AB This work aimed to isolate and identify the culturable bacterial strains from five enriched cultures and investigate the capability of these strains to biodegrade paroxetine (Prx) or bezafibrate (Bzf), when assembled into consortia. Bacterial strains were isolated from cultures enriched with Prx and Bzf using, as microbial inocula, an estuarine sediment and activated sludge from an associated wastewater treatment plant. All the isolated strains were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Pharmaceutical compounds were analyzed by HPLC-DAD (diode array detector). Fluoride release was analyzed using a fluoride ion-selective electrode to evaluate the extent of paroxetine defluorination. High removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals (97 %) was observed for three of the five assembled consortia. A total of 28 bacterial strains were isolated from an activated sludge enrichment and 20 bacterial strains were isolated from an estuarine sediment enrichment. The genera Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were the most dominant in the consortia derived from activated sludge, while the genus Pseudomonas was dominant in the consortia derived from estuarine sediment. This work highlights the potential of native bacterial consortia obtained from different environmental sources to biodegrade Prx or Bzf, and unveils the taxonomic diversity associated to the biodegradation of these compounds. These consortia may be considered in the future for the development of new bioremediation tools for environmental restoration.

AB Iopromide (IOP) has been identified as one of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment processes, however, kinetic and intrinsic factors constraining its fast removal in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are yet to be resolved. Here oxidation of IOP by heat-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Rates of IOP degradation were enhanced by elevating solution temperature and acidity. An apparent kinetic rate equation was developed, based on the pseudo-first-order reaction model and assumption of steady state of SO4 center dot-. The common water constituents showed inhibitory effects on IOP decomposition to various extent. An insufficient supply of SO4 center dot- was considered as the major kinetic constraint. Eight byproducts were identified and most of which had intact triiodinated benzene ring. O-demethylation, oxidation of amino moiety and oxidation/elimination of alcohol groups are proposed as the primary degradation pathways, in accordance with the incomplete mineralization and non-detectable release of inorganic iodine. Quantum chemical calculations predict that oxidation of alkyl chains of IOP preferentially occurs and IOP byproducts with shorter side chains and intact triiodinated ring are more reactive than IOP. By virtue of the identified kinetic and intrinsic constraints, strategies to maximize degradation efficiency of IOP are proposed.

AB The ability to determine accurately the fate of APIs in soil is essential for rigorous risk assessment associated with wastewater reuse or biosolid recycling to land, particularly in lower income countries where water and fertiliser is scarce. Four APIs (naproxen, ofloxacin, propranolol and nevirapine) with wide ranging functionality were used as examples in the development of the OECD 106 soil partitioning and/or degradation study, with naproxen used to illustrate applying the full methodology. The data showed key methodological criteria require careful consideration and testing to generate accurate and consistent results. Only glass fibre membranes were suitable for all APIs, without unduly adsorbing APIs to their surface, thus effectively restricting the minimum practical pore size to 0.7 mu m. Polypropylene plastic centrifuge tubes were shown to be suitable, with careful determination of recoveries. Direct injection liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry could reliably resolve all 4 APIs down to less than mu g L-1 in soil solutions, although allowance for matrix effects via standard additions was required in some cases. Greatest analytical challenges were found for the highest molecular weight API with the greatest affinity for sorption to surfaces (ofloxacin). Key variables that can impact on partitioning such as solution pH and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were shown to vary within tests over time and should be accounted for.

AB Water scarcity is a worldwide problem boosted by global warming and pollution of anthropogenic origin. The contaminants of emerging concern in water sources are increasing due to the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatments, and these should be mitigated. Advanced oxidation processes appear as suitable solutions for decontamination. The photocatalytic oxidation of the mixture of sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and lorazepam was investigated. TiO2 modified by Ag and TiO2 modified by Pd were used as photocatalysts to improve photoactivity. The impact of light wavelengths was examined using UVA and visible radiation as well as natural sunlight. Visible light revealed the lowest ability for decontamination in 60 min of irradiation through Ag and Pd-TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation. On the other hand, UVA and sunlight in the presence of photocatalysts were able to totally remove the contaminants. This can be related to the high production of reactive oxidative species at those conditions. The increase of the noble metal load promotes the improvement of the decontamination efficiency. The kinetic rate was analyzed for UVA and sunlight radiation for different photocatalytic conditions. The presence of a natural light source without energy costs leads to an increase in the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant. Sunlight radiation with a suitable photocatalyst can be a very good option for water decontamination.

AB Our research investigated the hormesis effect of cefradine on the specific growth rates (mu) of single-celled algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) from aqueous solutions. We found the specific growth rate of C. reinhardtii slightly increased with cefradine concentrations within the range 0.5-10 mg/L. Effects of algae density, initial solution pH, and temperature on the adsorption batch assays were investigated. The optimum conditions for cefradine adsorption occurred at a density of 5 x 10(6) algae cells/mL, a solution pH of 7.0, and a temperature of 25.0 degrees C. A Box-ehnken design was employed to evaluate correlations between influential factors and cefradine adsorption. The results showed a significant interaction between algae density and temperature. The maximum removal rate could reach 50.13% under the optimal conditions. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms were explored through Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamics. The results suggested that the adsorption process was monolayer, spontaneous, and endothermic with an increase in randomness at the algae solution interface, which followed a pseudo-second-order model. All the data indicated that the alga performed a better removal capacity in the antibiotic-containing wastewater treatment process. This study lays the groundwork for a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between cefradine and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in water solutions under dark condition.

AB The current study was carried out to investigate the efficiency of using magnetic mesoporous of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized silica-coated magnetite for removing amoxicillin (AMX) and tetracycline (TC) from tap water, river water, and medical wastewater as real samples. The properties of the synthesized adsorbent were characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, pH(pzc), and also Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) methods. The BET surface area and the average diameter of mesoporous Fe3O4/SiO2/CTAB-SiO2 in accordance with TEM were 157.8 m(2) g(-1) and around 55 nm, respectively. In batch tests, the adsorption parameters, including the initial concentration, contact time, pH of solution, ionic strength, and adsorbent dose, were analysed. The experimental adsorption data were modelled using different classical and recently developed models. According to the results, the maximum adsorption capacities of AMX and TC on mesoporous Fe3O4/SiO2/CTAB-SiO2 were found to be 362.66 and 220.70 mg g(-1), respectively. Also, the results indicated that AMX and TC loaded on the adsorbent could be easily desorbed with 0.1 mol L-1 HNO3 (+) acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) and the adsorbent showed good reusability for the adsorption of the drugs studied.

AB Progestins are utilized as a component of human contraceptives, and commonly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluent. Certain progestins activate fish androgen receptors and cause decreases in fecundity and masculinization of females. We used a nest acquisition assay and computer-assisted sperm analysis to examine the effects of levonorgestrel on male fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) reproductive fitness. Males were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d. Combinations of a control male and a male from one of the treatments were placed into a competitive nesting assay, and the time each male spent holding the nest and time spent exhibiting aggressive behaviors were analyzed at 48 h postexposure. Semen samples were analyzed for total motility, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, linearity, beat cross frequency, and wobble at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 s postactivation. Males exposed to either 10 or 100 ng/L of levonorgestrel exhibited increased nest acquisition success and lower levels of aggression compared with control-control pairings, as well as decreases in multiple sperm motion characteristics. Our results suggest that further research is required to ascertain the effects of levonorgestrel on male gamete quality and reproductive behaviors. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB This study showed that substituted anilines of environmental concerns could be appreciably degraded by potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) in the pH range of 6-10 with apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) varying from 0.32 to 36,500 M-1 s(-1). The pH-dependence rate curves were well fitted via a kinetic model, which involved the formation of intermediates between Fe(VI) and substituted anilines. The plausible degradation pathways were proposed including the generation of aniline radical cations and their further oxidation to nitrobenzene compounds or dimerization to azobenzene compounds. Humic acid (HA) significantly reduced the transformation rates of substituted anilines with Fe(VI) even though considering the effect of oxidant consumption. This suppression effect likely resulted from the reaction between HA and the aniline radical cation, where the aniline radical cation was turned back to parent compound. Meanwhile, it was found that HA also had an impact on the formation kinetics of oxidation products. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) for degradation of substituted anilines in natural water was evaluated, where background matrix constituents could affect both the kinetics of contaminants degradation and products formation, similar to the case of HA. These results have advanced the understanding of Fe(VI) chemistry involved in water and wastewater treatment.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS), two of the most commonly used antimicrobial compounds, can be introduced into ecosystems by applying wastewater treatment plant biosolids to agricultural fields. Concentrations of TCC and TCS were measured in different trophic levels within a terrestrial food web encompassing land-applied biosolids, soil, earthworms (Lumbricus), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and eggs of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius) at an experimental site amended with biosolids for the previous 7 years. The samples from this site were compared to the same types of samples from a reference (biosolids-free) agricultural site. Inter-site comparisons showed that concentrations of both antimicrobials were higher on the experimental site in the soil, earthworms, mice (livers), and European starling eggs, but not American kestrel eggs, compared to the control site. Inter-species comparisons on the experimental site indicated significantly higher TCC concentrations in mice (TCC: 12.6-33.3 ng/g) and in starling eggs (TCC: 15.4-31.4 ng/g) than in kestrel eggs (TCC: 3.6 ng/g). Nesting success of kestrels only was significantly lower on the experimental site compared to the reference site due to nest abandonment. This study demonstrates that biosolids-derived TCC and TCS are present throughout the terrestrial food web, including secondary (e.g., starlings) and tertiary (i.e., kestrels) consumers, after repeated, long-term biosolids application.

AB In the past few years, the improvement of advanced analytical tools allowed to confirm the presence of trace amounts of metabolized and unchanged active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as in freshwater surfaces. It is known that the continuous contact with APIs, even at very low concentrations (ng L-1-mu gL(-1)), leads to serious human health problems. In this context, this work shows the feasibility of using ionic-liquid-based aqueous biphasic systems (IL-based ABS) in the extraction of quinolones present in aqueous media. In particular, ABS composed of imidazolium- and phosphonium-based ILs and aluminium-based salts (already used in water treatment plants) were evaluated in one-step extractions of six fluoroquinolones (FQs), namely ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and sarafloxacin, and extraction efficiencies up to 98% were obtained. Despite the large interest devoted to IL-based ABS as extractive systems of outstanding performance, their recyclability/reusability has seldomly been studied. An efficient extraction/cleaning process of the IL-rich phase is here proposed by FQs induced precipitation. The recycling of the IL and its further reuse without losses in the ABS extractive performance for FQs were established, as confirmed by the four consecutive removal/extraction cycles evaluated. This novel recycling strategy supports IL-based ABS as sustainable and cost-efficient extraction platforms.

AB In this study, the rejection of surfactant (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, SDBS) was investigated at different feed solution (FS) chemistries (ionic strengths and SDBS concentrations, with and without the presence of organic foulants BSA and Alg-Na), temperatures and flow velocities in the forward osmosis (FO) process. SDBS rejection increased with the increase of flow velocity and the decrease of temperature and SDBS concentration; while it had no obvious change with the increasing FS ionic strength. SOBS rejection of FO membrane was high (more than 99.77%), mainly due to the size exclusion. Moreover, the water flux and effectiveness of physical cleaning were also measured. SDBS impacted water flux by two ways: one was the positive role that SDBS micelles enhanced the hydrophilia of membrane; the other one was the negative role that SDBS formed a gel cake layer and increase the resistance. The membrane fouling caused by Alg-Na increased solute rejection and water flux in the FO mode, which was beneficial to the total membrane process. Though BSA fouling increased solute rejection in the PRO mode, it declined water flux, and caused a severe pore blocking which was hard to remove just by the simple rinse. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Four UF membranes (denoted GH, GK, PT and PW with MWCO of 1000, 2000, 5000 and 20,000 Da, respectively) and four NF membranes (denoted DL, CK, DK and HL, with an approximate MWCO of 150-300 Da in all cases) were used for the filtration of an effluent generated in a municipal wastewater plant after a secondary treatment. The influence of the most important operating variables (nature and MWCO of the membranes, transmembrane pressure, tangential velocity, and temperature) on the permeate flux was widely discussed, and the resistances to the permeate flux were determined following the resistances in series model. Rejection coefficients for parameters that measure the global pollutant content of the effluent (chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, absorbance at 254 nm, turbidity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were also evaluated, and the results revealed that both UF and NF are feasible options for the treatment of this effluent, yielding a permeate stream that can be reused in several applications. Finally, 28 pharmaceutical compounds were initially detected in this effluent, and their respective rejection coefficients were determined, with eliminations higher than 75% in the case of NF with the HL membrane. Therefore, it is concluded that NF is an excellent option for the removal of toxic pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewaters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concern over pharmaceuticals and their toxicity in wastewater and drinking water has grown over the past decade. In this study, the common analgesic, acetaminophen, was chlorinated with sodium hypochlorite to determine the effects of pH and chlorine-to-pharmaceutical molar ratios on the degradation of acetaminophen and the formation of the toxic byproduct 1,4-benzoquinone. Reactions were studied for pH 6.0, 7.5 and 9.0 at average molar ratios of 106 +/- 6, 1,417 +/- 285, and 9,789 +/- 1,430 over a period of 100 minutes. The degradation of acetaminophen and the formation of 1,4-benzoquinone were monitored using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Results indicate that acetaminophen is most reactive with free chlorine at pH 9.0 and least reactive at pH 6.0. As pH increased, degradation of acetaminophen also increased. The formation of 1,4-benzoquinone was also affected by pH and its concentration reached a maximum of 68.7% of the initial acetaminophen concentration when the pH was at 6.0, the molar ratio at 1,275, and after a contact time of 30 minutes. At all pH values the rate of degradation of acetaminophen was slowest at a molar ratio of about 100, and highest at a molar ratio of about 10,000.

AB The degradation of diclofenac sodium (DCF) in pre-magnetization Fe-0/persulfate (Pre-Fe-0/PS) and Fe-0/PS systems were studied in detail in this study. The influencing operational conditions (initial PS dosage, Fe(0)dosage, and pH) were studied for their effects on the DCF degradation. The removal rate constant for DCF by the Pre-Fe-0/PS system was 2.1-6.2 times higher than that of the Fe-0/PS system. A higher TOC removal efficiency (81.5%) was observed during the mineralization of DCF in the Pre-Fe-0/PS process than that of the Fe-0/PS process (70%). The results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirmed that the Pre-Fe-0/PS system could produce much more(center dot)OH and SO(4)(-center dot)at a faster rate than the Fe-0/PS system. Moreover, the degradation mechanism of DCF by the Pre-Fe-0/PS process was elucidated. This work would provide a perspective on the Pre-Fe-0/PS process for efficient degradation of DCF, exhibiting advantages to removing DCF, such as broaden the range of working pH and reduce the amount of chemicals. So, it is an efficient and potential method to remove DCF from wastewater by the Pre-Fe-0/PS process.

AB Organoclays have been applied as efficient adsorbents for pharmaceutical pollutants from aqueous solution. In this work, dodecylpyridinium chloride (C(12)pyCl) and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (C(16)pyCl) cationic surfactants were used for the preparation of organobentonites destined for diclofenac sodium (DFNa) adsorption, an anionic drug widely detected in wastewater. The organofunctionalization of the clay samples was performed under microwave irradiation at 50 degrees C for 5 min with surfactant amounts of 100% and 200% in relation to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the pristine bentonite. The amount of incorporated ammonium salts based on CHN elemental analysis was higher for all samples prepared with 200% of the CEC. The basal spacings of the organoclays ranged from 1.54 to 2.13 nm, indicating the entrance of organic cations into the interlayer spacing of the clay samples, and the spacing depended on the size of the alkyl organic chain. The hydrophobic character of the organobentonites was verified by thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption isotherms showed that the drug capacity adsorption was influenced by the amount of surfactant incorporated into the bentonite, the packing density and the arrangement of the surfactants in the interlayer spacing. Zeta potential measurements of the organobentonites and FTIR analysis after drug adsorption suggested that electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions contributed to the mechanism of adsorption.

AB This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Fe(III)-EDDS complex for degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in a solar photo-Fenton-like process at neutral pH in two different aqueous matrixes. Electrochemical experiments were performed to monitor the formation and stability of the complex, as a function of the amount of complexing agent and pH. Eight compounds, including diazepam, dipyrone, fluoxetine, furosemide, nimesulide, paracetamol, progesterone, and propranolol, were analyzed in distilled water and simulated wastewater, at initial concentrations of 500 mu g L-1. By applying Doehlert matrix design and the response surface methodology the optimal experimental conditions were found to be 0.28 mmol L-1 Fe(III)-EDDS and 5.00 mmol L-1 H2O2, with a ratio of 1:2 for Fe(III)-EDDS. The most persistent transformation products (TPs) generated during the treatment process were investigated using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 16 TPs were identified and classified as having high toxicity (according to the Cramer rules), low biodegradability (according to the START scheme), and possible carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity. Most of the compounds were degraded in the first minutes of treatment, and most of the identified TPs had been successfully removed at the end of the process.

AB The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols to aminophenols by diverse catalysts has attracted much attention owing to its potential applications in wastewater purification, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical fields. Though great progress has been achieved, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols by different crystal phase structured Ni nanocrystals (NCs) has not been investigated until now. Here, the face centered cubic (fcc) Ni and hexagonal close packed (hcp) Ni NCs are controllably synthesized, and employed as the catalysts for hydrogenation of nitrophenols at ambient pressure by using NaBH4 as the hydrogen carrier. The experimental results reveal that both fcc and hcp Ni NCs can catalyze hydrogenation of nitrophenols to related aminophenols. But the hcp Ni NCs exhibit much higher catalytic activity than fcc Ni NCs no matter which nitrophenols is used. Moreover, both hcp and fcc Ni NCs can be recycled at least ten times without obvious loss of activity, showing an exceptional durability that comparable or even superior to supported Ni catalysts. Deduced from the kinetics and XPS analyses, the higher catalytic activity of hcp Ni NCs is attributed to the more richness of active sites on their surfaces in relative to that of fcc Ni NCs. This work may shed some light on design and development of advanced hydrogenation catalysts based on crystal phase engineering.

AB Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is a synthetic water-insoluble polymer widely used as fining agent in the wine industry for removing low-molecular-weight phenolics. Used PVPP, estimated in 2014 of 1037 tons, ends up in the municipal wastewater treatment plants with a detrimental environmental impact. Recycling of PVPP for obtaining fully reusable PVPP and wine phenolic concentrates for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries would increase the sustainability of its use. An ammoniacal solution of ethanol allows one to desorb with high recoveries (average 73%) the PVPP adsorbed phenolics with yields ranging from 2.82 to 10.80 g/kg of wet PVPP, depending on the wine. Extracts were nearly pure concerning the phenolics abundance (>89%), without need of further purification. The performance of the recycled PVPP for white wine fining was not significantly different from that of the new PVPP, which can be recycled at least four times without loss of fining performance and allow a good recovery of adsorbed phenolics to be maintained. Results obtained in this work show that by using a simple, cheap, and eco-friendly recycling strategy, it is possible to reuse PVPP for wine fining, providing a cleaner winemaking process and additionally obtain wine phenolic concentrates with high purity, antioxidant, and bioactivity, valuable for other industries.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, including antimicrobials, can be found at trace levels in treated wastewater effluent. Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, Vibrio, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of similar to 5 ppm) can induce a significant Vibrio growth response (68-1,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial -community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of Vibrio in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels.

AB Surface water from 38 streams nationwide was assessed using 14 target-organic methods (719 compounds). Designed-bioactive anthropogenic contaminants (biocides, pharmaceuticals) comprised 57% of 406 organics detected at least once. The 10 most-frequently detected anthropogenicorganics included eight pesticides (desulfinylfipronil, AMPA, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, metolachlor, atrazine, CIAT, glyphosate) and two pharmaceuticals (caffeine, metformin) with detection frequencies ranging 66-84% of.all sites. Detected contaminant concentrations varied from less than 1 ng L-1 to greater than 10 mu g L-1, with 77 and 278 having median detected concentrations greater than 100 mu g L-1 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Cumulative detections and concentrations ranged 4-161 compounds (median 70) and 8.5-102 847 mu g L-1, respectively, and correlated significantly with wastewater discharge, watershed development, and toxic release inventory metrics. Log10 concentrations of widely monitored HHCB, triclosan, and carbamazepine explained 71-82% of the variability in the total number of compounds detected (linear regression; p-values: < 0.001-0.012), providing a statistical inference tool for unmonitored contaminants. Due to multiple modes of action, high bioactivity, biorecalcitrance, and direct environment application (pesticides), designed-bioactive organics (median 41 per site at fig L-1 cumulative concentrations) in developed watersheds present aquatic health concerns, given their acknowledged potential for sublethal "effects to sensitive species and lifecycle stages at low ng L-1.

AB This research addresses the potential for biochar to remove pharmaceuticals from synthetic urine, thereby allowing the treated urine to be used as a contaminant-free nutrient product. Four biochars and one activated carbon from different source materials were tested: activated coconut carbon, coconut shell, bamboo, southern yellow pine, and northern hardwood. Batch tests were conducted for 24 hours using different compositions of synthetic urine and secondary wastewater effluent with biochar doses of 0.8 and 40 g L-1 and an initial pharmaceutical concentration of 0.2 mmol L-1. Seven pharmaceuticals were tested in this study: acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, citalopram, carbamazepine, and diclofenac. Activated coconut carbon, bamboo, and southern yellow pine biochars had the highest pharmaceutical removal in urine compositions at 40 g L-1, adsorbing greater than 90% of each pharmaceutical. These biochars also demonstrated the ability to remove pharmaceuticals in the presence of nutrients, where the maximum removal of phosphorus and nitrogen was 36% by activated coconut carbon, 9% by bamboo, and 23% by southern yellow pine in all waste waters. Due to the high concentrations of nutrients naturally present in urine, there remains a high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus after biochar treatment. The interactions between biochar, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals suggest that biochar has the ability to remove pharmaceuticals while maintaining nutrient concentrations in solution for future use as a nutrient product.

AB Manganese dioxide formed in oxidation process by potassium permanganate exhibits promising adsorptive capacity which can be utilized to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. However, the structure variances of organic molecules lead to wide difference of adsorption efficiency. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a general relationship between removal rate of organic compounds and their quantum parameters. This study focused on building up quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models based on experimental removal rate (r (exp)) of 25 organic compounds and 17 quantum parameters of each organic compounds computed by Gaussian 09 and Material Studio 6.1. The recommended model is r (pre) = -0.502 -aEuro parts per thousand 7.742 f(+)(x) + 0.107 E (HOMO) + 0.959 q(H+) + 1.388 BO (x). Both internal and external validations of the recommended model are satisfied, suggesting optimum stability and predictive ability. The definition of applicability domain and the Y-randomization test indicate all the prediction is reliable and no possibility of chance correlation. The recommended model contains four variables, which are closely related to adsorption mechanism. f(+)(x) reveals the degree of affinity for nucleophilic attack. E (HOMO) represents the difficulty of electron loss. q(H+) reflect the distribution of partial charge between carbon and hydrogen atom. BO (x) shows the stability of a molecule.

AB Metronidazole (MNZ) is an antibiotic pollutant with a high occurrence in the ambient medium. In this study, the anode material Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce prepared in the lab was employed to investigate the feasibility of the electrochemical process to treat antibiotic in wastewater. The result showed that metronidazole could be effectively removed using Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce. The degradation efficiency of 88% was obtained under the current density 1.6 mA cm(-2), pH = 5.6 (not adjusted), electrolyte (Na2SO4) concentration of 0.2 M for electrolysis 2 h. The removal percentage was higher by 17% compared with the control when the bare Ti was applied. Meanwhile, the energy consumption on Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce was about one-seventh of that on Ti. The characterization of the material was conducted by the thermal field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce anode displayed compact, multi-porous morphology and good redox reversibility. The influencing factors such as current density, pH, concentration of Na2SO4, initial MNZ concentration were studied to obtain main factors and optimum conditions. In addition, a preliminary study on the mechanism of the electro-oxidation was carried out. The results demonstrate that chemisorbed oxygen has a dominant role in MNZ removal.

AB The biosorption potential of three fungal waste-biomasses (Acremonium strictum, Acremonium sp. and Penicillium sp.) from pharmaceutical companies was compared with that of a selected biomass (Cunninghamella elegans), already proven to be very effective in dye biosorption. Among the waste-biomasses, A. strictum was the most efficient (decolorization percentage up to 90% within 30 min) with regard to three simulated dye baths; nevertheless it was less active than C. elegans which was able to produce a quick and substantial decolorization of all the simulated dye baths (up to 97% within 30 min). The biomasses of A. strictum and C. elegans were then tested for the treatment of nine real exhausted dye baths. A. strictum was effective at acidic or neutral pH, whereas C. elegans confirmed its high efficiency and versatility towards exhausted dye baths characterised by different classes of dyes (acid, disperse, vat, reactive) and variation in pH and ionic strength. Finally, the effect of pH on the biosorption process was evaluated to provide a realistic estimation of the validity of the laboratory results in an industrial setting. The C. elegans biomass was highly effective from pH 3 to pH 11 (for amounts of adsorbed dye up to 1054 and 667 mg of dye g(-1) biomass dry weight, respectively); thus, this biomass can be considered an excellent and exceptionally versatile biosorbent material.

AB Aqueous solutions of a mixture of several pesticides (alachlor, atrazine, chlorfenvinphos, diuron and isoproturon), considered PS (priority substances) by the European Commission, and an intermediate product of the pharmaceutical industry (alpha-methylphenylglycine, MPG) chosen as a model industrial pollutant, have been degraded at pilot-plant scale using ozonation. This study is part of a large research project [CADOX Project, A Coupled Advanced Oxidation-Biological Process for Recycling of Industrial Wastewater Containing Persistent Organic Contaminants, Contract No.: EVK1-CT-2002-00122. European Commission, http://www.psa.es/webeng/projects/cadox/index.html [1]] founded by the European Union that inquires into the potential coupling between chemical and biological oxidations for the removal of toxic or non-biodegradable contaminants from water. The evolution of pollutant concentration, TOC mineralization, generation of inorganic species and consumption of 03 have been followed in order to visualize the chemical treatment effectiveness. Although complete mineralization is hard to accomplish, and large amounts of the oxidant are required to lower the organic content of the solutions, the possibility of ozonation cannot be ruled out if partial degradation is the final goal wanted. In this sense. Zahn-Wellens biodegradability tests of the ozonated MPG solutions have been performed, and the possibility of a further coupling with a secondary biological treatment for complete organic removal is envisaged.

AB The occurrence of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment has raised concerns due to their accumulation in the ecosystem. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using a Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) reactor for PPCPs removal from waterbody. Five model PPCP compounds including ibuprofen, oxybenzone, triclosan, bisphenol A and N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) were mixed and added to the culture medium. It shows that PPCP removal efficiencies of the RAB reactor ranged from 70% to 100%. The degradation of PPCPs by the RAB reactor contributed 90% PPCP removal while < 10% PPCPs removal was due to accumulation in the algal biomass. The nutrients removal performance of the RAB reactor was not affected by exposing to the PPCPs. The extracellular polysaccharides content of the biomass increased when exposing to PPCPs, while the extracellular proteins content remained constant. The Chl a content maintained constant in the PPCPs-treated biomass, but decreased in the biomass without PPCP treatment. It was also found that the microbial consortium of the RAB reactor was enriched with PPCPs degradation microorganisms with the progressing of feeding PPCPs. Collectively, this work demonstrates that the RAB system is a promising technology for removing PPCPs from wastewater.

AB A suitable porous adsorbent with prominent adsorption performance and better selectivity for the target containments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is highly desired in wastewater treatment. Owing to the intrinsic attributes known as predictable structure, tunable pore size, high chemical stability as well as the reliable post-synthetic modification, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as brilliant adsorbent candidates which have drawn great attentions. Herein, two COFs with different functional groups (COF-NO2 and COF-NH2) were designed and prepared in order to enhance selective adsorption ability toward the Ketoprofen (KTP) molecule via functional group tuning. For KTP, due to amino group which could interact with not only carboxylic acid but also carbonyl group, COF-NH2 exhibited twice adsorption capacity as high as other two counterparts Ibuprofen (IBP) and Naproxen (NPX). However, there was no selectivity for those three NSAIDs when COFs containing nitro groups (COF-NO2) were used as adsorbents. We also found that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model well, which confirmed the capture of KTP onto COF-NH2 was dominated by chemical adsorption. The COF-NH2 will be a particularly promising porous adsorbent to selectively eliminate the KTP from effluents, and COFs with specific binding sites for various pollutants can be acquired via functional group tuning.

AB The presence of contaminants in water is concerning due to the potential impacts on human health and the environment, and ingested contaminants cause harm in various ways. The conventional water treatment systems are not efficient to remove these contaminants. Therefore, novel techniques and materials for the removal of contaminants are increasingly being developed. The separation process using modified membranes can remove these micropollutants; therefore, they have attracted significant research attention. Among the materials used for manufacturing of these membranes, composites based on graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide are preferred owing to their promising properties, such as mechanical resistance, thermal and chemical stability, antifouling capacity, water permeability, high thermal and electrical conductivity, high optical transmittance and high surface area. Membrane separation processes (MSP) can be used as secondary or tertiary treatment during the supply of wastewater. However, the efficient and accessible applications of these technologies are challenging. This study aims to demonstrate the main concepts of membrane separation processes and their application in the removal of emerging contaminants. This study reports bibliometric mapping, relevant data on studies using membranes as water treatment processes, and their viability in industrial applications. The main challenges and perspectives of these technologies are discussed in detail as well.

AB Hospital wastewater is mainly a source of pharmaceutical compounds entering water resources. The presence of the residual pharmaceutical compounds, due to the inability of the conventional treatment processes, will lead to the introduction of these compounds into the environment and therefore will have its own environmental and health effects. In the present study, the degradation and mineralisation of cyclophosphamide from aqueous solution was investigated using the UV/Persulphate process and the effect of variables such as pH, persulphate concentration, reaction time, cyclophosphamide concentration, and mineralisation rate of cyclophosphamide were evaluated and compared with similar studies. The results of the study show that the pH of the process does not have much effect on the performance of the UV/Persulphate process and based on the results, the neutral pH was selected as the optimum pH. The concentration of 300 mg/L of persulphate was also obtained as the optimum concentration of persulphate. The kinetic analysis of decomposition also shows that the cyclophosphamide decomposition follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Also, the study of the mineralisation rate of cyclophosphamide shows that the UV/Persulphate process can complete the mineralisation of 50 mg/L cyclophosphamide within 210 min. Finally, according to the results, it can be concluded that the UV/Persulphate process can be an effective and promising process for the degradation and mineralisation of cyclophosphamide.

AB Pharmaceutical residue pollution remains as an underexplored issue, especially in Asian countries. Along with that line, the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in tap water and its associated potential health risks, involving a total of 80 Putrajaya residents. Besides, this study also aimed to evaluate public awareness (knowledge, attitude, and practice) levels with regards to pharmaceutical handling. The highest pharmaceutical residue occurrence was caffeine (0.38 ng/L) while the lowest was diclofenac (0.14 ng/L). These pharmaceutical residue occurrences in tap water were linked with rapid urbanization and industrialization in river water, poor removal efficiencies in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants as well as improper pharmaceutical waste handling and disposal from the general public. The potential health risks (RQ(T)) indicated residents in Putrajaya with ages between 61 and 75 were exposed to the highest health risks caused by the pharmaceutical residues in tap water. In general, low public awareness (knowledge, attitude, and practice) levels were identified with only 44.5% of Putrajaya population having good knowledge, 27.5% having good attitude and 1.6% having good practice related to pharmaceutical handling and its effect to tap water quality. Findings of this study reflected the importance of public awareness program to educate the general public on proper unused/expired handling and disposal to minimize pharmaceutical pollution.

AB Water from wastewater treatment plants contains concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds as high as micrograms per liter, which can adversely affect fish health and behavior, and contaminate the food chain. Here, we tested the ability of the common carp hepatic S9 fraction to produce the main metabolites from citalopram, metoprolol, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Metabolism in fish S9 fractions was compared to that in sheep. The metabolism of citalopram was further studied in fish. Our results suggest a large difference in the rate of metabolites formation between fish and sheep. Fish hepatic S9 fractions do not show an ability to form metabolites from venlafaxine, which was also the case for sheep. Citalopram, metoprolol, and sertraline were metabolized by both fish and sheep S9. Citalopram showed concentration-dependent N-desmethylcitalopram formation with V-max = 1781 pmol/min/mg and K-m = 29.7 mu M. The presence of ellipticine, a specific CYP1A inhibitor, in the incubations reduced the formation of N-desmethylcitalopram by 30-100% depending on the applied concentration. These findings suggest that CYP1A is the major enzyme contributing to the formation of N-desmethylcitalopram. In summary, the results from the present in vitro study suggest that common carp can form the major metabolites of citalopram, metoprolol, and sertraline.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the aquatic environment represents a worldwide threat. NSAIDs are considered "emerging contaminants" of water since the traditional methods are not designed to efficiently remove them. Aiming to overcome the limits of the conventional wastewater treatment plants, we propose molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as valid tools for selective adsorption and removal of these drugs from water. In particular, in this work, we have prepared diclofenac-selective MIP by a simple bulk polymerization process. After the characterization of the synthetized polymers, the binding abilities were evaluated in detail through the adsorption of diclofenac in aqueous solution and compared with the abilities of a corresponding non-imprinted polymer used as a reference. Thanks to the imprinting effect, the prepared MIP adsorbs with extreme selectivity its template molecule, i.e. the diclofenac. This effect was evaluated by testing the adsorption abilities towards different drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid and trimethoprim. In addition, MIP reusability was demonstrated after a simple regeneration step. The strength of this work is due to the low cost synthesis of MIP and to its optimal performance of molecular recognition in water, differentially from many of the traditional MIPs, usually used with organic solvent. Such peculiarities make the material potentially applicable for water treatment on a large scale.

TI Impacts of a Rural Subdivision on Groundwater Quality: Results of

AB A rural subdivision in south central Wisconsin was instrumented with monitoring wells and lysimeters before, during, and after its construction to examine the impacts of the unsewered subdivision on groundwater quality and quantity. Prior to construction, the 78-acre (32 ha) site was farmland. Sixteen homes were constructed beginning in 2003. Initial monitoring from 2002 to 2005 showed that groundwater beneath the site had been impacted by previous agricultural use, with nitrate-N values as high as 30 mg/L and some detections of the herbicide atrazine. Our 12-year study shows that the transition from agricultural to residential land use has changed groundwater quality in both negative and positive ways. Although groundwater elevations showed typical seasonal fluctuations each year, there were no measurable changes in groundwater levels or general flow directions during the 12-year study period. Chloride values increased in many wells, possibly as a result of road salting or water softener discharge. Nitrate concentrations varied spatially and temporally over the study period, with some initial concentrations substantially above the drinking water standard. In some wells, nitrate and atrazine levels have declined substantially since agriculture ceased. However, atrazine was still present at trace concentrations throughout the site in 2014. Wastewater tracers show there are small but detectable impacts from septic effluent on groundwater quality. Particle traces based on a groundwater flow model are consistent with the hypothesis that septic leachate has impacted groundwater quality.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a chiral fluorinated pharmaceutical mainly indicated for treatment of depression and is one of the most distributed drugs. There is a clear evidence of environmental contamination with this drug. Aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactors constitute a promising technology for wastewater treatment; however the removal of carbon and nutrients can be affected by micropollutants. In this study, the fate and effect of FLX on reactor performance and on microbial population were investigated. FLX adsorption/desorption to the aerobic granules was observed. FLX shock loads (<= 4 mu M) did not show a significant effect on the COD removal. Ammonium removal efficiency decreased in the beginning of first shock load, but after 20 days, ammonia oxidizing bacteria became adapted. The nitrite concentration in the effluent was practically null indicating that nitrite oxidizing bacteria was not inhibited, whereas, nitrate was accumulated in the effluent, indicating that denitrification was affected. Phosphate removal was affected at the beginning showing a gradual adaptation, and the effluent concentration was <0.04 mM after 70 days. A shift in microbial community occurred probably due to FIX exposure, which induced adaptation/restructuration of the microbial population. This contributed to the robustness of the reactor, which was able to adapt to the FLX load. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reclaimed water irrigation can satisfy increasing water demand, but it may also introduce pharmaceutical contaminants into the soil and groundwater environment. In this work, a range of laboratory experiments were conducted to test whether biochar can be amended in soils to enhance removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from reclaimed water. Eight types of biochar were tested in laboratory sorption experiments yielding solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d) of 2-104 L/kg. Two types of biochar with relatively high Kd were used in column leaching experiments to assess their effect on reclaimed water SMX transport through soils. Only about 2-14% of the SMX was transported through biochar-amended soils, while 60% was found in the leachate of the unamended soils. Toxicity characteristic leaching experiments confirmed that the mobility and bioavailability of SMX in biochar-amended soils were lower than that of unamended soils. However, biochar with high accumulations of SMX was still found to inhibit the growth of the bacteria compared to biochar with less SMX which showed no effects. Thus, biochar with very high pharmaceutical sorption abilities may find use as a low-cost alternative sorbent for treating wastewater plant effluent, but should be used with caution as an amendment to soils irrigated with reclaimed water or waste water.

TI Emerging pharmaceutical and organic contaminants removal using

DE Emerging organic contaminants; Carbon black waste; Adsorption;
   Antibiotics; Carboxymethylcellulose
AB The occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) such as chemicals in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, etc. in surface waters is a growing global concern. The discharge of most EOCs is not regulated, and EOCs have been shown to be toxic to both human and aquatic life even at low concentrations. In this work, acid-leached carbon black waste (LCBW), a carbonaceous residue from petroleum refineries, was investigated as a potential waste-derived adsorbent for the removal of EOCs. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, (CIPRO, antibiotic), sulfamethoxazole (SULFA, antibiotic), acetaminophen (ACET, pharmaceutical), bisphenol A (BPA, plasticizer) and N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET, insect repellent) were chosen as the target EOCs owing to their presence in relatively high concentrations in surface waters as well as in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants. LCBW, with a specific surface area of 409 m(2)/g, demonstrated 90-99% removal of 10 ppm CIPRO, BPA, and ACET and 70-80% removal of 10 ppm SULFA and DEET in tap water. Adsorption was rapid, particularly for CIPRO, BPA, and ACET, wherein >85% of the adsorption occurred within 1 h of contact time. To illustrate the potential of LCBW as an adsorbent in different physical forms, similar to 3 mm spherical beads of LCBW encapsulated within carboxymethyl cellulose matrix were prepared by a facile ionic gelation method and their adsorption performance was demonstrated.

AB Hospital discharge (HD) represents the primary point source of pharmaceutical components that may constitute not only a sharp risk of phytotoxic effects in food crops, but leaving behind the toxicity implications to the environment. The present work has been oriented to the scientific assessment of pharmaceutical compounds in HD. The phenological, physiological, and morphological changes, oxidative stress biomarkers, antioxidative responses, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration factor in relation to different concentrations of HD-induced irrigation in Ipomoea aquatica were evaluated; while the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell were assessed. Acetaminophen, metoprolol, atenolol, enalapril, and metformin were predominantly detected in the raw HD and bioaccumulated in I. aquatica. Concentration-dependent phenological inhibition, chlorophylls reductions, morphological distortions, reactive oxygen species generation, and antioxidant enzymes upregulation were recorded in the HD-irrigated I. aquatica. Drastic reductions in cell viability and increase of tail damage and tail moment indicated the metabolic alterations of mitochondrial function, and deoxyribonucleicacid (DNA) damage via oxidative stress and DNA adducts formation in the HD-treated groups. The diluted HD at 5% and 10 % could be feasibly reused for food crops irrigation, verified by the negligible phytotoxic implications in the plant model, bioaccumulation, and cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HepG2 cell.

AB Antibiotics are widely used in human medicine and veterinary production. Residues of these compounds reach the water sources through waste or direct application (e.g. aquaculture). The constant input of the parent drugs and their transformation products into the environment leads these pharmaceuticals to be considered as emerging pollutants. For some molecules, the pathway of degradation and formation in products is less known. To assess the impact of these substances in the environment and in the human health, it is necessary to elucidate the transformation products and their kinetic of degradation to evaluate the possible risks. In the present report, the characterization and the degradation kinetic of two widely used beta-lactams antibiotics - amoxidllin and ampidllin - was evaluated. Surface water samples containing these antibiotics were submitted to photolysis and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with Orbitrap detection in order to establish the profile of degradation and the formation of transformation products. Results showed that the degradation of amoxicillin and ampicillin is almost complete and reach their maximum at 48 h in river water. Moreover, a database containing >65 transformation products of amoxicillin and ampicillin was build and real samples of industrial wastewater were analyzed to investigate the occurrence of amoxicillin, ampicillin and their transformation products.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely used antiepileptic drug, is refractory to biological wastewater treatment. Rapid removal of CBZ is possible using synthetic manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) but the removal mechanisms require further investigation. In this study, CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 was carried out at different pH to further explore the degradation mechanisms. Results show that CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 was highly pH dependent, and rapid degradation occurred when pH b2.8. Based on the density functional theory calculations, increasing [H+] not only increased the reactivity of delta-MnO2, but also enhanced the secondary reactions of the intermediates. During the degradation process, protonation of CBZ degradation intermediates, instead of CBZ, played an important role. The overall kinetics of CBZ degradation was then described by the retarded first-order model. The initial rate (rinit) in the model between pH 2.0 and 6.2 was determined to be r(init) = (2.41 +/- 0.51) x 10(-3)[CBZ](1.21) [MnO2](1.07)[H+](1.41). This is the first report revealing that protonation of intermediates from CBZ degradation can improve the CBZ oxidation by delta-MnO2. The pathways of CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 were also proposed. The results of this study provide a new insight into the processing mechanism. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are discharged to the environment from wastewater resource recovery facilities, sewer overflows, and illicit sewer connections. To understand the fate of pharmaceuticals, there is a need to better understand their sorption dynamics to suspended sediments (SS) and settled sediments (StS) in sewer systems. In this study, such sorption dynamics to both SS and StS were assessed using a batch equilibrium method under both static and dynamic conditions. Experiments were performed with natively occurring and artificially modified concentrations of sewer pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, theophylline, carbamazepine, and a metabolite of carbamazepine) and caffeine. Differences in apparent distribution coefficients, K-d,K-app, between SS and StS were related to differences in their organic carbon (OC) content, and the practice of artificially modifying the concentration. K-d,K-app values of modified contaminant concentrations and high OC sediments were substantially higher. Pseudo-second order desorption rates for these mobile compounds were also quantified. Successive flushing events to simulate the addition of stormwater to sewer networks revealed that aqueous concentrations would not necessarily decrease, because the added water will rapidly return to equilibrium concentrations with the sediments. Sorption and desorption kinetics must be considered in addition to dilution, to avoid underestimating the influence of dilution on concentrations of pharmaceuticals discharged to the environment.

AB This chapter examines potential risks posed by active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) present in the aquatic environment to humans and aquatic life. We begin by describing the mechanisms by which pharmaceuticals enter the vertebrate body, produce effects and leave the body. Then we describe theoretical and practical issues limiting the certainty which can be expected from risk estimates. This is followed by a description of particular considerations applicable to evaluation of human risks, along with a summary of methods and conclusions from some important studies examining those risks. A similar discussion of theoretical issues and selected data relevant for estimating risks to aquatic life is then presented. We finish by discussing potential contributions of antibiotics present in the environment to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. We conclude that there are too few data to definitively address every concern, particularly risks to aquatic life and contributions to development of antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, available data suggest risks to humans are very low for all active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and risks to aquatic life are very low for most APIs. Although aquatic risks cannot be as confidently ruled out for a few APIs, potential risks are probably limited to particularly contaminated regions in close vicinity to concentrated pollution sources, such as wastewater treatment plant outfalls.

AB BACKGROUND: The persistence of microcontaminants through conventional wastewater treatments is a matter of concern and it suggests the implementation of advanced treatment steps. Although there is evidence that reverse osmosis (RO) is the most efficient treatment for the the removal of these compounds, it has the drawback of producing significant amounts of highly polluted brine. In this work, chemical analyses and toxicity bioassays were combined to evaluate the removal of different pharmaceuticals and of dioxin-like compounds from RO brine through oxidative processes such as ozone, UV and UV/H2O2.
   RESULTS: The removal of the selected pharmaceuticals required a relatively high oxidative capacity, either by ozonation or by the combination of UV radiation and H2O2. Bioassays showed a significant dioxin-like activity in brine samples, whereas antibacterial or estrogenic activities were negligible. UV by itself was the least efficient in removing this dioxin-like activity. Ozonation appeared as the most competent treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work indicate the usefulness of advanced oxidation methods, especially ozonation, to remove biologically active micropollutants from brine samples. They also show that only the combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows complete characterization of the efficiency of advanced water treatment processes to remove recalcitrant pollutants.

AB This study evaluates the potential application of tin porphyrin- and C-60 aminofullerene-derivatized silica (SnP/silica and aminoC(60)/silica) as O-1(2) generating systems for photochemical degradation of organic pollutants. Photosensitized O-1(2) production with SnP/silica, which was faster than with aminoC(60)/silica, effectively oxidized a variety of pharmaceuticals. Significant degradation of pharmaceuticals in the presence of the 400-nm UV cutoff filter corroborated visible light activation of both photosensitizers. Whereas the efficacy of aminoC(60)/silica for O-1(2) production drastically decreased under irradiation with lambda > 550 nm, Q-band absorption caused negligible loss of the photosensitizing activity of SnP/silica in the long wavelength region. Faster destruction of phenolates by SnP/silica and aminoC60/silica under alkaline pH conditions further implicated O-1(2) involvement in the oxidative degradation. Direct charge transfer mediated by SO, which was inferred from nanosecond laser flash photolysis, induced significant degradation of neutral phenols under high power light irradiation. Self-sensitized destruction caused gradual activity loss of SnP/silica in reuse tests unlike aminoC(60)/silica. The kinetic comparison of SnP/silica and TiO2 photocatalyst in real wastewater effluents showed that photosensitized singlet oxygenation of pharmaceuticals was still efficiently achieved in the presence of background organic matters, while significant interference was observed for photocatalyzed oxidation involving non-selective OH radical.

AB German Environment Specimen Bank (GESB) fish tissue samples, collected from 14 different GESB locations, were analyzed for 15 pharmaceuticals, 2 pharmaceutical metabolites, and 12 personal care products. Only 2 pharmaceuticals, diphenhydramine and desmethylsertraline, were measured above MDL. Diphenhydramine (0.04-0.07 ng g(-1) ww) and desmethylsertraline (1.65-3.28 ng g(-1) ww) were measured at 4 and 2 locations, respectively. The maximum concentrations of galaxolide (HHCB) (447 ng g(-1) ww) and tonalide (AHTN) (15 ng g(-1) ww) were measured at the Rehlingen sampling site in the Saar River. A significant decrease in HHCB and AHTN fish tissue concentrations was observed from 1995 to 2008 at select GESB sampling sites (r(2) = 0.69-0.89 for galaxolide and 0.89-0.97 for tonalide with p < 0.003). Galaxolide and tonalide fish tissue concentrations in Germany were similar to 9X and similar to 28X lower, respectively, as compared to fish tissue concentrations measured in a United States nationwide PPCP study conducted in 2006. Proximity of the sampling locations to the upstream wastewater treatment plant discharging point and mean annual flow at the sampling location were found to significantly predict galaxolide and tonalide fish tissue concentrations (HHCB: r(2) = 0.79, p = 0.021 and AHTN: r(2) = 0.81, p = 0.037) in Germany.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter the environment mainly through municipal wastewater effluents, agricultural run-off, pharmaceutical and related chemical industry discharges. The present study was conducted to remove PPCPs through nano-filtration (NF) membranes prepared with two different tailor-made polymeric additives. The first is a novel charged surface modifying macromolecule (CSMM) additive synthesized by reactive diisocyanate and dihydroxy naphthalene disulfonate. The second additive was a tailor made hydrophilic SMM (LSMM), which was manufactured incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) as end groups. Cellulose acetate (CA) membranes with and without 3 wt% CSMM or LSMM were prepared by the phase inversion technique. The membranes were characterized by static contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer, and atomic force microscopy. The NF filtration studies were conducted at two different operating pressures (150 and 400 psig). They consisted of pure water flux tests, sodium chloride separation tests, and individual PPCP (ppm level carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethazine) separation tests. The long term NF performance for the removal of ibuprofen was also conducted. Significant effect of CSMM blending on the separation performance of ibuprofen for long hours operation was observed.

ID CYCLODEXTRIN-BASED NANOSPONGES; METHYLENE-BLUE; CROSS-LINKING; HYDROGEL
AB Cyclodextrin nanosponges (CD-NS) are cross-linked cyclodextrin polymers characterized by a nanostructured three-dimensional network. CD-NSs in the last years found many different applications in the pharmaceutical field for the controlled release of drugs and for the absorption of undesired substances from physiological media, food, and wastewater. Most of CD-NS syntheses involve the solubilization of the chosen CD in closed batch, using a suitable organic polar aprotic liquid, which may affect potential environmental or biomedical applications. Since the research is now moving towards more sustainable approaches, new and greener syntheses of CD-NS are now being developed. Here, it is reported a new eco-friendly and efficient synthesis of nanosponges through mechanochemistry. Mechanochemistry involves the application of mechanical forces to drive and control chemical reactions by transferring energy to chemical bonds. The mechanochemical approach involves the use of a twin-screw extruder (TSE) as a chemical reactor: TSE are capable of fine temperature control and, furthermore, TS Extrusion is a continuous process and not a batch process. Among the many available CD-NS syntheses, we tested our solvent-free approach on a beta-CD/citric acid (CA) system. Moreover, using TSE, the same polymer was obtained in a considerably shorter time. The so obtained NSs were used for the adsorption and removal of probe molecules, in comparison with NSs prepared by cross-linking beta-CD with CA in batch.

AB In this study, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with aerobic granular sludge (AGS) was operated with synthetic wastewater containing environmental relevant concentrations of 178-estradiol (E2), 17?-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Despite the presence of the studied PhAC, the granular fraction clearly predominated (TSSgran/TSS ranging from 0.82 to 0.98) throughout the monitoring period, presenting aggregates with high organic fraction (VSS/TSS above 0.83) and good settling characteristics (SVI5 ranging from 15 to 39 mL/ gTSS). A principal component analysis (PCA) with quantitative image analysis (QIA) based data allowed to distinguish the different operational periods, namely with mature granules (CONT), and the E2, EE2, and SMX feeding periods. It further revealed a positive relationship between the biomass density, sludge settling ability, overall and granular biomass contents, granulation properties, granular biomass fraction and large granules fraction and size. Moreover, a discriminant analysis (DA) allowed to successfully discriminate not only the different operational periods, mainly by using the floccular apparent density, granular stratification and contents data, but also the PhAC presence in samples. The filamentous bacteria contents, sludge settling properties, settling properties stability and granular stratification, structure and contents parameters were found to be crucial for that purpose.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is problem for human health worldwide. Paracetamol is one of the pharmaceutical compounds that is widely used as a pain reliever and fever reducer, and it has been discharged in water via industrial and domestic wastewater. This study aimed to improve the removal of paracetamol from aqueous solutions using two different amino-acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). Two types of adsorbents were used: the surfaces of epoxy-modified MSNs were modified with glycine (MSN-Gly) and cysteine (MSN-Cys). Topographical images indicated that the size of fabricated nanoparticles ranged between 220 and 360 nm, with a pore size of similar to 5 nm. IR spectra confirmed the successful attachment of amino acids on MSN surfaces as a peak appeared at similar to 1720 cm(-1), indicating a carbonyl group. A series of experiments were performed using the batch adsorption method to investigate the effects of contact time, initial concentration of the adsorbate, and pH on the removal of paracetamol from the aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity of paracetamol was higher in acidic media for both adsorbents. The maximum adsorbed amount of paracetamol was 300 mg/g for MSN-Gly compared with 250 mg/g for MSN-Cys. For both adsorbents and at all pH values, the experimental data were well matched with the pseudo-second order and the adsorption isotherm was fitted using a Temkin model.

AB Recently, heterogeneous catalysis for organic pollutants oxidation in contaminated water has received extensive concern. In this study, the bimetal oxides of NixCo3-xO4 were synthesized as solid catalysts to activate persulfate (PS) for tetracycline (TC) and bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. The physicochemical properties of crystal phases, morphologies and chemical compositions were characterized by several analysis techniques. The results demonstrated that the porous network-structured NixCo3xO4 possessed higher catalytic activity for PS activation and organic pollutants degradation than NiO and Co2O3, which may be due to the cooperative conversion of value state between redox shuttles of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Co3+/Co2+. In NCO-2/PS system, the best catalytic degradation efficiency of NCO-2 could reach to 81.1 % for TC and 60.3 % for BPA, respectively. The degradation process with low activation energy was significantly depended on initial pollutants concentration and solution pH. Furthermore, the scavengers test and electron spin resonance experiment proved that SO4 center dot- and center dot OH radicals were successfully generated to be the dominant active oxygen species for TC and BPA disintegration. Besides, the considerable reusability of NCO-2 was testified by three consecutive cycles experiment with XPS and XRD analysis. Hence, NixCo3-xO4 has great potential in pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors contained wastewater disposal and environmental protection.

AB Water contamination by pharmaceutical compounds has become one of the most serious problem for environment. The use of solar illumination as a renewable energy associated to nanomaterials is an alternative solution for disinfection of wastewater. Therefore, there is a great challenge in green chemistry research to synthesize robust and efficient catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutant under visible light. In this study, we describe new ways to decorated mesoporous TiO(2)with cerium (Ce) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles. Indeed, mesoporous TiO(2)was co-doped with Ag and Ce using two different methods: co-impregnation (Co-IMP) and co-deposition precipitation with urea (Co-DPU). The prepared catalysts were characterized using different analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR/UV-vis) and N(2)adsorption/desorption. The effect of the preparation method has been evaluated in the photodegradation of ibuprofen (IBP) under visible light irradiation. The obtained results underlined the improvement of photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO(2)by metals under visible light. A mineralization of IBP up to 98 % was achieved after 4 h irradiation for the catalyst prepared by co-deposition precipitation with urea. Therefore, this catalyst could be suitable for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in aqueous media using solar light as the energy source.

AB The limited amount of electron mediators (EMs) excreted by microorganisms has restricted electricity generation and the related pollutant removal in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The polyphenolic-rich plants contain simple polyphenols or anthraquinones that have promising electron-shuttling potential, but this has not been well understood. Herein, four herbal plants Polygonum multiflorum (T. fallopia), rhubarb (B. rheum), radix rubiae (L. Rubia) and semen cassiae (Catsia tora Linn) were selected and then studied to produce EMs to stimulate electricity generation in MFCs. B. rheum had the highest redox activity and 2% acid pretreatment contributing the most to the release of electroactive substances. The highest power density (18.67 W/m(3)) and Coulombic efficiency (29.03%) and the lowest internal resistance (29.02 Omega) were achieved in MFCs with B. rheum addition compared to other herbal plants. The satisfactory COD (93.68%) and NH4+-N (39.68%) removal were also obtained with a 0.01 g/L dosage. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and high throughput sequencing analysis showed that B. rheum had the least negative effects on biofilm microstructure and microbial species, corresponding to its outstanding performance. These findings first suggested that B. rheum can be regarded as a promising redox mediator to improve MFC performance. This study provided a new thinking to apply herbal wastewater or pharmaceutical waste in improving the bioelectrochemical system.

AB Petal-like ZnS-SnS2 heterojunctions with Z-scheme band alignment were prepared by one-pot solvothermal strategy. The optimal (1:1) ZnS-SnS2 can degrade 93.46 % of tetracycline and remove 73.9 % COD of pharmaceutical wastewater under visible-light irradiation due to the efficient production of H-center dot, O-center dot(2)-, h(+) and OH. The toxicity evaluation by ECOSAR prediction and the growth of E. coli indicates efficient toxicity reduction of tetracycline by photocatalysis and the non-toxicity of ZnS-SnS2. The attacked sites on tetracycline by reactive species were analyzed according to Fukui index, and two degradation pathways of tetracycline were inferred via the identification of intermediate products. Tetracycline degradation efficiency and the energy consumption in different water bodies were compared, and it was found that the electrical energy per order (EE/O) was the lowest in Ganjiang River. The valence band offset (Delta E-VBO) and conduction band offset (Delta E-CBO) of ZnS-SnS2 were 1.02 eV and 0.22 eV, respectively. The probable photocatalytic mechanism of ZnS/SnS2 heterojunctions with Z-scheme band alignment based on Delta E-VBO and Delta E-CBO was first presented.

AB There are growing public attention and concern about the possibility of ecosystem and human health effects from pharmaceuticals in environment. Several types of environmental samples were target of studies by the scientific community, namely drinking water, groundwater, surface water (river, ocean), treated water (influent and effluent), soils, and sediments near to Wastewater Treatment Plants or near to others potential sources of contaminations. Normally, studies in the cemeteries areas are for historical and architectural research and questions of the potential risk for adverse impact of cemeteries in environment have never received enough attention. However, this risk may exist when cemeteries are placed in areas that are vulnerable to contamination. The objective of the present work was the determination of pharmaceuticals (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory/analgesics, antibiotics and psychiatric drugs) in groundwater samples collected inside of the cemeteries areas. Acetaminophen, salicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, nimesulide, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were the pharmaceuticals achieved in the analysed samples. None of the studied antibiotics were detected. The highest concentration was obtained for salicylic acid (in the range of 33.7 to 71.0 ng/L) and carbamazepine (between 20.0 and 22.3 ng/L), respectively. By the cluster analysis similarity between carbamazepine and fluoxetine was achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twenty commonly used pharmaceuticals including eight chiral drugs were investigated in Dongting Lake, China. The contamination level was relatively low on a global scale. Twelve pharmaceuticals were identified. The most abundant compound was caffeine followed by diclofenac, DEET, mefenamic acid, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine with mean concentrations from 2.0 to 80.8 ng L-1. Concentrations between East and West Dongting Lake showed spatial difference, with the West Dongting Lake less polluted. The relatively high ratio of caffeine versus carbamazepine (over 50) may indicate there was possible direct discharge of domestic wastewater into the lake. This is the first study presenting a survey allowing for comprehensive analysis of multiclass achiral and chiral pharmaceuticals including beta-blockers, antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs in freshwater lake. The enantiomeric compositions presented racemic to weakly enantioselective, with the highest enantiomeric fraction (EF) of 0.63 for fluoxetine. Meanwhile, venlafaxine was identified and evaluated the environment risk in surface water in China for the first time. The results of risk assessment suggested that fluoxetine, venlafaxine and diclofenac acid might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake. The resulting data will be useful to enrich the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake and stereochemistry for environment investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) are introduced into the agricultural environment through irrigation with treated effluents and application of biosolids. Transport processes can determine the fate of PCs and the associated risks related to their exposure in the environment. The aim of this work was to evaluate the combined effects of biosolids application and irrigation with treated effluents on the mobility of PCs in soil and to elucidate the main mechanisms affecting their transport. Column-leaching experiments revealed that application of biosolids generally increased the retardation of PCs, whereas treated effluents increased the mobility of weakly acidic PCs in the biosolids-amended soils. Experiments conducted at environmentally relevant PC concentrations (similar to 1 mu g/L) highlight the importance of irreversible sorption as a possible mechanism for low leachability. Data generated from this study suggest that (i) transport behavior of PCs can be affected by common biosolids application to arable land; (ii) treated effluents increase the mobility of weakly acidic PCs mainly by increasing of the soil solution pH and not due to complexation of the PCs with dissolved organic matter; and (iii) it is highly important to evaluate transport behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations and not to base modeling on data obtained from experiments conducted in high concentrations.

AB A wet air oxidation (WAO) process was applied to four selected pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) individually dissolved in ultra-pure water, varying the temperature and oxygen pressure. Due to the moderate (amoxicillin) or low (metoprolol, naproxen, and phenacetin) efficiency found in the oxidation of these pollutants, a catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) process was then tested using a platinum catalyst supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT). In this CWAO process, the pharmaceuticals were dissolved together in ultra-pure water and in four natural water matrices-a reservoir water, a groundwater, and two waters from different municipal wastewater treatment plants. On the basis of the measurements of their removals, a discussion is given of the influence of the main operating variables: the presence or absence of catalyst, type of catalyst (the synthesized Pt/CNT or a commercial Pt/AC), catalyst dosage (0.005-0.050 g), temperature (120-140 degrees C), and oxygen pressure (20-40 bar). In most experiments, the removals were in the sequence: amoxicillin > naproxen > phenacetin. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) removal measurements were made of some of the natural waters tested. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Pre-treatment of industrial landfill leachate by fenton's oxidation
SO GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE advanced oxidation; industrial landfill leachate; Fenton's reagent
AB Biological treatment (aerobic and anaerobic) of industrial landfill leachate is limited by the presence of toxic contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) and recalcitrant (biopersistent) organics (e.g., polyphenols, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.,), hindering viable conditions for biomass proliferation in biological reactors, with difficulties in meeting concentration limits imposed by applied regulations.
   Fenton's oxidation by the use of Fe2+-H2O2-H+ mixture may be used as a pre-treatment of industrial landfill leachate for preliminary abatement of the organic load and to improve biodegradability (BOD/COD > 0.4) to favour biological oxidation in conventional wastewater treatment plants.
   Leachate from Grottaglie (S.E. Italy) non-hazardous landfill (pH 8.6; COD=11.000 mg l(-1); BOD5=2.400 mg l(-1); NH4-N=2.900 mg l(-1); conductivity=60.000 mu S cm(-1)) was laboratory tested in different operative conditions, i.e., initial pH, Fe2+/H2O2 ratio, concentrations and reaction time. The oxidation reaction was monitored by equilibrium pH and residual COD and BOD5 concentrations.
   Best operative conditions were obtained at pH 3, Fe2+ =700 mg l(-1), H2O2=9,900 Mg l(-1) (H2O2/Fe2+ ratio similar to 13w/w), reaction time=2h. Following the oxidation reaction, solution pH was neutralized by the addition of Ca(OH)(2) or NaOH (120 meq l(-1)) for further abatement of target parameters by precipitation/sorption.
   Preliminary technical/economical evaluation of possible process schemes is also given in the paper.

AB This study aimed at giving a better insight into the possible fate of nonylphenol (NP) during wastewater treatment by using a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) designed and optimized for fate studies carried out with radiolabeled compounds. After a single pulse of C-14-labeled-NP isomer (4-[1-ethyl-1,3-dimethylpentyl]phenol) as radiotracer, the applied radioactivity was monitored in the MBR system over 34 days. The mass balance of NP residues at the end of the study showed that 42% of the applied radioactivity was recovered in the effluent as degradation products of NP, 21% was removed with the daily excess sludge from the MBR, and 34% was recovered as adsorbed in the component parts of the MBR. A high amount of NP was associated to the sludge during the test period, while degradation compounds were mainly found in the effluent. Partial identification of these metabolites by means of HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry coupled to radio-detection showed they are alkyl-chain oxidation products of NP. The use of this MBR and a radiolabeled test compound was found suitable for demonstrating that under the applied conditions, the elimination of NP through mineralization and volatilization processes (both less than 1%) was negligible. However, the removal of NP via sorption and the continuous release of oxidation products of NP in permeate were of relevance.

AB The photochemistry of N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (acetaminophen, APAP) is here investigated by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis to monitor APAP photodegradation upon steady-state irradiation. The purpose of this work is to assess the applicability of DPV to monitor the photochemical behaviour of xenobiotics, along with the development of an electrochemical set-up for the real-time monitoring of APAP photodegradation. We here investigated the APAP photoreactivity towards the main photogenerated reactive transients species occurring in sunlit surface waters (hydroxyl radical HO center dot, carbonate radical CO3(center dot) (-), excited triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulfonate used as proxy of the chromophoric DOM, and singlet oxygen O-1(2)), and determined relevant kinetic parameters. A standard procedure based on UV detection coupled with liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) was used under identical experimental conditions to compare and verify the DPV-based results. The latter were in agreement with HPLC data, with the exception of the triplet-sensitized processes. In the other cases, DPV could be used as an alternative to the well-tested but more costly and time-consuming HPLC-UV technique. We have also assessed the reaction rate constant between APAP and HO center dot by real-time DPV, which allowed for the monitoring of APAP photodegradation inside the irradiation chamber. Unfortunately, real-time DPV measurements are likely to be affected by temperature variations of the irradiated samples. Overall, DPV appeared as a fast, cheap and reasonably reliable technique when used for the off-line monitoring of APAP photodegradation. When a suitable real-time procedure is developed, it could become a very straightforward method to study the photochemical behaviour of electroactive xenobiotics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB TiO2/high-silica zeolite composite synthesized by a sol-gel method was applied for the removal of sulfamethazine (SMT) antibiotic from water, and simple models including both adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition were developed. In this study, two types of models were constructed: a synergistic model that included the interaction between the zeolite and TiO2 in the composite, and an individual model, which did not include the interaction. We obtained rate constants for adsorption, desorption and photocatalytic decomposition experimentally, and compared them with the results calculated using the synergistic and individual models. The individual model predicted that ca. 55% of SMT would be removed from the system after 6 h of treatment; however, our experiments showed that 80% of the SMT was removed, suggesting the existence of another reaction pathway. Therefore, a synergistic model was constructed, in which, part of the SMT was adsorbed onto the zeolite within the composite, desorbed from the zeolite and migrated to the TiO2, and was then photocatalytically decomposed. Experiments were carried out with varying amounts of the TiO2-zeolite composite, and the synergistic model was validated. We estimated that 10% of the desorbed SMT was photocatalytically decomposed without being released into the water. When TiO2-zeolite composite concentrations were 0.04, 0.12 and 0.20 g/L, and the treatment time was 6 h, the proportions of the total decomposition of SMT that occurred via this synergistic reaction pathway were calculated as 52.2%, 58.6% and 66.7%, respectively. In other words, over half of the SMT was decomposed through the synergistic reaction, which played a very significant role in the overall removal of SMT (the remainder of the SMT was decomposed through simple photocatalysis on the TiO2).

AB This work determined the solid-water distribution coefficient (K-d) and the organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient (K-oc) of several pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, iopromide, sulfamethoxazole and roxithromycin), three estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) and two musk fragrances (HHCB and AHTN) in digested sludge. These sorption coefficients can be used to evaluate the fate of these substances during sludge treatment, thus avoiding the expensive and time-consuming analysis in the sludge phase.
   For determining the K-d and K-oc values of the target compounds in digested sludge, their concentrations were measured in the aqueous and solid phase of the effluent of an anaerobic digestion pilot plant run at several operational conditions. The results obtained were compared with the values modelled by using simple K-ow approaches. The resulting logK(d) values ranged between 3.5 and 4.4 for the two musk fragrances (logK(oc) of 4.S-6.0), between 2.1 and 2.9 for estrogens (logK(oc) of 2.9-4.2) and between 0.8 and 1.9 for the remaining pharmaceuticals (logK(oc) of 1.8-3.5). These values are in the same range as those reported in the literature for primary and secondary sludge and no significant influence of the anaerobic digestion operational conditions was observed. For most compounds, the modelled K-oc were close or within the lower range of the experimentally determined K-oc Major deviations of the modelled K-oc values were found for iopromide, sulfa methoxazole and roxithromycin, which were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than the measured values.

AB Studies reveal that surface waters worldwide are contaminated with hormonally active agents, many released from sewage treatment plants. Another potential source of aquatic hormonal contamination is livestock feedlot effluent. In this study, we assessed whether feedlot effluent contaminates watercourses by measuring a) total androgenic [methyltrienolone (R1881) equivalents] and estrogenic (17beta-estradiol equivalents) activity using the A-SCREEN and E-SCREEN bioassays and b) concentrations of anabolic agents via gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and enzyme-based immunoassays. Water samples were collected over 3 years from up to six sites [all confluent with the Elkhorn River, Nebraska, USA: a feedlot retention pond (site 1), a site downstream from site 1 (site 2), a stream with intermediate livestock impact (site 3), and three sites with no observable livestock impact (sites 4-6)] and two sources of tap water. In 1999, samples from site 1 contained 9.6 pM R1881 equivalents and 1.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. Site 2 samples had estrogen levels similar to those in site 1 samples but lower androgen levels (3.8 pM R1881 equivalents). Androgen levels in site 3 samples were similar to those in site 2 samples, whereas estrogen levels decreased to 0.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. At site 6, androgen levels were approximately half those found at site 3, and estrogen levels were comparable with those at site 3. Sampling in later years was limited to fewer sites because of drought and lack of permission to access one site. Instrumental analysis revealed estrone but no significant levels of resorcylic acid lactones or trenbolone metabolites. Tap water was devoid of hormonal activity. We conclude that feedlot effluents contain sufficient levels of hormonally active agents to warrant further investigation of possible effects on aquatic ecosystem health.

These are challenges to the global water industries as there is no unit process specifically designed to remove these pollutants. An efficient technology is thus sought to treat these pollutants in water and waste water.
   Methodology/Major Results: A novel chemical, ferrate, was assessed using a standard jar test procedure for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The analytical protocols of pharmaceuticals were standard solid phase extraction together with various instrumentation methods including LC-MS, HPLC-UV and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Ferrate can remove more than 80% of ciprofloxacin (CIP) at ferrate dose of 1 mg Fe/L and 30% of ibuprofen (IBU) at ferrate dose of 2 mg Fe/L. Removal of pharmaceuticals by ferrate was pH dependant and this was in coordinate to the chemical/physical properties of pharmaceuticals. Ferrate has shown higher capability in the degradation of CIP than IBU; this is because CIP has electron-rich organic moieties (EOM) which can be readily degraded by ferrate oxidation and IBU has electron-withdrawing groups which has slow reaction rate with ferrate. Promising performance of ferrate in the treatment of real waste water effluent at both pH 6 and 8 and dose range of 1-5 mg Fe/L was observed. Removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin was the highest among the target compounds (63%), followed by naproxen (43%). On the other hand, n-acetyl sulphamethoxazole was the hardest to be removed by ferrate (8% only).
   Conclusions: Ferrate is a promising chemical to be used to treat pharmaceuticals in waste water. Adjusting operating conditions in terms of the properties of target pharmaceuticals can maximise the pharmaceutical removal efficiency.

AB The degradation of four pharmaceutical compounds (PhACs), ibuprofen (IBU), diphenhydramine (DP), phenazone (PZ), and phenytoin (PHT) was investigated via ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and UV/H2O2 process with a low-pressure (LP) LTV lamp. For each PhAC tested, direct photolysis quantum yields at 254 nm were found to be ranging from 6.32 x 10(-2) to 2.79 x 10(-1) mol E-1 at pH 7. The second-order rate constants of the reaction between the PhACs and (OH)-O-center dot were determined to be from 4.86 x 10(9) to 6.67 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) by using a competition kinetic model which utilized para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a reference compound. The overall effect of (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging from humic acid (HA) and anions HCO3-, NO3- was measured utilizing R-OH,R-UV method through examining the aqueous photodegradation of pCBA as a probe compound. Moreover, these fundamental direct and indirect photolysis parameters were applied in the model prediction for oxidation rate constants of the PhACs in UV/H2O2 process. It was found that the predicted oxidation rate constants approximated the observed ones. The results indicated that the new R-OH,R-UV probe compound method was applicable for measuring background (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging effects in water treatment process of UV/H2O2. Furthermore, by GC-MS analysis, most of the intermediates created during the photodegradation of the selected PhACs in UV/H2O2 process were identified. For the photodegradation of PZ, a competition mechanism existed between the direct UV photolysis and the oxidation of (OH)-O-center dot. An appropriate dosage of H2O2 could hinder the occurrence of the direct photolysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the aquatic environment, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of contaminants which may alter the toxicity profile of each compound, compared to its toxicity alone. Pharmaceutical drugs (e.g. carbamazepine (CBZ) and cetirizine (CTZ)) and metals (e.g. cadmium (Cd)) are among those contaminants that co-occur in the environment. However, most studies concerning their toxicity towards aquatic species are based on single exposure experiments. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate single and combined effects of Cd and CBZ or CTZ (single conditions: Cd, CTZ, CBZ; combined conditions: CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) on biomarkers related to oxidative stress and energy metabolism in the edible clam Ruditapes philippinarum, by exposing the organisms for 28 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of these contaminants. The biomarkers studied were: i) the electron transport system activity, protein and glycogen contents (indicators of organisms' metabolic status and energy reserves); ii) lipid peroxidation and the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (indicators of oxidative stress); iii) superoxide dismutase and catalase activities (enzymes indicators of antioxidant defence) and iv) activity of glutathione S-transferases (family of enzymes indicators of biotransformation capacity). Results obtained showed that the uptake of Cd and CBZ was not affected by the combined presence of the contaminants. However, for CTZ, the uptake was higher in the presence than in the absence of Cd. Concerning toxicity data, in general, the combined exposures (CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) had lower biological effects than the contaminants alone. Nevertheless, our data showed that despite the low concentrations tested, they were enough to exert biological effects that differed between single and combined treatments, evidencing the need to conduct more co-exposure studies to increase the environmental relevance of the gathered data.

AB In this study, avocado seed was successfully used as raw material for producing activated carbons by conventional pyrolysis. In order to determine the best condition to produce the activated carbons, a 2(2) full-factorial design of experiment (DOE) with three central points was employed by varying the temperature and time of pyrolysis. The two evaluated factors (temperature and time of pyrolysis) strongly influenced the S-BET, pore volumes, hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity ratio (HI) and functional groups values; both factors had a negative effect over S-BET, pore volumes and functional groups which means that increasing the values of factors leads to decrease of these responses; on the other hand, with regards to HI, both factors caused a positive effect which means that increasing their values, the HI has an enhancement over its values. The produced activated carbon exhibited high specific surface areas in the range of 1122-1584 m(2) g(-1). Surface characterisation revealed that avocado seed activated carbons (ASACs) have hydrophilic surfaces and have predominantly acidic groups on their surfaces. The prepared ASACs were employed in the adsorption of 25 emerging organic compounds such as 10 pharmaceuticals and 15 phenolic compounds which presented high uptake values for all emerging pollutants. It was observed that the activated carbon prepared at higher temperature of pyrolysis (700 degrees C), which generated less total functional groups and presented higher HI, was the activated carbon with higher sorption capacity for uptaking emerging organic contaminants. Based on results of this work, it is possible to conclude that avocado seed can be employed as a raw material to produce high surface area and very efficient activated carbons in relation to treatment of polluted waters with emerging organic pollutants.

AB Human-use drug residues (DR) are only partially eliminated by waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), so that residual amounts can reach natural waters and cause environmental hazards. In order to properly manage these hazards in the aquatic environment, a database is made available that integrates the concentration ranges for DR, which cause adverse effects for aquatic organisms, and the temporal variations of the ecotoxicological risks. To implement this database for the ecotoxicological risk assessment (ERA database), the required information for each DR is the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs), along with the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). The risk assessment is based on the ratio between the PNECs and the PECs. Adverse effect data or PNECs have been found in the publicly available literature for 45 substances. These ecotoxicity test data have been extracted from 125 different sources. This ERA database contains 1157 adverse effect data and 287 PNECs. The efficiency of this ERA database was tested with a data set coming from a simultaneous survey of WWTPs and the natural environment. In this data set, 26 DR were searched for in two WWTPs and in the river. On five sampling dates, concentrations measured in the river for 10 DR could pose environmental problems of which 7 were measured only downstream of WWTP outlets. From scientific literature and measurements, data implementation with unit homogenisation in a single database facilitates the actual ecotoxicological risk assessment, and may be useful for further risk coming from data arising from the future field survey. Moreover, the accumulation of a large ecotoxicity data set in a single database should not only improve knowledge of higher risk molecules but also supply an objective tool to help the rapid and efficient evaluation of the risk.

AB Tetracycline (TET) is commonly used to treat bacterial diseases in humans and chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), is largely excreted, and is found at elevated concentrations in treated sewage sludge (bio-solids) and poultry litter (excrement plus bedding materials). Routine application of these nutrient-and carbon-enriched materials to soils improves fertility and other characteristics, but the presence of antibiotics (and other pharmaceuticals) in amendments raises questions about potential adverse effects on biota and development of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Hazard risks are largely dictated by sorption-desorption and diffusion behavior in amendments, so these processes were evaluated from sorption-desorption equilibrium isotherm and diffusion cell experiments with four types amendments (biosolids, poultry manure, wood chip litter, and rice hull litter) at three temperatures (8 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C). Linear sorption-desorption equilibrium distribution constants (Kd) in native amendments ranged between 124-2418 L kg(-1). TET sorption was significantly increased after treatment with alum, and there was a strong exponential relationship between Kd and the concentration of bound Al3+ in amendments (R-2 = 0.94), which indicated that amendments contained functional groups capable of chelating Al3+ and forming metal bridges with TET. Effective diffusion coefficients of TET in amendments ranged between 0.1 and 5.2 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), which were positively related to temperature and inversely related to Kd by a multiple regression model (R-2 = 0.86). Treatment of organic amendments with alum greatly increased Kd, would decrease D-s, and so would greatly reduce hazard risks of applying these organic amendments with this antibiotic to soils.

AB Anaerobic biodegradation of mixed non-analogous two substrates was studied in a binary system with and without the primary substrate using an anaerobic multichamber bed (AMCBR). In the binary mixture, the biodegradation of less-degradable oxytetracycline (OTC) was restarted in the presence of more degradable benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the initial runs of the AMCBR, but enhanced biodegradation of the more recalcitrant OTC occurs in the later runs of the AMCBR due to enhanced biomass growth on dual substrates without the primary carbon source. The biodegradation yields of the OTC, BaP were discussed with sole-substrate systems and with the dual substrate system in the presence of the primary substrate. The maximum OTC and BaP yields were 93% in Run 3 with the primary substrate, while the maximum BaP and OTC yields were 95%, 98% in Run 3 without the primary substrate. A dual form of the Monod was found to adequately predict the substrate interactions in the binary mixture of OTC and BaP using only the parameters derived from batch experiments. At low BaP (4 mg L-1) and OTC (40 mg L-1) concentrations, a non-competitive inhibition does not affect the binding of the substrate and so the K-s were was not affected while the mu(max) was lowered. At high BaP (10 mg L-1) and OTC (100 mg L-1) concentrations, the BaP and OTC were biodegraded according to competitive inhibition with increased K-s while mu(max) was not affected. BaP and OTC were biodegraded according to Haldane at high concentrations (>10 mg L-1 for BaP, 100 mg L-1 OTC) where they were used as the sole substrate.

AB The presence of micropollutants can be a concern for land application of biosolids. Of particular interest are nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), and nonylphenol (NP), collectively referred to as NPE, which accumulate in anaerobically digested biosolids and are subject to regulation based on the environmental risks associated with them. Because biosolids are a valuable nutrient resource, it is essential that we understand how various treatment processes impact the fate of NPE in biosolids. Thermal hydrolysis (TH) coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) is an advanced digestion process that destroys pathogens in biosolids and increases methane yields and volatile solids destruction. We investigated the impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on the subsequent biodegradation of NPE in digested biosolids. Biosolids were treated with TH, anaerobic digestion, and aerobic digestion in laboratory-scale reactors, and NPE were analyzed in the influent and effluent of the digesters. NP2EO and NP1EO have been observed to degrade to the more estrogenic NP under anaerobic conditions; therefore, changes in the ratio of NP:NPE were of interest. The increase in NP:NPE following MAD was 56%; the average increase of this ratio in four sets of TH-MAD samples, however, was only 24.6 +/- 3.1%. In addition, TH experiments performed in pure water verified that, during TH, the high temperature and pressure alone did not directly destroy NPE; TH experiments with NP added to sludge also showed that NP was not destroyed by the high temperature and pressure of TH when in a more complex sludge matrix. The post-aerobic digestion phases removed NPE, regardless of whether TH pretreatment occurred. This research indicates that changes in biosolids processing can have impacts beyond just gas production and solids destruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research was carried out with the aim of monitoring anaerobic digestion processes using thermal analysis with the aid of mass spectrometry so as to define the stability of the digestate obtained. Three different systems were investigated under varying conditions. The digestion of waste sludge from a pharmaceutical industry (PI) and the digestion of cattle manure (CM) were evaluated under mesophilic conditions.
   The co-digestion of a mixture of primary sludge (PS) and the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) was studied under thermophitic conditions. Temperature-programmed combustion tests were carried out to investigate the degree of stabilization of samples throughout the digestion processes. The derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles obtained for the mesophilic digestion of PI waste showed a decrease at low temperatures and an increase at high temperatures in the intensity of the peaks recorded as the stabilization process proceeded. These results are in accordance with those obtained by the present authors in their previous work on the mesophilic digestion of primary sludge and OFMSW. In contrast, the DTG profiles obtained from the stabilization process of CM and thermophilic codigestion of PS and OFMSW showed a reduction in peaks at high temperatures. When the stabilization products obtained from CM by anaerobic digestion and by composting processes were compared, it was observed that the composting process was capable of further decomposing materials readily oxidized at low temperatures and increasing the presence of structurally more complex substances. The evolution of the differential thermal analysis (DTA) signal recorded simultaneously showed considerable similarity to the mass/charge (m/z) signal 44 registered by the mass spectrometer. The use of mass spectrometry helped to clarify the inner workings of the digestion process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Activated carbon (AC)/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites, MAC-1 and MAC-2, were prepared by a simple pyrolytic method using a mixture of iron(III)/cobalt(II) benzoates and iron(III)/cobalt(II) oxalates, respectively, and were used as efficient adsorbents for the removal of amoxicillin (AMX) and paracetamol (PCT) of aqueous effluents. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sizes of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles formed from benzoates of iron(III)/cobalt(II) and oxalates of iron(III)/cobalt(II) precursors were in the ranges of 5-80 and 6-27 nm, respectively. The saturation magnetization (M-s), remanence (M-r) and coercivity (H-c) of the MAC-2 nanocomposites were found to be 3.07 emu g(-1), 1.36 emu g(-1) and 762.49 Oe; for MAC-1, they were 0.2989 emu g(-1), 0.0466 emu g(-1) and 456.82 Oe. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies were investigated, and the results showed that the as-prepared nanocomposites MAC-1 and MAC-2 could be utilized as an efficient, magnetically separable adsorbent for environmental cleanup. The maximum sorption capacities obtained were 280.9 and 444.2 mg g(-1) of AMX for MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively, and 215.1 and 399.9 mg g(-1) of PCT using MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively. Both adsorbents were successfully used for simulated hospital effluents, removing at least 93.00 and 96.77% for MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively, of a mixture of nine pharmaceuticals with high concentrations of sugars, organic components and saline concentrations.

TI Aerobic treatment of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in landfill
   leachate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Pharmaceuticals used in human medical care are not completely eliminated in the human body and can enter the municipal sewage sludge system and leachate water from landfill both as the parent compound and as their biologically active metabolites. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a large potential for unwanted effects on nontarget organisms in the environment. Leachates from active or old closed landfills are often treated with continuous stirring and simple aeration in a pond/lagoon before infiltration into the environment. The aim of this work was to simulate the reduction of five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine) and three of their metabolites (desmethylcitalopram, didesmethylcitalopram and norfluoxetine) during aerobic treatment of leachate from landfills. This landfill leachate-simulation experiment was performed to see what happens with the pharmaceuticals during aerated treatment and continuous stirring of landfill leachate for 120 h. It is important to establish whether different pollutants such as pharmaceuticals can be removed (oxidized or otherwise degraded) or not before infiltration into the environment.
   Results: All the SSRIs had a significant concentration reduction during the aeration treatment process. Total SSRI concentrations were reduced significantly during aerobic treatment, and the individual SSRIs were reduced by 89% to 100% after 120 h. Among the high-concentration samples, fluoxetine (10 mg L-1) was the least degraded with 93% concentration reduction. Among the low-concentration samples, paroxetine was the least degraded with 89% concentration reduction. Fluvoxamine and citalopram were most effectively eliminated and were completely removed from both the high- and low-concentration samples. The samples were also investigated for the metabolites desmethylcitalopram, didesmethylcitalopram and norfluoxetine but only norfluoxetine in the high-concentration fluoxetine sample was detected.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that aeration is an effective method for eliminating pharmaceuticals such as SSRIs from landfill leachate water. Comparing the results of all SSRIs with different treatment methods, paroxetine and fluvoxamine seem to be the easiest compounds to eliminate independent of method, while fluoxetine and sertraline seem to be the most stable.

AB Two carbon materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, MWCNT, and activated carbon, AC) were investigated as ozonation catalysts for the mineralization of bezafibrate (BZF) in water. For comparative purposes, kinetic results obtained in the absence of catalyst (single zonation) and adsorption experiments were also presented. Removal of BZF in the presence of MWCNT is mainly due to a catalytic process, contrarily to what occurs in the presence of activated carbon, which acts mainly as adsorbent. 3-[(4-chlorophenyl)formamido]propanoic acid (BBR), 4-chorobenzoic acid (pCBA) and 4-chloro-N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]benzamide (BBV) were detected as primary products of single and catalytic ozonation of BZF, whereas oxalic, pyruvic and oxamic acids were identified as refractory final oxidation products. The original chlorine of BZF is completely converted to chloride ion and part of nitrogen is converted to NH4+, NO3- and NO2-. The presence of the radical scavenger tert-butanol during catalytic and single ozonation evidenced the participation of HO center dot radicals in the oxidation process, especially in the mineralization of several intermediates. Microtox tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and AC originated lower acute toxicity, which may be due to the contribution of adsorption for the removal from the solution of BZF and its oxidation compounds. The time course of all detected compounds is studied and, as a result, the transformation pathway for the complete mineralization of BZF by single and catalytic ozonation in the presence of the selected carbon materials is also elucidated. Successive experimental runs of BZF degradation carried out with MWCNT show that the catalyst suffers some deactivation as a result of the introduction of oxygenated surface groups on the surface.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging as environmentally problematic compounds. As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to mu g L-1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 mu g L(-1 )for citalopram, 320 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 473 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471 mu g L-1 for citalopram, 411 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 713 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. The results of this study conclude that tramadol and citalopram produce hypoactivity in 144 hpf zebrafish larvae. Further, a 1:1 binary mixture of the two caused the same response, albeit at a higher concentration, possibly due to SS. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The levels of 14 micropollutants including nine pharmaceuticals, two pesticides, and three endocrine disruptors were measured in a water treatment plant (WTP) in Seoul, Korea. Among the measured micropollutants, 12 (excluding atrazine,and triclocarban) were found in the influent and effluent from the WTP, at levels ranging from 2 to 482 ng L-1. The removal efficiencies of the detected micropollutants in the WTP ranged from 6% to 100%. Among them diclofenac, acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, and 2,4-D were effectively removed (>80%). Metoprolol was unlikely to be removed (6%) in the WTP process. Concentrations of acetaminophen, metoprolol, ibuprofen, and naproxen were higher in winter, while levels of herbicides of 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were higher in summer. Metoprolol was hardly removed in the water treatment process. Laboratory experiments showed that compounds with logK(ow) > 2.5 (especially bisphenol-A, 2,4-D, carbamazepine, triclocarban and 4-nonylphenol) were effectively removed by coagulation process, and adsorption effect increased in proportion with hydrophobicity of micropollutants and the turbidity of water. Sunlight photodegradation also effectively removed sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, which are photosensitizes. Chlorination was relatively not effective for the removal of micropollutants due to the lower chlorine dosage (2 mg L-1), lower contact time (1 h), and already lower levels of micropollutants at the chlorination stage at WTP. Our results imply that micropollutants during coagulation stage at WTP can be removed not only by coagulation itself, but also by adsorption to clay particle especially for high turbidity water, and by sunlight photodegradation in the areas open to the atmosphere.

AB Acute and chronic (or sub-chronic) toxicity of five selected antimicrobial agents, including triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), resorcinol, phenoxyethanol and p-thymol, was investigated using the conventional three-aquatic-organism battery. These compounds are widely used in cosmetics and other personal care products and their ecological risk has recently become a significant concern. As results of toxicity tests, TCS was found to be most strongly toxic for green algae [e.g. 72h no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.50 mu gl(-1)] among the selected compounds, followed by TCC, while TCC was more toxic or similar to TCS for Daphnia and fish (e.g. Daphnia 8day NOEC of 1.9 mu gl(-1)). Having compared the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) determined from the toxicity data with measured environmental concentrations (MEC), the preliminary ecological risk assessment of these five antimicrobials was conducted. The MEC/PNEC ratios of TCS and TCC were over 1 for some monitoring data, especially in urban streams with watershed areas without sewage service coverage, and their potential risk for green algae and Daphnia might be at a level of concern, although the contribution of TCS/TCC on the total toxicity of the those sites needs to be further investigated. For the three other antimicrobials, the maximum MEC/PNEC ratio for resorcinol was 0.1-1, but those for phenoxyethanol and p-thymol were <0.1 and their risk to aquatic organisms is limited, although the additive effects with TCS, TCC and other antimicrobial agents, such as parabens, need to be further examined in future studies.

AB In recent years, numerous studies have indicated that various long-term use drugs, such as antibiotics or analgesics, not only cannot be completely decomposed via sewage treatment but also exhibit biological toxicity if they enter the environment; thus, the release of these drugs into the environment can damage ecological systems. This study sought to investigate the acute toxicity of two commonly utilized analgesics, ibuprofen (IBU) and acetaminophen (APAP), to aquatic organisms after these drugs have entered the water. To address this objective, the acute toxicity (median lethal concentration, LC50, for a 96-h exposure) of IBU alone, APAP alone, and mixtures containing different ratios of IBU and APAP in green neon shrimp (Neocaridina denticulate) were measured. The results of four tests revealed that the 96-h LC50 values for IBU and APAP alone were 6.07 mg/L and 6.60 mg/L, respectively. The 96-h LC50 for a 1:1 mixture of IBU and APAP was 6.23 mg/L, and the toxicity of this mixture did not significantly differ from the toxicity of either drug alone (p <0.05). The experimental results for mixtures containing unequal ratios of IBU and APAP indicated that mixtures with high APAP concentrations and low IBU concentrations exhibited markedly greater toxicity in N. denticulate (LC50 =4.78 mg/L) than APAP or IBU alone. However, mixtures with high IBU concentrations and low APAP concentrations exhibited lower toxicity in N. denticulate (LC50 = 6.78 mg/L) than IBU or APAP alone. This study demonstrated that different mixtures of IBU and APAP were associated with different toxic effects in green neon shrimp. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Pharmaceuticals are known to contaminate tap water worldwide, but the relevant human health risks have not been assessed in China.
   OBJECTIVES: We monitored 32 pharmaceuticals in Chinese tap water and evaluated the life-long human health risks of exposure in order to provide information for future prioritization and risk management.
   METHODS: We analyzed samples (n = 113) from 13 cities and compared detected concentrations with existing or newly-derived safety levels for assessing risk quotients (RQs) at different life stages, excluding the prenatal stage.
   RESULTS: We detected 17 pharmaceuticals in 89% of samples, with most detectable concentrations (92%) at < 50 ng/L. Caffeine (median-maximum, nanograms per liter: 24.4-564), metronidazole (1.8-19.3), salicylic acid (16.6-41.2), clofibric acid (1.2-3.3), carbamazepine (1.3-6.7), and dimetridazole (6.9-14.7) were found in >= 20% of samples. Cities within the Yangtze River region and Guangzhou were regarded as contamination hot spots because of elevated levels and frequent positive detections. Of the 17 pharmaceuticals detected, 13 showed very low risk levels, but 4 (i.e., dimetridazole, thiamphenicol, sulfamethazine, and clarithromycin) were found to have at least one life-stage RQ >= 0.01, especially for the infant and child life stages, and should be considered of high priority for management. We propose an indicator-based monitoring framework for providing information for source identification, water treatment effectiveness, and water safety management in China.
   CONCLUSION: Chinese tap water is an additional route of human exposure to pharmaceuticals, particularly for dimetridazole, although the risk to human health is low based on current toxicity data. Pharmaceutical detection and application of the proposed monitoring framework can be used for water source protection and risk management in China and elsewhere.

AB The presence of residues of veterinary pharmaceuticals in farm wastewaters such as pig slurry represents a problem that needs to be tackled to avoid further contamination of environmental waters and the development of resistant bacteria. For their monitoring and control, it is necessary the existence of reliable analytical tools. The present paper describes for the first time the development and optimization by statistical experimental design of a specifically designed analytical method for the analysis of 21 veterinary drugs, including 18 antibiotics of several families (beta-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, macrolides, among others), 1 antiparasitic, 1 analgesic and 1 hormone, in a complex environmental matrix such as the fresh solid phase of pig slurry. The resulting method, consisted of an ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) combined with in-situ dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) from a 0.3 g of freeze-dried sample aliquot followed by a preconcentration step by compact solid phase extraction (c-SPE) and subsequent instrumental analysis by ultra-high-performance-liquid-chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem (MS/MS) by a triple quadrupole, was successfully validated as a very sensitive (method limit of quantification in the low ng g(-1)) and reliable method (relative recoveries around 100% and method repeatability featured by a general relative standard deviation below 20%). Provided raw data was intended to be processed by matrix-matched quantification approach. The resulting methodology was applied to the characterization of several pig manures from different Spanish farms sampled across breeding season between 2018 and 2019. Sample precedence showed to have a high impact in the positives, its frequency and concentration. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urine has great potential to be an effective fertilizer due to its high nutrient content, however, it can contain potentially worrying pharmaceuticals. Our objective was to study whether urine storage and aerobic biological treatment, i.e. nitrification, was sufficient to remove pharmaceuticals or an additional treatment with activated carbon was necessary to produce a fertilizer from urine. We investigated the abatement of twelve pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and antivirals, in laboratory experiments representing the treatment steps of anaerobic storage of source-separated human urine, stabilization using partial and full nitrification under acclimatized and non-acclimatized conditions, and treatment of nitrified urine using powdered activated carbon (PAC). Two-month-long-term storage of urine was insufficient to substantially degrade the pharmaceuticals, except for hydrochlorothiazide (>90%). In the partial and full nitrification fed-batch reactors, atazanavir, ritonavir, and clarithromycin were rapidly removed, with biotransformation rate constants greater than 10 L(gss)(-1)d(-1). Darunavir, emtricitabine, trimethoprim, N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, diclofenac, and hydrochlorothiazide were degraded slowly, with biotransformation rate constants of < 1 L(gss)(-1)d(-1). With 200 mg PAC L-1, at least 90% of each investigated pharmaceutical was removed. Yeast estrogen screen tests and bioluminescence inhibition tests revealed efficient removal of estrogenicity (99%) and toxicity (56%) using nitrification, and a reduction of 89% and 64%, respectively, using 200 mg PAC L-1. With our study, we provide biotransformation rate constants of compounds never previously investigated. We also show that a combination of nitrification and PAC adsorption enables the production of a safe fertilizer with sufficiently low pharmaceutical concentrations and no removal of beneficial nutrients.

AB Traditional Chinese medicine residue (TCMR) is the solid substances remaining after the extraction of pharmaceutical ingredients from medicinal plant materials, which include abundant soil nutrients. However, TCMR is nearly lost as domestic garbage, which not only occupies a large amount of land but also leads to the waste of resource, as well as causing the eco-environment potential pollution. Therefore, we implemented this study to assess whether TCMR could be used as an organic fertilizer in agricultural practices for realizing waste resource utilization, improving soil fertility, and enhancing plant growth. The results showed that (1) application of TCMR could improve soil fertility, particularly in enhancing the soil contents of SOM, TN, NaOH-N, NaHCO3-P, and HNO3-K; (2) the higher application ratios of TCMR (0.8-1.0%) that increased the soil EC values would cause the risk of soil secondary salinization; (3) the lower application ratios of TCMR (0.2-0.6%) has a better positive effect on improved the maize seedlings' physiological parameters and photosynthetic performance than the higher application ratios; (4) although application of TCMR lead to the heavy metal (Cr, Pb, Cd, As, and Hg) content increased in soil, there was no ecology risk under below 0.8% application ratio, compared with the China soil risk control standards, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), and pollution load index (PLI). Thus, TCMR could potentially be used as an organic fertilizer in agricultural practices. This approach is an effective strategy not only for achieving TCMR disposal but also for realizing waste resource utilization, as well as for improving soil fertility and plant growth.

AB The study was performed in order to clarify whether carbamazepine-spiked solutions used as model waste-waters are suitable for the assessment of carbamazepine removal from real secondary municipal effluents by photocatalytic oxidation in the presence and absence of activated carbon. Therefore, carbamazepine (10 mg L-1) was dissolved in deionized water or in secondary municipal effluent. Photocatalytic oxidation of these model wastewaters was carried out with TiO2 "P25" (100 mg L-1) and UV-A lamps in the absence and in the presence of 20 mg L-1 powdered activated carbon (PAC). Carbamazepine was analyzed photometrically. In deionized water at pH 5.5, carbamazepine was nearly completely removed with a UV dose of 6.48 kJ L-1. A similar efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of carbamazepine added to secondary effluent was observed when the suspension pH was 2.7, while at pH 8 and 10.6, carbamazepine removal from spiked secondary effluent with the same UV dose was only 40 and 60%, respectively. Although PAC addition resulted in an initial adsorptive carbamazepine reduction of 20 to 35% from the model wastewaters, it did not lead to markedly enhanced carbamazepine removal in the subsequent photocatalysis phase. During photocatalytic oxidation of unspiked secondary effluent (initial carbamazepine concentration: 133 ng L-1) at pH 7.3 with and without PAC, carbamazepine concentrations were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. While PAC addition resulted in the adsorption of about 90% of the initial carbamazepine, photocatalysis did not lead to any carbamazepine removal at all. This indicates that the experiments with spiked model wastewaters - even in a secondary effluent matrix - are absolutely inadequate for predicting photocatalytic carbamazepine removal under real conditions.

AB Seawater acidification could alter the susceptibility of marine organisms to emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals. In this study, the combined effects of seawater acidification and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac on survival, growth and oxidative stress-related parameters (catalase activity and lipid peroxidation) in the larvae of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum were investigated for the first time. An experimental flow-through system was set up to carry out a 96-h exposure of clam larvae. Two pH levels (pH 8.0, the control, and pH 7.8, the predicted pH by the end of this century) were tested with and without diclofenac (0.5 mu g/L). After 4 days, mortality was dramatically higher under reduced pH, particularly in the presence of diclofenac (62% of the larvae dead). Shell morphology was negatively affected by both acidification and diclofenac from the first day of exposure. The percentage of abnormal larvae was always higher at pH 7.8 than in controls, peaking at 98% in the presence of diclofenac after 96 h. Instead, shell length, shell height or the ratio of these values were only negatively influenced by reduced pH throughout the whole experiment.
   After 96 h, catalase activity was significantly increased in all larvae kept at pH 7.8, whereas no significant difference in lipid peroxidation was found among the treatments. This study demonstrates a high susceptibility of R. philippinarum larvae to a slight reduction in seawater pH. Furthermore, the results obtained highlight that acidification enhances the sensitivity of clam larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of diclofenac. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of solids retention time (SRT) on estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal in an activated sludge plant (ASP) was examined using a pilot plant to closely control operation. Ex situ analytical methods were simultaneously used to enable discrimination of the dominant mechanisms governing estrogen removal following transitions in SRT from short (3 d) to medium (10 d) and long (27 d) SRTs which broadly represent those encountered at full-scale. Total estrogen (Sigma(EsT), i.e., sum of E1, E2, E3 and EE2) removals which account for aqueous and particulate concentrations were 70 +/- 8, 95 +/- 1 and 93 +/- 2% at 3, 10 and 27 d SRTs respectively. The improved removal observed following an SRT increase from 3 to 10 d was attributable to the augmented biodegradation of the natural estrogens El and E2. Interestingly, estrogen biodegradation per bacterial cell increased with SRT. These were 499, 1361 and 1750 ng 10(12) viable cells(-1) d(-1). This indicated an improved efficiency of the same group or the development of a more responsive group of bacteria. In this study no improvement in absolute Sigma(EsT) removal was observed in the ASP when SRT increased from 10 to 27 d. However, batch studies identified an augmented biomass sorption capacity for the more hydrophobic estrogens E2 and EE2 at 27 d, equivalent to an order of magnitude. The lack of influence on estrogen removal during pilot plant operation can be ascribed to their distribution within activated sludge being under equilibrium. Consequently, lower wastage of excess sludge inherent of long SRT operation counteracts any improvement in sorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of the increasing concerns about the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the nanomaterial pollution in aquatic ecosystem, the effects of carbon nanotubes on the photochemical transformation of PPCPs are less considered. In this study, the photochemical production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in colloidal dispersions of hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT-OH) under simulated solar irradiation using a Xenon lamp. Two kinds of ROS, O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot, were confirmed by their molecular probes, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and p-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA). The steady-state concentrations of O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot were calculated as 1.30 x 10(-14) M and 5.02 x 10(-16) M, respectively. The effects of MWNT-OH on photodegradation of atenolol (ATL) were investigated in the presence of natural water components, i.e., dissolved organic matters (DOMs), nitrate (NO3-) and ferric ions (Fe3+). Photoproducts of atenolol were identified by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) analysis techniques. Three potential photochemical pathways of atenolol, including the hydroxylation on aromatic ring, the loss of amide group and the cleavage of ether oxygen bond as well as di-polymerization of reaction intermediates were tentatively proposed. Using the radical quenching method, reaction with (OH)-O-center dot was determined as the major photolysis pathway of atenolol in irradiated MWNT-OH suspensions. These findings of the production of ROS and their effects on the photodegradation of organic contaminants provided useful information for assessing environmental risk of MWNT-OH.

AB Acid solutions containing up to 1 g l(-1) of the drug paracetamol have been treated with ozone alone and ozonation catalyzed with Fe2+, Cu2+ and/or UVA light at 25.0 degrees C. Direct ozonation yields poor degradation due to the high stability of final carboxylic acids formed, whereas more than 83% of mineralization is attained with the catalyzed methods. Under UVA irradiation, organics can be efficiently destroyed by the combined action of generated H2O2 and UVA light. In the presence of Fe2+ and UVA light, the process is accelerated due to the production of oxidant hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and the photodecomposition of Fe3+ complexes. The highest oxidizing power is achieved by combining Fe2+, Cu2+ and UVA light, because complexes of final acids with Cu2+ are more quickly degraded than those competitively formed with Fe3+. For all catalyzed methods, the initial mineralization rate is enhanced and the percent of degradation generally drops with increasing drug concentration. The paracetamol decay always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction with slightly higher rate constant for catalyzed systems than direct ozonation. Aromatic products such as hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 2-hydroxy-4-(N-acetyl)aminophenol are identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and reversed-phase chromatography. Acetamide is generated when hydroquinone is produced. These products are degraded to oxalic and oxamic acids as ultimate carboxylic acids, as detected by GC-MS and ion-exclusion chromatography. Oxalic acid is generated via glycolic, glyoxylic, tartronic, ketomalonic and maleic acids. While Fe3+-oxalato complexes are photolyzed by UVA light, Cu2+-oxalato, Fe3+-oxamato and Cu2+-oxamato complexes are oxidized with (OH)-O-center dot. NH4+ and NO3- ions are produced during mineralization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodegradation is an important route for the removal of sulfamethazine (SMZ), one of the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotics, in the environment. However, little information is known about the kinetics, products, and pathways of SMZ biodegradation owing to the complexity of its enzyme-based biotransformation processes. In this study, the SMZ-degrading strain A01 belonging to the genus Paenarthrobacter was isolated from SMZ-enriched activated sludge reactors. The bacterial cells were rod-shaped with transient branches 2.50-4.00 mu m in length with most forming in a V-shaped arrangement. The genome size of Paenarthrobacter sp. A01 had a total length of 4,885,005 bp with a GC content of 63.5%, and it contained 104 contigs and 55 RNAs. The effects of pH, temperature, initial substrate concentration and additional carbon source on the biodegradation of SMZ were investigated. The results indicated that pH 6.0-7.8, 25 degrees C and the addition of 0.2 g/L sodium acetate favored the biodegradation, whereas a high concentration of SMZ, 500 mg/L, had an inhibitory effect. The biodegradation kinetics with SMZ as the sole carbon source or 0.2 g/L sodium acetate as the co-substrate fit the modified Gompertz model well with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.99. Three biodegradation pathways were proposed involving nine biodegradation products, among which C6H9N3O2S and C12H12N2 were two novel biodegradation products that have not been reported previously. Approximately 90.7% of SMZ was transformed to 2-amino-4, 6-dimethylpyrimidine. Furthermore, sad genes responsible for catabolizing sulfonamides were characterized in A01 with high similarities of 96.0%-100.0%. This study will fill the knowledge gap in the biodegradation of this ubiquitous micropollutant in the aquatic environment.

AB PPCPs and pesticides have been documented throughout the world over the years, yet relatively little is known about the factors affecting their spatial distribution and temporal change in order to know their potential risk to the ecosystem or human health in the future. In our study, 5 PPCPs and 9 pesticides were selected to study their occurrence, impact variables and potential risk in a drinking water reservoir in Yangtze Estuary and related drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in China. The detection results showed the presence of PPCPs and pesticides reflected in a large part of croplands and urban and built-up land in the adjacent basin. The discrepancy of concentration among the different PPCPs and pesticides was mainly decided by their application amount or daily usage. Then, the major factors regulating the occurrence of these contaminants in the surface water were found as the living expenditure attributed to food and medicine based on a correlation analysis. Also, the PPCPs were found to negatively correlate to the effectiveness of sewage management. The detection of the PPCPs and pesticides in DWTPs indicated that, except for atrazine and simazine, the removal percentages were increased significantly in advanced DWTPs. Moreover, risk assessment estimated by a Risk Quotient and Hazard Quotient showed that while caffeine, bisphenol A, estrone and simazine were at a high-risk level in the reservoir water, all of the contaminants detected posed no risk to human health through drinking water. It's possible that atrazine could pose a high risk to the ecosystem while simazine could pose a risk to human health in the future considering the increasing expenditure attributed to food.

AB This work describes the removal of 6 quinolone antibiotics from wastewaters under different redox conditions (aerobic, nitrifying and anoxic) through batch experiments in laboratory scale activated sludge reactors using mixed liquor from a membrane bioreactor pilot plant (MBR). The main removal pathways for antibiotics from wastewaters involved in each treatment are described. Mass balances indicated that sorption on sludge played a dominating role in the elimination of antibiotics. Sorption potential depended on the redox conditions, being lower in nitrifying (K-d, 414-876 L kg(-1)) and anoxic (K-d, 471-930 L kg(-1)) sludge in comparison with aerobic sludge (K-d, 534-1137 L kg(-1)). Kd was higher for piperazinylic quinolones. Redox conditions also influenced biodegradation, a secondary pathway, which followed first-order kinetics with degradation rates constants ranging from 1.8.10(-3) to 8.2.10(-3) h(-1). Biodegradation rates under anoxic conditions were negligible. The experimental results have also demonstrated much higher removal efficiency by biodegradation (36.2-60.0%) under nitrifying conditions in comparison with aerobic conditions (14.9-43.8%). The addition of allylthiourea, an ammonia monooxygenase inhibitor, inhibited nitrification completely and reduced significantly the biodegradation of target antibiotics (16.5-29.3%). The residual biodegradation in the presence of allylthiourea may be due to the activity of heterotrophs in the enriched nitrifier culture. The removal of the selected antibiotics under the studied redox conditions depended significantly on the bacteria composition of the sludge. These results suggest that despite the known persistence of this group of antibiotics it is possible to enhance their degradation using nitrifying conditions, which at adequate working conditions as high SRT, typical in MBR, become a promising alternative for improving quinolones removal from environment.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been detected in aquatic environments in several countries. Long-term exposure to low levels of antimicrobial agents provides selective pressure, which might alter the sensitivity of bacteria to antimicrobial agents in the environment. Here, we examined FQ levels and the resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to FQs by phenotyping and genotyping. In the aquatic environment in Osaka, Japan, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, enfloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin were detected in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 570 ng L-1. FQ-resistant E. colt were also found. Although no obvious correlation was detected between the concentration of FQs and the presence of FQ-resistant E. coli, FQ-resistant E. coli were detected in samples along with FQs, particularly ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Most FQ-resistant E. coli carried mutations in gyrA, parC, and parE in quinolone resistance-determining regions. No mutations in gyrB were detected in any isolates. Amino acid changes in these isolates were quite similar to those in clinical isolates. Six strains carried the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 and expressed low susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid: the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.25 mu g mL(-1) for ciprofloxacin, and from 8 to 16 mu g mL(-1) for nalidixic acid. This finding confirmed that plasmids containing genes themselves did not confer full resistance to quinolones. Because plasmids are responsible for much the horizontal gene transfer, these genes may transfer and spread in the environment. To our knowledge, is the first report of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 in the aquatic environment, this investigation provides baseline data on antimicrobial resistance profiles in the Osaka area.

AB Antibiotic entry into the water environment has been of growing concern. However, few investigations have been performed to examine the potential for indirect human exposure to environmental antibiotic residues. We evaluated the contribution of drinking water and major food consumption to inadvertent intake of antibiotic residues among general human population in Korea. We estimated daily human intake of six antibiotics, i.e., sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfathiazole (STZ), trimethoprim (TMP), enrofloxacin (EFX), and roxithromycin (RIM), by measuring the concentrations of the antibiotics and their major metabolites in urine from general population in Korea (n=541). In addition, we measured antibiotics from source water of drinking water as well as in tap water samples, and surveyed water consumption rates among the study population. To assess the contribution of dietary factor, we also surveyed consumption pattern for several major foods which are suspected of antibiotics residue. SMZ, Sulfamethazine-N4-acetyl (SMZ-N4), IMP, EFX, ciprofloxacin (CFX), and RIM were detected up to 448, 6210, 11,900, 6970, 32,400, and 151 pg/ml in the urine samples, respectively. Estimates of daily intake of major antibiotics did not appear to be related with consumption of drinking water although antibiotics were frequently detected in source waters (10-67 ng/l). Consumption of several foods correlated significantly with urinary excretion of several antibiotics. Daily intake estimates of EFX and CFX were associated with consumption of beef, pork, and dairy products; those of SMZ and IMP associated with pork and dairy products; and that of IMP related with raw fish. Daily antibiotics intake estimates however did not exceed the acceptable daily intake levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The potential effect of human and veterinary medicines and other personal care products on the environment has become an important topic over the past few years. Whilst an assessment of the potential environmental risks posed by new and existing pharmaceuticals has been required in the United States (U.S.) for a number of decades, in the European Union (EU) and Canada assessments have only been required in the last 5 - 10 years. In the U.S., guidance has been available since the early 1980s on the assessment of veterinary medicines, whereas only recently has detailed guidance become available on how to perform the risk assessment in other areas. For example, in Canada, new pharmaceuticals (and other substances including novel foods, food additives, human biologics and genetic therapies, medical devices, natural health products, veterinary drugs, cosmetics) have been required to be notified for an environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA 1999) since 2001. The European Medicines Evaluation Authority (EMEA) has published guidelines for assessment of veterinary medicines in use in Europe. For veterinary medicines attempts are currently being made by the Veterinary International Co-operation on Harmonisation (VICH) to harmonise these approaches. Generally, the current assessment approaches are tiered and initially involve a comparison of environmental concentrations with set trigger values. If the trigger values are exceeded then a formal assessment has to be performed requiring data on environmental fate and ecotoxicity. Concerns have been raised over the current approaches used in each of the assessment processes and there are a number of areas that warrant further research. This paper will provide an overview of the regulatory assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and will expand on many of the topics for research in the future, and the role that QSAR scientists can play in this research will be highlighted.

AB Quinolone (QN) antibiotics are widely used all over the world and have been frequently detected in source water, but the occurrence in tap water and the treatment efficiencies of QNs by drinking-water treatment plants (DWTPs) were rarely reported. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of six representative QNs in three urban DWTPs of China were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of total QNs in the three source waters ranged from 26.4 ng/L to 313.8 ng/L and all of the six QNs were detectable with a detection frequency of 100% (4.6 to 121.7 ng/L). Enrofloxacin (ENR) and ofloxacin (OFL) were the dominant species of QNs and accounted for 40.1% to 79.5% of the total QNs. After the treatments, there were still considerable QNs in the finished water (total amounts of 74.9 ng/L to 148.4 ng/L). The adsorbed QNs could be readily treated with the removal of turbidity by DWTPs, but only a part of the dissolved QNs (13.6% to 68.5%) can be removed. This implies that the dissolved QNs were more hazardous in the source water. Pre-oxidation and disinfection could remove 15.8 8.3% and 16.9 10.8% of dissolved QNs, respectively, depending on the chemical structure of QNs and the types of oxidant. Chemical oxidation were more efficient than coagulation-sedimentation and filtration for the treatment of dissolved QNs. Ozone-granular activated carbon filtration may fail to remove dissolved QNs in the actual DWTPs, because of the insufficient dosage of oxidant and the competition effect of natural organic matter.

AB Interest in the risks posed by trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters is increasing, particularly with regard to potential effects of long-term, low-dose exposures of aquatic organisms. In most cases, the actual studies on PPCPs were risk assessments at screening-level, and accurate estimates were scarce. In this study, exposure and ecotoxicity data of 50 PPCPs were collected based on our previous studies, and a multiple-level environmental risk assessment was performed. The 50 selected PPCPs are likely to be frequently detected in surface waters of China, with concentrations ranging from the ng L-1 to the low-g L-1, and the risk quotients based on median concentrations ranged from 2046 for nonylphenol to 0 for phantolide. A semi-probabilistic approach screened 33 PPCPs that posed potential risks to aquatic organisms, among which 15 chemicals (nonylphenol, sulfamethoxazole, di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 17 beta-ethynyl estradiol, caffeine, tetracycline, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, dibutyl phthalate, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, tonalide, galaxolide, triclosan, and bisphenol A) were categorized as priority compounds according to an optimized risk assessment, and then the refined probabilistic risk assessment indicated 12 of them posed low to high risk to aquatic ecosystem, with the maximum risk products ranged from 1.54% to 17.38%. Based on these results, we propose that the optimized risk assessment was appropriate for screening priority contaminants at national scale, and when a more accurate estimation is required, the refined probability risk assessment is useful. The methodology and process might provide reference for other research of chemical evaluation and management for rivers, lakes, and sea waters.

AB The paper has analyzed the presence of antibiotics in crude (hospital, medicine production and municipal) waste water, treated waste water, surface water and drinking water across the world. The concentrations of antibiotics in medicine production waste water reached a level of up to 900 mu/dm(3); in hospital waste water, up to 124 mu/dm(3); and in municipal waste water, up to 64 mu/dm(3). Antibiotic concentrations in treated waste water approached 260 ng/dm(3). The presence of antibiotics in surface water has also been covered. The most often identified medicines were: Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Norfloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. The maximum antibiotic concentrations in surface water are as high as up to 2 mu g/dm(3). In the majority of cases, identified antibiotics occurred in concentrations from several to several dozen ng/dm(3), and less often in several hundred ng/dm3. The presence of antibiotics in drinking water, similarly as for waste water, was identified worldwide, e.g. in China, USA, Germany, Canada, France. Very high antibiotic concentrations were noted in Guangzhou, China, which reached a level of up to 679.7 ng/dm(3) (Ciprofloxacin), but also in the USA (Triclosan) 734 ng/dm(3)). In the majority of instances, antibiotics are present in water in much lower concentrations. The consequence of environmental contamination with antibiotics is the drug resistance of many bacterial strains with the resultant deaths of 25 000 people in the European Union and 700 000 people across the globe. The other effects of the presence of antibiotics in the natural environment are not fully understood yet. For example, carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic effects are attributed to these contaminants.

AB Clofibric acid is the metabolite and active principle of blood lipid regulators, it represents the class of acidic pharmaceuticals, and is one of the most persistent drug residues detected in the aquatic environment worldwide. This interdisciplinary work evaluates the effect of solution pH and water hardness in clofibric acid adsorption onto commercial activated carbons. Kinetic and equilibrium assays revealed that the highest clofibric acid removal efficiencies (>70%) were attained at pH 3, and that at pH 8 water hardness degree plays a fundamental role in the adsorption process. In hard water at pH 8 the removal efficiency values increased by 22 or 46% points depending on the carbon sample. Adsorbents' textural properties also affect the adsorption process since for the microporous sample (CP) the increase of water hardness has a great influence in kinetic and equilibrium data, while for the micro + mesoporous carbon (VP) the variation of the water hardness promoted less significant changes. At pH 3 the increase of water hardness leads to changes in the adsorption mechanism of clofibric acid onto CP carbon signaled by a transition from an S-type to an L-type curve. At pH 8 the change from deionized water to hard water doubles the maximum adsorption capacity of sample CP (101.7 mg g(-1) vs 211.9 mg g(-1), respectively).
   The adsorption enhancement, with water hardness under alkaline conditions, was reasoned in terms of calcium complexation with clofibrate anion exposed by molecular modeling and conductivity studies. Ca2+ complexation by other acidic organic compounds may also occur, and should be considered, since it can play a fundamental role in improved design of water treatment processes employing activated carbons.

AB The effects of the antiepileptic, analgesic drug carbamazepine on the growth, morphology, and life-history characteristics of Daphnia pulex were examined at nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 200 mu g L-1. At 1 mu g carbamazepine L-1, Daphnia matured and reproduced slightly earlier than did controls, and at a given body length females produced more offspring than did controls or those receiving other treatments. In combination with a relatively high juvenile somatic growth rate and highest total number of progeny produced per female, carbamazepine at 1 mu g L-1 seemed to exert a stimulatory effect. The rates of population growth of the 100 and 200 mu g L-1 treatment groups was 9% and 32% lower, respectively, than the rates of growth of the controls and the Daphnia receiving treatments of up to 10 mu g carbamazepine L-1. At the highest dose, retardation of juvenile somatic growth resulted in delayed maturity and consequently in a lower rate of population growth. Adult somatic growth, spine length, reproductive output, and size of newborns were similar among treatments. Male offspring were only produced in the third broods, with broods that were 8% and 28% male at 1 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Neck teeth were never observed in Daphnia. Chronic adverse effects of carbamazepine on nontarget Daphnia were detected at 200 mu g carbamazepine L-1, but stimulatory effects might occur at environmentally realistic concentrations. However, additional studies of chronic toxicity investigating various combinations of pharmaceuticals and various environmental stresses, such as food condition, temperature, and kairomones, are needed to fully explore potential long-term adverse effects and to assess the environmental risk of common pharmaceuticals.

AB Sulfamethoxazole is an emergent contaminant in waters. It is an antibiotic for humans and animals that is difficult to biodegrade in drinking water and sewage treatment plants. As the most frequent sulfonamide, its treatment and removal is difficult. In its anionic form, it can be retained by ion exchange, although competition with other ions, especially salts present in natural and treated water, needs to be taken into consideration because of competition between the anions for the active sites of the resin. This work investigated the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from low saline waters. An anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP500, was used to remove SMX in synthetic solutions in the presence of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate salts. Multicomponent system solutions containing a fixed concentration of salts and different concentrations of SMX were tested in batch experiments. The presence of Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- suppressed the adsorption of SMX, especially the presence of SO42-, which showed the highest adsorption capacity onto the resin. Adsorption equilibrium constants were determined using the Langmuir isotherm and the extended Langmuir isotherm for multicomponent systems. The maximum adsorption capacity for the SMX and salts system was 105 mg/mL wet resin and the equilibrium constants 1.4 L/g SMX, 6 L/g NO3-, 9 L/g SO42-. Kinetics was analyzed using the pore diffusion model, getting a diffusivity value of 1.3 x 10 cm(2)/s for SMX. Finally, two operational load and elution cycles were carried out in a fixed-bed column using mixture synthetic solutions of SMX and salts to obtain the corresponding breakthrough curves. Results show that the resin is able to retain SMX despite the high competition of the other anions and can be regenerated completely after each cycle. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been documented throughout the United States fresh-waters but research has focused largely on lotic systems. Because PPCPs are designed to have a physiological effect, it is likely that they may also influence aquatic organisms. Thus, PPCPs may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. The objectives of this research were to quantify PPCP abundance in near-shore habitats of southern Lake Michigan and identify factors related to PPCP abundance. Stratified sampling was conducted seasonally at four southern Lake Michigan sites. All sites and depths had measurable PPCP concentrations, with mean individual compound concentrations of acetaminophen (536 ng/L), caffeine (31.0 ng/L), carbamazepine (2.23 ng/L), cotinine (4.03 ng/L), gemfibrozil (7.03 ng/L), ibuprofen (7.88 ng/L), lincomycin (4.28 ng/L), naproxen (6.32 ng/L), paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine; 462 ng/L), sulfadimethoxine (0.94 ng/L), sulfamerazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (26.0 ng/L), sulfathiazole (0.92 ng/L), tridocarban (5.72 ng/L), trimethoprim (5.15 ng/L), and tylosin (3.75 ng/L). Concentrations of PPCPs varied significantly among sampling times and locations (river mouth vs offshore), with statistical interactions between the main effects of site and time as well as time and location. Concentrations of PPCPs did not differ with site or depth. Temperature, total carbon, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and ammonium concentrations were related to total pharmaceutical concentrations. These data indicate that PPCPs are ubiquitous and persistent in southern Lake Michigan, potentially posing harmful effects to aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, tens-of-thousands of chemicals are used in Japan, and their presence in and impact on aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. Because conventional risk evaluation processes using target analysis and biological tests are time-consuming and costly, it is challenging to investigate all substances. Therefore, we aimed to develop a rapid and highly efficient screening scheme for identifying hazardous organic micropollutants (OMPs) in aquatic ecosystems. The scheme is divided into two steps: chemical analysis and risk evaluation. First, a comprehensive screening method (CSM) using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and a database containing nearly 1000 compounds is used to identify known compounds, and nontargeted analysis is carried out using a GC x GC-time-of-flight (TOF)MS to detect compounds not registered in the database. Secondly, the predicted toxicity values obtained by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) are used to evaluate and rank the ecological risk of each detected OMPs and to identify priority compounds for detailed survey. To assess the proposed scheme, we surveyed representative urban rivers in Japan and ranked the potential toxicity of the identified compounds. The total number of compounds detected in water from each river ranged from 29 to 87, and the total concentrations ranged from 2.3 to 63 mu g L-1. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, such as crotamiton and galaxolide, were identified in the urban rivers and found to have high ecotoxicity rankings. Thus, the scheme combining CSM and risk evaluation using QSAR is a novel screening that can identify candidates with high ecological risk in aquatic environment rapidly and efficiently.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter surface waters via sewage treatment plants. In the environment, the substances and their transformation products, formed by the degradation of the parent compounds, can affect aquatic wildlife, including freshwater invertebrates. However, research on pharmaceutical-induced effects in wild freshwater organisms other than fish is still scarce. In our study, we investigated the impact of the highly consumed antidiabetic drug metformin and its main transformation product, guanylurea, on the health of a freshwater gastropod-the big ramshorn snail (Planorbarius corneus) by analysing its biochemical and cellular stress responses and apical parameters. The snails were exposed to different concentrations of the drug (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/L) and its transformation product (0, 0.1, 10, and 100 mg/L). The examined parameters were mortality, weight, tissue integrity of the hepatopancreas, and the levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides. Mortality and the levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides were not influenced by the two substances. In response to the highest concentrations of both chemicals, the weight of the snails was slightly but not significantly reduced. The histopathological investigation of the hepatopancreas revealed a significant effect of guanylurea at a concentration of 100 mg/L with an increased number of symptoms of cellular responses in the tissue (e.g., dilated lumen, disturbed compartmentation of the digestive cells, nucleus deformation, hyperplasia, and hypertrophy of crypt cells). For the parent compound, a similar trend was also observed for the highest concentration. Overall, the observed effects did not occur at environmentally relevant concentrations, but at concentrations which were 10,000 times higher than these. Thus, the results did not give rise to a major concern that metformin and guanylurea could pose a risk to the big ramshorn snail in the environment.

AB Data on the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) in marine environmental compartments are still limited, with few studies reporting superficial water contamination, mainly in tropical zones. In this sense, environmental data of these substances are essential to identify potential polluting sources, as well as their impact in costal ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of COC and BE in seawater, sediment and mussels from a subtropical coastal zone (Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil), as well as to determine a field measured Bioaccumulation Factor (BAF). COC and BE were detected in all water samples in concentrations ranging from 1.91 ng.L-1 to 12.52 ng.L-1 and 9.88 ng.L-1 to 28.53 ng.L-1, respectively. In sediments, only COC was quantified in concentrations ranging from 0.94 ng.g(-1) to 46.85 ng.g(-1). Similarly, only COC was detected in tissues of mussels 0.914 mu g.kg(-1 )to 4.58 mu g.kg(-1) (ww). The field-measured BAF ranged from 163 to 1454 (L.kg(-1)). Our results pointed out a widespread contamination by cocaine and its main human metabolite benzoylecgonine in Santos Bay. Mussels were able to accumulate COC in areas used by residents and tourists for bathing, fishing, and harvest, denoting concern to human health. Therefore, our data can be considered a preliminary assessment, which indicates the need to evaluate drugs (including illicit as COC) in environmental and seafood monitoring programs, in order to understand their risks on the ecosystem and human health.

AB The efficiency of two white-rot fungi (WRF), Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma lucidum, to eliminate thirteen pharmaceutical pollutants with concomitant biodiesel production from the accumulating lipid content after treatment, was examined. The removal efficiency was studied using both individual and combined strains. The results of individual and combined strains showed a total removal (100%) of diclofenac (DCF), gemfibrozil (GFZ), ibuprofen (IBP), progesterone (PGT) and ranitidine (RNT). Lower removals were achieved for 4-acetamidoantipyrin (AAA), clofibric acid (ACF), atenolol (AM), caffeine (CFN), carbamazepine (CZP), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulpiride (SPD), although the combination of both strains enhanced the system's efficiency, with removals ranging from 15 to 41%. This increase of the removal efficiency when combining both strains was attributed to the interactions developed between them (i.e., competition). Results from enzymatic and cytochrome P450 examination suggested that both extracellular (laccase, MnP, LiP) and intracellular oxidation mechanisms participate in the biological removal of pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, the "green" potential of the fungal sludge generated during the biological removal process was assessed for biodiesel production by means of one-step direct (in-situ) transformation. This process consists of the simultaneous extraction and conversion of lipids contained in the sludge by catalytic esterification/transesterification using a robust acid heterogeneous Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. This catalytic system provided conversions close to 80% of the saponifiable fraction (including free fatty acids and glycerides) in the presence of high amount of impurities. The overall weight FAME yield, based on the initial dried mass, was close to 30% for both strains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of carbamazepine (CBZ) on aquatic organisms are yet not well investigated. The present study aimed to better understand the chronic effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of CBZ. The experiment was performed by exposing the filter feeding clam Ruditapes philippinarum to 0.00, 0.03, 0.30, 3.00 and 9.00 mu g/L, during 28 days. To assess the chronic toxicity of the drug a battery of biomarkers related with health status and oxidative stress was applied. In order to quantify CBZ in the clam's tissues and in water samples ELISA was used. The present study showed three types of responses on the clams after a chronic exposure to CBZ. For control condition and the lower concentrations (0.03 and 030 mu g/L) a "similar" metabolic state was observed and the most efficient antioxidant status leading to the elimination of reactive oxygen species formed during the metabolism of CBZ. The concentration of 3.00 mu g/L seemed to be a "threshold" concentration, beyond which the concentration levels of CBZ began to exert a toxic effect, compromising the activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, with notorious effects at the highest CBZ concentration (9.00 mu g/L). CBZ also seemed to alter the energy-related responses, especially the glycogen and electron system responses, revealing a slowdown in metabolism at the higher exposure concentrations (3.00 and 9.00 mu g/L). Overall, the present study demonstrated that the higher CBZ concentrations can lead to the impairment of antioxidant enzymes compromising the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, and thus the ability to cope with oxidative stress.

AB Apart from providing a total activated sludge (AS) inhibition, an efficient AS inhibition technique must preserve the biomass structure in order to maintain the real sorption phenomenon. Many inhibition techniques with different modes of action were used in previous studies for AS inhibition. But, the effectiveness of AS deactivation and the adverse effects on the biomass structure were rarely related. In this paper, five common AS inhibition techniques were evaluated: thermal, three chemical and gas purging techniques. The lowest chemical effective concentrations were determined in order to limit the negative impact on the AS structure. 100 mgHg(2)SO(4) g(TSS)(-1) and 30 mgHgCl(2) g(TSS)(-1) within 2 h of reaction were enough to provide a complete AS inhibition. However, after 20 h of reaction a full AS inhibition has never been achieved with sodium azide at 200 mgNaN(3) g(TSS)(-1), even by increasing NaN3 concentration.
   The analysis of the AS apparent viscosity, the median size D-50 of the flocs and the supernatant turbidity showed that the thermal technique destructured the AS completely. A significant AS deflocculation is induced by the three chemical reagents depending on the mode of action and the concentration used. Thermal and chemical inactivations are therefore not suitable to determine sorption properties. The only technique which kept the initial AS structure unchanged has several drawbacks since (i) a reaction might occur between the gas and the analyte of interest, and (ii) anaerobic activated sludge are not inhibited by this technique. Therefore, the establishment of anaerobic conditions without gas injection is recommended for implementing sorption experiments on aerobic AS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia (ELCIC), a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Brazil, was the focus of this study that aimed to relate external levels of exposure to contaminants to toxic effects on Gobioides broussonnetii fish. Different anthropogenic contaminants such as metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were analyzed in the sediments; and biochemical, histopathological and genotoxicity biomarkers evaluated in fish; in two different seasons at three sites of the estuarine region. Higher contamination of the sediments was observed near the main urban center (Iguape city - IG). Metal concentrations were considered low to moderate, while PAHs concentrations were considered low. The concentrations of PPCPs increased due to the anthropogenic presence and were higher near IG and the Cananeia Island (CI). Contributions from historical mining, agriculture, nautical activities, oil, sewage and waste disposal, biomass and fossil fuels combustion were identified. Higher concentrations of metals and PPCPs were observed during the cold-dry season, suggesting influences of the lower hydrodynamics during the season of lower precipitation. Higher PAHs concentrations occurred in the hot-rainy season, indicating influences of greater human presence in summer. In fish, biological responses followed the same spatial and seasonal pattern. More pronounced changes in antioxidant, biotransformation, histopathological and genotoxic biomarkers were observed in IG and CI. The multivariate analysis and the integrated biomarkers response index (IBR) also evidenced worse environmental conditions in these sites. This result can indicate a negative influence of anthropogenic activities on the contamination of sediments and on the biological responses of fish. This study presented the first ecotoxicological data for the species and suggested that these chronic exposures can cause adverse effects on this fish population. The data contribute to the understanding of local environmental quality and can be applied in the future to the environmental and social management of marine protected areas.

AB Biosolids are extensively used in agriculture as fertilizers while offering a practical solution for waste disposal. Many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), such as triclosan and triclocarban, are enriched in biosolids. Biosolid amendment changes soil physicochemical properties, which may in turn alter the persistence of PPCPs and hence the risk for secondary contamination such as plant uptake. To delineate the effect of biosolids on PPCPs persistence, triclosan and triclocarban were used as model compounds in this study and their sorption (K-d) and persistence (t(1/2)) were determined in different soils before and after biosolid amendment. Biosolids consistently increased sorption of triclosan and triclocarban in soil. The K-d of triclosan increased by 3.9-21 times following amendment of a sandy loam soil with biosolids at 2-10%. The persistence of both compounds was prolonged, with t(1/2) of triclosan increasing from 10 d in the unamended soil to 63 d after biosolid amendment at 10%. The relationship between t(1/2) and K-d was further examined through a meta-analysis using data from this study and all relevant published studies. A significant linear relationship between t(1/2) and K-d was observed for triclosan (r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.01) and triclocarban (r(2) = 0.38, p < 0.05) in biosolid-amended soils. On the average, when biosolid amendment increased by 1%, t(1/2) of triclosan was prolonged by 7.5 d, while t(1/2) of triclocarban was extended by 4.7 d. Therefore, biosolid amendment greatly enhances persistence of triclosan and triclocarban, likely due to enhanced sorption or decreased chemical bioavailability. This finding highlights the importance to consider the effect of biosolids when evaluating the environmental risks of these and other biosolid-borne PPCPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the photocatalytic removal of diclofenac (DCF) was investigated using TiO2-P25 nanoparticles immobilized on glass beads in a packed bed photoreactor. DCF is one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used as an analgesic drug. DCF is monitored in urban sewage and surface waters as a stable contaminant that can harm the environment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are promising methods for degradation and removal of environmental pollutants. The heterogeneous photocatalysis process is one of the AOPs so that the contaminants are decompose in the presence of UV light and a photocatalyst (TiO2). Holes and hydroxyl radicals are the main active species in the UV/TiO(2)process. A thin layer of TiO2-P25 nanoparticles was immobilized by heat attachment method on glass beads. The effect of five operational parameters, the initial concentration of DCF, the power of the light source, the flow rate of the fluid in the photoreactor, irradiation time and pH, has been studied experimentally in the efficiency of the photoreactor. The DCF removal percent is 99% for the initial DCF concentration of 10 mg L-1, the power of the light source of 16 W, the fluid flow rate of 240 mL min(-1)and pH 6 for 120 min irradiation time. The effect of operational parameters on the DCF removal percent was modeled using the artificial neural network (ANN). ANN modeling with a 5 : 9 : 1 feed-forward back propagation neural network demonstrated the appropriate consistency of the experimental and predicted data. TheR(2)values for all data (training, validation and test) were close to 1, confirming ANN reasonable predictive performance. Using the weights of the ANN model in the Garson equation, indicated that pH and irradiation time had the highest effect on the DCF removal percent.

AB This study determined biotransformation rates (k(bio)) and sorption-distribution coefficients (K-d) for a select group of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic activated sludge collected from two different biological nutrient removal (BNR) treatment systems located in Nevada (NV) and Ohio (OH) in the United States (US). The NV and OH facilities operated at solids retention times (SRTs) of 8 and 23 days, respectively. Using microwave-assisted extraction, the biotransformation rates of the chosen TOrCs were measured in the total mixed liquor. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and atenolol biotransformed in all three redox regimes irrespective of the activated sludge source. The biotransformation of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), triclosan, and benzotriazole was observed in aerobic activated sludge from both treatment plants; however, anoxic biotransformation of these three compounds was seen only in anoxic activated sludge from NV. Carbamazepine was recalcitrant in all three redox regimes and both sources of activated sludge. Atenolol and DEET had greater biotransformation rates in activated sludge with a higher SRT (23 days), while trimethoprim had a higher biotransformation rate in activated sludge with a lower SRT (8 days). The remaining compounds did not show any dependence on SRT. Lyophilized, heat inactivated sludge solids were used to determine the sorption-distribution coefficients. Triclosan was the most sorptive compound followed by carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, DEET, and benzotriazole. The sorption-distribution coefficients were similar across redox conditions and sludge sources. The biotransformation rates and sorption-distribution coefficients determined in this study can be used to improve fate prediction of the target TOrCs in BNR treatment systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered to be the cure-all of any pain: from headache and cold symptoms to toothaches and even labour pain. Their wide use in human medicine has been favoured by the possibility to purchase them without medical prescription, their low cost and by the absence of opioid-like side effects. At the same time, their administration to domestic and food-producing animals has become a common practice to improve their well-being. Therefore, human and veterinary applications are the main sources of NSAIDs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge through sewage treatment plants. Although their environmental occurrence is well-known, there is a lack of data regarding their levels in surface waters of Central Italy. In this study, a monitoring campaign was arranged in some of the most important rivers and lakes of Central Italy, characterised by a different anthropic impact, in spring-summer and autumn-winter 2012. A broad range of NSAIDs for human and animal use was analysed through a reliable analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, appropriately developed and validated. Results have shown the constant presence of all drugs commonly used in human medicine with a composition that mirrored the incidence of seasonal diseases quite well. A veterinary drug (flunixin) was found in Bracciano Lake (Rome district), an important tourist attraction surrounded by farmlands. Salicylic acid is a phytohormone and this explains its presence in all the analyzed samples. All the results collected during the extensive survey have proved that Central Italy is aligned with the rest of Europe since its natural waters have shown low levels of contamination (ngL(-1)) but with a chronic input.

AB The present study aims to investigate the individual and combined effects of temperature, pH, zero-valent bimetallic nanoparticles (ZVBMNPs) dose, and chloramphenicol (CP) concentration on the reductive degradation of CP using ZVBMNPs in aqueous medium.
   Iron-silver ZVBMNPs were synthesized. Batch experimental data were generated using a four-factor statistical experimental design. CP reduction by ZVBMNPs was optimized using the response surface modeling (RSM) and artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) approaches. The RSM and ANN methodologies were also compared for their predictive and generalization abilities using the same training and validation data set. Reductive by-products of CP were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique.
   The optimized process variables (RSM and ANN-GA approaches) yielded CP reduction capacity of 57.37 and 57.10 mg g(-1), respectively, as compared to the experimental value of 54.0 mg g(-1) with un-optimized variables. The ANN-GA and RSM methodologies yielded comparable results and helped to achieve a higher reduction (> 6%) of CP by the ZVBMNPs as compared to the experimental value. The root mean squared error, relative standard error of prediction and correlation coefficient between the measured and model-predicted values of response variable were 1.34, 3.79, and 0.964 for RSM and 0.03, 0.07, and 0.999 for ANN models for the training and 1.39, 3.47, and 0.996 for RSM and 1.25, 3.11, and 0.990 for ANN models for the validation set.
   Predictive and generalization abilities of both the RSM and ANN models were comparable. The synthesized ZVBMNPs may be used for an efficient reductive removal of CP from the water.

AB This work investigated the degradation of a natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) and the removal of estrogenic activity by the ozonation process in three different pHs (3, 7 and 11). A recombinant yeast assay (YES assay) was employed to determine estrogenic activity of the ozonized samples and of the by-products formed during the ozonation. Ozonation was very efficient for the removal of 17 beta-estradiol in aqueous solutions. High removals (>99%) were achieved with low ozone dosages in the three different pHs. Several by-products were formed during the ozonation of 17 beta-estradiol. However, only a few compounds could be identified and confirmed. Different by-products are formed at different pHs, which is probably due to different chemical pathways and different oxidants (03 and OH radical). The by-products formed at pH 11 were 10 epsilon-17 beta-dihydroxy- 1, 4-estradieno-3-one (DEO) and 2-hydroxyestradiol, which were not formed in pH 3. Only testosterone could be observed in pH 3, whereas at pH 7 all three by-products were found. At pH 7 and 11 the applied ozone dosages were not enough to remove all the estrogenicity from samples, even though the 17 beta-estradiol residual concentration for these two pHs was lower than at pH 3. Higher estrogenicity was detected at pH 11. An explanation to this fact may be that oxidation via OH radical forms more by-products with estrogenic activity. Probably, the formation of 2-hydroxyestradiol at pHs 7 and 11 is contributing to the residual estrogenicity of samples ozonized at these pHs. In this work, complete removal of estrogenic activity was only obtained at pH 3. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is detected in sewage effluent at concentrations that can disrupt normal reproductive function in fish. The objectives of this study were to identify novel genomic responses to EE2 exposure using microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis in the liver and telencephalon of male zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to an environmentally relevant nominal concentration of 10 ng/L EE2 for a 21 -day period. In the liver, common biomarkers for estrogenic exposure such as vitellogenin 1 and 3 (vtg1; vtg3), estrogen receptor alpha (esr1), and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) mRNA were identified by microarray analysis as being differentially regulated. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that vtg1 was induced similar to 700-fold, vtg3 was induced similar to 100-fold and esr1 was induced similar to 20-fold. As determined by microarray analysis, ATPase Na+/K+ alpha 1a.4 (atp1a1a.4) and ATPase Na+/K+ beta la (atp1b1a) mRNA were down-regulated in the liver. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that there were common biological processes and molecular functions regulated by EE2 in both tissues (e.g. electron transport and cell communication) but there were tissue specific changes in gene categories. For example, genes involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism were down-regulated in the liver but were induced in the telencephalon. This study demonstrates that (1) tissues exhibit different gene responses to low EE2 exposure; (2) there are pronounced genomic effects in the liver and (3) multi-tissue gene profiling is needed to improve understanding of the effects of human pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have recently. been detected in the aquatic environment. Many studies have identified domestic waste water discharge as the source for detectable concentrations of PPCPs in surface water. PPCPs are a concern for the aquatic environment when production and use are sufficiently large and physicochemical properties are appropriate. Hydrophilic PPCPs present in surface water or waste water may also affect ground water quality where water is used to recharge ground water. However, less is known about how efficiently PPCPs are removed during percolation, through the subsurface. The scope of this study was to. examine the fate of selected PPCPs during ground water recharge at two water reuse sites where secondary and tertiary treated waste water is used for subsequent ground water recharge. The ground water recharge sites selected differ in aboveground treatment and geohydrological settings. The selected pharmaceutials represent blood lipid regulators, analgesics/anti-inflammatories, blood viscosity agents, and antiepileptics. Organic iodine was used as a surrogate parameter for X-ray contrast agents. Composite samples of treated waste water and from ground water monitoring wells were collected and, analyzed for pharmaceuticals using gas chromatography with mass spectroscopic,detection.
   The study revealed that the stimulant caffeine, analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and fenoprofen, and blood lipid regulators such as gemfibrozil were efficiently removed to concentrations near or below the detection limit of the analytical method after retention times of less than six months during ground water recharge. The antiepileptics carbamazepine and primidone were not removed during ground water recharge under either anoxic saturated or aerobic unsaturated flow conditions during travel times of up to eight years. Organic iodine showed a partial removal only under anoxic, saturated conditions as compared to aerobic conditions and persisted in the recharged ground water.

AB The occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, and potential risks of 21 glucocorticoids (GCs) and 3 mineralocorticoids (MCs) in four rivers were studied by investigating the surface waters from the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. These environmental corticosteroids (ECs) were commonly present in the river surface waters with average concentrations varying from <0.17 ng/L for fluticasone propionate to 5.6 ng/L for clobetasone butyrate; and cortisone had the highest concentration, 32.9 ng/L. The total ECs ranged in concentration from undetectable to 83.3 ng/L, with a mean and median of 8.1 ng/L and 4.8 ng/L, respectively. Spatially the total EC concentration levels in the Pearl River system occurred in the following order: Zhujiang River (ZR) > Dongjiang River (DR) > Shiziyang waterway (SW) > Beijiang River (BR). These levels generally demonstrated a trend of increasing from upstream to midstream or down-stream then attenuating toward the estuary. Considerable seasonal variations in the ECs differed among rivers. Higher ECs concentrations in winter were mostly found in the ZR, whereas lower levels were found in the DR. Moreover, the temporal variations of the ECs were marginal in the BR and SW. These spatiotemporal distributions of the ECs might have been simultaneously influenced by pollution sources derived from anthropogenic activities and river hydrologic conditions. Correlation analyses indicated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could play a key role in the occurrence and distribution of ECs in an aquatic environment. Risk assessment demonstrated that the occurrence of ECs might have posed medium to high risk to aquatic organisms in the Pearl River. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contamination of the aquatic environment by pharmaceutical drugs is an emerging issue in ecotoxicology. Aquatic organisms, in the presence of xenobiotics, tend to activate defensive mechanisms against toxic effects in order to mitigate and/or compensate for the toxic damages that frequently result from these interactions. Salicylic acid (SA) is a common drug, widely used in human medicine due to its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties, as well as its activity in terms of preventing platelet aggregation, among other clinical and cosmetic uses. It is commonly found in levels of the nanograms per liter to the micrograms per liter range in receiving waters, and its presence has been related to toxic effects in aquatic organisms, including oxidative stress. However, the number of studies that characterize the ecotoxicological profile of salicylates is still scarce and no studies have been published about the putative toxic effects of SA, especially in marine polychaetes. In order to determine the potential ecotoxicological effects caused by SA, individuals of the marine Polychaeta species Hediste diversicolor were exposed for 96h to ecologically relevant concentrations of this compound, and several biochemical endpoints were evaluated, namely the activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT), the phase II biotransformation isoenzymes glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the determination of lipoperoxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay). The obtained results demonstrated that despite the pro-oxidative effects elicited by SA, exposure to realistic levels of this compound was not able to generate a state of oxidative stress, and the adaptive protective responses elicited by exposed individuals were effective enough to minimize and/or inhibit the damage potentially caused by overproduced reactive oxygen species.

AB Pharmaceuticals derived from manufacturing and human consumption contaminate surface waters worldwide. To what extent such pharmaceutical contamination accumulates and disperses over time in different compartments of aquatic food webs is not well known. In this study we assess to what extent five pharmaceuticals (diphenhydramine, oxazepam, trimethopiim, diclofenac, and hydroxyzine) are taken up by fish (European perch) and four aquatic invertebrate taxa (damselfly larvae, mayfly larvae, waterlouse, and ramshorn snail), by tracing their bioconcentrations over several months in a semi-natural large-scale (pond) system. The results suggest both significant differences among drugs in their capacity to bioaccumulate and differences among species in uptake. While no support for in situ uptake of diclofenac and trimethoprim was found, oxazepam, cliphenhyclramine, and hydroxyzine were detected in all analyzed species. Here, the highest bioaccumulation factor (tissue:water ratio) was found for hydroxyzine. In the food web, the highest concentrations were found in the benthic species ramshorn snail and waterlouse, indicating that bottom-living organism at lower trophic positions are the prime receivers of the pharmaceuticals. In general, concentrations in the biota decreased over time in response to decreasing water concentrations. However, two interesting exceptions to this trend were noted. First, mayfly larvae (primarily grazers) showed peak concentrations (a fourfold increase) of oxazepam, cliphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine about 30 days after initial addition of pharmaceuticals. Second, perch (top-predator) showed an increase in concentrations of oxazepam throughout the study period. Our results show that drugs can remain bioavailable for aquatic organism for long time periods (weeks to months) and even re-enter the food web at a later time. As such, for an understanding of accumulation and dispersion of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs, detailed ecological knowledge is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most amphibians breed in water, including the terrestrial species, and may therefore be exposed to water-borne pharmaceuticals during critical phases of the reproductive cycle, i.e. sex differentiation and gamete maturation. The objectives of this paper were to (i) review available literature regarding adverse effects of hormonally active pharmaceuticals on amphibians, with special reference to environmentally relevant exposure levels and (ii) expand the knowledge on toxicity of progestagens in amphibians by determining effects of norethindrone (NET) and progesterone (P) exposure to 0, 1, 10 or 100 ng l(-1) (nominal) on oogenesis in the test species Xenopus tropicalis. Very little information was found on toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals on amphibians. Research has shown that environmental concentrations (1.8 ng l(-1)) of the pharmaceutical oestrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) cause developmental reproductive toxicity involving impaired spermatogenesis in frogs. Recently, it was found that the progestagen levonorgestrel (LNG) inhibited oogenesis in frogs by interrupting the formation of vitellogenic oocytes at an environmentally relevant concentration (1.3 ng l(-1)). Results from the present study revealed that 1 ng NET l(-1) and 10 ng P l(-1) caused reduced proportions of vitellogenic oocytes and increased proportions of previtellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, thereby indicating inhibited vitellogenesis. Hence, the available literature shows that the oestrogen EE2 and the progestagens LNG, NET and P impair reproductive functions in amphibians at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations. The progestagens are of particular concern given their prevalence, the range of compounds and that several of them (LNG, NET and P) share the same target (oogenesis) at environmental exposure concentrations, indicating a risk for adverse effects on fertility in exposed wild amphibians.

AB Antibiotics are commonly used in livestock and poultry farming. Residual antibiotics in manure may lead to antibiotic pollution of soil, surface water, and groundwater through land application and run-off rainfall. The black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens is a good candidate for manure management. We evaluated the effect of sulfonamide pollution on the growth of H. illucens. Four treatments were considered with a sulfonamide content in the feed of 0 (control group), 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. The control larvae were fed without sulfonamide. Survival and development status of the individuals were recorded daily. The weights of the fifth instar larvae, prepupae, and pupae were checked. Antioxidant enzyme activity was determined with the fifth instar larvae. The results showed that a low (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) concentration of sulfonamides had no effects on larval survival, pupation, and eclosion of BSFs. A high sulfonamide concentration of 10 mg/kg had a significant effect on the survival of larvae and pupae and on the body weight of larvae, prepupae and pupae. Peak of the cumulated pupation rate and eclosion rate in the sulfonamide treatment of 10 mg/kg was very low. Pupation and eclosion in this group peaked later than that of the control and low sulfonamide concentration treatment groups (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg). Larvae from the sulfonamides group showed lower antioxidase activities than that of the control. In sulfonamide groups, the activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethazine were not detected in the harvested prepupae. Only sulfadiazine was discovered in the sulfonamide treatments of 1 and 10 mg/kg. In conclusion, BSFs can tolerate certain concentrations of sulfonamide contamination.

AB A Na-smectite clay mineral (Na-Mt) was exchanged with two concentrations of benzyldimethyltetradecyl ammonium chloride cationic surfactant up to one time the cation exchange capacity. Nonionic organoclay was prepared with polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether (Brij-O20) nonionic surfactant at one concentration. The resulting organoclays displayed lateral layer organization of the surfactants within their interlayer space.. The adsorption properties of these organoclays and the starting raw clay mineral were evaluated for three extensively used antibiotic pharmaceutical products: the amoxicillin (AMX), the sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and the trimethoprim (TRI), recognized as recalcitrant compounds to conventional water treatments and to display a complex behavior for different pH and temperature experimental conditions. Besides showing short half-life time with possible degradation by UV radiation, these antibiotics associated with mineral phases cause serious environmental issues of which the toxic effect can be exacerbated in the presence of other chemical compounds. From the set of data obtained by complementary techniques: UV and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction, it appears that the nonionic organoclay shows its versatility for the adsorption of individual molecules as well as a pool of antibiotics. The mixing of the three antibiotics showing different electric charged species (cations, anions, and zwitterions) mimics the natural context drives to a deep modification of the adsorption behavior onto the different materials that can act as possible carrier mineral phases in aquatic environment. These competition effects can be measured through the significant decrease of the K-F Freundlich constants for AMX in the presence of other molecules (or electrolytes), whereas TRI and SMX, by their possible association, create a synergistic effect that favors their adsorption on the whole layered materials.

AB The increase in medicine and drug consumption have resulted in identifying these emerging pollutants in all aquatic compartments, ranging from surface water and groundwater resources to the marine environment. Pharmaceuticals are an indispensable part of life today. A large number of pharmaceuticals are used in a daily basis in the treatment, prevention, cure or diagnosis of diseases or to otherwise enhance people's physical or mental well-being. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the attitude of citizens in Cyprus regarding the disposal of pharmaceuticals as well as to identify the main reasons why pharmaceutical wastes are produced. The result indicted that in Cyprus, there is lack of data regarding the amount of pharmaceutical wastes that are discarded into household waste and sinks. The survey audit showed that 86.6% of men's and 83.3% of women's used pharmacy with or without doctor's recipe. Social behaviour is considered to be the most significant reason that pharmaceutical are produced. The results indicated that, citizens mainly keep unused medicines and drugs at home in case they are needed again as well as patients use to cut-off or to reduce their treatment in case that on the first 3-6 days they feel better. The survey indicated that the main disposal method of unused or expired medicines and drugs is in household waste followed from the sink and the toilet. Furthermore, the main disposal solution of unused or expired medicines and drugs remain the household bin as well as the sewage system (sink or toilet), while a percentage more than 55% of the participants indicated that they will follow a specific waste management program if existing in place. Moreover, in order to reduce the production of pharmaceutical wastes, specific prevention activities must be considered.

AB There is a risk of 'ecological surprises' if multiple potentially interacting stressors are managed individually, which is a question attracting significant current interest. Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a 'basemodel' with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna.

AB The objectives of the research are to determine the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water and groundwater in the Republic of Serbia and to identify significant effects of river-water purification through riverbank filtration, concerning oxic conditions and hydrogeological conditions of alluvial aquifers in Serbia. Between 2009 and 2015, a total of 19 studied pharmaceuticals and metabolites were analyzed in 184 samples, 10 were detected in surface water, and 8 in groundwater. Carbamazepine and metamizole metabolites N-acetyl-4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAA) and N-formyl-4-amino-antipyrine (4-FAA) have the highest frequency of occurrence in surface water (57.3-68.8 %) and in groundwater (19.5-43.9 %), respectively. Highest detected concentrations were for 4-AAA (520 ng/L) and 4-FAA (248 ng/L) in surface water as well as in groundwater (4-AAA 128 ng/L and 4-FAA 150 ng/L). Results showed that riverbank filtration sites with different hydrogeological and oxic conditions could significantly remove investigated pharmaceuticals. Percentage of removal during riverbank filtration was determined for carbamazepine (65.4 %), trimethoprim (100 %), 4-AAA (91.2 %), and 4-FAA (70 %) for all investigated locations. Based on the available data for three specific locations (Danube River alluvion, Sava River alluvion, and Velika Morava River alluvion), results showed that besides oxic conditions, residence time of groundwater in alluvial aquifer and ratio of infiltrated water from river to the well play very important role in the quality of groundwater. These results are extremely important for better understanding of self-purification potential of alluvial aquifers and protection from potential impacts of anthropogenic pollution to the groundwater sources in the Republic of Serbia.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as trace pollutants in natural surface water bodies, ground water and drinking water has recently led to some concern. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which utilize free radical reactions to degrade chemical contaminates, are an alternative to traditional water treatment. Anti-inflammatory drug balsalazide (as model compounds) besides actual waste-water samples were UV photodegraded using suspended titanium silicon oxide (TiSiO4) or UV/H2O2/O-2 systems. The photodegradation was favourable in the pH 8-12.8 range. The effect of various parameters such as photocatalyst amount, balsalazide (BSZ) concentration, pH of aqueous solution, irradiation time, addition of H2O2 and temperature on photocatalytic oxidation was investigated. The kinetics of the photocatalytic oxidation of BSZ in aqueous TiSiO4 suspensions was investigated as a function of catalyst loading (2-12 mg/L) and the concentration of BSZ (0.01-0.05 mg/mL) at pH 11.5. The optimum conditions for the degradation of the BSZ have been found as 0.045 mg/mL drug concentration, pH 11.5 and 0.1 g/L catalyst dose. The results indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of BSZ was well described by pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The effect of temperature on the efficiency of photodegradation of BSZ was also studied in the range 278-298 K. The activation energy was calculated according to Arrhenius plot and was found equal to 24+/-1 kJ mol(-1) for TiSiO4. Decolourization and mineralization of BSZ in the absence of light and/or catalyst were performed to demonstrate that the presence of light and catalyst is essential for the decolourization of this BSZ. This work adds to the global discussion on the role of the advanced oxidation processes in water treatment.

AB Simple analytical methods were developed for the extraction and determination of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from water, sediments, and biota. PPCPs were determined using tandem LC-MS in electrospray ionization mode, and interactions with matrix co-eluents were investigated. Extractions of water samples were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE), sediments were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and biota was extracted by liquid extraction. The selected analytical methods yielded recoveries >= 61% in all matrixes. Matrix interactions were investigated throughout the linear range of quantification of each compound, revealing that dissolved salts had relatively minor effects on ionization (between 14% suppression to 12% enhancement), but that sediment and biota extracts caused significant matrix effects (ranging from 56% suppression to 25% enhancement). The direction and magnitude of matrix interactions reflected the physico-chemical properties of each analyte, particularly their pK(a). Among the compounds analyzed in electrospray positive mode, carbamazepine was insensitive to matrix interactions, because it is a strong proton acceptor (pK(a) = 14.0). In contrast, atorvastatin (pK(a) = 4.5), a weaker proton acceptor, was particularly sensitive to matrix effects. For those compounds analyzed in negative- ion mode, sample alkalinity was found to be important. With a pK(a) of 10.4, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol generally exhibited matrix enhancement with increased sample alkalinity. However, the presence of acidic co-eluents contributed to matrix suppression. Lastly, TCS was particularly sensitive to matrix suppression, as its circumneutral pK(a) (7.9) caused even slight changes in sample pH to considerably impact ionization. We conclude that while different matrixes have clear impacts on ionization of these PPCPs, matrix effects can be quantified and overcome.

AB Despite concerns about potential risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment, few toxicological data address the effects of these compounds. In aquatic systems, which often represent the final repository for PPCPs, increasing toxicological information regarding aquatic biota is improving our capacity to assess potential risks. However, responses of key biota, such as benthic invertebrates, have not been investigated as widely. In the present study, we examined the toxicity of four PPCPs-the lipid regulator atorvastatin (ATO), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ), the synthetic hormone]17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS)-to the midge Chironolnus tentans and the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca in 10-d waterborne exposures. The toxicity of the four compounds varied between 0.20 and 47.3 mg/L (median lethal concentration), with a relative toxicity ranking of TCS > EE(2) > ATO > CBZ. Hyalella azteca was more sensitive than C. tentans to these compounds. The toxicity data were used in a hazard quotient approach to evaluate the risk posed by the four PPCPs to benthic invertebrates and other aquatic organisms. For each compound, a hazard quotient was calculated by dividing the lowest toxicity value by the highest exposure value found in the literature, to which an uncertainty factor was applied. With hazard quotients of 3.55 to 11.5, we conclude that potential risks exist toward benthic invertebrates for the toxicity of TCS and CBZ and that further investigations of these compounds are required to characterize more completely the risks to benthic organisms. In contrast, our data also indicate that considering the low concentrations currently detected in the environment, ATO and EE2 pose negligible risks to benthic invertebrates.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment worldwide and considered emerging contaminants. Their effects on growth, behavior, and physiological processes of aquatic organisms have been identified even at very low concentrations. Ecotoxicological investigations have primarily focused on single compound exposure, generally at a range of concentrations. In the natural environment, pollutants seldom occur in isolation, but little is known about the effects and risks of combinations of chemicals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of concurrent exposure to six psychoactive PhACs on locomotory behavior and life history traits of clonal marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis. Crayfish were exposed to similar to 1 mu g L-1 of the antidepressants sertraline, citalopram, and venlafaxine; the anxiolytic oxazepam; the opioid tramadol; and the widely abused psychostimulant methamphetamine. In the absence of shelter, exposed crayfish moved significantly shorter distances and at lower velocity and showed significantly less activity than controls. With available shelter, exposed crayfish moved significantly more distance, showed higher activity, and spent a significantly more time outside the shelter than controls. Molting, mortality, and spawning frequency did not vary significantly between the groups. Hemolymph glucose level did not vary among groups and was not correlated with observed behaviors. Results suggest that environmental concentrations of the tested compounds in combination can alter the behavior of non-target aquatic organisms as individual exposure of these compounds, which may lead to disruption of ecosystem processes due to their reduced caution in polluted conditions. Further research is needed using varied chemical mixtures, exposure systems, and habitats, considering molecular and physiological processes connected to behavior alterations. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Estrogens originated from humans can reach ambient water and possibly cause significant ecological risks. In this study, the quantities of human-origin estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in the influent and effluent of four sewer treatment plants (STPs) in Seoul, South Korea were estimated using a demographic model. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the quantitative uncertainty of estimated E1 and E2 concentrations. Mean concentrations of E1 and E2 estimated for STP influents ranged from 29.5 to 38.4 and 7.5 to 9.7 ng/L, respectively. Meanwhile, mean concentrations of E1 and E2 estimated for STP effluents were 4.9 to 6.6 and 0.28 to 0.36 ng/L, respectively. These estimated values are similar to measured data as reported in the literatures within the range of uncertainty based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The hazard quotient (HQ) value in the main stem of the Han River was calculated to be far less than 1 because of the dilution effect of the Han River's abundant flow, indicating that most of the Han River ecosystem will not be influenced by these endogenous estrogens. With a 95% cumulative probability, HQ values in the main stem of the Han River for the Jungrang, Nanji, Tanchun, and Seonam STPs were less than 0.18, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.15, respectively. Nevertheless, HQ values >1 were observed in the vicinity of the STP outlets when using the numerical modeling. Our results show that the endocrine disruption potential of E1 and E2 around STP outlets in the main stem of the Han River must be monitored carefully. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has been of concerns for their potential threats to ecosystems and human's health for decades. PPCPs have been detected in water environments worldwide and have been identified in water sources and finished water. To elucidate the potential exposure of PPCPs in drinking water, this study assessed the occurrences and treatment efficiencies of PPCPs in the drinking water of Taiwan. Raw and finished water samples collected from five main drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in February, June, and November 2018 were analyzed. Furthermore, laboratory-scale water treatment processes were conducted to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of these chemicals. Most of the water samples from the DWTPs had a low concentration (<30 ng/L) of PPCPs. Only samples from a DWTP was observed to have higher concentration of ibuprofen (55.6 ng/L), benzophenone (92.5 ng/L), caffeine (390.5 ng/L), and diethyltoluamide (DEET) (434.9 ng/L) in raw water than others. The results of laboratory simulations indicated that the pre-chlorination process was the key step responsible for the removal of PPCPs in conventional water treatment processes, which can remove most of the hormone treatment products, parabens, oxybenzone, and acetaminophen in water sources. However, the filtration process with anthracite as a medium could remove some of the parabens (approximately 11.9%-41.2%), hormones (approximately 18.2%-44.8%), suntan lotions (37.5%-68.8%), and naproxen (30.1%) from Milli-Q water. The removal efficiencies of the aforementioned chemicals were marginally lower in raw water. However, analgesics, caffeine, and DEET cannot be removed effectively through conventional drinking water treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects on reproductive health and immune status of farm animals following exposure to a range of natural and synthetic environmental compounds that disrupt normal hormonal actions. These compounds range from natural plant oestrogens (e.g. genistein, coumesterol) and mycoestrogens (e.g. Aflatoxins, zearalenone) to growth promoting pharmaceuticals (e.g. trenbolone acetate, melengastrol acetate) to chemicals spread in water, sewage sludge or the atmosphere such as detergents and surfactants (e.g. octylphenol, nonylphenol), plastics (e.g. bisphenol-A, phthalates), pesticides (e.g. methoxychlor, dieldrin, DDT) and industrial chemicals (e.g. PCB, TCDD). These compounds are commonly termed 'endocrine disrupting compounds' (EDCs) or 'endocrine disruptors' due to their ability to act as either hormone agonists or antagonists or the ability to disrupt hormone synthesis, storage or metabolism. A similar group of compounds are called 'immunotoxicants' and are thought to affect the immune system mainly by disrupting B and T cell homeostasis. As more studies are performed it is becoming clear that many compounds can directly or indirectly affect both the endocrine and immune systems. The susceptibility of target tissues is related to the stage of development, the cumulative exposure dose and the immune status of the individual. While some of the effects of the EDCs on the endocrine and immune systems are quite distinct, many are subtle and identifying the causative agent from the vast array of environmental challenges including EDCs, nutrition, temperature, etc. can be problematic. Identifying the causative agent is confounded by the possibility that effects that are observed in the adult may be due to exposure to EDCs during fetal life. This has major implications for the determination of universal end-point measurements to assess exposure to EDCs in farm animals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of antimicrobials, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB), and the associated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment is a global health concern. In this study, the concentrations of 25 antimicrobials, the resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains in response to the selection pressure imposed by 15 antimicrobials, and enrichment of 20 ARGs in E. coli isolated from hospital wastewaters and surface waters were investigated from 2016 to 2018. In hospital wastewaters, clarithromycin was detected at the highest concentration followed by sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine. Approximately 80% of the E. coli isolates were resistant, while 14% of the isolates exhibited intermediate resistance against the tested antimicrobial agents. Approximately 61% of the examined isolates were categorized as multidrug-resistant bacteria. The overall abundance of phenotypes that were resistant toward drugs was in the following order: beta-lactams, tetracycline, quinolones, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol. The data showed that the E. coli isolates frequently harbored bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), tetA, qnrS, and sul2. These results indicated that personal care products were significantly associated with the presence of several resistant phenotypes and resistance genes, implying their role in co-association with multidrug resistance. Statistical analysis also indicated a disparity specific to the site, treatment, and year in the data describing the prevalence of ARB and ARGs and their release into downstream waters. This study provides novel insights into the abundance of antimicrobial, ARB and ARGs in Sri Lanka, and could further offer invaluable information that can be integrated into global antimicrobial resistance databases.

AB This study investigates the environmental fate of eight benzophenone derivatives (the pharmaceutical ketoprofen, its phototransformation products 3-ethylbenzophenone and 3-acetylbenzophenone, and five benzophenone-type UV filters) by evaluating their photolytic behaviour. In addition, the genotoxicity of these compounds and the produced photodegradation mixtures was studied. Laboratory-scale irradiation experiments using a medium pressure UV lamp revealed that photodegradation of benzophenones follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. Ketoprofen was the most photolabile (t(1/2) = 0.8 min), while UV filters were more resistant to UV light with t(1/2) between 17 and 99 h. The compounds were also exposed to irradiation by natural sunlight and showed similar photostability as predicted under laboratory conditions. Solar photodegradation experiments were performed in distilled water, lake and seawater, and revealed that photosensitizers present in natural waters significantly affect the photolytic behaviour of the investigated compounds. In this case, the presence of lake water resulted in accelerated photodecomposition, while seawater showed different effects on photodegradation, depending on a compound. Further, it was shown that the transformation products of ketoprofen 3-ethylbenzophenone and 3-acetylbenzophenone were formed under environmental conditions when ketoprofen was exposed to natural sunlight. Genotoxicity testing of parent benzophenone compounds using the SOS/umuC assay revealed that UV filters exhibited weak genotoxic activity in the presence of a metabolic activation system, however the concentrations tested were much higher than found in the environment (>= 125 mu g mL(-1)). After irradiation of benzophenones, the produced photodegradation mixtures showed that, with the exception of benzophenone that exhibited weak genotoxic activity, all the other compounds tested did not elicit any activity when exposed to UV light.

AB The aim of this study was to screen and quantify 23 pharmaceutical compounds (including illicit drugs), at two sampling points near the diffusers of the Guaruja submarine outfall, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Samples were collected in triplicate during the high (January 2018) and low (April 2018) seasons at two different water column depths (surface and bottom). A total of 10 compounds were detected using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Caffeine (42.3-141.0 ng/L), diclofenac (3.6-85.7 ng/L), valsartan (4.7-14.3 ng/L), benzoylecgonine (0.3-1.7 ng/L), and cocaine (0.3-0.6 ng/L) were frequently detected (75% occurrence). Orphenadrine (0.6-3.0 ng/L) and atenolol (0.1-0.3 ng/L), and acetaminophen (1.2-1.4 ng/L) and losartan (0.7-3.4 ng/L), were detected in 50% and 25% of the samples, respectively. Only one sample (12.5%) detected the presence of carbamazepine (< 0.001-0.1 ng/L). Unexpectedly a lower frequency of occurrence and concentration of these compounds occurred during the summer season, suggesting that other factors, such as the oceanographic and hydrodynamic regimes of the study area, besides the population rise, should be taken into account. Caffeine presented concentrations above the surface water safety limits (0.01 mu g/L). For almost all compounds, the observed concentrations indicate nonenvironmental risk for the aquatic biota, except for caffeine, diclofenac, and acetaminophen that showed low to moderate ecological risk for the three trophic levels tested.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds were increasingly detected in environmental matrices but little is known whether these compounds would transport to coastal zones via watersheds. Three typical tidal rivers in southeastern China were selected and 15 surface sediment samples (0-10 cm) were collected along a 50-km tidal section of each river. Surface sediment samples were frozen-drying and then extracted for pharmaceutical compounds by an accelerated solvent extraction system. The pharmaceutical compounds in extracts were scanned using a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandern mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Three hundred and thirty compounds from nine pharmaceutical groups were detected with signal-to-noise above three (detectable level) in the surface sediments, of which 186 compounds were with a signal-to-noise above ten (measurable level). Of all, 291 and 80 compounds were detectable and measurable in all the three rivers, respectively. The Jiulong River showed a high load of pharmaceutical compounds in surface sediment than other two rivers. Of the nine pharmaceutical groups, the antihistamines and detoxification group and anti-infective drug group contributed five dominant compounds in the surface sediments in all the three rivers. Natures of pharmaceutical compounds rather than the sediment properties (pH, EC, and total carbon content) might influence their residues. The incredible number and intensity of pharmaceutical residues were detected in tidal surface sediments of the three rivers indicating that the pharmaceutical contamination should be strongly considered in China. Source identification and eco-toxicity assessment should be taken into account in the future study. Therapeutic medicine managements need to be strictly improved at a watershed scale to reduce loads of pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems.

AB For a few years, the concern of water treatment companies is not only focused on the removal of target micropollutants but has been extended to the investigation of potential biologically active by-products generated during the treatment processes. Therefore, some methods dedicated to the detection and structural characterization of such by-products have emerged. However, most of these studies are usually carried out under simplified conditions (e.g. high concentration levels of micropollutants, drastic treatment conditions, use of deionized or ultrapure water) and somewhat unrealistic conditions compared to that implemented in water treatment plants. In the present study, a real field water sample was fortified at the part-per-billion level (50 mu g L-1) with estrone-3-sulfate (E1-3S) before being ozonated (at 1 mg L-1) for 10 min. In a first step, targeted measurements evidenced a degradation of the parent compound (>80%) in 10 min. Secondly, a non-targeted chemical profiling approach derived from metabolomic profiling studies allowed to reveal 11 zonation by-products, among which 4 were found predominant. The estrogenic activity of these water samples spiked with E1-3S before and after treatment was assessed by the ER-CALUX assay and was found to decrease significantly after 10 min of ozonation. Therefore, this innovative methodological strategy demonstrated its suitability and relevancy for revealing unknown compounds generated from water treatment, and permitted to generate new results regarding specifically the impact of ozonation on estrone-3-sulfate. These results confirm that ozonation is effective at removing E1-3S in drinking water and indicate that the by-products generated have significantly lower estrogenic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Atenolol (ATL) is a photostable and hydrolysis resistant beta-blocker and has been frequently detected in natural water. In this study, mechanism on aquatic photodegradation of ATL was investigated with an emphasis on the role of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) as well as other natural water compositions (nitrate, bicarbonate and ferric ions). Significant acceleration of photodegradtion of ATL was observed in the presence of each DOMs added, namely Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA), Nordic Lake Fulvic Acid (NOFA) and Nordic Lake Humic Acid (NOHA). Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) was determined as the main reactive species in this process, instead of singlet oxygen or excited triplet of DOM. Addition of these four DOMs all inhibited photodegradation of ATL in nitrate solutions through reducing nitrated-derived (OH)-O-center dot and screening photons absorbed by nitrate. No loss of ATL was detected in bicarbonate solution with or without DOMs. Bicarbonate exhibited a scavenger of (OH)-O-center dot derived from DOMs. However, in the presence of iron species, photodegradation of ATL was significantly enhanced by the addition of each DOM, due to the high yield of (OH)-O-center dot in the photoprocess of Fe(III)-DOM complex. The photoproducts distribution of ATL demonstrated that SRFA promote the hydroxylation on aromatic ring in the presence of nitrate and reduce the ketone moiety to alcohol in the system of ferric ions. Our findings indicate that DOMs should be considered in aquatic photoprocesses of organic pollutants induced by themselves as well as other coexisting photoactive water compositions.

AB This study investigates the prediction of the removal efficiency of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) (pharmaceuticals-PhCs, personal care products-PCPs, and steroidal hormones-SHs) in constructed wetlands based on their physicochemical properties (e.g., molecular weight-MW, octanol-water partition coefficient-Log Kow, soil organic carbon sorption coefficient-Log Koc, octanol-water distribution coefficient-Log Dow, and dissociation constant-pKa). The predictive models are formed based on statistical analysis underpinned by principle component, correlation, and regression analyses of a global data set compiled from peer-reviewed publications. The results show that the physicochemical properties of EOCs emerged as good predictors of their removal efficiency. Log Koc, Log Dow, and Log Kow are the most significant predictors, and combination with MW and/or pKa often improved the reliability of the predictions. The best performing model for PhCs was composed of MW, Log Dow, and Log Koc (coefficient of determination-R2: 0.601; probability value-p < 0.05; root mean square error-RMSE: training set: 11%; test set: 27%). Log Kow and Log Koc for PCPs (R2: 0.644; p < 0.1; RMSE: training set: 14%; test set: 14%), and a combination of MW, Log Kow, and pKa for SHs (R2: 0.941; p < 0.1; RMSE: training set: 3%; test set: 15%) formed the plausible models for predicting the removal efficiency. Similarly, reasonably good combined models could be formed in the case of PhCs and SHs or PCPs and SHs, although their individual models were comparatively better. A novel decision support tool, named as REOCWPCP, was developed to readily estimate the removal efficiency of EOCs, and facilitate the decision-making process.

AB The occurrence, partitioning, and spatio-temporal distribution of seven pharmaceuticals for human use, three steroid hormones and one personal care product were determined in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment of Pirai Creek and Jundiai River (Jundiai River Basin, So Paulo, Brazil). The maximum average detected concentrations of the compounds in the Pirai River samples were < 30 ng L-1, except for caffeine (222 ng L-1). In Jundiai River samples, most of the compounds were frequently detected, wherein caffeine had the highest concentration, with maximum average concentrations of 14,050 ng L-1, followed by atenolol (431 ng L-1), ibuprofen (268 ng L-1) and diclofenac (214 ng L-1). Atenolol, propranolol, estrone, and triclosan were the contaminants most frequently detected in sediment and SPM samples. Triclosan had the highest average proportion of SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase (> 75%). Contaminants with acid functional groups showed, in general, a lower tendency to bind to particulate matter and sediments. In addition, hydrophobicity had an important effect on their environmental partitioning. The spatial distribution of contaminants along the Jundiai River was mainly affected by the higher concentration of contaminants in water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results obtained here clearly showed the importance of the analysis of some contaminants in the whole water, meaning both dissolved and particulate compartments in the water, and that the partitioning is ruled by a set of parameters associated to the physicochemical characteristics of contaminants and the matrix properties of the studied, which need be considered in an integrated approach to understand the fate of emerging chemical contaminants in aquatic environments.

AB In some countries effluents from hospitals and households are directly emitted into open ditches without any further treatment and with very little dilution. Under such circumstances photo- and biodegradation in the environment can occur. However, these processes do not necessarily end up with the complete mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, the biodegradability of photoproduct(s) by environmental bacteria is of interest.
   Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally. Captopril (CP) is used in this study as it is widely used in Egypt and stated as one of the essential drugs in Egypt for hypertension. Three tests from the OECD series were used for biodegradation testing: Closed Bottle test (CBT; OECD 301 D), Manometric Respirometry test (MRT; OECD 301 F) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT; OECD 302 B). Photodegradation (150W medium-pressure Hg-lamp) of CP was studied. Also CBT was performed for captopril disulfide (CPDS) and samples received after 64 min and 512 min of photolysis.
   The primary elimination of CP and CPDS was monitored by LC-UV at 210 nm and structures of photoproducts were assessed by LC-UV-MS/MS (ion trap). Analysis of photodegradation samples by LC-MS/MS revealed CP sulfonic acid as the major photodegradation product of CP. No biodegradation was observed for CP, CPDS and of the mixture resulting from photo-treatment after 64 min in CBT. Partial biodegradation in the CBT and MRT was observed in samples taken after 512 min photolysis and for CP itself in MRT. Complete biodegradation and mineralization of CP occurred in the ZWT.

AB The effects of Clofibric acid (a persistent environmental metabolite of Clofibrate, a human pharmaceutical), on Fathead minnows were studied. Fibrates are used to prevent cardiovascular disease through their antilipidemic activity. In a series of experiments, in which fish were exposed to waterborne Clofibric acid, no convincing, reproducible antilipidemic effects were observed. In contrast, in three separate experiments, Clofibric acid affected the reproductive axis of fish. Spermatogenesis was apparently impaired, leading to a marked reduction in sperm count in two of the three experiments. Various measures of sperm motility were also reduced, although only significantly so at the highest concentration of Clofibric acid tested (1 mg/L). There were also indications that plasma androgen concentrations were reduced. These effects of Clofibric acid on the reproductive axis of fish are similar to those that occur in some mammals as a side-effect of the drug. Taken together, a weight-of-evidence argument would suggest that the main discernable effect of Clofibric acid on fish is likely to be a reproductive, not an antilipidemic, one. Although some of these reproductive effects of Clofibric acid occurred only at a high concentration (1 mg/L), others occurred at lower concentrations ( mu g/litre), near or similar to those reported in the aquatic environment (ng to low mu g/litre range). Although we recognise that this is not a definitive study of the effects of Clofibric acid on fish reproduction, the results strongly suggest that Clofibric acid could adversely affect sperm parameters and androgen concentrations in adult Fathead minnows. Further studies are warranted. This may be an example of a drug in which an accidentally discovered side-effect found in mammals turns out to be the most important effect in a different vertebrate group, namely fish.

AB The identification and quantification of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in aquatic ecosystems is critical to further studies and elucidation of their fate as well as the potential threats to aquatic ecology and human health. This study used mass balances to analyse the sources, transformation, and transport of PPCPs in rivers based on the population and consumption habits of residents, the removal level of sewage treatment, the persistence and partitioning mechanisms of PPCPs, hydrological conditions, and other natural factors. Our results suggested that in an urbanized river of Guangzhou City, China, the daily consumption of PPCPs was the main reason for the variety of species and concentrations of PPCPs. Through the determination of PPCPs in the river water samples and a central composite design (CCD) methodology, the dominant elimination mechanisms of caffeine and carbamazepine from river water were photolysis and biodegradation, but that of triclosan was sorption rather than biodegradation. The mass data of 3 PPCPs were estimated and corroborated using the measured data to evaluate the accuracy of the mass balance. Finally, caffeine, carbamazepine and triclosan discharged from the Shijing River into the Pearl River accounted for 97.81%, 99.52%, and 28.00%, respectively, of the total mass of these three compounds in the surface water of Shijing River. The results suggest that photolysis are the main process of natural attenuation for selected PPCPs in surface waters of river systems, and the transfer processes of PPCPs is mainly attributed to riverine advection. In addition, the low concentration of dissolved oxygen inhibited the degradation of PPCPs in the surface water of Shijing River. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eighteen selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), consisting of five non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (N-APs), four sulfonamides (SAs), four tetracyclines (TCs), four macrolides (MCs), and one quinolone (QN) were detected in water, pore water, and sediment samples from Baiyangdian Lake, China. A total of 31 water samples and 29 sediment samples were collected in March 2017. Caffeine was detected with 100% frequency in surface water, pore water, and sediment samples. Carbamazepine was detected with 100% frequency in surface water and sediment samples. Five N-APs were prominent, with mean concentrations of 4.90-266.24 ng/l in surface water and 5.07-14.73 mu g/kg in sediment samples. Four MCs were prominent, with mean concentrations of 0.97-29.92 ng/l in pore water samples. The total concentrations of the different classes of PPCPs followed the order: N-APs (53.26%) > MCs (25.39) > SAs (10.06%) > TCs (7.64%) > QNs (3.64%) in surface water; N-APs (42.70%) > MCs (25.43%) > TCs (14.69%) > SAs (13.90%) > QNs (3.24%) in sediment samples, and MCs (42.12%) > N-APs (34.80%) > SAs (11.71%) > TCs (7.48%) > QNs (3.88%) in pore water samples. The geographical differences of PPCP concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Baoding City and human activities around Baiyangdian Lake were the main sources of PPCPs in the lake. An environmental risk assessment for the upper quartile concentration was undertaken using calculated risk quotients and indicated a low or medium-high risk from 18 PPCPs in Baiyangdian Lake and its five upstream rivers.

AB The residue levels of selected fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides and tetracyclines in 143 animal dung samples collected in 2007 from large-scale livestock and poultry feedlots in 8 provinces were determined by using ultrasonic extraction and liquid chromatography. Recoveries from spiked pig dung samples (spike level = 1 mg/kg) ranged from 73.9 to 102.0% for fluoroquinolones, from 81.6 to 923% for sulfonamides. and from 57.2 to 72.6% for tetracyclines. Relative standard deviations of the recoveries were less than 10% within the same day. Method quantification limits were measured from 0.031 to 0.150 mg/kg for fluoroquinolones, from 0.023 to 0.082 mg/kg for sulfonamides, and 0.091 to 0.182 mg/kg for tetracyclines in spiked pig manure samples. Analysis of 61 pig, 54 chicken and 28 cow dung samples collected in China revealed that in pig and cow dung, up to 33.98 and 29.59 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, 33.26 and 46.70 mg/kg enrofloxacin, 59.06 and 59.59 mg/kg oxytetracycline, and 21.06 and 27.59 mg/kg chlortetracycline could be detected, respectively. A maximum concentration of 99.43 mg/kg fleroxacin, 225.45 mg/kg norfloxacin, 45.59 mg/kg ciprofloxacin and 1420.76 mg/kg enrofloxacin could be detected in chicken dung. No appreciable sulfonamide antibiotic concentrations (less than 10 mg/kg) were found in any animal dung, and only sulfadimidine was observed, at a maximum concentration of 6.04 mg/kg, in chicken dung. Both enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline were detected with a very high occurrence in three animal manure samples. The residue levels for most antibiotics showed significant statistical differences among the sampling districts and the animal species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work is to evaluate and compare the degradation achieved for three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by heterogeneous TiO2 photocatalytic means in aqueous solution at laboratory scale. The selected pharmaceutical compounds were diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP). These compounds were used in their sodium salt chemical form.
   Previous experiments (adsorption, photolysis and thermodegradation) were developed to evaluate non-catalytic degradation for each NSAID. Photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a Xe-lamp reactor in order to study the influences of different operational conditions (catalyst load, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration). These results showed that the optimum amount Of TiO2, to achieve maximum degradation, of IBP was 1 g/L. In contrast, the maximum degradation for DCF or NPX was observed at a TiO2 loading of 0.1 g/L. Temperature had a significant effect only for NPX degradation, achieving almost 99% phototransformation. No significant differences were observed for DCF and IBP at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen concentration was an important parameter to increase the degradation for NPX and IBP. However, it was observed that its rate of mineralization did not increase. Intermediate metabolites were detected in all cases. Hydroxyl metabolites were the most important residual compounds after the photocatalytic treatment of IBP. The inhibition percentage of bioluminescence from Vibro fischeri-as a toxicity parameter-increased during the irradiation time due to the residual concentration of the hydroxyl metabolites generated. However, after 120 min, in experiments with 40 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, a decrease of the % inhibition was observed. Only photocatalytic treatment of IBP drives to a satisfactory biodegradability index BOD5/COD (between 0.16 and 0.42) and, only in this case, a post-biological treatment could be suggested.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are widely used and can reach surface waters, where they have the potential to exert biological effects on aquatic non-target organisms. Due to the high number of pharmaceutical drugs used in human medicine throughout the world, it is necessary to select the pharmaceuticals to search for, prior to implementing any environmental measurements and any extensive environmental risk assessment (ERA). This paper describes a methodology developed in order to define this selection. The prioritization scheme consists in three tiers. First, a preliminary classification based on the assessment of exposure is implemented. This exposure assessment is determined by calculating predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for each pharmaceutical according to the European Medicine Evaluation Agency's (EMEAs) environmental risk assessment guidelines [EMEA, 2006. European Medicine Agency Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.].
   In the second step, the preliminary classification is reviewed on a case-by-case hypothesis basis using all the biological data available: ecotoxicological, pharmacological (mechanism of action (MoA), enzyme modulation, adverse effects) and physicochemical data (log K-ow).
   Finally, an additional step is used to select priority compounds among molecules showing the same chemical structure and the same mechanism of action.
   We applied this methodology to the French situation and prioritized 120 parent molecules and 30 metabolites. The final prioritization list gathers 40 parent compounds and 14 metabolites. Among the 40 parent molecules, 21 have already been found in the aquatic environment, indicating a good agreement between the theoretical approach and the environmental measurements. Parameters used to construct the effect criteria are discussed for their relevance.

AB Residues of phenazone-type pharmaceuticals originating from spills of a former pharmaceutical production plant have recently been detected in ground water in Berlin, Germany. The degradation pathways of phenazone, propyphenazone, and dimethylaminophenazone (DMAA) during water purification were enlightened in batch experiments with groundwater and filter material obtained from operating waterworks. For phenazone and propyphenazone a complete biological transformation into their respective metabolites 1,5-dimetllyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP) and 4-(2-methylethyl)-1,5-dimethyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (PDP) was observed. Generally, removal of phenazone-type pharmaceutical residues during rapid Sand filtration was almost exclusively caused by microorganisms only present in polluted raw water. DMAA applied to fresh filter materials was rapidly degraded into its metabolites 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMPH), acetoaminoantipyrine (AAA), formylaminoantipyrine (FAA), and 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyloxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH). DMAA, AAA, and FAA were, however, only detected Lit low levels in a few samples of purified water from all operating water works. Whereas, the metabolites AMDOPH and DP were detected up to 1 mu g l(-1). Propyphenazone was rapidly removed and AMPH, phenazone, and PDP were only measured with concentrations in the low ng l(-1) range. The concentrations of the metabolites DP and PDP are even higher in the purified water than in the raw water caused by their formation during degradation of phenazone and propyphenazone. Reduction of filtration velocity on an experimental filter from 5 m h(-1) down to 2 m h(-1) resulted in improved removal of phenazone, propyphenazone and their metabolites DP and PDP, respectively. AMDOPH, however, was highly persistent in all experiments independent from filtration velocities and contact times. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of pharmaceutical drugs has systematically increased, resulting in their environmental presence and exertion of effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Diclofenac (DCF) is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug, frequently found in the aquatic compartment. The present work analyzed the ecotoxicological effects of DCF in the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor and in the marine fish Solea senegalensis. In addition, the putative toxic effects of DCF along a simulated food chain were studied, by feeding individuals of S. senegalensis with H. diversicolor previously exposed to DCF. Biomarkers of anti-oxidant defense (catalase, CAT), phase II metabolism (glutathione S-transferases, GSTs) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) were quantified. The obtained results demonstrated that DCF did not affect CAT activity in organisms of both species directly exposed through the water, suggesting the absence of oxidative effects. In addition, organisms directly or indirectly exposed to DCF showed an increase of GSTs activities, suggesting an additional challenge to the metabolism of the exposed individuals. However, significant decreases in the activities of CAT and AChE were observed in fish fed with worms previously exposed to DCF. These data suggest that direct or indirect exposure to DCF may cause significant physiological modifications in aquatic organisms. In addition, exposure of wild organisms via contaminated food may lead to toxicological effects which may differ from alterations elicited by direct exposure. Such toxicological differences, between direct (waterborne) and trophic (via contaminated feed) exposures were qualitatively distinct, and need to be fully addressed when considering the consequences of environmental contamination by therapeutic drugs.

AB Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon that has severe epidemiological ramifications world-wide. It has been suggested that antibiotics that have been discharged into the natural aquatic environments after usage or manufacture can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). These environmental ARGs could serve as a reservoir and be horizontally transferred to human-associated bacteria and thus contribute to AR proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anthropogenic load of antibiotics in Northern Pakistan and study the occurrence of ARGs in selected samples from this region. 19 sampling sites were selected; including six rivers, one dam, one canal, one sewage drain and four drug formulation facilities. Our results show that five of the rivers have antibiotic levels comparable to surface water measurements in unpolluted sites in Europe and the US. However, high levels of antibiotics could be detected in the downstream river in close vicinity of the 10 million city Lahore, 1100, 1700 and 2700 ng L-1 for oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole respectively. Highest detected levels were at one of the drug formulation facilities, with the measured levels of 1100, 4100, 6200, 7300, 8000, 27000, 28000 and 49000 ng L 21 of erythromycin, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole respectively. ARGs were also detected at the sites and the highest levels of ARGs detected, sulI and dfrA1, were directly associated with the antibiotics detected at the highest concentrations, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Highest levels of both antibiotics and ARGs were seen at a drug formulation facility, within an industrial estate with a low number of local residents and no hospitals in the vicinity, which indicates that the levels of ARGs at this site were associated with the environmental levels of antibiotics.

AB The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in waters at low levels is a concern due to its ability to act as an endocrine disruptor. Ozone (O-3) is commonly used in water treatment and reacts with EE2 to form by-products having characteristics that are mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the by-products of E2 and EE2 ozonation and determine their estrogenicity and toxicity relative to the parent compound. Ozonation by-products were identified via LC-MS analysis. The estrogenicity was measured using the YES assay, and toxicity was determined by monitoring effects on histology of fetal rat testes and testosterone secretion by these tissues. Two EE2 by-products were identified with open phenolic ring structures (masses 302 and 344 u). The Yeast Estrogen Screening (YES) assay showed a decreased but incomplete removal of estrogenicity after ozonation of EE2. Histological analysis of fetal testes revealed that neither E2 nor EE2, with or without ozonation, had any effect on seminiferous cord formation; however, a remarkable negative effect on testosterone secretion was observed, with EE2 by-products after ozonation showing the most rapid and extensive inhibition. These results show that the removal of EE2 via reaction with O-3 resulted in the formation of by-products that are less estrogenic (as demonstrated by the YES assay), but have a greater negative impact on testosterone secretion. Thus, the disappearance of the parent compound is not a sufficient endpoint, as the by-products created may be more toxic. Care should be taken when implementing oxidation applications such as ozone during waste water treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal efficiency of selected emerging pollutants, total (TotCol) and faecal (FecCol) coliforms in surface (SF) and subsurface (SSF) flow constructed wetlands (CWs) was compared. The pilot plant (located in southeastern Mexico) consisted of eight CWs: four with SF and four with SSF. Two cells of each type were planted with Typha sp. and two were left without plant as controls. CWs were fed with water from Sordo river, which receives untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewaters. Water samples from river and outflow from each CW were collected in four sampling campaigns, they were filtered, extracted and analysed by GC/MS. Redox potential (Eh) was measured in all cells. The following pollutants were identified and quantified: Caffeine, CAF; Galaxolide, GAL; Methyl dihydrojasmonate, MDHJ; Linear alkylbenzenes, LAB; Butylated hydroxytoluene, BHT; Surfynol 104, SSURF; Alkylphenols, AP; 4-alkylphenol monoetoxylates, APE; Parsol, PAR. Typical removals of studied compounds were attained with slightly better results in SSFCW. A multiple linear regression analysis considering Eh, time, influent pollutant concentration (C-0) and the presence of plants and filtering media (Fmedia) as independent variables showed that Eh has a significant influence in the removal for almost all the studied compounds with the exception of BHT and AP. C-0 influences removal processes with the exception of coliforms. A significant influence of Fmedia in the BHT and PAR removal is observed, also positive for AP, APE, CAF, LAB and GAL in decreasing order. The effect of plants is positive for PAR (significant), GAL, CAF, BHT and MDHJ. SURF has a distinct behaviour with a negative coefficient for its C-0. For TotCol and FecCol the most significant effects are Eh and time. This may be related to the fact that predation by aerobic microbial communities may be the predominant factor in their removal and the development of these microbial communities with time.

TI Acute and chronic toxicity of fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake

SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

AB Fluoxetine is a biologically active pharmaceutical chemical that has been detected at parts-per-trillion levels in surface waters in North America and Europe. This has generated concern because negative effects in aquatic organisms are possible. Known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (e.g., Prozac; Elli Lilly) is neurologically active and widely prescribed for clinical depression in humans. In the present investigation, acute and chronic toxicities of fluoxetine were evaluated in an environmentally relevant species, western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis. Acute toxicity (5 to 5340 ppb fluoxetine) was assessed in neonates (age 24 to 48 hours) exposed in glass aquaria for 7 days; chronic toxicity (0.05 to 5 ppb fluoxetine) was examined in fish exposed from age neonate to age 91 days; and effects of chronic exposure (100 days) on sexual maturation was investigated in mesocosm tanks (100 L) in fish exposed (7 to 71 ppb) from age 59 to 159 days. Acute toxicity of fluoxetine in neonate western mosquitofish was observed to have a 7-day median lethal concentration of 546 ppb. Chronic exposure did not affect survival, growth, or sex ratio; however, increased lethargy in fish exposed to >= 0.5 ppb fluoxetine was observed. In fish exposed from age 59 to 159 days (juvenile to adult life stages), delayed development of external adult sexual morphology was observed at 71 ppb fluoxetine, which consisted of delayed onset of the presence of the black spot in the posterior abdomen in female fish and delayed formation of the elongated anal fin (gonopodium) in male fish. The present study demonstrated that chronic exposure of western mosquitofish to fluoxetine can affect sexual development; however, it does so only at concentrations 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those previously found in the environment.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are potential endocrine disrupting compounds that have been detected in the aquatic environment around the world in the low ng/L (nanomolar) range. GCs are used as immunosuppressants in medicine. It is of high interest whether clobetasol propionate (CP), a highly potent GC, suppresses the inflammatory response in fish after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was used to induce inflammation and thus mimic pathogen infection. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 5 <= 1000 nM CP from similar to 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf, and CP uptake, survival after LPS challenge, and expression of inflammation-related genes were examined. Our initial experiments were carried out using 0.001% DMSO as a solvent vehicle, but we observed that DMSO interfered with the LPS challenge assay, and thus masked the effects of CP. Therefore, DMSO was not used in the subsequent experiments. The internal CP concentration was quantifiable after exposure to 10 nM CP for 96 h. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of CP was determined to be between 16 and 33 in zebrafish embryos. CP-exposed embryos showed a significantly higher survival rate in the LPS challenge assay after exposure to 0.1 nM in a dose dependent manner. This effect is an indication of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the regulation pattern of several genes related to LPS challenge in mammals supported our results, providing evidence that LPSmediated inflammatory pathways are conserved from mammals to teleost fish. Anxalb, a GC-action related antiinflammatory gene, was significantly down-regulated after exposure to 0.05 nM CP. Our results show for the first time that synthetic GCs can suppress the innate immune system of fish at environmentally relevant concentrations. This may reduce the chances of fish to survive in the environment, as their defense against pathogens is weakened.

AB Removal of pharmaceuticals (PhCs) by photocatalysis is a promising avenue in water treatment. The efficiency of these treatments on PhC derivatives compared to their parent molecules remains poorly documented. The present study investigates the efficiency of photodegradation catalyzed by TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles on the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and three of its derivatives; carbamazepine epoxide (CBZ-E), acridine (Al), and acridone (AO). The effects of environmental parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and natural organic matter content on photodegradation efficiency (transformation after 6 hand kinetics) were tested. We report that the efficiency of the catalysts (TiO2 and ZnO) can be very different when comparing CBZ and its derivatives (CBZ-E, Al and AO). TiO2 was more efficient than ZnO at degrading CBZ and CBZ-E. For Al and AO, no significant differences were observed between the two catalysts. We also report that environmental parameters have contrasting effects on the efficiency of the photodegradation of CBZ compared to its derivatives. Changing pH and organic matter content had the most contrasted effects; the photodegradation of CBZ and CBZ-E was significantly affected by pH (especially in presence of TiO2 NPs) and by the presence of natural organic matter. In contrast, the photodegradation of Al and AO was not affected by pH and organic matter. Only the photodegradation of CBZ was clearly affected by IS and solely at very high IS (I M). Overall, our results highlight that TiO2 and ZnO catalysts present contrasted efficiency on the removal of CBZ when compared to its derivatives (CBZ-E, Al and AO). Our results also show that the effect of environmental parameters on the efficiency of the photodegradation of CBZ derivatives cannot be predicted based on the behavior of the parent molecule (CBZ).

AB Poor removal of many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage treatment leads to their discharge into the receiving waters, where they may cause negative effects. Their elimination from the water column depends of several processes, including photochemical and biological degradation. We have focused this research on comparing the degradation kinetics of a wide number (n = 33) of frequently detected PPCPs considering different types of water, pH and solar irradiation. For those compounds that were susceptible of photodegradation, their rates (k) varied from 0.02 to 30.48 h(-1) at pH 7, with the lowest values for antihypertensive and psychiatric drugs (t(1/2) > 1000 h). Modification of the pH turned into faster disappearance of most of the PPCPs (e.g., k = 0.072 and 0.066 h(-1) for atenolol and carbamazepine at pH 4, respectively). On the other hand, biodegradation was enhanced by marine bacteria in many cases, for example for mefenamic acid, caffeine and triclosan (k = 0.019, 0.01 and 0.04 h(-1), respectively), and was faster for anionic surfactants. Comparing photodegradation and biodegradation processes, hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac, both not biodegradable, were eliminated exclusively by irradiation (t(1/2) = 0.15-0.43 h and t(1/2) = 0.14-0.17 h, respectively). Salicylic acid and phenylbutazone were efficiently photo (t(1/2) <3 h) and biodegraded (t(1/2) = 116-158 h), whereas some compounds such as ibuprofen, carbamazepine and atenolol had low degradation rates by any of the processes tested (t(1/2) = 23-2310 h), making then susceptible to persist in the aquatic media.

AB Removal of 14 pharmaceuticals and 3 of their transformation products was studied in a full-scale source separated sanitation system with separate collection and treatment of black water and grey water. Black water is treated in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor followed by oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification-denitrification in a rotating biological contactor and struvite precipitation. Grey water is treated in an aerobic activated sludge process. Concentration of 10 pharmaceuticals and 2 transformation products in black water ranged between low mu g/l to low mg/l. Additionally, 5 pharmaceuticals were also present in grey water in low mu g/l range. Pharmaceutical influent loads were distributed over two streams, i.e. diclofenac was present for 70% in grey water, while the other compounds were predominantly associated to black water. Removal in the UASB reactor fed with black water exceeded 70% for 9 pharmaceuticals out of the 12 detected, with only two pharmaceuticals removed by sorption to sludge. Ibuprofen and the transformation product of naproxen, desmethylnaproxen, were removed in the rotating biological contactor. In contrast, only paracetamol removal exceeded 90% in the grey water treatment system while removal of other 7 pharmaceuticals was below 40% or even negative. The efficiency of pharmaceutical removal in the source separated sanitation system was compared with removal in the conventional sewage treatment plants. Furthermore, effluent concentrations of black water and grey water treatment systems were compared with predicted no-effect concentrations to assess toxicity of the effluent. Concentrations of diclofenac, ibuprofen and oxazepam in both effluents were higher than predicted no-effect concentrations, indicating the necessity of post-treatment. Ciprofloxacin, metoprolol and propranolol were found in UASB sludge in mu g/g range, while pharmaceutical concentrations in struvite did not exceed the detection limits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The treatment of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ibuprofen (IBU) in test solutions by ferrate(VI) was investigated in this study. A series of jar test was performed in bench-scale at pH 6-9 and ferrate(VI) dose of 1-5 mg L-1. Results demonstrated that ferrate(VI) removed CIP from test solutions efficiently, with above 70% of reduction under study conditions. In contrary, the removal rates of IBU were very low, less than 25% in all conditions. Raising ferrate(VI) dose improved the treatment performance, while the influence of solution pH was not significant at pH 6-9 compared with that of ferrate(VI) dose. In addition, kinetic studies of ferrate(VI) with both compounds were carried out at pH 8 and pH 9 (20 degrees C). Ferrate(VI) had a much higher reactivity with CIP than IBU at pH 8 and pH 9, with CIP's apparent second-order rate constants of 113.7 +/- 6.3 M-1 s(-1) and 64.1 +/- 1.0 M(-1)s(-1), respectively. The rate constants of ferrate(VI) with IBU were less than 0.2 M-1 s(-1) at 8 and pH 9. Furthermore, seven oxidation products (OPs) were formed during CIP degradation by ferrate(VI). The attack on the piperazinyl ring of the CIP by ferrate(VI) appeared to lead to the cleavage or hydroxylation of the rings, and the attack on the quinolone moiety by ferrate(VI) might lead to the cleavage of the double bond at the six-member heterocyclic ring. No OPs of IBU were detected during ferrate(VI) oxidation due to very small part of IBU was degraded by ferrate(VI). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and the water cycle at trace levels (in the range of nanograms to low micrograms per litre) has been widely discussed and published in literature in the past decade. The increase in detection is largely attributable to the advances in analytical techniques and instrumentation. This paper describes development, optimisation and validation of a method for the simultaneous analysis of 7 multi-class pharmaceuticals (caffeine (CAF), Prazosin (PRZ), enalapril maleate (ENL), carbamazepine (CBZ), nifedipine (NFD), levonorgestrel (LNG), simvastatin (SMV)) using solid phase extraction (SPE cartridges Oasis HLB) followed by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF/MS). Its linearity, 0.5-250 mu g L-1, provided determination coefficients (R-2) above 0.99 for all compounds. The Instrumental Quantification Limits (IQLs) for all pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.5-5 mu g L-1 in the solvent as a standard mixture (i.e., direct injection). The extraction efficiency (EE%) was more than 40% and 60% in river and deionised water for most of compounds, respectively. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for all pharmaceuticals ranged from 13-800 ng L-1 in spiked river water. The inter and intra day precision of the method, calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD%), 2.33-22.3% and 0.6-9.9%, respectively, except for caffeine, which has a RSD% of 20.1% at 50 mu g L-1. Matrix effect was investigated and ranged from 10-41%. Out of seven pharmaceuticals, six pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the river water sample.

AB This paper presents the development and application of a new multi-residue analytical method providing the first data on the environmental occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in Africa, particularly the Nairobi River basin (Kenya).
   Based on pharmaceutical consumption data available for the Nairobi region, 43 'priority' pharmaceutically active ingredients (PAIs) were selected for this study. On the basis of magnetic sector high-resolution mass spectrometry, a new methodology involving both full-scan screening and selective target analysis has been developed to investigate the presence of the defined priority PAIs. Subsequent analysis of the corresponding standard compounds provided the full confirmation and indicative concentrations (low ng/L-high mu g/L) of 10 human PAIs in the Nairobi River. The detected compounds belong to different classes, i.e. antibiotics, analgesic/anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic drugs, antimalarials and antiretrovirals. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole and zidovudine showed to be the most concentrated PAIs (about 10-30 mu g/L). The concentration of the antiretrovirals (lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine) is clearly higher than those reported in the literature, although environmental data on this class of PAIs are still very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence of detection of lamivudine in surface water. The presented unique data on the occurrence of selected PAIs in the aquatic environment of Africa clearly show that the high prevalence of specific diseases like HIV/AIDS infection in developing countries might result in a different pattern of PAIs in environmental waters compared to the more developed regions.

AB Small scale laboratory experiment series were performed to study the suitability of a cyclodextrin-based sorbent (beta-cyclodextrin bead polymer, BCDP) for modelling the removal of micropollutants from drinking water and purified waste water using simulated inflow test solutions containing target analytes (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, bisphenol-A, diclofenac, beta-estradiol, ethinylestradiol, estriol, cholesterol at 2-6 mu g/L level). This work was focused on the preliminary evaluation of BCDP as a sorbent in two different model systems (filtration and fluidization) applied for risk reduction of emerging micropollutants.
   For comparison different filter systems combined with various sorbents (commercial filter and activated carbon) were applied and evaluated in the filtration experiment series.
   The spiked test solution (inflow) and the treated outflows were characterized by an integrated methodology including chemical analytical methods gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and various environmental toxicity tests to determine the efficiency and selectivity of the applied sorbents.
   Under experimental conditions the cyclodextrin-based filters used for purification of drinking water in most cases were able to absorb more than 90% of the bisphenol-A and of the estrogenic compounds. Both the analytical. chemistry and toxicity results showed efficient elimination of these pollutants. Especially the toxicity of the filtrate decreased considerably.
   Laboratory experiment modelling post-purification of waste water was also performed applying fluidization technology by beta-cyclodextrin bead polymer. The BCDP removed efficiently from the spiked test solution most of the micropollutants, especially the bisphenol-A (94%) and the hormones (87-99%)
   The results confirmed that the BCDP-containing sorbents provide a good solution to water quality problems and they are able to decrease the load and risk posed by micropollutants to the water systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among pharmaceuticals and personal care products released into the aquatic environment, antibiotics are of particular concern, because of their ubiquity and health effects. Although scientists have recently paid more attention to the threat of antibiotics to coastal ecosystems, researchers have often focused on relatively few antibiotics, because of the absence of suitable analytical methods. We have therefore developed a method for the rapid detection of 36 antibiotic residues in coastal waters, including tetracyclines (TCs), sulfanilamides (SAs), and quinolones (QLs). The method consists of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. The SPE was performed with Oasis HLB and Oasis MCX cartridges. Chromatographic separation on a C18 column was achieved using a binary eluent containing methanol and water with 0.1% formic acid. Typical recoveries of the analytes ranged from 67.4% to 109.3% at a fortification level of 100 ng/L. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), was below 14.6% for all the compounds. The limits of detection (LODs) varied from 0.45 pg to 7.97 pg. The method was applied to determine the target analytes in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea in Liaoning, China. Among the tested antibiotics, 31 were found in coastal waters, with their concentrations between the LOD and 212.5 ng/L. These data indicate that this method is valid for analysis of antibiotics in coastal waters. The study first reports such a large number of antibiotics along the Yellow Sea coast of Liaoning, and should facilitate future comprehensive evaluation of antibiotics in coastal ecosystems.

AB Pharmaceutical androgens and estrogens discharged into the aquatic environment are now known to induce adverse effects in fish and are a health concern for wildlife. Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exposed to a pharmaceutical androgen, trenbolone, used to enhance cattle growth and found to pollute waters below feedlots in the USA, has been shown to alter the development of the anal fin of the females and disrupt gonopodium development in fry. In our work, we showed that altered gonopodimu development was associated with disruption in the normal patterns of expression of 2 cloned androgen receptors. Furthermore, exposure to trenbolone at 1 mu g/L induced spermatocytes in the ovary of sexually mature females.
   Roach (Rutilus rutilus) living in UK rivers are exposed to estrogenic chemicals in effluents derived from sewage treatment works and this causes feminizing effects, including the development of oocytes in the testis of males. The contraceptive estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) is believed to contribute to these feminized responses. Our lab-based studies showed that gonadal feminization of roach could be induced by exposure to EE2 at 4 ng/L and the phenotypic responses were associated with altered patterns of expression of 2 cloned estrogen receptors (ERs) and aromatase genes. EE2 was shown to induce similar feminized responses in the medaka (Oryzias latipes). We established a reporter gene assay system for roach and medaka ERs and showed that specific environmental estrogens differentially activated the two fish ER subtypes. We also found evidence for an enhanced sensitivity for some estrogens to activate the medaka ERs compared with the roach ERs.

AB River Yamuna is one of the major lifelines of Northern India. The study quantified 16 target compounds including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and hormones in the Yamuna river. Surface water samples were collected from 13 locations spanning 575 km along the river, and from two of its tributaries, Hindon river and Hindon canal. Spatiotemporal variations in the occurrence of the target compounds at the 13 sites during summer and post-monsoon season were investigated. Caffeine, estrone, gemfibrozil, sulfamethoxazole, testosterone and trimethoprim were found in all the samples, indicating substantial usage and/or persistence in the environment. The mean concentration of the target compounds ranged from 25.5 to 2187.5 ng/L. Higher concentrations were detected during the post monsoon, compared to the summer season. The highest concentration detected was of trimethoprim (8807.6 ng/L) during summer sampling, followed by caffeine (6489.9 ng/L) and gemfibrozil (2991 ng/L), during the post-monsoon sampling. The lowest concentration detected was of estrone (10.7 ng/L), during the summer sampling. The runoff from the catchment areas is one of the contributing factors for the increased concentration of the compounds during post monsoon. During summer, the river bed goes dry, facilitating the adsorption of the compounds onto the river bed sediments. The three sampling locations Okhla barrage (ponding of water from drains traversing Delhi), confluence of Yamuna with Shahadara drain (industrial and poultry cluster, and Ghazipur dumping yard) and Agra city (industrial clusters) were the hotspots in terms of total concentration of the target compounds. The study also reported the presence of PPCPs and hormones in the finished drinking water of two DWTPs at Mathura and Agra. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are widely used as preservatives in different commercial items including food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and their wide use has resulted in accumulation in the environment. Parabens have been shown to have negative effects on animals as well as human health. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive study to determine the adverse effects associated with propylparaben (PP) and methylparaben (MP) on early developmental stages of zebrafish. Mortality, hatching, developmental abnormalities and gene expression profiles were investigated in embryos exposed to both compounds. The semi-static exposure conditions showed that both MP (>= 100 mu M) and PP (>= 10 mu M) are toxic to the embryos in a concentration-dependent manner and lead to developmental abnormality. Malformations such as spinal defects, pericardial edema, and pigmentation defects were observed following both MP and PP treatments. Hatching delay, mortality and developmental abnormality data indicate that PP is more toxic than MP. For gene expression analysis, 1 and 10 mu M doses of MP and PP were analyzed. Genes from physiological pathways including stress response, cell cycle and DNA damage, inflammation, fatty acid metabolism and endocrine functions were affected by MP and PP. The gene expression profiles show that parabens cause toxicity by inducing oxidative stress, DNA double-strand breaks, apoptosis as well as by altering fatty acid metabolism. Altered expression of androgen receptor (ar) and estrogen receptor 2 alpha (esr2a) indicates an antiandrogenic and estrogenic activity of parabens in zebrafish. Overall, the present study provides considerable information on the negative effects of MP and PP using physiological endpoints and motivates further studies to explore the molecular mechanism of the toxicity associated with parabens.

AB Although pharmaceutical metabolites are found in the aquatic environment, their toxicity on living organisms is poorly studied in general. Endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHTam) are two metabolites of the widely used anticancer drug tamoxifen for the prevention and treatment of breast cancers. Both metabolites have a high pharmacological potency in vertebrates, attributing prodrug characteristics to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites are body-excreted by patients, and the parent compound is found in sewage treatment plan effluents and natural waters. The toxicity of these potent metabolites on non-target aquatic species is unknown, which forces environmental risk assessors to predict their toxicity on aquatic species using knowledge on the parent compounds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of two generations of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex towards 4OHTam and endoxifen. Two chronic tests of 4OHTam and endoxifen were run in parallel and several end points were assessed. The results show that the metabolites 4OHTam and endoxifen induced reproductive and survival effects. For both metabolites, the sensitivity of Daphnia pulex increased in the second generation. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) decreased with increasing 4OHTam and endoxifen concentrations. The No-Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) calculated for the reproduction of the second generation exposed to 4OHTam and endoxifen were <1.8 and 4.3 mu g/L, respectively, whereas the NOECs that were calculated for the intrinsic rate of natural increase were <1.8 and 0.4 mu g/L, respectively. Our study raises questions about prodrug and active metabolites in environmental toxicology assessments of pharmaceuticals. Our findings also emphasize the importance of performing long-term experiments and considering multi-endpoints instead of the standard reproduction outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The main aim of the current work is to test the tetracycline adsorption behavior of activated carbon (AC) dopped alginate (ALG) beads. In this way, synthesis and characterization of activated carbon dopped alginate beads using Fourier-transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, adsorption equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, adsorption mechanism, desorption, and reusability experiments were carried out. Maximum tetracycline removal percentage was achieved using 200 mg of AC-ALG beads with a ratio of 3.0% (w/v) within 6 h at pH 7.0, and tetracycline removal performance was determined to be 100.0%. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Temkin, Halsey, and Harkins-Jura isotherm models were applied to experimental data. AC-ALG-(1.0 and 2.0) beads were found to fit the Langmuir model well, while AC-ALG-3.0 beads fitted the Freundlich model. Adsorption kinetics were investigated by pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, Weber-Morris intraparticle diffusion, and Bangham models and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the adsorption data well. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated, and the enthalpy of tetracycline adsorption was endothermic for all beads. After the adsorption process, the beads can easily be regenerated by NaOH and effectively reused within five cycles. It can be concluded that activated carbon dopped alginate beads have a considerable potential on the adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater.

AB A series of activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by modifying a commercial AC by physical activation using CO2 during different activation times. The ACs were designated as F, F12, F24, and F40 corresponding to the activation times of 0, 12, 24, and 40h, respectively. The surface area, total pore volume, micropore volume, and mean micropore width were determined for all the ACs. The textural properties of the modified ACs increased substantially with the activation time, and the capacity of the ACs for adsorbing diclofenac (DCF) was almost linearly dependent upon the surface area of the ACS. The maximum adsorption capacities of F, F12, F24, and F40 carbons towards diclofenac (DCF) from aqueous solution were 271, 522, 821, and 1033mg/g, respectively. Hence, the adsorption capacities of ACs were considerably enhanced with the activation time, and F12, F24, and F40 carbons presented the highest adsorption capacities towards DCF reported in the technical literature. The F40 adsorption capacity was at least twice those of other carbon materials. The adsorption capacities decreased by raising the pH from 7 to 11 due to electrostatic repulsion between the ACs surface and anionic DCF in solution. The removal of DCF from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was effectively carried out by adsorption on F40. Hence, the capacity of ACs for adsorbing DCF can be optimized by tailoring the porous structure of ACs.

AB Human activities introduce a variety of chemicals to the Laurentian Great Lakes including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, plasticizers, and solvents (collectively referred to as contaminants of emerging concern or CECs) potentially threatening the vitality of these valuable ecosystems. We conducted a basin-wide study to identify the presence of CECs and other chemicals of interest in 12 U.S. tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes during 2013 and 2014. A total of 292 surface-water and 80 sediment samples were collected and analyzed for approximately 200 chemicals. A total of 32 and 28 chemicals were detected in at least 30% of water and sediment samples, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 0.0284 (indole) to 72.2 (cholesterol) mu g/L in water and 1.75 (diphenhydramine) to 20,800 mu g/kg (fluoranthene) in sediment. Cluster analyses revealed chemicals that frequently co-occurred such as pharmaceuticals and flame retardants at sites receiving similar inputs such as wastewater treatment plant effluent. Comparison of environmental concentrations to water and sediment-quality benchmarks revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations often exceeded benchmarks in both water and sediment. Additionally, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dichlorvos concentrations exceeded water-quality benchmarks in several rivers. Results from this study can be used to understand organism exposure, prioritize river basins for future management efforts, and guide detailed assessments of factors influencing transport and fate of CECs in the Great Lakes Basin.

AB A screening using four white-rot fungi (Trametes versicolor, Irpex lacteus, Ganoderma lucidum and Phanerochaete chrysosporium) was performed on the degradation of 10 mg L-1 of ibuprofen (IBU, anti-inflammatory), clofibric acid (CLOFI, lipid regulator) and carbamazepine (CARBA, antiepileptic/analgetic) after 7 d of incubation. Whereas IBU was extensively degraded by all the fungi tested, T. versicolor was the only strain able to degrade either CLOFI (similar to 91%) and CARBA (similar to 58%), although the latter was also degraded by G. lucidum (similar to 47%). In vitro experiments using manganese peroxidase and laccase-mediator system showed that extracellular fungal enzyme systems did not appear to play a role in the first step of degradation. However, our in vivo studies using the cytochrome P450 inhibitors I-aminobenzotriazole and piperonyl butoxide suggested that the cytochrome P450 system may be involved in the first step of CLOFI and CARBA oxidation by T. versicolor. During the very early stages of IBU degradation by T. versicolor, two hydroxylated metabolites were detected: 1-hydroxy ibuprofen and 2-hydroxy ibuprofen. These byproducts were subsequently degraded by the fungus to 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, that was not reported in biological systems to date. Furthermore, these results are of particular interest because CLOFI and CARBA are highly persistent in the aquatic environment and they pass unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Removal of pharmaceutical and personal care products from wastewater is very important in water treatment process. Combining photocatalysis with persulfate (PS) could be a good solvent for this problem. Novel perylene diimide derivative (EHPDI) was designed and synthesized. Furthermore, self-assembled EHPDI/TiO2 composite photocatalyst (EPT) was prepared and applied in activating persulfate (PS) under visible light to enhance the photodegradation of pollutants. The presence of the alkyl side chain 2-ethylhexyl optimizes the self-assembly process, enabling the composite material to achieve high performance under low EHPDI loading. Various methods were used to detect the physical and chemical characteristics of EPT. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was chosen to be the model pollutant to study the removal efficiency of EPT/PS system under visible light. Within 30 min, 5.0 mg/ CBZ could be almost completely degraded, and the removal ratio of TOC was 75.2% within 60 min. The SO4 center dot-, center dot OH, O-2 center dot(-), O-2 and h(+) were proved to be involved in the removal of CBZ by EPR and quenching experiments. Then, other typical pollutants were degraded by this EPT/PS system, demonstrating this system is suitable for degrading different pollutants. Besides, the degradation paths of CBZ were proposed by HPLC/MS. Finally, the EPT showed excellent recyclability and stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bimetallic FexMny catalysts derived from metal organic frameworks for
   efficient photocatalytic removal of quinolones without oxidant

AB Quinolones are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry; however, the high residue of these antibiotics has caused serious water quality issues, and their effective removal is still a great challenge. In this work, bimetallic magnetic FexMny catalysts are prepared by a facile impregnation method and are efficient for photocatalytic removal of five typical quinolone pollutants without oxidant under simulated light irradiation. The fabricated bimetallic magnetic FexMny catalyst with the Fe3+/Mn2+ ratio of 1 : 1 exhibits a large surface area of 122.5 m(2) g(-1), highly porous structure, rich defects and a covalent metal environment. These fabricated semiconductor catalysts can degrade 98.3% of ciprofloxacin (CIP), 96.0% of ofloxacin (OFL), 91.0% of enrofloxacin (ENR), 92.2% of levofloxacin (LEV), and 93.5% of norfloxacin (NOR) in 30 min without using any oxidant. The magnetic FexMny catalysts can be simply recycled using a magnet and maintain high stability, avoiding complex recycling procedures. Even after five cycles, the degradation rate of CIP was still over 92.0%. The degradation performance is far superior to that of most previously reported candidates. The bimetallic FexMny catalyst improves the ability to capture sunlight, increases the interface charge transfer rate, and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In addition, the mechanism and the main intermediates in the photocatalytic degradation of CIP are explored by quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. These noble-metal free magnetic FexMny catalysts provide a promising opportunity for advanced photocatalytic oxidation technology to treat wastewater.

AB Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was a kind of layer materials with multi-metal elements and good catalytic performance, but the metals can be dissolved during catalysis. Graphene oxide (GO) was a two-dimensional structure with abundant anionic groups with the potential of immobilizing metals. However, LDH combined with GO (LDH/GO) was few reported in the treatment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). In this work, CoFeNi LDH/GO composites were designed and synthesized for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Meanwhile, gatifloxacin (GAT), a typical antibiotic, was used to assess the performance of LDH/GO + PMS system. The characterization of LDH/GO using various measures showed that the adding GO was inserted the layer structure of LDH and the surface functional group of GO was immobilized in LDH well. GAT could be degraded completely after 45 min under the reaction conditions of pH 7.0, 38 mg L-1 GAT, 40 mg L-1 LDH/GO and 400 mg L-1 PMS. The removal of total organic carbon and defluorination reached 55.5% and 78.0% after 5 h reaction, respectively. Quenching tests suggested that the main radicals responsible for GAT degradation and mineralization was sulfate radical (SO4-center dot). The redox cycle made the catalysis of the LDH/GO composites work continuously. Compared with LDH + PMS system, the concentration of dissolved metals decreased 60.6%-74.3% at pH 3.0-11.0 in LDH/GO + PMS system. The reusability test indicates that LDH/GO has stable catalytic performance in removing PPCPs from wastewater.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, little is known about their ecological effect on aquatic biota and ecosystems. Drug-induced behaviour changes could have a substantial impact on consumer-resource interactions influencing stability of the community and ecosystem. We combined laboratory experiments and functional response modelling to investigate effects of real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, as well as environmentally relevant concentrations of the antidepressants citalopram and opioid pain medication tramadol, on trophic interactions. Our biological system consisted of dragonfly Aeshna cyanea larvae as predator of common carp Cyprinus carpio fry. Exposure to WWTP effluent significantly increased A. cyanea maximum feeding rate, while those parameters in tramadol and citalopram-exposed larvae were significantly lower from unexposed control group. This suggested the potential of all tested pollutants to have an effect on consumer-resource equilibrium in aquatic ecosystems. While WWTP effluent strengthened interaction strength (IS) of consumer-resource interaction dynamics making the food web more vulnerable to fluctuation and destabilization, tramadol and citalopram could inhibit the potential oscillations of the consumer-resource system by weakening the IS. Similar studies to reveal the potential of pervasive pharmaceuticals to change of consumer-resource interactions dynamics are needed, especially when real WWTP effluent consisting of mixture of various pharmaceuticals displayed very different effect from single compounds tested.

AB For sustainable production, there is an urgent need to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of swine farming, which is a major contributor of the pollutants p-cresol and tylosin. Novel reactive composite alginate beads (CAB-MOACs) were fabricated by combining alginate with activated carbon (AC) and MnO2 recovered from spent battery waste and used for efficient removal of p-cresol and tylosin from water. Batch experiments were carried out under varying pH (3-11), temperature (15-50 degrees C), and agitation speed (50-200 rpm) to understand their effects on removal efficiency. The CAB-MOACs had better removal efficiency for p-cresol and tylosin than alginate beads alone or beads containing only AC or MnO2. Adsorption to CAB-MOACs followed pseudo-second-order kinetics (R-2 >= 0.98) and Langmuir isotherm models (R-2 >= 0.95). CAB-MOACs showed higher removal efficiency (similar to 99.9% after 10 h) compared to beads containing only immobilized MnO2 (60-70%) or AC (94-96%). Regeneration and reuse performance of the CAB-MOACs was excellent through five cycles, although slightly better for p-cresol than tylosin. With low-cost manufacturing and beneficial utilization of hazardous waste such as spent batteries, the newly developed composite beads show potential as an effective adsorbent for treating wastewater effluent containing emerging contaminants like p-cresol and tylosin. Future studies may focus on product refinement and large-scale testing on actual wastewaters.

AB Aerobic granular sludge is considered a promising technology for biological wastewater treatment, since it is more compact and resistant to shock and toxic loads than activated sludge systems. Furthermore, the monitoring of the aerobic granules structure, size and morphology has been growing in importance, proving to be suitable for operational and process control purposes. In this work, a sampling methodology is validated for the assessment of the ensemble granular and floccular biomass, by quantitative image analysis, in the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds, including 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and the sulfamethoxazole. The employed sampling volumes were found to be adequate in obtaining a representative number of granules for all samples. Indeed, it was always obtained a variation lower than 5% in the average and standard deviation criterion of the main size, morphological and structural parameters. Moreover, it was also assessed the performance of the sieving process in successfully separating the granular and floccular biomass fractions and established a lower bound fraction size cut-off for the employed sieve. In addition, the continuity of the performed methodology and the image acquisition triplicates approach could also be validated. The ability of the proposed QIA procedure to monitor the studied AGS system was corroborated by the fact that 95% of the samples were able to be classified in the correct group (proof of concept).

AB The study is aimed to assess the effectiveness of electron beam (EB) technology to degrade the antibiotic ornidazole (ORN) in aqueous solution. The influence of several factors viz. initial ORN concentrations, dose, pH of solution, and addition of NO2-, NO3- isopropanol, H2O2, thiourea, and different water mediums were evaluated on the ORN degradation. The degradation of ORN was followed by pseudo first-order reaction kinetics with rate constant value of 2.01, 1.17, 0.87 and 0.70 kGy(-1) for the initial concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg L-1 with their corresponding (G-((ORN))) values of 0.93, 1.60, 1.97, and 2.12 mu mol J(-1), respectively. The presence of NO2-, thiourea and isopropanol revealed reduction in the k-value, whereas, addition of NO3- anion had not substantially effected the degradation of ORN. Presence of H2O2 exhibits significant effect on the mineralization efficiency of ORN rather than degradation extent. The efficacy of EB irradiation to degrade ORN decreased in wastewater in comparison to surface, ground and ultrapure water. Based on the LC-QTOF-MS study, it could be ascribed that degradation of ORN was primarily due to the oxidative species HO center dot radical and direct cleavage of ORN compound. Tentative pathways for EB-induced radiolytic degradation of ORN were proposed. Cytotoxicity assessment and overall cost of electrical energy consumed for the degradation of ORN was also evaluated.

AB In this research, degradation of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was studied using electrochemical reduction and oxidation in single pass, flow-through mode using porous titanium suboxide (Ti4O7) reactive electrochemical membranes (REMs) and Pd-Cu doped Ti4O7 REMs (Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REMs). Electrochemical reduction of SMX increased from 3.8 +/- 0.3% for the Ti4O7 REM to 96.1 +/- 3.9% for the Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REM at -1.14 V/SHE and at a permeate flux of 300 L m(-2) h(-1) (LMH) (liquid residence time:similar to 1.8 s). By contrast, electrochemical oxidation using Ti4O7 REMs achieved 95.7 +/- 1.0% removal of SMX at 2.03 V/SHE and a permeate flux of 300 LMH (liquid residence time:similar to 9.0 s) without the catalyst addition. We developed a reactive transport mathematical model and calibrated it to the SMX experimental data. The calibrated model predicted SMX permeate concentrations at fixed potentials and as a function of permeate flux. Based on products from SMX reduction, we proposed that SMX was reduced by a hydrogen atom transfer reaction that was mediated by the Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REM. Toxicity tests indicated that electrochemical oxidation/reduction lowered solution toxicity. The results of this work indicate that a tandem electrochemical reduction/oxidation approach using the REM based technology is a potential treatment strategy for sulfonamide-contaminated pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The widely used anticonvulsant pharmaceutical carbamazepine is recalcitrant in many environmental niches and thus poses a challenge in wastewater treatment. We followed the decomposition of carbamazepine by the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus in liquid culture compared to solid-state fermentation on lignocellulosic substrate where different enzymatic systems are active. Carbamazepine metabolites were identified using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). In liquid culture, carbamazepine was only transformed to 10,11-epoxy carbamazepine and 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine as a dead-end product. During solid-state fermentation, carbamazepine metabolism resulted in the generation of an additional 22 transformation products, some of which are toxic. Under solid-state-fermentation conditions, 10,11-epoxy carbamazepine was further metabolized via acridine and 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine pathways. The latter was further metabolized via five subpathways. When C-14-carbonyl-labeled carbamazepine was used as the substrate, C-14-CO2 release amounted to 17.4% of the initial radioactivity after 63 days of incubation. The proposed pathways were validated using metabolites (10,11-epoxy carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine, and acridine) as primary substrates and following their fate at different time points. This work highlights the effect of growth conditions on the transformation pathways of xenobiotics. A better understanding of the fate of pollutants during bioremediation treatments is important for establishment of such technologies.

AB In the environment, chemical substances appear as complex mixtures and consequently organisms are exposed to a variety of chemicals from different sources (e.g. wastewater treatment plants, agriculture runoffs). When studying chemical mixtures, there are two conceptual models usually used to predict toxicity: the Independent Action (IA) and Concentration Addition (CA) models. However, deviations from these reference models can occur as synergism or antagonism, dose ratio or dose level dependency. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of triclosan and carbendazim, and their binary mixture to Daphnia magna. With this purpose, immobilisation, feeding inhibition, and reproduction were assessed as main ecotoxicity endpoints. In addition, in vivo genotoxicity of both chemicals was investigated using the comet assay. In the single exposure, carbendazim was more toxic to Daphnia magna than triclosan. When daphnids were exposed to both single compounds, DNA damage was observed. Concerning mixture exposures, different endpoints followed different patterns of response, from additivity: IA model (feeding inhibition and reproduction data), to deviations that indicate interaction between chemicals inside the organism: dose level dependency (immobilisation data) and dose ratio dependency (DNA damage). This study showed that additivity does not rule the dose-effect relation in chemical mixtures of carbendazim and triclosan and interactions between both chemicals might induce generally higher toxicity than predicted based on single chemical exposures.

AB The residual effluent from the corn tortilla industry, referred to as Nejayote in Mexico, causes serious pollution problems because of its high chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, as this effluent contains valuable corn phytochemicals, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives, it also represents an opportunity to produce high-added-value biocompounds. In this work, we addressed environmental and biosynthetic approaches by applying laccase oxidative treatment in the presence of chitosan to reduce the environmental impact of the effluents from the tortilla industry. A central composite design pattern was used to understand the relationship between several variables (pH, temperature, reaction time, and enzyme quantity) and two responses (removal of ferulic acid derivatives and COD decrease). The optimum conditions for maximizing both responses were pH 6, 35 degrees C, 24 h, and 0.3025 nmoles laccase, which resulted in 70 and 78% decreases in phenolics and COD, respectively. UV-vis, fluorescence and FTIR analyses revealed enzymatic grafting of chitosan with phenolics from the effluent. Grafted chitosan presented a higher capacity to scavenge DPPH radicals (EC50 1.9 mg/mL) than neat chitosan (EC50 2.5 mg/mL) and higher viscosity values. The obtained results indicate that a process involving a single enzymatic step could be adequate to decrease the effluent COD and to generate polymers with potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

AB Concentrations of 119 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 13 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in marine sediments measured throughout Puget Sound (n=10) and Bellingham Bay (n=30), Washington, USA, are reported. These data are among the first measurements of PPCPs and PFASs in marine sediments from the Pacific Northwest and provide a comparison to previous measurements of these chemicals in influent, effluent, and biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants throughout the region. The concentrations of both PPCPs and PFASs in sediments from Puget Sound and Bellingham Bay ranged from very low to non-detectable for most compounds. Only 14 of the 119 PPCPs and 3 of 13 PFASs were quantifiable in sediments. Diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) was most frequently detected (87.5% of samples), with a maximum concentration of 4.81ng/g dry weight and an estimated mean detected concentration of 1.68ng/g. Triclocarban (an antibacterial) was detected in 35.0% of the samples, with a maximum concentration of 16.6ng/g dry weight. Perfluoroalkyl substances were detected in 2.5% of analyses. Perfluorobutanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorooctane sulfonamide were detected in 7, 5, and 1 sample(s) each, respectively, with the highest concentrations observed for perfluorooctane sulfonate (1.5ng/g).

AB A novel granular carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/alumina (Al2O3) hybrid adsorbent with good sorption and regeneration properties was successfully prepared by mixing CNTs with surfactant Brij 35 and pseudo boehmite, followed by calcining to remove surfactant and form porous granules. Alumina binder increased the mechanical strength, hydrophilicity and porosity of the granular adsorbent, while the dispersed CNTs in the granular adsorbent were responsible for the sorption of diclofenac sodium (DS) and carbamazepine (CBZ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the CNTs and Al2O3 were mixed well and the porous structure was formed in the granular adsorbent. The high surface area and appropriate pore size of granular CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent were favorable for sorption. The sorption of DS decreased with increasing solution pH, while pH had little effect on CBZ sorption. The maximum sorption capacities of CBZ and DS on the CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent were 157.4 and 106.5 mu mol/g according to the Langmuir fitting. Moreover, the spent CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent can be thermally regenerated at 400 degrees C in air due to the thermal stability of CNTs. The removal of CBZ and DS changed a little in the initial reuse cycles and then kept relatively constant until tenth cycles. The adsorbed CBZ and DS were decomposed in the regeneration process. This regenerable adsorbent may find potential application in water or wastewater treatment for the removal of some micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and biomass concentration (C-TSS) in activated sludge systems on removal of various micropollutants (MPs), covering a wide spectrum of biodegradability. The influence of biomass concentration on the classical pseudo-first-order rate constant was verified. Results showed that the removal rate constants were affected by both the HRT and SRT. The enhancement of the SRT increased the removal of all the MPs except for two macrolide antibiotics. Application of a higher HRT also improved MP removal, as was expected from the measured removal rate constants. More interesting, our results indicated that, logically, the increase of biomass concentration (expressed as total suspended solids C-TSS) from 3 to 5 g(TSS) L-1 significantly enhanced the removal rate of the highly and moderately degradable compounds. Conversely, a further increase to 8 g(TSS) L-1 produced only an unexpected moderate effect, showing that the rate was not proportional to biomass concentration, contrary to what is generally postulated. Therefore, the use of classical kinetic models is questionable, since they do not cover the entire range of boundary conditions in activated sludge systems. This work opens new research paths and suggests potential improvements to processes.

AB The use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of infections in humans and animals has increased in Argentina, and they can be found in large amounts in water bodies. The present study investigated the occurrence and associated ecological risk of 5 fluoroquinolones in rivers and farm wastewaters of San Luis, Santa Fe, Cordoba, Entre Rios, and Buenos Aires provinces of Argentina by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fast-scanning fluorescence detection and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry detection. The maximum concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and difloxacin found in wastewater were 1.14, 11.9, 1.78, 22.1, and 14.2 mu g L-1, respectively. In the case of river samples, only enrofloxacin was found, at a concentration of 0.97 mu g L-1. The individual risk of aquatic organisms associated with water pollution due to fluoroquinolones was higher in bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, plants, and anurans than in crustaceae and fish, with, in some cases, risk quotients >1. The proportion of samples classified as high risk was 87.5% for ofloxacin, 63.5% for enrofloxacin, 57.1% for ciprofloxacin, and 25% for enoxacin. Our results suggest that the prevalence of fluoroquinolones in water could be potentially risky for the aquatic ecosystem, and harmful to biodiversity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2305-2313.

AB A bench-scale column experiment was performed to study the removal of 31 selected organic micropollutants (MPs) and phosphorus by lignite, xyloid lignite (Xylit), granular activated carbon (GAC), Polonite (R) and sand over a period of 12 weeks. In total 29 out of the 31 MPs showed removal efficiency > 90% by GAC with an average removal of 97 +/- 6%. Xylit and lignite were less efficient with an average removal of 80 +/- 28% and 68 +/- 29%, respectively. The removal efficiency was found to be impacted by the characterization of the sorbents and physicochemical properties of the compounds, as well as the interaction between the sorbents and compounds. For instance, Xylit and lignite performed well for relatively hydrophobic (log octanol/water partition coefficient (K-ow) >= 3) MPs, while the removal efficiency of moderately hydrophilic, highly hydrophilic and negatively charged MPs were lower. The organic sorbents were found to have more functional groups at their surfaces, which might explain the higher adsorption of MPs to these sorbents. The removal of several MPs improved after four weeks in sand, Xylit, GAC and lignite which may be related to increased biological activity and biofilm development. GAC and sand had limited ability to remove phosphorus (12 +/- 27% and 14 +/- 2%, respectively), while the calcium-silicate material Polonite (R) precipitated phosphorus efficiently and increased the total phosphorus removal from 12% to 96% after the GAC filter.

AB Biosolids from wastewater treatment are primarily disposed of via land applications, where numerous pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) may contaminate food crops and pose a human exposure risk. Biosolids are rich in organic carbon and addition of biosolids can increase the sorption of certain PPCPs in soil, decreasing their bioavailability. This study tested the hypothesis that the relative plant uptake of PPCPs decreases with increasing biosolids amendment. Accumulation of triclosan and triclocarban was measured in roots of radish and carrot grown in soils with or without biosolids. Addition of biosolids significantly-prolonged the persistence of triclosan in soil. When expressed in bioaccumulation factor (BCF), accumulation of triclosan drastically decreased in biosolids-amended soils, while the effect was limited for triclocarban. Compared to the unamended soil, amending biosolids at 2% (w/w) decreased BCF of triclosan in the edible tissues of radish and carrot by 85.4 and 89.3%, respectively. Measurement using a thin-film passive sampler provided direct evidence showing that the availability of triclosan greatly decreased in biosolids-amended soils. Partial correlation analysis using data from this and published studies validated that biosolids decreased plant uptake primarily by increasing soil organic carbon content and subsequently sorption. Therefore, contamination of food crops by biosolids-borne contaminants does not linearly depend on biosolids use rates. This finding bears significant implications in the overall risk evaluation of biosolids-borne contaminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the degradation of high concentration pollutant by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature, 10,000mg/L acid orange 7 (AO7) aqueous solution was treated by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at 80 degrees C. First, the effect of the operating temperature (30-80 degrees C) on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles was investigated thoroughly. Then, the studies on the effect of theoretical Cu mass loading, Fe/Cu dosage, stirring speed and initial pH on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles at a high temperature (i.e., 80 degrees C) were carried out, respectively. The degradation and transformation process of AO7 was studied by using COD, TOC and UV-Vis spectra. The results indicate that high concentration pollutant could be removed effectively by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature. And the removal efficiencies of AO7 by Fe/Cu bimetallic system were in accordance with the pseudo-first-order model. Finally, it was observed that the high temperature could accelerate mass transport rate and overcome the high activation energy barrier to significantly improve the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles. Therefore, the higher removal efficiency could be obtained by Fe/Cu system at a high operating temperature. Thus, the high operating temperature played a leading role in the degradation of high concentration pollutant.

AB Occurrence and methods for the removal of nonylphenolic compounds in drinking water have been gaining increased attention due to their widespread presence in natural water and the potential health risks from the consumptions of drinking water. The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and bisphenol-A (BPA) in water sources and treated water in Taiwan, to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of these compounds in both the conventional (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination) and advanced treatment processes. The treatment efficiencies of these chemicals were assessed based on their concentrations in water sources, and the results were verified with laboratory simulated treatment processes. A survey of NP, OP, and BPA in 11 Taiwanese water sources showed that all of them could be identified in most of the sampled sources, and that higher concentrations of NP were found when the raw water was contaminated by domestic wastewater. However, higher treatment efficiency could be observed when the NP concentration in water source is high. Laboratory simulation studies of conventional treatment processes showed that chlorination played an important role in the degradation of NP in raw water. Treatment efficiencies of 60%-90% were achieved for NP removal when sufficient chlorine dosages were applied to satisfy chlorine demands. However, results also showed that conventional coagulation and rapid filtration processes were less effective in the reduction of phenolic compounds in water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the potential for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals to accumulate in the tissues of biota is a topic of increasing importance in the pharmaceutical risk assessment process. However, few data are available in the literature that compare the ability of laboratory bioconcentration studies to predict field tissue concentrations. To begin to address this data gap, bioconcentration factors (BCF) for carbamazepine (CBZ), a human anticonvulsant that modulates Na+ channels, were determined using laboratory experiments with Pimephales notatus and Ictalurus punctatus. These data were compared to field derived bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for Oreochromis niloticus from the Denton, Texas Wastewater Treatment Plant. The 42 d kinetic BCFs (BCFk) for white muscle and liver of P. notatus were 1.9 and 4.6, respectively, while the white muscle, liver, brain, and plasma BCFk's of I. punctatus were 1.8, 1.5, 1.6, and 7.1, respectively. Field derived BAF values (2.5-3.8) for O. niloticus were similar to those derived in laboratory studies. Partitioning values between blood plasma and individual tissues were calculated for I. punctatus and O. niloticus, with the values indicating that tissue levels of carbamazepine are similar or slightly higher than plasma concentrations. Collectively these data suggest that the fish laboratory BCF and field derived BCF/BAF values for carbamazepine are similar and much lower than the European Union regulatory threshold of 2000 for designation of a "B" substance.

AB Penicillin-G is the drug of choice for infection caused by organisms suspectible to it. In case of streptococcal infection (like pharyngitis, scarlet fever), staphylococcus infection, pneumococcus infection, diphtheria, tetanus and gas gangrene, anthrax, actinomycosis and rat bite fever penicillin-G is widely used. Separation and purification of penicillin-G from a mixture of other components is common and essential step in pharmaceutical industry. Separation and purification of drug component from a mixture of components, separation of enantiomeric drugs mixture, separation of chemical constituents from plant source and removal of drug components from wastewater can be carried out through foam separation method. The aim of this work is to study performance criteria of separation of penicillin-G from an aqueous solution by controlling of different variables and using two type of surfactants in foam separation method. The result showed that penicillin-G can be easily separated from dilute solution of drug mixture in a short time. The influence of operatives variables including concentration of surface active agent, pH, superficial gas velocity (SGV) and recovery of drug were investigated. The optimum separation has been set as follows: concentration of surface active agent tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (2.25 mM) and dodecylamine (2.25 mM), pH 7, superficial gas velocity 0.03 cm/s, % of drug recovery was found as 84.20 and 86.78, respectively. The unique advantage of the present work relative to other reported method is the higher separation efficiency at lowest cost.

AB The focus of this study was to investigate the efficacy of applying boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes in an electrochemical advanced oxidation process, for the removal of the target compound diclofenac (DCF) in different water matrices. The reduction of DCF, and at the same time the formation of transformation products (TPs) and inorganic by-products, was investigated as a function of electrode settings and the duration of treatment. Kinetic assessments of DCF and possible TPs derived from data from the literature were performed, based on a serial chromatographic separation with reversed-phase liquid chromatographyfollowed by hydophilic interaction liquid chromatography (RPLC-HILIC system) coupled to ESI-TOF mass spectrometry. The application of the BDD electrode resulted in the complete removal of DCF in deionized water, drinking water and wastewater effluents spiked with DCF. As a function of the applied current density, a variety of TPs appeared, including early stage products, structures after ring opening and highly oxidized small molecules. Both the complexity of the water matrix and the electrode settings had a noticeable influence on the treatment process's efficacy. In order to achieve effective removal of the target compound under economic conditions, and at the same time minimize by-product formation, it is recommended to operate the electrode at a moderate current density and reduce the extent of the treatment.

AB Sulfadiazine (SDZ) is a prominent antibiotic pollutant that appears in wastewater discharges from domestic, agricultural and pharmaceutical sectors. In this paper, we have reported studies in SDZ degradation using a novel hybrid AOP that coupled hydrodynamic cavitation with heterogeneous Fenton and persulfate. Two solid Fenton catalysts (alpha-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) in the form of nanoparticles were synthesized. The composition of reaction mixture was optimized using statistical techniques. Effect of four operating parameters, viz. (1) SDZ initial concentration, (2) inlet pressure of cavitating flow, (3) pH and (4) type of heterogeneous Fenton catalyst (at optimum loading), on SDZ degradation was studied. A kinetic model for SDZ degradation was proposed based on homogeneous Fenton/persulfate system, and experimental degradation profiles were analyzed vis-a-vis simulated profiles. The highest degradation of SDZ (81%) was obtained for SDZ initial concn.= 20 ppm, pH = 4, inlet pressure = 10 atm, Na2S2O8 = 348.5 mg/L, H2O2= 0.95 mL/L and alpha-Fe2O3 catalyst (181.8 mg/L). Kinetic model analysis showed best match between experimental and simulated profiles for [Fe2+]/[H2O2] initial ratio = 4. This indicated efficient catalytic activity of alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles - close to that of homogeneous catalyst. This is a consequence of high rate of mass transfer at surface of alpha-Fe2O3 particles due to intense turbulence and shear generated in cavitating flow in hydrodynamic cavitation reactor.

AB High surface area (2022 m(2).g(-1)) activated carbon (CSZ-C) is prepared by single step thermochemical activation of agro-waste lignocellulosic biomass. The turbostratic structure of CSZ-C enriched with microporosity promises the potential for adsorptive removal of organic dyes and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The pi-pi interaction between aromatic rings of organic pollutants and discrete graphitic clusters/units of CSZ-C facilitates the adsorption. The electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, trapping of organic pollutants by structural defects, etc. also play the roles and their contributions are governed by charge, chemical structure and molecular size of organic pollutants. The CSZ-C exhibited faster and higher adsorption of cationic dyes (523-537 mg.g(-1)) than the anionic dye (434.8 mg.g(-1)), whereas neutral organic pollutant tetracycline showed comparatively slower adsorption. Nevertheless, CSZ-C revealed significantly higher adsorption (595.2 mg.g(-1)) of tetracycline, which is governed by hydrogen bonding besides the p-p interaction between the oxygen functionalities-enriched tetracycline and the CSZ-C. The continuous flow separative unit having a fixed bed of CSZ-C efficiently removed the organic dyes from the industrial wastewater. Furthermore, the partition coefficients and breakthrough curves suggest the fast and high adsorptive removal efficiency of CSZ-C activated carbon for organic dyes.

AB The degradation of roxithromycin (ROX) by hydroxyl radical ( OH ) generated by UV/H2O2 was systematically investigated in terms of degradation kinetics, effects of water chemistry parameters, oxidation products, as well as toxicity evaluation. The degradation of ROX by UV/H2O2 with varying light irradiation intensity, initial ROX concentration, and H2O2 concentration in pure water and wastewater all followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The second-order rate constant for reaction between ROX and OH is 5.68 +/- 0.34x10(9)/M/s. The degradation rate of ROX increased with the pH; for instance, the apparent degradation rates were 0.0162 and 0.0309/min for pH4 and pH9, respectively. The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) at its concentrations up to 10mg C/L did not significantly affect the removal of ROX. NO3- and NO2- anions inhibited the degradation of ROX due to the consumption of OH in reactions with these ions . Fe3+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ cations inhibited the degradation of ROX, probably because of the formation of ROX-metal chelates. A total of ten degradation products were tentatively identified by HPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS, which mainly derived from the attack on the oxygen linking the lactone ring and the cladinose moiety, tertiary amine and oxime side chain moiety by OH . The toxicity evaluation revealed that UV/H2O2 treatment of ROX induced the toxicity to bioluminescent bacteria increased.

AB Having in mind that there is a general lack of monitoring plans and precaution measures in the developing countries and that the Danube is the second longest river in Europe, the estimation of the relevant concentration levels of unregulated xenobiotics is a topic of interest both on local and international level. The selected pharmaceuticals, caffeine, and benzotriazole presented in the collected water samples from seven representative locations around the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, during 1-year period, were analyzed with the use of solid-phase extraction followed by the liquid chromatography coupled with triple quad tandem mass spectrometry. The most frequently detected compounds were caffeine and carbamazepine in the concentrations up to 621 and 22.2 ng/L, respectively, while the maximum concentration of the analyzed pharmaceuticals was obtained for ibuprofen (60.1 ng/L). The presence of benzotriazole along the analyzed section of the river was confirmed in the concentration levels up to 26.7 ng/L. Although sulfamethoxazole and desmethyldiazepam were detected at trace levels (0.22 and 3.41 ng/L, respectively); the presence of these pharmaceuticals in complex mixtures should not be neglected. Due to the frequent detection caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and benzotriazole could be proper candidate for hydrophilic anthropogenic markers for quantification of wastewater contamination in surface water in the analyzed Danube section.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in the environment. Its chemical fate is influenced by the type of wastewater treatment. This study sets out to determine the degradation mechanism and products in the reaction between CBZ and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is the main chlorinating species in water. In the search for the most feasible pathways of HOCl-induced transformations of CBZ, a quantum chemical approach was employed. Chlorination and epoxidation of CBZ are two initial, competitive processes that result in two key intermediates: N-chloramide and 10,11-epoxide. The calculated free energy barriers (Delta G(293)) for these reactions are 105.7 and 95.7 kJ mol(-1) resp., which is in agreement with the experimental energy barrier of 98.2 kJ mol(-1). All transformation products detected in chlorination experiments were located by computational models, and the reaction mechanism underlying their formation was described in detail. Different computational methods (density functional and ab initio theory) were applied, and the double hybrid B2-PLYPD functional was found to be superior in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Of special interest are oxoiminostilbene and formylacridine, which are the final products in the degradation cascade. Their exceptional thermodynamic stability, as predicted by quantum chemical methods, suggests that these structures should be considered as recalcitrants in chlorinated waters. Fruitful interplay between computational models and experimental data proves that the quantum chemical approach can be used as a predictive tool in environmental degradation studies.

TI Risk-based screening of selected contaminants in the Great Lakes Basin

ID PHARMACEUTICALS
AB A risk-based screening exercise was carried out to evaluate the significance of chemicals of emerging concern measured in water and sediment of the Great Lakes Basin. Chemical classes included pesticides, pharmaceuticals, organic wastewater constituents, nonylphenol ethoxylates, perfluorinated surfactants, chlorinated paraffins, synthetic musks and flame retardants. Maximum measured concentrations were compared to benchmarks selected or developed to reflect a conservative no-effect level and/or the lowest-effect level. These benchmarks reflected traditional effect information such as survival, growth and reproduction. From this analysis, several pesticides, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nonylphenol ethoxylates were identified as potential concerns and needs for further work were identified. Five of these chemicals (all pesticides) were identified in waters of both the US and Canada (azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and metolachlor). Chlopyrifos, malathion and metolachlor are still registered for use in both jurisdictions; diazinon is registered for use only in the US and azinphos-methyl is not registered for use in either jurisdiction, reflecting the persistence of these chemicals. The results of this screening exercise also were compared to those of several other studies, revealing some common chemicals. Although there are several uncertainties and data gaps in the benchmarks and monitoring data used in the current screening exercise, the results of this risk-based screening can be used by agencies for priority setting, program development, and to support ongoing collaborative research and monitoring programs.

TI Several Synthetic Progestins with Different Potencies Adversely Affect
   Reproduction of Fish
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; WATER; MICROCONTAMINANTS; PHARMACEUTICALS;
   HORMONES; SURFACE
AB Synthetic progestins are widely used as a component in both contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), both on their own and in combination with EE2. Their presence in the environment is now established in wastewater effluent and river water and this has led to concerns regarding their potential effects on aquatic organisms living in these waters. We carried out in vivo experiments to determine the potencies of four different synthetic progestins on the reproductive capabilities of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). We then performed a series of in vitro assays to try and determine the reason for the effects seen in the in vivo experiments. In the first experiment, fathead minnow exposed to a single concentration of 100 ng/L of either Levonorgestrel or Gestodene stopped spawning almost completely. The same nominal concentration of Desogestrel and Drospirenone did not affect reproduction (21 d NOECs of 100 ng/L). The second experiment investigated two progestins of different potency: Gestodene at 1, 10, and 100 ng/L and Desogestrel at 100 ng/L, 1 mu g/L, and 10 mu g/L. Gestodene concentrations as low as 1 ng/L had significant effects on reproduction over 21 d, whereas concentrations of Desogestrel at or above 1 mu g/L were required to significantly reduce egg production. The synthetic progestins also masculinized the female fish in a concentration-dependent manner. Results from yeast-based in vitro assays demonstrated that the progestins are all strongly androgenic, thereby explaining the masculinization effects. The results strongly suggest that synthetic progestins merit serious consideration as environmental pollutants.

AB A biomarker approach was undertaken using the mussel Elliptio complanata to assess the ecotoxicological effects after injection of a range concentration (0-10 mM) of three different PPCPs: carbamazepine, caffeine, methotrexate; and an effluent extract (C8) from St. Lawrence wastewaters treatment plant (Montreal, Canada). A battery of biomarkers, involving oxidative stress and genotoxicity responses: glutation-S-transferase (GST), ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), dibenzylflourescein dealkylase (DBF), xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activities, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were determined in gonad and digestive gland tissues after 48 h of injection. Results showed an induction of the oxidative metabolism with increasing pharmaceutical concentration in those mussels injected with the PPCPs and the effluent extract. Phase I detoxification enzymes were significantly induced (p<0.05), concretely DBF activity was significantly induced after caffeine. carbamazipine and C8 injection; and EROD activity after C8 and methotrexate injection. Oxidative stress induction only lead to lipid peroxidation (p<0.05) in organisms injected with carbamazepine and caffeine and DNA damage in organisms injected with methotrexate (p<0.05). EROD and DBF enzymatic activities have been found to be suitable biomarkers to determine bioavailability of pharmaceuticals. LPO and DNA damage to determine possible associated adverse effects. Nevertheless, their validation in realistic exposure scenarios and under exposure conditions should be performed in future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, there is still a demand concerning processes for appropriate treatment of wastewater containing toxic heavy metals and emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and pesticides). Regarding that, water remediation can be enhanced by the development of next-generation flocculants that may tackle the current need. Therefore, this study addressed the preparation of environmental friendly flocculants derived from biobased chitosan grafted with biocompatible poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc), as well as their evaluation in the removal of turbidity, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and cadmium (Cd(II)) from contaminated water. After flocculation trials, it was found that unmodified chitosan worked well at a specific dosage as flocculant (5 mu g mL(-1)), whilst its graft copolymers having tuned properties showed a wide range of concentrations (from 1 to 10 mu g mL(-1)) reducing contaminants levels. Besides, graft copolymers led to better results (residual turbidity 30 NTU) than using PNVCL homopolymer alone (residual turbidity 200 NTU). Increased temperature yielded higher pollutant removal due to the thermoresponsivity of the PNVCL grafted to the chitosan backbone (turbidity removal using CS-g-PNVCL at pH 7: < 60% at 25 degrees C, but around 90% at 50 degrees C); while the pH of the medium influenced greatly the pollutants removal in general. Flocculants containing both PNVCL and PAAc grafts allowed CIP and Cd(II) removal close to 95% in single contaminant flocculation experiments.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent that is ubiquitously present in water, biosolids and soil. Current agricultural practices, such as irrigation with treated wastewater and soil amendment with biosolids, often cause further triclosan contamination in agricultural fields. However, the fate and crop uptake of triclosan in agrofood systems and related human exposure are still not fully understood. In the present study, C-14-triclosan was used to trace the fate and distribution of triclosan in a soil-peanut plant system. C-14-triclosan in the system maintained an excellent mass balance ranging from 92.5% to 102.7%. C-14-triclosan uptake from soil to peanut plants at the harvest stage (120 d) was only 1.02 +/- 0.17% of the applied C-14. The bioconcentration factors in different tissues followed the order of roots > stems > leaves > fruits. The concentration of C-14-triclosan in peanut fruits was 0.76-0.84 mu g g(-1). C-14-triclosan was more easily accumulated in peanut kernels (69.2 +/- 6.30%) than peanut hulls (27.5 +/- 5.77%) and skin (3.28 +/- 0.53%). The estimated daily intake (EDI) values suggested that peanut consumption represented a minimal risk to human health. The results of this study help to develop a better understanding of the fate of triclosan in the soil-peanut plant system and assess its environmental and human health risks.<bold> </bold>

AB The palm (Elaeis guineensis), known as dende, is an important oleaginous Brazilian plant with a high performance of oil production. In this work, a 2(3) full experimental design was performed and the response surface method (RSM) was used to indicate the optimum parameter of caffeine adsorption on Elaeis guineensis endocarp activated carbon, since the endocarp is the main by-product from dende oil production. It was set the adsorbent point of zero charge (pH(pzc)), and the material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The RSM results indicate removal efficiency (%) at the optimal conditions, 0.20 g of adsorbent, and caffeine initial concentration of 20 mg/L, and acidic medium was about 95%. Based on ANOVA and F test (F-calculated > F-standard), the mathematical/statistical model obtained fits well to the experimental data. The overall kinetic studies showed time was achieved after 5 h and caffeine adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemisorption is a predominant mechanism. Redlich-Peterson and Sips models best represented the experimental data (0.967 < R-2 < 0.993). Thermodynamic revealed that caffeine adsorption was spontaneous at all temperatures studied, exothermic, and probably with changes in the adsorbate-adsorbent complex during the process. The tests conducted in different water matrixes corroborate the suitability of this adsorbent to be used in caffeine removal even in a complex solution.

AB This work has focused on a pharmaceutical plant waters and the environmental impact of its discharges. The Water Quality Index (WQI), the Organic Pollution Index (OPI) and the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of incoming and outgoing waters were analyzed over seasonal variations for 5 months using classical and mathematical indices. Highly significant increases were observed at the output (p < 0.001) for electrical conductivity, alkalinity, calcium and sodium; very significant (p < 0.01) for nitrites, COD and BOD5; significant (p < 0.05) for turbidity, potassium and chlorides. The sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, ammonia, TSS, magnesium, aluminum, iron and manganese showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). These parameters remained high all over the study period except for the BOD5. The WQI was reported in input waters in the range 85.9-89.5 indicating water safe for domestic use, range 42.3-60.9 (medium to bad) in output waters highlighting the water pollution. The OPI highlighted waters with low-to-moderate pollution, essentially due to high levels of nitrites. The SAR was found in "medium-to-high" salinity and "low sodium" ranges, thus precautions required in soils but without significant global effects. The COD/BOD5 ratio highlighted a wastewater sometimes difficultly biodegradable (ratio > 3). In conclusion, often throughout all the study period, the outgoing waters were found with bad quality and non-negligible risks for soils; it is thus strongly advocated that these waters must undergo appropriate treatment to improve its physicochemical quality.

AB This study was focused on the generation of sulfate radicals and their applicability as powerful oxidants for degrading complex organic compounds with the final objective of operating in flow systems. To this end, the removal of two compounds from the pharmaceutical industry was assessed, lissamine green and prednisolone. Initially, sulfate radicals were generated by the activation of persulfate with iron as homogenous catalyst, and the key parameters involved in the process, as catalyst concentration and oxidant dosage, were evaluated. Furthermore, with the aim of preventing the secondary contamination due to metal leaching and to be operate in a continuous mode, a heterogeneous catalyst was developed. For it, the iron was fixed on a cationic resin as Amberlite IR120 Na+ form. It was demonstrated that the removal of both pollutants increases with greater catalyst dosages, achieving a decay of 85% within 25 min with 30 gL(-1) of catalyst. Moreover, the reuse capability of the catalyst was tested, illustrating that it is rough enough for its reuse. Conversely, in order to develop a continuous treatment in flow system, a fixed bed reactor was constructed and its feasibility was proven. Different experiments with residence times from 10 min to 60 min were performed, obtaining a removal level of approximate to 95% and 90% for prednisolone and lissamine green, respectively, at residence time of 60 min. In conclusion, the potential of sulfate radicals-based technology for degrading organic contaminants has been demonstrated.

AB In view of the increasing concerns for environmental problems caused by the widespread use of antibiotics, there is an urgent demand to develop effective technologies for antibiotics removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. For this purpose, photocatalysis has been developed as an important advanced oxidation technology possessing remarkable prospective, and thus, the semiconductor photocatalysts are currently attracting unprecedented research attention. Herein, we report the fabrication of composite materials based on nitrogen-doped carbons and cadmium sulfide semiconductors (CdS/NC-T) derived solely from cadmium metal-organic frameworks (Cd-MOF) through a facile in situ carbonization method, as well as their application as viable photocatalysts toward tetracycline degradation under visible irradiation. It was revealed that cadmium and sulfur species in Cd-MOF precursors assembled to form CdS nanoparticles (NPs), which were deposited simultaneously on nitrogen-doped carbon scaffolds to afford CdS/NC-T composites during carbonization processes. PXRD and TEM studies on as-prepared CdS/NC-T materials indicated the formation of crystalline hexagonal (Wurtzite) CdS NPs on carbonaceous supports. These CdS/NC-T composites were further studied for photocatalytic tetracycline degradation in aqueous solutions under visible irradiation, among which CdS/NC-500 exhibited the highest TC degradation efficiency of ca. 83% within 1 h. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CdS/NC-T depended largely on carbonization temperature, which suggested great potentials of the proposed synthetic pathway in engineering of new visible-light-driven photocatalysts.

AB Advanced oxidation processes that utilize highly oxidative radicals are widely used in water reuse treatment. In recent years, the application of sulfate radical (SO(4)c(center dot-)) as a promising oxidant for water treatment has gained increasing attention. To understand the efficiency of SO(4)c(center dot-) in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater effluent, it is important to be able to predict the reaction kinetics of various SO(4)c(center dot-) -driven oxidation reactions. In this study, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) and high-level wavefunction-based methods (including computationally-intensive coupled cluster methods), to explore the activation energies of SO(4)c(center dot-) -driven oxidation reactions on a series of benzene-derived contaminants. These high-level calculations encompass a wide set of reactions including 110 forward/reverse reactions and 5 different computational methods in total. Based on the high-level coupledcluster quantum calculations, we find that the popular M06-2X DFT functional is significantly more accurate for OH- additions than for SO(4)c(center dot-) reactions. Most importantly, we highlight some of the limitations and deficiencies of other computational methods, and we recommend the use of high-level quantum calculations to spot-check environmental chemistry reactions that may lie outside the training set of the M06-2X functional, particularly for water oxidation reactions that involve SO(4)c(center dot-) and other inorganic species.

AB Fenton or Fenton-like processes have been regarded as feasible methods to degrade a wide variety of contaminants by generating reactive species, but the efficiency is still challenged by the slow transformation from Fe(III) to Fe(II) and pH. This study employed hydroxylamine (HA) to improve the oxidation efficiency of Fe(II)/HSO5- (Fe(II)/PMS) process, by selecting sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as the target compound. The degradation efficiency and mechanism of SMX by the HA/Fe(II)/PMS process were elucidated for the first time. Compared with Fe(II)/PMS process, the HA/Fe(II)/PMS process showed about 4 times higher degradation efficiency of SMX at pH 3.0. The analysis of steady-state concentration of Fe species indicated that HA enhanced the transformation of Fe(III) to Fe(II), sustaining the rapid Fenton-like reactions. Both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals accounted for the degradation of SMX, with the latter regarded as the dominant reactive species. Degradation intermediates of SMX were further analyzed, and three main transformation pathways were thus proposed. The HA/Fe(II)/PMS process was also effective in the removal of SMX and total organic carbon from real pharmaceutical wastewater. This work would broaden the scope of application of Fenton and Fenton-like processes enhanced by HA in contaminants treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A substrate-immobilized (SI) TiO2 nanofiber (NF) photocatalyst for multiple uses was prepared through electrospinning and hot pressing. The rate of furfuryl alcohol degradation under UV irradiation was found to be the highest when the anatase to rutile ratio was 70:30; the rate did not linearly increase as a function of the NF film thickness, mainly due to diffusion limitation. Even after eight repeated cycles, it showed only a marginal reduction in the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of cimetidine. The effects of pH and different organic matter characteristics on the photodegradation of cimetidine (CMT), propranolol (PRP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated. The pH-dependence of the photocatalytic degradation rates of PRP was explained by electrostatic interactions between the selected compounds and the surface of TiO2 NFs. The degradation rates of CMT showed the following order: deionized water > L-tyrosine > secondary wastewater effluent (effluent organic matter) > Suwannee River natural organic matter, demonstrating that the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) can affect the photodegradation of CMT. Photodegradation of CBZ was affected by the presence of DOM, and no significant change was observed between different DOM characteristics. These findings suggest that the removal of CMT, PRP, and CBZ during photocatalytic oxidation using SI TiO2 NFs is affected by the presence of DOM and/or pH, which should be importantly considered for practical applications.

AB Functionalized Granular Activated Carbons (FACS) are used as adsorbents for treating pharmaceutical wastewaters containing Chlorhexidine Gluconate. Chemical modifications of Granular Activated Carbons (GACs) using functionalizing agents like HCl and HF produce FACs. The adsorption capacity of each of FAC-HCl and FAC-HF is found to be higher than GAC. The modelled maximum adsorption capacity for FAC-HCl is 1.02 g/g of adsorbent, 3.49 g/g of adsorbent for FAC-HF and 0.0682 g/g of adsorbent for GAC. This is mainly due to the additional chemisorptions by surface complexation at the functionalized surface sites of the modified GACs. This is also supported by the well-known pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Formation of surface complexes with the functional groups and weakly polar Chlorhexidine Gluconate is well supported by the physical characterization using Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET) test and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis after adsorption. The adsorption capacity of GAC and the FACs increases in the order of FAC-HF > FAC-HCl > GAC conforming to the proportion of the total acidity of the carbon surfaces. Intra-particle diffusion is not the sole rate-controlling factor. An agreement to pseudo-second-order kinetic model, Elovich kinetic model and Boyd's film diffusion model proves that chemisorption is the rate-controlling parameter in this adsorption study.

Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed and purchased drugs that has been widely detected in wastewater and surface water. The present study investigated paracetamol degradation by photocatalytic treatment in a batch system using TiO2 supported on aluminosilicate recovered from waste LED panel (ATiO(2)). The prepared ATiO(2) catalyst was characterized for morphology, elemental composition and crystallinity using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. ATiO(2) was spherical in morphology with a predominance of the anatase phase of TiO2 and an average size of similar to 15 nm. Subsequently, the effects of operating parameters, viz., initial paracetamol concentration (1-10 mg/L), catalyst dosage (0.5-4.0 g/L) and pH (4-10) on paracetamol degradation were investigated using central composite design (CCD). A polynomial model was developed to interpret the linear and interactive effect of operating parameters on the paracetamol degradation efficiency. About 99% degradation efficiency of paracetamol was obtained at optimum conditions (Initial paracetamol concentration similar to 2.74 mg/L, ATiO(2) dosage similar to 2.71 g/L and pH similar to 9.5). The mechanism of paracetamol degradation was adsorption on aluminosilicate and subsequent degradation by TiO2. ATiO(2) could be effectively reused up to 3 cycles, with <5% decrease in the degradation efficiency.

AB This research investigated the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin by titanium dioxide nanoparticles immobilized on a glass plate in an aqueous solution. The important point about this process is immobilization on glass plate, which resolves difficulties related to separation of catalysts from the solution in the application of sole nanoparticles as well as reusability of nanoparticles. Application of nanoparticles without immobilization on a support medium causes toxic effects in aqueous solutions, which was fixed through immobilization on a glass plate in this study. In this research, 1 gL(?1) of TiO2 was immobilized on a glass plate. XRD and SEM indicated that the TiO2 immobilized on the glass plate was highly pure and uniform in size (39.2?74.9?nm). The maximum ciprofloxacin removal efficiency from the synthetic aqueous solution was obtained at the optimal pH of 5, contact time of 105?min, and ciprofloxacin initial concentration of 3 mgL(?1). The extent of ciprofloxacin removed under optimal conditions was obtained as 92.81% and 86.57% from the synthetic and real samples, respectively. Evaluation of linear models of kinetics and adsorption isotherms indicated that the data followed pseudo-first-order kinetics as well as Langmuir?Hinshelwood and Freundlich isotherms. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin on TiO2 nanoparticles immobilized on glass plate is an endothermic and physical process. Considering the high efficiency of this process under real conditions, it can be used for the removal of resistant pollutants from industrial wastewater.

AB The widespread use of platinum in high-tech and catalytic applications has led to the production of diverse Pt loaded wastewaters. Effective recovery strategies are needed for the treatment of low concentrated waste streams to prevent pollution and to stimulate recovery of this precious resource. The biological recovery of five common environmental Pt-complexes was studied under acidic conditions; the chloro-complexes PtCl42- and PtCl62-, the amine-complex Pt(NH3)(4)Cl-2 and the pharmaceutical complexes cisplatin and carboplatin. Five bacterial species were screened on their platinum recovery potential; the Gram-negative species Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, Geobacter metallireducens, and Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the Gram-positive species Bacillus toyonensis. Overall, PtCl42- and PtCl62- were completely recovered by all bacterial species while only S. oneidensis and C. metallidurans were able to recover cisplatin quantitatively (99%), all in the presence of H-2 as electron donor at pH 2. Carboplatin was only partly recovered (max. 25% at pH 7), whereas no recovery was observed in the case of the Pt-tetraamine complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of both intra- and extracellular platinum particles. Flow cytometry based microbial viability assessment demonstrated the decrease in number of intact bacterial cells during platinum reduction and indicated C. metallidurans to be the most resistant species. This study showed the effective and complete biological recovery of three common Pt-complexes, and estimated the fate and transport of the Pt-complexes in wastewater treatment plants and the natural environment.

AB The issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment has caused increasing concern in the recent years and various strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem. This work describes a Bayesian network (BN)-based socioecological impact assessment of a set of measures aimed at reducing the entry of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. The measures investigated were selected across three sectors: public health market, environmental politics and drug design innovation. The BN model was developed for two drugs, Metformin and Metoprolol, and it models the distribution of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) values as a function of different measures. Results show that the sensitivity of the PEC for the two drugs to the measures investigated reflects the distinct drug characteristics, suggesting that in order to ensure the successful reduction of a broad range of substances, a spectrum of measures targeting the entire lifecycle of a pharmaceutical should be implemented. Furthermore, evaluation of two scenarios reflecting different emission management strategies highlights that the integrated implementation of a comprehensive set of measures across the three sectors results in a more extensive reduction of the contamination. Finally, the BN provides an initial forecasting tool to model the PEC of a drug as a function of a combination of measures in a context-specific manner and possible adaptations of the model are proposed.

AB Emerging contaminants such as diclofenac is frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants as they are not specifically designed for the removal of pharmaceutical effluents, which results in poor removal efficiency. Even though photocatalyst has emerged as an excellent alternative, most of the reported photocatalyst portrays fast recombination rate of electron-hole pair and has slow electron mobility. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in the present work, visible light-driven TiO2/gC(3)N(4) photocatalyst was synthesized for the photodegradation of diclofenac in aqueous solution. The morphological and optical properties of the photocatalyst were analysed. The photodegradation efficiency was highly improved even at low g-C3N4 loading, indicating the Z-scheme photocatalyst, successfully overcame the electron-hole pair's fast recombination rate. The photodegradation efficiency was represented as a function of all independent variables, using a second-order quadratic model. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the degradation process. A maximum degradation efficiency (93.49%) was achieved at the optimum conditions (irradiation time = 90 min, initial solution pH = 5, initial DCF concentration = 5 ppm and g-C3N4 loading = 0.3g/g TiO2). The as developed photocatalyst is found to be highly stable as it showed a satisfactory recyclability. The process followed a pseudo-first-order reaction. Photodegradation of diclofenac also resulted in ten intermediates as identified using LCMS analysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rhamnose is a high-value carbohydrate used in flavorings, aromatics, and pharmaceuticals. Current demand for rhamnose is filled through plant-based sources; however, microbially originated rhamnolipids have been proposed as an alternative source. A mixed microbial biofilm, cultured from a wastewater sludge, was found to comprise >8 dry weight% rhamnose when provided volatile fatty acids as carbon source, and 24 dry weight% when given glucose. The latter rhamnose concentration is a fourfold higher production mass than the current plant-based origin and is competitive with yields from pure microbial cultures. The biofilm was characterized based on total carbohydrate production at varying nutrient levels, individual carbohydrate monomer production from varying organic acid substrates, and microbial community compositionbased on 16s rRNA. Biofilm carbohydrate production was maximized at a C:N ratio of 28 (mol:mol). The production of rhamnose varied significantly based on carbon substrate; glucose had the greatest yield of rhamnose, followed by propionic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, valeric acid, and butyric acid. Microbial community analysis indicated an abundance of organisms within the Xanthobacter genus, which is known to produce rhamnose as zeaxanthin rhamnoside. Rhamnose production was heavily correlated with ribose production (R-2=0.96). Results suggest that mixed microbial biofilms could be a competitive source of monomeric rhamnose that may be produced from mixed organic waste streams of variable composition via volatile fatty acids and glucose.

AB Ciprofloxacin is the second generation of quinolone antibiotic used to treat infections in living beings. After using this antibiotic, some percentages of the compound are not metabolized in the body and is excreted along with the urine and excreta. This will reach the treatment plant and the conventional treatment methods are not designed to treat these micropollutants, so it is released into the environment. The presence of ciprofloxacin is detected in surface water samples collected from different areas of the world.This study is conducted to find an effective adsorbent that can remove the ciprofloxacin from wastewater. Biochar produced from agricultural waste can be used as an effective adsorbent. Biochar is prepared under a process called pyrolysis which is carried out under relatively higher temperatures and low oxygen content. In this study, biochar is prepared from rice husk at different temperatures ie, 200 degrees C, 250 degrees C and 300 degrees C. The adsorption experiments were conducted at the varying contact time, varying the initial concentration of biochar and varying residence time in the muffle furnace. The biochar prepared at 300 degrees C showed 96% removal in a contact time of 90 minutes. FTIR results showed that stretching vibration of -OH group, phenolic C-OH stretch, C-O in phenol, C-H stretching vibration and C=O stretching play a vital role in ciprofloxacin adsorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetic reaction and Freundlich isotherm agreed well with ciprofloxacin adsorption process. SEM images after adsorption showed a drastic change in the surface morphology of the rice husk biochar.

AB The present work investigates the occurrence of 22 drugs of abuse (DAs) and metabolites in surface water from four Spanish River basins: Llobregat, Ebro, Jucar and Guadalquivir. To this end, samples were collected from 77 selected sites in two sampling campaigns conducted in 2010 and 2011. Analyses were performed by means of on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS). Cocaine, its metabolite benzoylecgonine, ephedrine, MDMA (ecstasy), and methadone and its metabolite EDDP were the most ubiquitous compounds, being present in more than 50% of the samples. Overall, DAs were present at low ng/L levels, showing comparatively higher concentrations in small tributary rivers impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluents. The results obtained did not show a clear relationship between the concentrations of DAs and the hydrological conditions of the river basins. Differences in the occurrence of DAs between river basins were observed, but only for MDMA this finding could be confirmed in both sampling campaigns. These results overall suggest similar drugs consumption in the studied areas.

AB Effluent-dominated streams are becoming increasingly common in temperate regions and generate complex pharmaceutical mixture exposure conditions that may impact aquatic organisms via drug-drug interactions. Here, we quantified spatiotemporal pharmaceutical exposure concentrations and composition mixture dynamics during baseflow conditions at four sites in a temperate-region effluent-dominated stream (upstream, at, and progressively downstream from effluent discharge). Samples were analyzed monthly for 1 year for 109 pharmaceuticals/ degradates using a comprehensive U.S. Geological Survey analytical method and biweekly for 2 years focused on 14 most common pharmaceuticals/degradates. We observed a strong chemical gradient with pharmaceuticals only sporadically detected upstream from the effluent. Seventy-four individual pharmaceuticals/degradates were detected, spanning 5 orders of magnitude from 0.28 to 13 500 ng/L, with 38 compounds detected in >50% of samples. "Biweekly" compounds represented 77 +/- 8% of the overall pharmaceutical concentration. The antidiabetic drug metformin consistently had the highest concentration with limited in-stream attenuation. The antihistamine drug fexofenadine inputs were greater during warm- than cool-season conditions but also attenuated faster. Differential attenuation of individual pharmaceuticals (i.e., high = citalopram; low = metformin) contributed to complex mixture evolution along the stream reach. This research demonstrates that variable inputs over multiple years and differential instream attenuation of individual compounds generate evolving complex mixture exposure conditions for biota, with implications for interactive effects.

AB The discharge of effluent from the pharmaceutical industries is a major source of environmental pollution due to the toxic and at times carcinogenic nature of contaminants. The current work investigates the treatment of pharmaceutical industry effluent (PIE) using ultrasonic horn, operated individually and in combination with oxidants. Under controlled operating conditions, the effect of addition of hydrogen peroxide (ratio of COD of PIE: H2O2 varied over the range from 1:1 to 1:10), ozone (flow rate of 400 mg/h) and Fenton's reagent (FeSO4:H2O2 ratio of 3:5) was investigated as a possible process intensification strategy. The combined approach of ultrasound, ozone and CuO catalyst (0.3 g/L) as well as US + H2O2 + Ozone was also studied. The combined operation of US with H2O2 and Ozone resulted in a 73 % COD reduction, whereas the combination of the US, ozone and CuO catalyst gave maximum COD reduction of 92 %. The study also focused on identification of intermediate products formed during the PIE treatment. The component analysis of PIE before and after treatment was carried out by high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HR-LCMS). The research work has clearly established that cavitation in combination with other AOPs can be effectively used for the treatment of PIE with a significant increase in the extent of COD reduction for the combination approach.

AB The removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and cell-free antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and the microbial community of ARB were investigated in detail to understand their fate and provide valuable information on the feasibility of full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The potential risks of cell-free ARGs to the receiving environment were discovered. High influent antibiotic concentration could inhibit the microbial activity of MBR sludge, whereas good antibiotic removal could be maintained because of relatively long solid retention time and high biomass retention. Approximately 61.8%-77.5% of the total antibiotics were degraded, and 22.5%-38.2% of the total antibiotics were adsorbed by MBR sludge on average. The individual antibiotic removal presented intense discrepancy because of the chemical construction and distribution coefficient of antibiotics. Aeromonas exhibited specific antibiotic resistance to ampicillin and erythromycin, Escherichia became the predominant genera in kanamycin-ARB and tetracycline-ARB, and Klebsiella and Bacteroides were the particular genera that exhibited distinct antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin. A significant correlation was found between cell-free ARG abundance and ARB content, and relatively high effluent cell-free ARG abundance facilitated the proliferation and transmission of ARB. The impacts of the receiving environment to eliminate the ecological risks and severe threats to human health should be investigated because of the low decay ratio and long-term persistence of cell-free ARGs.

AB The combination of enzymes and nanomaterials represents an innovative technology that can be used in the field of environmental bioremediation. Various biologically active molecules can be effectively immobilized onto nanomaterials, which are considered very interesting matrices because of their unique physicochemical properties. Nanoparticles are carriers that have been intensively investigated because of their potential to produce nanobiocatalysts. Currently, the development of novel hybrid nanocomposites such as nanographene, nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanogels is significantly increasing. In the first part of this chapter, importance and advantages of enzyme immobilization, properties of free enzymes, and parameters influencing the immobilization processes are discussed. Description of different types of nanomaterials and the corresponding immobilization techniques such as adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, encapsulation, and cross-linking is also involved. The second part of this chapter is about degradation of various pollutants including phenolic compounds, synthetic dyes, pharmaceuticals, and PAHs by nanobiocatalysts. Many studies have been published over the past 5 years, which indicates an increasing interest in this application. The most important parameters and results of the published papers have been reviewed and organized in a comprehensive table. It is obvious that the utilization of nanobiocatalysts for remediating contaminated wastewater and soil is still under development. However, enzyme-based nanomaterials found an interesting application in the field of biosensors, which is described at the end of this chapter. Nanobiosensors are rapidly developing and more and more often used for detecting and monitoring various pollutants in the environment.

AB Background: Amidases are ubiquitous enzymes and biological functions of these enzymes vary widely. They are considered to be synergistically involved in the synthesis of a wide variety of carboxylic acids, hydroxamic acids and hydrazides, which find applications in commodity chemicals synthesis, pharmaceuticals agrochemicals and wastewater treatments.
   Methods: They hydrolyse a wide variety of amides (short-chain aliphatic amides, mid-chain amides, arylamides, a-aminoamides and a-hydroxyamides) and can be grouped on the basis of their catalytic site and preferred substrate. Despite their economic importance, we lack knowledge as to how these amidases withstand elevated pH and temperature whereas others cannot.
   Results: The present study focuses on the statistical comparison between the acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic organisms. In silico analysis of amidases of acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic organisms revealed some striking trends as to how amino acid composition varies significantly. Statistical analysis of primary and secondary structure revealed amino acid trends in amidases of these three groups of bacteria. The abundance of isoleucine (Ile, I) in acid-tolerant and leucine (Leu, L) in alkali tolerant showed the aliphatic amino acid dominance in extreme conditions of pH in acidtolerant and alkali tolerant amidases.
   Conclusion: The present investigation insights physiochemical properties and dominance of some crucial amino acid residues in the primary and secondary structure of some amidases from acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic microorganisms.

AB Prioritization methodologies are often used for identifying those pharmaceuticals that pose the greatest risk to the natural environment and to focus laboratory testing or environmental monitoring toward pharmaceuticals of greatest concern. Risk-based prioritization approaches, employing models to derive exposure concentrations, are commonly used, but the reliability of these models is unclear. The present study evaluated the accuracy of exposure models commonly used for pharmaceutical prioritization. Targeted monitoring was conducted for 95 pharmaceuticals in the Rivers Foss and Ouse in the City of York (UK). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) ranges were estimated based on localized prescription, hydrological data, reported metabolism, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) removal rates, and were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). For the River Foss, PECs, obtained using highest metabolism and lowest WWTP removal, were similar to MECs. In contrast, this trend was not observed for the River Ouse, possibly because of pharmaceutical inputs unaccounted for by our modeling. Pharmaceuticals were ranked by risk based on either MECs or PECs. With 2 exceptions (dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine), risk ranking based on both MECs and PECs produced similar results in the River Foss. Overall, these findings indicate that PECs may well be appropriate for prioritization of pharmaceuticals in the environment when robust and local data on the system of interest are available and reflective of most source inputs.

AB A metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) matrix of MIL-100(Fe) loading N-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) nanoparticles as a novel photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile two-step strategy including preparation of neutral NTiO2 sol and caging N-TiO2 nanoparticles. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by a series of techniques including XRD, ICP, BET, UV-vis, XPS and TEM. Photocatalytic activity of the samples was assessed based on degradation of methylene blue or rhodamine B dye in model wastewater under visible-light irradiation. The as-synthesized samples essentially maintain the typical MOFs structure and porous property of MIL-100(Fe), which exhibits well confinement effect on TiO2 nanoparticles. A significant finding is that the quantum dots-like N-TiO2 nanoparticles (< 2 nm) with an appropriate mass percentage of 32% highly disperse in cages of MIL100(Fe) with 1.9 nm of pore size and obtain narrowed band gap. But agglomeration of N-TiO2 nanoparticles occurs as TiO2 content increases to 50%. Meanwhile, nitrogen atoms are successfully incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. The optimal catalyst obtains 99.1% and 93.5% of final removal rate, respectively for methylene blue and rhodamine B, presenting the enhanced photocatalytic performance by comparison with the pure MIL-100(Fe). The composite exhibits more excellent sedimentation efficiency and reusability than pure N-TiO2. A possible mechanism of the photocatalysis process is presented in detail.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern, particularly endocrine active compounds (EACs), have been identified as a threat to aquatic wildlife. However, little is known about the impact of EACs on lakes through groundwater from onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). This study aims to identify specific contributions of OWTS to Sullivan Lake, Minnesota, USA. Lake hydrology, water chemistry, caged bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) exposures were used to assess whether EACs entered the lake through OWTS inflow and the resultant biological impact on fish. Study areas included two OWTS-influenced near-shore sites with native bluegill spawning habitats and two in-lake control sites without nearby EAC sources. Caged bluegill sunfish were analyzed for plasma vitellogenin concentrations, organosomatic indices, and histological pathologies. Surface and porewater was collected from each site and analyzed for EACs. Porewater was also collected for laboratory exposure of larval fathead minnow, before analysis of predator escape performance and gene expression profiles. Chemical analysis showed EACs present at low concentrations at each study site, whereas discrete variations were reported between sites and between summer and fall samplings. Body condition index and liver vacuolization of sunfish were found to differ among study sites as did gene expression in exposed larval fathead minnows. Interestingly, biological exposure data and water chemistry did not match. Therefore, although results highlight the potential impacts of seepage from OWTS, further investigation of mixture effects and life history factor as well as chemical fate is warranted.

AB A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was operated using a glucose-based synthetic wastewater to study the effects of tylosin, a macrolide antimicrobial commonly used in swine production, on treatment performance. The experimental period was divided into three consecutive phases with different influent tylosin concentrations (0, 1.67, and 167 mg/L. The addition of 1.67 mg/L tylosin to the reactor had negligible effects oil the overall treatment performance, that is, total methane production and effluent chemical oxygen demand did not change significantly (P < 0.05), yet analyses of individual ASBR cycles revealed a decrease in the rates of both methane production and propionate uptake after tylosin was added. The addition of 167 mg/L tylosin to the reactor resulted in a gradual decrease in methane production and the accumulation of propionate and acetate. Subsequent inhibition of methanogenesis was attributed to a decrease in the pH of the reactor. After the addition of 167 mg/L tylosin to the reactor, an initial decrease in the rate of glucose uptake during the ASBR cycle followed by a gradual recovery was observed. In batch tests, the specific biogas production with the substrate butyrate was completely inhibited in the presence of tylosin. This study indicated that tylosin inhibited propionate and butyrate-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria and fermenting bacteria resulting in unfavorable effects on methanogenesis. Biotechnol.

AB Ready biodegradability tests (RBTs) are extensively used to screen the potential of chemicals to be biodegraded. The use of RBT protocols often results in large variations of test results that may lead to wrong interpretations. The present study aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of this variability. For this, we subjected the compounds 4-chloroaniline (4CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), metformin (MET), and N-methylpiperazine (NMP) to a variety of different test conditions. Inocula from five local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used in an attempt to enhance the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 310 biodegradability tests. The biodegradation capacity in RBTs, community composition and adaptation of the communities were compared after one week of pre-exposure in batch and four months exposure in chemostat. The results confirm that none of the test compounds is readily biodegradable in the standard OECD 310 RBT. However, when pre-exposure under either batch or chemostat conditions was included, 4CA was degraded in some cases and less variability among different inocula was observed for the transformation of MET. Bacterial communities from the five locations were found to be significantly different in composition from one another. In addition, pre-treatment performed before the RBT significantly changed the composition of each community. Results of this experiment show that short-term pre-exposure may increase the absolute number of degraders and deserves to be further investigated as a potential method to reduce the outcome variability of RBTs.

AB Antibiotics are resistant to biodegradation, and their removal by biological processes is difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the removal of azithromycin from water using ultraviolet radiation (UV), Fe (VI) oxidation process and ZnO nanoparticles. The effect of different parameters such as pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), the concentration of Fe (VI) and ZnO nanoparticles and UV intensity on the removal of azithromycin from water was investigated. The optimal conditions for the removal of azithromycin were a pH of 2, a temperature of 25 degrees C, a HRT of 15 min, and a ratio of ZnO nanoparticles to the initial concentration of azithromycin (A/P) of 0.00009 which was fitted by Langmuir isotherm. In addition, the optimal conditions for the removal of azithromycin using UV radiation were a pH of 7, a temperature of 65 degrees C, a HRT of 60 min, and UV radiation power of 163 mW/cm(2). For the Fe (VI) oxidation process, the optimal conditions were a pH of 2, a temperature of 50 degrees C and a HRT of 20 min. Also, the optimal ratio of Fe (VI) to the initial concentration of antibiotic was between 0.011 and 0.012. The results of this study showed that the Fe (VI) oxidation process, UV radiation, and ZnO nanoparticles were efficient methods for the removal of azithromycin from water.

AB Oxytetracycline (OTC), an antibacterial agent, is extensively used in aquaculture practices all over the world, but also in human and veterinary medicines. Because of its intensive use, low rates of absorption by treated animals, inadequate disposal, and low efficiency of removal in wastewater treatment plants, the potential harmful effects on aquatic organisms are of great concern. This work aimed to assess the effects of this antibiotic in rainbow trout, following both acute and chronic exposures. Catalase (CAT), total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRed) activities and lipid peroxidation (TBARS levels) were quantified as oxidative stress biomarkers, in gills and liver. Genotoxic endpoints, reflecting different types of genetic damage in blood cells, were also determined, by analysis of genetic damage (determination of the genetic damage index, GDI, measured by comet assay) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs). The obtained results showed a mild pattern of antioxidant response, with modifications in CAT and GPx activities in gills, and lipid peroxidation in liver. These results suggest that despite the occurrence of oxidative effects, a full scenario of oxidative stress is not likely. However, exposure to OTC resulted in the establishment of genotoxic alterations with the induction of DNA strand breaks in blood cells (increase of GDI), and of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities (increase of ENAs). Considering that the oxidative response was not totally devisable, other mechanisms may be involved in the genotoxic effects reported.

AB The present work describes dynamic uptake of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CH), by using a cost-effective agricultural by-product - sawdust (SD). The sawdust was characterised by FTIR and SEM analysis. The sorbent particles were highly porous with average pore diameter of nearly 10 mu m. The optimum pH and solid/liquid ratio for sorption of CH were found to be 5.8 and 2.0, respectively. The dynamic drug uptake data was applied to various kinetic models and their order of fitness was found to be pseudo second order > Elovich equation > power function model, as indicated by their regression values. The experimental equilibrium uptake values (q(e)) were in close agreement with those evaluated from the pseudo second order equation for initial sorbate concentrations of 10 and 20 mg.l(-1) at 33 degrees C. The drug uptake mechanism was found to be attractive non-electrostatic interactions, involving H-bonding interactions between H atoms and other electro-negative species such as F, O and N of the drug molecule. The mechanism is discussed on the basis of pH(pzc) of sawdust and zwitterionic nature of drug CH. Mass transfer analysis was carried out using the drug uptake data obtained with sorbate concentrations of 10 and 20 mg.l(-1). The used sorbent could be regenerated using 1.0 mol.l(-1) HCl solution with a regeneration efficiency of nearly 85%.

AB Pharmaceutical industries in and around Hyderabad produce a wide variety of products using both organic and inorganic substances as raw materials thereby generating a large quantity of complex toxic organic liquid wastes containing high concentrations of inorganic TDS. These wastes are highly toxic to biological life and are usually characterized by high BOD, COD and a high COD:BOD ratio. In the present study an attempt has been made to evaluate the treatability of a bulk drug pharmaceutical wastewater using a lab-scale activated sludge reactor with acclimatized mixed consortia. The application of chemical coagulation as a pretreatment for the removal of sulphates from the effluent was examined with lime as a coagulant to reduce the TDS levels. A 44-48% removal of sulphates was achieved which helped in increasing the efficiency for achieving better biological treatment. The treatability studies with mixed consortia revealed that the acclimatized bacteria were highly effective in treating the waste by achieving a maximum reduction of 86.6% from as high as 4000 mg/l COD concentration. At an HRT of 4.5 days maximum reduction in the COD concentration is found in all the concentrations studied. The biokinetic parameters like Y, K-s, k, mu(max) and k(d) which will be useful to design a prototype activated sludge reactor are evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Novel particle electrodes, i.e. flotation tailings particle electrode (FPE), were prepared using flotation tailings, garden soil, and soluble starch with a mass ratio of 16:3:1, and then used in tetracycline wastewater treatment. The physicochemical properties of FPE were systematically characterized using SEM, XRD, FT-IR and XRF. Tetracycline adsorption and its adsorption mechanism onto FPE was explored for the first time. Parameters affecting FPE's degradation efficiency and energy consumption such as current density, electrolysis time, initial concentration, initial pH and aeration rate were examined. The electrocatalytic degradation of tetracycline shows that the degradation of tetracycline meets the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Moreover, the numbers of center dot OH produced on the surfaces of the cathode, anode and particle electrode were compared. Results showed that the adsorption-saturated FPE can be regenerated by electrochemical action to induce further absorption and form in situ electrocatalysis. In order to find out the transformation products in water and degradation pathways of Tetracycline, UHPLC method was used to obtain the degradation pathways for Tetracycline. So, this work could provide a fabrication of high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalytic for removal of pharmaceuticals pollutants from waste water as well as deeper insight into electrocatalytic mechanism, transformation products, and degradation pathways of Tetracycline in water.

AB Magnetic bentonite (MBt) and Ti/TiO2 nanotube/PbO2, for the first time, were investigated as particle electrodes and anode of three dimensional electro-Fenton process (3DEF) for the degradation of diclofenac (DCF) and naproxen (NPX). The characteristics of the electrodes were determined byX-ray diffraction(XRD),scanning electron microscope(SEM) andenergydispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS) analyses and the effects of operating parameters on degradation were studied. The results showed that adsorption and electrochemical processes have lower removal efficiency than the 3DEF process at neutral pH. This efficiency was due to the greater production of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) through the anode and MBt surface. The results of the scavenging experiments confirmed an increase in the amount of production of center dot OH. The maximum removal efficiency of DCF and NPX was obtained at pH of 6, MBt dosage of 500 mg/L, current density of 25 mA/cm(2)and electrolysis time of 120 min. The electrodes reusability was confirmed by consecutive reaction cycle and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and SEM-mapping analysis explained their stability. The results of continuous electro-oxidation reactor showed proper removal of the chemical oxygen demand(COD) from real wastewater. The degradation by-products were identified by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis coupled with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). Based on comparative tests and products identification, the possible mechanism and pathway of drugs degradation were suggested.

AB The agent triclosan has been extensively used in different personal care products as a broad-spectrumantimicrobial and preservative agent. Due to its continuous release into the environment, including discharge via wastewater treatment plants, triclosan has been widely detected in aquatic environments. There is growing interest in improving the knowledge about the environmental fate of triclosan due to its possible bioaccumulation and the toxicity it may pose to organisms, such as fish and other non-target species. To investigate the distribution and bioconcentration of triclosan in fish, Poecilia vivipara was exposed to 0.2 mg L-1. Contents of triclosan in whole fish, brain, gonads, liver, muscle and gills were quantified by LC-MS/MS. When lipid normalised concentration was used, the liver exhibited the highest concentration followed by the gills, gonads, brain and muscle tissues. Bioconcentration was increased with time reaching a steady-state around 7-14 days for most all tissues. After 24 h depuration, triclosan concentrations declined >80% in all tissues except liver, in which triclosan takes longer to be depurated. These results not only clearly indicate that triclosan accumulated in P. vivipara, with tissue-specific bioconcentration factors (BCF) that ranged from 40.2 to 1025.4, but also show that the elimination of triclosan after transferring the fish to triclosan-free freshwater is rapid in all tissues.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter freshwater and affect aquatic ecosystem health. Although toxicity tests have been carried out for the commonly used pharmaceuticals, evidence-based water quality guidelines have not been derived. High-reliability water quality guideline values have been derived for 4 pharmaceuticalscarbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine, and propranololin freshwaters using a Burr type III distribution applied to species sensitivity distributions of chronic toxicity data. Data were quality-assured and had to meet acceptability criteria for chronic no-observed-effect concentrations or concentrations affecting 10% of species, endpoints of population relevance (namely, effect endpoints based on development, growth, reproduction, and survival). Biomarker response data (e.g., biochemical, histological, or molecular responses) were excluded from the derivation because they are typically not directly relevant to wildlife population-related impacts. The derived guideline values for 95% species protection were 9.2g/L, 770g/L, 1.6g/L, and 14g/L for carbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine, and propranolol, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the unknown reliability values derived for the European Commission, Switzerland, or Germany that are based on the application of assessment factors to the most sensitive experimental endpoint (which may include biochemical, histological, or molecular biomarker responses) of a limited data set. The guideline values derived in the present study were not exceeded in recent data for Australian rivers and streams receiving pharmaceutical-containing effluents from wastewater-treatment plants.

AB The objective of this research was the development, optimization, and demonstration of an ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) based method for organic anthropogenic waste indicators (AWIs) with a range of physicochemical properties from soil and sediment samples. The optimized method was designed to be cost effective compared to existing extraction methods, which may require large quantities of consumables, produce substantial volumes of organic waste, or require costly instrumentation or equipment. Reagent grade sand, soil collected from the native grassland in proximity to Eastern Washington University (EWU), and sediment samples collected from the Spokane river were used as sample matrices during method development. These matrices were fortified with eight AWls of varying chemical properties that are representative of a variety of household, industrial, and agricultural sources. The recoveries of the AWls spiked onto these matrices were determined in the extracts using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). These values reflect the efficiency of the method for extraction of these analytes from representative environmental matrices. Recoveries ranged from 46.1% to 110% in the fortified soil and from 49.2% to 118.6% in the fortified sediment samples, which is comparable with existing methods for the study analytes. The optimized method was then used to quantify AWls in a biosolid-amended soil. Indole and p-cresol were detected in the biosolid-amended soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A full scale experiment with an activated sludge process in a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant showed that the-operation of two settling tanks in series, with the first tank full of sludge, resulted in selection of sludge particles which had a lower than average filament content for retention in the process. Series operation of the two clarifiers was very successful in controlling sludge bulking. The functioning of the settling tanks as selectors of sludge particles which settle and thicken well has not been considered to any great extent. Two laboratory-scale activated sludge plants fed with an artificial wastewater were operated to explore this selection function further. The SVI values were measured and assessed. At the start of operation, the SVI was about 60-80 ml/g in both of the parallel and the series plants. After eight days of the operation, the SVI started to increase rapidly in the parallel plant, and in twenty days of operation, the averaged values of SVI were 163 ml/g and 116 ml/g for the parallel and the series plants, respectively. On day 38, MLSS from two aeration tanks were interchanged. In a few days after that interchange, the SVI values in the parallel, which was originally in the series mode, rapidly increased from 130 ml/g to more than 350 ml/g(SV30 = 930 ml/g). This experiment clearly supports the hypothesis of a microorganism selection function of the settling tank and also corresponds to the results obtained from the field study.

AB In this study, the removal rates of eight anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic pharmaceuticals, AIAPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, codeine, indomethacin and propyphenazone) were assessed in a pilot-scale A(2)O system (including anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic zones), long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. qPCR was used to quantify the absolute abundances of total Bacteria, total Archaea, mycolic-acid containing filamentous Actinobacteria (Mycolata) and Fungi within the activated sludge microbial community developed in the system. Multivariate analyses and Spearman correlation coefficients were used in search of significant links among the removal rates of the AIAPs, the abundances of the targeted microbial groups in the activated sludge, and the changes of environmental/operating variables in the A(2)O system. Improved removal efficiencies of several of the AIAPs analyzed (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen) were correlated to higher organic load in the influent water, higher concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), lower temperature and lower food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M). Removal efficiencies of several pharmaceuticals correlated with increased abundances of Mycolata in the A(2)O system, pointing at this group of bacteria as candidate key players for AIAPs removal in activated sludge.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) offers to be a very promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from contaminated wastewater, and with the recent developments in FO membranes, the effect of both a higher water flux and reverse salt flux on the rejection of TrOCs needs to be explored. In this study two novel thin-film composite (TFC) membranes with greater water permeability and selectivity than the benchmark cellulose tri-acetate (CTA) membrane were compared at bench-scale in terms of TrOCs permeability. By probing the solute-membrane interactions that dictate the transport of TrOCs through the two membranes in the absence and presence of a draw solution, several conclusions were drawn. Firstly, steric hindrance is the main TrOCs transport-limiting mechanism through TFC membranes unless the negative membrane surface charge is significant, in which case, electrostatic interactions can dominate over steric hindrance. Secondly, the increase in ionic strength induced by the draw solution in the vicinity of and perhaps inside the membrane seems to favour the rejection of TrOCs by "shrinking" the membrane pores or by "shielding" the negative surface charge. Lastly, during FO operation, solute concentration polarisation becomes detrimental when working at high water fluxes, whereas the reverse solute flux has no direct impact on the transport of TrOCs through the membrane.

AB Granular activated carbon (GAC) is applied as post-treatment technology in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in order to increase the elimination of organic micropollutants (OMPs). However, the efficiency and life-time of GAC depend on several parameters, such as the quality of the effluent to be treated or the type of GAC. In the present paper, two types of GAC, based on bituminous carbon (BC-GAC) and coconut shell (CS-GAC), were assessed from a technical, economic and environmental point of view to further remove OMPs present in two secondary effluents, coming from integrated biological systems with a membrane or a settler, respectively. Although all GAC filters were efficient in removing selected OMPs, the quality of the secondary effluent had a strong influence on the lifespan of adsorbent material and the technical operability of the filtration systems. While GAC filters treating membrane effluent were highly effective to remove recalcitrant compounds, such as carbamazepine and diazepam (> 80%), even after 430 d of operation (> 30,800 BV), the efficiency of GAC filters treating settler effluent quickly lowered to 50% after 100 d of operation (< 7200 BV). Both types of GAC showed similar adsorption capacities and only slight differences were found in terms of costs ( 2.4  pound/kg vs 2.7  pound/kg). However, CS-GAC has a lower carbon footprint than BC-GAC, mainly due to the more environmentally friendly production process of CS-GAC.

AB Three cancerostatic platinum compounds (CPCs) including cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are complexes of Pt and classified as probable carcinogenic compounds to humans. This study aimed to perform health risk assessment of platinum cytotoxic drugs for drinking water by developing a sensitive analytical method in the water resource of Qom Province in the central part of Iran. Concentrations of the platinum drugs were determined, including 052 +/- 0.2 mu g/L for cisplatin, 0.94 +/- 0.36 mu g/L for carboplatin and 0.27 +/- 0.16 mu g/L for oxaliplatin in influent samples, and 0.24 +/- 0.07 mu g/L for cisplatin, 0.28 +/- 0.05 mu g/L for carboplatin and 0.11 +/- 0.01 mu g/L for oxaliplatin in effluent samples. The results indicated that in all the well water samples related to the groundwater, the concentration of the platinum-based compounds was lower than the calculated limits of quantification (LOQ); the concentration of cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin across the samples in the station of drinking water distribution was also below the limits of detection (LOD). The resulting margin of exposure (MOE) is lower than one (MOE < 1) for the three groups including children, pregnant women and lactation women related to cisplatin and carboplatin was determined through exposure to raw and untreated drinking water. Further research is recommended to be conducted in this area, particularly environmental fate of metabolites and transformation products.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals, particularly antibiotics, in water bodies and water streams has raised increasing worries about the potential risks to human health and ecosystems. Norfloxacin is a popularly used fluoroquinolone antibiotic and considered as an emerging pharmaceutical contaminant. In this paper, adsorption of norfloxacin from artificial wastewater was done by the pretreated barley straw (PBS) that was made from raw barley straw with H3PO4 impregnation and microwave heating. The experimentally maximum norfloxacin adsorption capacity of PBS was 349 +/- 17 mg/g at 298.15 K and pH 6.96. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms with respect to temperature were evaluated. The results indicated that adsorption of norfloxacin on PBS was an endothermic process. The adsorption site energy and its distribution based on the Langmuir-Freundlich model were determined to describe the adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the percentage of adsorption sites, the site energy of which are greater than or equal to a specific energy E*, was estimated. The proposed dominant driving forces, electron-donor-acceptor interactions (n-pi and pi-pi) between the polarizable PBS (carboxyl and aromatic groups, as n- and pi-electron-donors) and norfloxacin (carbon atom in benzene ring attached to F, as a pi-electron-acceptor), were investigated by the C and O K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy.

AB Ketoprofen (MET) is a mostly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been frequently detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters. In this study, we investigated the degradation of KET by sulfate radical (SO4 center dot(-)) based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) in aqueous solution. The degradation kinetics, mechanisms, and effects of natural water matrices on thermally activated persulfate (TAP) oxidation of KET were systematically investigated. Increasing the temperature and persulfate (PS) concentrations greatly enhanced the degradation of KET. KET degradation is pH-dependent with an optimum pH of 5.0. Reactions in the presence of radical quenchers revealed the dominant role of SO4 center dot(-) in oxidizing KET. Water matrix significantly influenced the degradation of KET. The common inorganic anions present in natural waters exhibited inhibitory effect on KET degradation, and the inhibition followed the order of Cl- > CO32- > HCO3- > NOT3-; however, no significant inhibition of KET degradation was observed in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations. The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) suppressed MET degradation, and the suppression increased as NOM concentration increase. Products identification and mineralization experiments revealed that MET and its degradation intermediates were finally transformed into CO2 and H2O. The results of this study indicated that applying SR-AOPs for the remediation of MET contaminated water matrix is technically possible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given that drugs and their degradation products are likely to occur as concoctions in wastewater, the degradation of a mixture of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diclofenac (DCF) and naproxen (NPX), was investigated by solar photolysis and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-mediated solar photocatalysis using an immersion-well photoreactor. An equimolar ratio (1:1) of both NSAIDs in distilled water, drinking water, and river water was subjected to solar degradation. Solar photolysis of the DCF and NPX mixture was competitive particularly in drinking water and river water, as both drugs have the ability to undergo photolysis. However, the addition of TiO2 in the mixture significantly enhanced the degradation rate of both APIs compared to solar photolysis alone. Mineralization, as measured by chemical oxygen demand (COD), was incomplete under all conditions investigated. TiO2-mediated solar photocatalytic degradation of DCF and NPX mixtures produced 15 identifiable degradants corresponding to degradation of the individual NSAIDs, while two degradation products with much higher molecular weight than the parent NSAIDs were identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). This study showed that the solar light intensity and the water matrix appear to be the main factors influencing the overall performance of the solar photolysis and TiO2-mediated solar photocatalysis for degradation of DCF and NPX mixtures.

AB Previous studies showed that caffeine, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine were bioconcentrated by mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) from freshwater bodies directly affected by reclaimed water. To understand the uptake, depuration, and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) under the worst-case conditions, the authors exposed 84 mosquito fish to reclaimed water under static renewal for 7 d, followed by a 14-d depuration phase in clean water. Characterization of the exposure media revealed the presence of 26 pharmaceuticals, whereas only 5 pharmaceuticalscaffeine, diphenhydramine, diltiazem, carbamazepine, and ibuprofenwere present in the organisms after only 5 h of exposure. Caffeine, diltiazem, and carbamazepine were quickly taken up by mosquito fish following a similar uptake curve. Diphenhydramine and ibuprofen, on the other hand, were more gradually taken up by mosquito fish but were also eliminated fairly quickly, resulting in the 2 shortest depuration half-lives at 34 h and 32 h, respectively. For comparison, BCFs based on rate constants (BCFb), steady-state concentrations (BCFa), and saturation-state concentrations (BCFc) were calculated. Values of BCFb ranged from 0.23 to 29 and increased in the order of caffeine<carbamazepine<diltiazem<diphenhydramine<ibuprofen. Values of BCFa and BCFc ranged from 2.0 to 28 and increased in the order of carbamazepine<caffeine<diltiazem<diphenhydramine<ibuprofen. This is the first study using a nonartificial exposure-treated wastewater matrix to generate pharmacokinetic data for pharmaceutical mixtures in aquatic organisms.

AB Eighty-six water samples were collected in early 2009 from Costa Rican surface water and coastal locations for the analysis of 34 pharmaceutical and personal care product compounds (PPCPs). Sampling sites included areas receiving treated and untreated wastewaters, and urban and rural runoff. PPCPs were analyzed using a combination of solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The five most frequently detected compounds were doxycycline (77%), sulfadimethoxine (43%), salicylic acid (41%), triclosan (34%) and caffeine (29%). Caffeine had the maximum concentration of 1.1 mg L-1, possibly due to coffee bean production facilities upstream. Other compounds found in high concentrations include: doxycycline (74 mu g L-1), ibuprofen (37 mu g L-1), gemfibrozil (17 mu g L-1), acetominophen (13 mu g L-1) and ketoprofen (10 mu g L-1). The wastewater effluent collected from an oxidation pond had similar detection and concentrations of compounds compared to other studies reported in the literature. Waters receiving runoff from a nearby hospital showed higher concentrations than other areas for many PPCPs. Both caffeine and carbamazepine were found in low frequency compared to other studies, likely due to enhanced degradation and low usage, respectively. Overall concentrations of PPCPs in surface waters of Costa Rica are inline with currently reported occurrence data from around the world, with the exception of doxycycline. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although extensive research to date has focused on enhancing removal rates of antibiotics from municipal wastewaters, the transformation products formed by anaerobic treatment processes remain understudied. The present work aims to examine the possible roles that the different microbial communities of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) play in the transformation of antibiotics during wastewater treatment. As part of this work, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and ampicillin were added in separate stages to the influent of the AnMBR at incremental concentrations of 10, 50, and 250 mu g/L each. Antibiotic-specific transformation products detected during each stage, as identified by high resolution LC-MS, are reported herein. Results suggest that both isoxazole (sulfamethoxazole) and beta-lactam (ampicillin) ring opening could be facilitated by the AnMBR's bioprocess. Microbial community analysis results indicated that relative activity of the system's suspended biomass consistently shifted towards syntrophic groups throughout the duration of the experiment. Notable differences were also observed between the suspended biomass and the AnMBR's membrane biofilms. Membrane-attached biofilm communities showed high relative activities of several specific methanogenic (Methanothrix and Methanomethylovorans), syntrophic (Syntrophaceae), and sulfate-reducing (Desulfomonile) groups. Such groups have been previously identified as involved in the formation of the antibiotic degradation products observed in the effluent of the AnMBR. The activity of these communities within the biofilms likely confers certain advantages that aid in the biotransformation of the antibiotics tested.

AB The synergistic impact of salts and organic matter on adsorption of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by three types of biochar and an activated carbon was investigated using reclaimed water reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate and synthetic solutions spiked with target organic compounds and non-target water constituents (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, alkalinity, humic acid (HA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Kinetic modeling was used to better understand the adsorption process between the carbon adsorbents and pharmaceuticals and to elucidate the impact of water chemistry on pharmaceuticals adsorption. The adsorption capacity of pharmaceuticals by biochar was affected by their physicochemical properties including ash content, specific surface area, charge, pore volume, as well as hydrophobicity, pi-energy, and speciation of pharmaceuticals. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals in concentrate was pH-dependent, the kinetic rate constant increased with deceasing pH due to the electrical interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and adsorbents. High salinity and electrolyte ions in RO concentrate improved adsorption, whereas the presence of carbonate species, HA, and BSA hindered the removal of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. This study revealed the correlation of concentrate water quality on adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biochar and activated carbon. Biochar provides a promising alternative to activated carbon for removal of organic contaminants of emerging concerns in various wastewater and concentrate streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB CWPO has proved to be effective for the treatment of representative pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, metronidazole, diltiazem, trimethoprim and ranitidine) in different water matrices (ultrapure water, surface water, WWTP effluent and hospital wastewater). Complete removal of the pollutants and the aromatic intermediates was achieved using the stoichiometric dose of H2O2, a catalyst (Fe3O4/gamma-Al2O3) load of 2 g L-1, pH 3 and temperature of 50-75 degrees C. Accordingly, the ecotoxicity was reduced to negligible values. The degradation was faster when the pharmaceuticals were together, being the reaction time for the elimination of the most refractory species (metronidazole) shortened from 4h to 1 h. The mineralization of the drugs was fairly different, being the most reactive species those containing several aromatic rings (X-TOC similar to 80%) and the most refractory that bearing an imidazolium ring (X-TOC similar to 35%). The water matrix affected the kinetics of the process but in all cases complete conversion of the drugs was reached within 1 h. The presence of dissolved organic matter (surface water) seemed to promote drugs degradation while the occurrence of inorganic ions (real WTTP and hospital effluents) partially inhibited it due to scavenging effects. Remarkably, the process was successfully operated at the typical concentrations of main micropollutant sources (mu g L-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: The nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) is a process commonly used in wastewater treatment to remove ammonia. What is less clear is its ability to remove emerging organic contaminants. This study evaluated the potential of NTF to remove eight trace organic chemicals of concern (CoCs), with initial concentration of caffeine, bisphenol A, benzotriazole, trimethoprim and acetaminophen 1 mg L-1, atrazine 2 mg L-1, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol 5 mg L-1 and N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide 10 mg L-1, using a laboratory-scale NTF system. The impact of initial nitrification rate on chemicals' removal and the impact of chemicals on nitrification rate were investigated.
   RESULTS: The removal efficiency of a recirculating NTF for CoC removal was in the following order: caffeine (98%)> acetaminophen and N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (58.6%)> atrazine (48.7%)> 17 alpha NTF-ethynylestradiol (48.3%)> benzotriazole (42.8%)> bisphenol A (26.2%)> trimethoprim (17.9%). In NTFs, biodegradation was the dominant process. In this study, the removal of caffeine was found to be the most effective, and removal of trimethoprim the least. The removal efficiency of most chemicals increased, except for benzotriazole, with increasing nitrification. The presence of CoCs might negatively affect nitrification in NTFs.
   CONCLUSION: The research demonstrated that recirculating high rate NTF is potentially an efficient approach for removal of trace organic contaminants. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The river Meuse serves as a drinking-water source for more than 6 million people in France, Belgium, and The Netherlands. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides, both designed to be biologically active, are important classes of contaminants present in this river. The variation in the presence of pharmaceuticals in time and space in the Dutch part of the Meuse was studied using a multicomponent analytical method for pharmaceuticals combined with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of the results. Trends and variation in time in the presence of pharmaceuticals were investigated in a dead-end side stream of the Meuse that serves as an intake point for the production of drinking water, and 93% of the selected compounds were detected. Highest concentrations were found for the antidiabetic metformin. Furthermore, a spatial snapshot of the presence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides was made along the river Meuse. Principal component analysis was successfully applied to reveal that wastewater-treatment plant effluent and water composition at the Belgian border were the main factors determining which compounds are found at different locations. The Dutch part of the river basin appeared responsible for approximately one-half of the loads of pharmaceuticals and pesticides discharged by the Meuse into the North Sea. The present study showed that multicomponent monitoring in combination with principal component analysis is a powerful tool to provide insight into contamination patterns in surface waters.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids are pharmaceutical compounds prescribed in human and veterinary medicine as anti-inflammatory agents and have the potential to contaminate natural watersheds via inputs from wastewater treatment facilities and confined animal-feeding operations. Despite this, few studies have examined the effects of this class of chemicals on aquatic vertebrates. To generate data to assess potential risk to the aquatic environment, we used fathead minnow 21-d reproduction and 29-d embryolarvae assays to determine reproductive toxicity and early-life-stage effects of dexamethasone. Exposure to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L in the 21-d test caused reductions in fathead minnow fecundity and female plasma estradiol concentrations and increased the occurrence of abnormally hatched fry. Female fish exposed to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L also displayed a significant increase in plasma vitellogenin protein levels, possibly because of decreased spawning. A decrease in vitellogenin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in liver tissue from females exposed to the high dexamethasone concentration lends support to this hypothesis. Histological results indicate that a 29-d embryolarval exposure to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L caused a significant increase in deformed gill opercula. Fry exposed to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L for 29?d also exhibited a significant reduction in weight and length compared with control fry. Taken together, these results indicate that nonlethal concentrations of a model glucocorticoid receptor agonist can impair fish reproduction, growth, and development. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Activated carbon (AC) can be used for the removal of emerging contaminants (e.g., drugs) in water and wastewater treatment plants. In the present study, we investigated the performance of two ACs (from coconut shell and Pinnus sp.) in the adsorption of caffeine, carbamazepine, and ricobendazole considering the compounds separately and in combination in batch-scale experiments. The concentrations of the drugs were determined by a validated method using solid-phase extraction with on-line ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The most mesoporous AC provided higher drug removal. The kinetic data were described by the pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and Weber-Morris models, while the adsorption isotherms showed a better fit to the Freundlich model, indicative of multilayer adsorption. The Dubinin-Radushkevich model was used as a first approach to estimate the mean adsorption energy (E) and the results indicate that chemisorption governed the adsorption process, with E higher than 8 kJ mol(-1). In the multicomponent assays, the adsorption of caffeine showed the greatest hindrance caused by the presence of other drugs. Multicomponent assays are fundamental to evaluate the potential adsorption capacity in real water treatment plants. Our study suggests that drugs with different structures and physicochemical properties may interact differently with ACs, especially in multicomponent solutions, with important implications for the design (e.g., volumes and areas of treatment plants) and operation (e.g., water residence time) of the treatment plants.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides are still found in treated municipal effluent and are discharged into the natural environment. Natural direct photodegradation may be one pathway for removing these micropollutants in treatment processes such as free-water surface constructed wetlands (CW). This work was set out to evaluate the half-life (t(1/2)) of direct photodegradation of 36 micropollutants under controlled conditions of light exposure close to solar radiation. The results allowed to classify the micropollutants into three groups (fast, medium and slow). Seven micropollutants were classified in the fast group with t(1/2) between 0.05 h and 0.79 h, 24 in the medium group with t(1/2) between 5.3 h and 49.7 h, and five in the slow group with t(1/2) between 56 h and 118 h. The t(1/2) values obtained in laboratory were compared with those from a CW receiving treated wastewater. Correction factors were calculated to adjust the in situ data for the light intensity in laboratory and improved the correspondence especially for the micropollutants of the fast and medium groups. Finally, an innovative method based on statistical tests highlighted the chemical functions characteristic of micropollutants sensitive to photodegradation (OH-(CO)-O-=, (CN)-N-=-O-, =N-OH, -CH=N, -O-(PO)-O-=, -(CC)-C-=-) and with low sensitivity (-O-R, -Cl).

AB The abatements of 89 pharmaceuticals in secondary effluent by ozonation and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process were investigated. Based on the results, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed to explore relationship between chemical structure of pharmaceuticals and their oxidation rates by ozone. The orthogonal projection to latent structure (OPLS) method was used to identify relevant chemical descriptors of the pharmaceuticals, from large number of descriptors, for model development. The resulting QSAR model, based on 44 molecular descriptors related to the ozone reactivity of the pharmaceuticals, showed high goodness of fit(R-2 = 0.963) and predictive power (Q(2) = 0.84). After validation, the model was used to predict second-order rate constants of 491 pharmaceuticals of special concern (kO3) including the 89 studied experimentally. The predicted kO3 values and experimentally determined pseudo-first order rate constants of the pharmaceuticals' abatement during ozonation (k(OZ)) and the E-peroxone process (k(EP)) were then used to assess effects of switching from ozonation to the E-peroxone process on removal of these pharmaceuticals. The results indicate that the E-peroxone process could accelerate the abatement of pharmaceuticals with relatively low ozone reactivity (kO3< similar to 102M-1.s-1) than ozonation (3-10 min versus 5-20 min). The validated QSAR model predicted 66 pharmaceuticals to be highly O-3-resistant. The developed QSAR model may be used to estimate the ozone reactivity of pharmaceuticals of diverse chemistry and thus predict their fate in ozone-based processes.

AB The introduction of pharmaceuticals into agricultural lands from the application of biosolids and animal manure, and irrigation with treated wastewater has led to concern for animal and human health after the ingestion of pharmaceutical-tainted agricultural products. In this study, the uptake and accumulation of cephalexin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was compared in three common vegetables (lettuce, celery, and radish) grown in nutrient solution for 144 h. During the uptake experiments, cephalexin concentration in the nutrient solution decreased in the order of radish > celery > lettuce, while the accumulation of cephalexin in vegetable roots followed the rank of lettuce > celery > radish. The accumulation of cephalexin was below the limit of detection in radish roots. No accumulation of ceph-alexinwas observed in the shoots of all three vegetables. The behaviors of cephalexin in vivo were further elucidated using in vitro measurements of cephalexin sorption by vegetable roots and transformation in plant enzyme extracts. The affinity of cephalexin to lettuce > celery > radish roots, and the respective sorption coefficients of 687, 303, and 161 mL g(-1), coupled to the transformation of cephalexin in root enzyme extracts with estimated reaction rate constants of 0.020, 0.027 and 0.024 hr(-1) for lettuce, celery and radish, could help elucidate the accumulation observed in the in vivo experiments. Overall, sorption by plant roots (affinity) and reaction with plant enzymes could collectively influence the uptake and accumulation of cephalexin in vegetables. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background The high consumption of acetaminophen leads to high concentrations in surface water causing impacts on aquatic organisms, which is highlighting the need for investigation of alternative water and wastewater treatments. Therefore, the present study objective was to evaluate the adsorption capacity of acetaminophen onto Moringa oleifera Lam. seed husks after chemical and thermal treatment. Results The characterization of the adsorbent revelaed heterogeneous morphology with the presence of micro- and mesopores. Adsorption studies showed that the adsorption did not altered between pH 3 and 9, and that there was no significant effect of the ionic strength, indicating that the mechanism does not involve electrostatic interactions. In fact, Fourier transform infrard spectra showed that acetaminophen was adsorbed by hydrogen bonds and pi-stacking. The kinetic data were adjusted to the pseudo-first-order model, indicating an equilibrium time of 18 h. The equilibrium study showed that adsorption occurred in a monolayer and was favoured by the increase in temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity was 17.48 mg g(-1), at 318 K, higher than some capacities found in the literature. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous, endothermic and physical. Conclusions The characteristics and results found compared to the recent literature verified the possibility of applying this residue as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of acetaminophen.

AB Background: The occurrence of emerging pollutants like pharmaceuticals and related compounds in the aquatic and terrestrial environments is of increasing concern. Ciprofloxacin is one of the pharmaceuticals which is active against a wide range of bacteria. The main objective of this research is to develop a simple method for the extraction and determination of ciprofloxacin residues in environmental water samples.
   Results: A salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) method for the determination of ciprofloxacin in water samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was developed. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.1-100 mu g/L with coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.9976. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method were 0.075 and 0.25 mu g/L, respectively. The reproducibility in terms of relative standard deviation (% RSD) was less than 10%. The applicability of the developed method was investigated by analyzing tap water, bottled mineral water and waste water and demonstrated satisfactory recoveries in the ranges of 86.4-120%.
   Conclusion: The method offered a number of features including wide linear range, good recovery, short analysis time, simple operation process and environmental friendly. The developed method can be utilized as an attractive alternative for the determination of ciprofloxacin residues in environmental water matrices.

AB With increasing problems of drug abuse worldwide, aquatic ecosystems are contaminated by human pharmaceuticals from the discharge of hospital or municipal effluent. However, ecotoxicity data and related toxic mechanism for neuroactive controlled or illicit drugs are still lacking, so assessing the associated hazardous risk is difficult. This study aims to investigate the behavioral changes, oxidative stress, gene expression and neurotoxic or apoptosis effect(s) in larvae of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) with environmentally relevant exposures of ketamine (KET) solutions for 1-14 days. KET exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (0.004 mu M) to 40 mu M conferred specific patterns in larval swimming behavior during 24 h. At 14 days, such exposure induced dose- and/or time-dependent alteration on reactive oxygen species induction, the activity of antioxidants catalase and superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and malondialdehyde contents in fish bodies. KET-induced oxidative stress disrupted the expression of acetylcholinesterase and p53-regulated apoptosis pathways and increased caspase expression in medaka larvae. The toxic responses of medaka larvae, in terms of chemical effects, were qualitatively analogous to those of zebrafish and mammals. Our results implicate a toxicological impact of waterborne KET on fish development and human health, for potential ecological risks of directly releasing neuroactive drugs-containing wastewater into the aquatic environment.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been recently shown to exert phytotoxic effects. The present study explores the uptake, systemic translocation, and abiotic stress responses and detoxification mechanisms induced by the exposure of alfalfa plants grown in sand under greenhouse conditions to four common, individually applied PhACs (10 mu g L-1) (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, 17a-ethinylestradiol) and their mixture. Stress physiology markers (lipid peroxidation, proline, H2O2 and NO content, antioxidant activity assays) and gene expression levels of key plant detoxification components (including glutathione S-transferases, GST7, GST17; superoxide dismutases, CuZnSOD, FeSOD; protonpump, H+-ATP, and cytochromec oxidase, CytcOx), were evaluated. PhACs were detected in significantly higher concentrations in roots compared with leaves. Stress related effects, manifested via membrane lipid peroxidation and oxidative burst, were local (roots) rather than systemic (leaves), and exacerbated when the tested PhACs were applied in mixture. Systemic accumulation of H2O2 in leaves suggests its involvement in signal transduction and detoxification responses. Increased antioxidant enzymatic activities, as well as upregulated transcript levels of GST7, GST17, H+-ATPase and CytcOx, propose their role in the detoxification of the selected PhACs in plants. The current findings provide novel biochemical and molecular evidence highlighting the studied PhACs as an emerging abiotic stress factor, and point the need for further research on wastewater flows under natural agricultural environments.

AB Psychoactive drugs have emerged as contaminants over the last few decades. These drugs are frequently prescribed and poorly eliminated by wastewater treatment plants, and many are present at non-negligible concentrations in surface waters. Several studies have investigated the non-target organism toxicity of one such drug, oxazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic frequently detected in rivers. However, very little is known about the impact of this drug on reproduction. We investigated the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of oxazepam on Radix balthica, a freshwater gastropod widespread in Europe. We identified the reproductive organs of Radix balthica. We then exposed this gastropod to oxazepam for two months and assessed several reproductive parameters, from reproductive organ status to behavioral parameters. We found that adults exposed to 10 mu g/L oxazepam display an increase in the density of spermatozoa, and that adults exposed to 0.8 mu g/L oxazepam displayed a decrease in the number of eggs per egg mass over time. By contrast, oxazepam had no effect on shell length, the size of male reproductive organs or social interactions. Finally, a locomotor activity analysis showed the distance covered over time decreased in all conditions of exposure to oxazepam, potentially reflecting a disturbance of exploratory activity. These results shed light on the effects of oxazepam on the reproduction of a non-target freshwater mollusk.

AB Membrane filtration using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient effluent polishing step at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the removal of selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (>60%) removed BP3, UV-329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (<20%) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30-50% of COD, 80-95% of TP, up to 30% of TN and NH4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment.

In the first step, their degradation under different experimental conditions (applied molar ratio of NaOCl and the target contaminant (m.r.), reaction's contact time, pH value of the reaction's solution and the influence of total suspended solids (TSS) presence) was investigated and their removal kinetics parameters (k(obs) and t(1/2)) were determined. In the second step, LC-QTOFMS/MS was used for the detection and identification of transformation products (TPs) formed during chlorination, through the application of suspect and non-target screening approaches. Four and five TPs of XTRi and 2-amino-BTH, respectively, were detected and tentatively identified, while 1-H-BTRi was proven to be formed by the chlorination of 1-OH-BTRi. Moreover, since the identified TPs were also detected in spiked wastewater samples, after lab-scale chlorination experiments, toxicity assessment was carried out by ECOSAR calculations for the environmental relevance of their occurrence. The proposed chlorinated TPs were proven to be more toxic than their parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly fluorescent carbon nanodots are promising fluorophores for biochemical, pharmaceutical, and environmental analysis due to their facile preparation, biocompatibility, tunability, and low-cost precursors. The selectivity improvements towards an environmentally interesting analyte are challenging in analytical chemistry. Herein, a surface modification using a mixed solvent was used to prepare fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) as selective fluorophores for the detection of mercury ions (Hg2+). The solvothermal method was used for the fabrication of 4-6 nm CDs using xylose as a carbon precursor and ethanol-H2O as a mixed solvent. Moreover, optical, morphological, and surface characterizations were thoroughly conducted. The fluorescence emission of the CDs was selectively quenched after the addition of mercury ions and restored by the addition of cysteine. The CDs were successfully used for the quantitative detection of Hg2+ ions without interferences. The fabricated nanoprobe exhibited the good linearity range of 50-800 nM (R-2 = 0.9947), and a low detection limit down to 10 nM for Hg2+ was calculated. The selectivity experiments showed that the fluorescent probe was specific for Hg2+ even in the presence of interferences. The CDs were stable under rigorous conditions such as extreme ionic strength and low and high pH values. In addition, the CDs were photo- and thermostable; this made the CDs a promising fluorophore for the fabrication of a rugged and robust nanoprobe towards the detection of Hg2+. The Hg2+ ions in tap and wastewater were determined quantitatively with statistically good spike recoveries and standard deviations.

AB Oxidative degradation and mineralization of the antifungal drug Nystatin (NYS) was investigated using photochemical advanced oxidation processes UV-C irradiation (280-100nm), H2O2 photolysis (UV/H2O2), and photo-Fenton (UV/H2O2/Fe3+). The effect of operating parameters such as [H2O2], [Fe3+], and [NYS] initial concentrations on degradation efficiency and mineralization ability of different processes was comparatively examined in order to optimize the processes. Photo-Fenton was found to be the most efficient process attaining complete degradation of 0.02mM (19.2mgL(-1)) NYS at 2min and a quasi-complete mineralization (97%) of its solution at 5h treatment while UV/H2O2 and UV-C systems require significantly more time for complete degradation and lower mineralization degrees. The degradation and mineralization kinetics were affected by H2O2 and Fe3+ initial concentration, the optimum dosages being 4mM and 0.4mM, respectively. Consumption of H2O2 during photo-Fenton treatment is very fast during the first 30min leading to the appearance of two stages in the mineralization. The evolution of toxicity of treated solutions was assessed and confirmed the effectiveness of photo-Fenton process for the detoxification of NYS solution at the end of treatment. Application to real wastewater from pharmaceutical industry containing the target molecule NYS showed the effectiveness of photo-Fenton process since it achieved 92% TOC removal rate at 6-h treatment time.

AB N, S-doped TiO2 (NST), N, S-doped ZnO (NSZ) and their composite with chitosan (NST/CS, NSZ/CS) were synthesized by sol gel-hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were characterized using XRD, FTIR, TEM and BET techniques. These photocatalysts were used for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline under visible light irradiation. At screening test, NST/CS had the highest tetracycline degradation efficiency of 91% for duration of 20 min under visible light. The blending of chitosan with NST increases the rate of photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline about 2 times. A detail characterization including HRTEM, SEM, EDS and DRS were conducted for NST/CS, the most active photocatalyst in this study. Photocatalytic activity test was conducted by varying tetracycline concentration, irradiation time, catalyst's concentration and pH using response surface methodology to find out the optimum condition for photocatalytic activity. The reusability of as-synthesized NST/CS was assessed which due to its high recoverability can be applied as an effective catalyst for degradation of organic substances in water and wastewater especially for degradation of emerging pollutants such pharmaceutical pollutants. The results from this work show a promising material for local authorities and pharmaceutical facilities to use for the treatment of pharmaceutical pollutants and tetracycline removal in water resource.

AB Ternary extractive distillation is a green and sustainable separation process for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing methanol/acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water azeotropes that achieves the recovery of the acetonitrile and methanol solvents. A novel sequential iterative optimization methodology is proposed and the isovolatility curves of systems at different pressures are analyzed in this work to investigate the effect of the operating pressure on the ternary extractive distillation process. Four optimization procedures with different conditions of pressure and limits for the use of cold utilities were carried out. The optimization results showed that the optimal pressures of the first column and the third column are related to the top vapor that can be condensed by chiller water and cooling water, respectively, and the pressure of the second column is related to the effect of preheating on the third column. The ternary extractive distillation process with optimal operating pressure shows 60.1% energy cost savings and 47.0% total annual cost savings compared with the optimal process operating at atmospheric pressure. The proposed optimization method has the advantages of automatic optimization with a smaller number of simulator runs, providing a new solution for the simulator-based process optimization. The investigation of the operating pressure effect provides additional insight for the design and optimization of ternary extractive distillation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB New robust correlation models for ozonation, based on UVA(254) and fluorescence surrogate parameters and developed considering kinetic information, have been applied at pilot-scale. This model framework is validated with the aim for operators to control the ozone dose for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in effluents from full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants. The inflected correlation model between ATrOCs and the surrogates predicts the removal of TrOCs (based on statistical evidence) solely using the 2nd order reaction rate constant with ozone (k(o3)) and in a more adequate manner than similar single correlation models. This allows the use of this new model for current and future TrOCs under investigation which is highly interesting when imposed discharge limits might include more and other TrOCs in future. The use of UVA254 might be preferable at the current timing for online monitoring of TrOC abatement as the model showed a good predictive power (based on statistical evidence and visual confirmation). Reliable online sensors are more widespread (and commercially) available compared to fluorescence sensors which are still under development, with the exception of a few examples. Nevertheless, the data processing of the fluorescence signals, isolating the different intensities associated with moieties reacting similarly to ozone might even increase the predictive power, given the lower degree of interference (i.e. less scattering).

AB Venlafaxine is an antidepressant drug that has been detected in municipal wastewater effluents at low pg/L. concentrations. To assess the potential of this compound to affect the survival, development and reproductive capacity of fish, we exposed fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) over a full lifecycle in a flow-through system to nominal venlafaxine concentrations of 0.88, 8.8, and 88 mu g/L. Mean measured venlafaxine concentrations in these treatments were 1.0, 93 and 75 mu g/L. During the 167-168 d exposure, no significant changes were observed in survival, or the weights and lengths of fathead minnows. At maturity, there were no significant differences relative to controls in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in the venlafaxine exposed male or female fish. Fathead minnows from the highest venlafaxine treatment (i.e. 88 mu g/L) produced 46% more eggs per female than control fish (p = 0.031). Egg quality, % fertilization, % hatching, and % deformities in Fl fry were unaffected by exposure of the parent fish to venlafaxine at any of the test concentrations. Venlafaxine exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 0.88 and 8.8 mu g/L.) caused no adverse effects in fathead minnows. This study is the first to assess the potential for effects in fish exposed to the antidepressant venlafaxine over a full lifecycle. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Diclofenac represents one of the most common pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. To enhance the removal of diclofenac from water, a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was introduced into a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF)-67. CTAB is added originally to minimize the use of ligands during the synthesis of ZIF-67; however CTAB present in ZIF-67 also increases the surface charge and thus enhances the adsorption capacity up to 10 times compared to CTAB-free ZIF-67. Factors influencing the diclofenac adsorption are investigated, including CTAB loading, temperature and pH. A loading of 0.274 mol-CTAB/mol-Co2+ is suggested as an optimal loading to prepare a relatively efficient CTAB-ZIF-67, while over loading of CTAB could not fully incorporate CTAB into ZIF-67. In view of the diclofenac adsorption kinetics and isotherm, the adsorption of diclofenac to CTAB-ZIF-67 was considered to involve a strong affinity between diclofenac and CTAB-ZIF-67 owing to the electrostatic attraction between the carboxylic acid of diclofenac and the quaternary amine of CTAB. Considering that the removal of diclofenac from urine is of great interest, separation of diclofenac from urine using CTAB-ZIF-67 was evaluated and also employed to investigate the effect of co-existing ions. We also determined the desorption behavior of diclofenac from CTAB-ZIF-67 to provide insight for the recyclability of CTAB-ZIF-67 for diclofenac adsorption.

AB The discovery of pharmaceuticals in effluent from wastewater treatment plants and drug manufacturing facilities and in receiving waters has raised environmental concern. Because these compounds are ending up in the environment, it is important to investigate the effects of these compounds on wildlife as well as humans. The present study used a fish model to investigate the endocrine-disrupting effects of spironolactone (SPL), an aldosterone antagonist used as a diuretic, but which also exhibits antiandrogenic effects in humans. A dose-response study measured the effects of SPL on anal fin ray elongation, an androgen-dependent secondary sex trait, and expression of the vitellogenin gene, an estrogen-dependent trait, in female western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. Fish were exposed to SPL in the water for 35 d at four nominal concentrations: 10, 100, 250, and 500 nM (4.2, 41.7, 104.1, and 208.3 mu g/L, respectively) via the static renewal method. Masculinization of females, as evidenced by development of an elongated and modified anal fin, was observed in the fish exposed to the three highest concentrations. Anal fin elongation was observed in the group exposed to the lowest SPL concentration, but without the development of a tip apparatus. These results confirm the results of a preliminary study that, in contrast to antiandrogenic effects seen in humans, SPL has androgenic and/or antiestrogenic activity in a fish. Environ.

AB Much attention has been devoted recently to the fate of pharmaceutically active compounds such as tetracycline antibiotics in soil and water. Tetracycline (TC) biodegradability by activated sludge derived from membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating swine wastewater via CO(2)-evolution was evaluated by means of modified Sturm test, which was also used to evaluate its toxicity on carbon degradation. The impact of tetracycline on a semi-industrial MBR process was also examined and confronted to lab-scale experiments. After tetracycline injection in the pilot, no disturbance was detected on the elimination of organic matters and ammonium (nitrification), reaching after injection 88% and 99% respectively; only denitrification was slightly affected. Confirming the ruggedness and the superiority of membrane bioreactors over conventional bioreactors, no toxicity was observed at the considered level of TC in the pilot (20 mg TOC L(-1)), while at lab-scale sodium benzoate biodegradation was completely inhibited from 10 mg TOC L(-1) TC. The origin of the activated sludge showed a significant impact on the performances, since the ultimate biodegradation was in the range -50% to -53% for TC concentrations in the range 10-20 mg TOCL(-1) with conventional bioreactor sludge and increased to 18% for 40 mg TOCL(-1) of TC with activated sludge derived from the MBR pilot. This confirmed the higher resistance of activated sludge arising from membrane bioreactor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A combined strategy of a photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) was evaluated for total C and N removal from a synthetic wastewater containing 200mgL(-1) of the antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Photo-Fenton reaction was performed with two different H2O2 concentrations (300 and 400mgL(-1)) and 10mgL(-1) of Fe2+. The pre-treated effluents with the antibiotic intermediates as sole carbon source, together with a nutrients solution, were used as feed for the biological reactor. The SBBR was operated under aerobic conditions to mineralize the organic carbon and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was optimized down to 8 hours. Then, an anoxic denitrification stage of 24 hours of HRT was added right after the aerobic stage of the same duration in order to remove the NO3- generated along the chemical-biological treatment. TOC, COD and SMX concentrations together with O-2 uptake rate (OUR) profiles were monitored in purpose of assessing the performance of the system. NO3-, NH4+ and total N concentrations were analyzed to find out the fate of N contained in the initial SMX molecule. A start up strategy resulted in the correct formation of a biofilm over the volcanic support. The total TOC removals achieved with the combination of the chemical and the biological processes were 75.7 and 87.7% for the low and the high H2O2 concentration pretreatments respectively. Practically all N present in the SMX solution was eliminated in the SBBR when the aerobic-anoxic strategy was used.

AB The occurrence and persistence of pharmaceutical products (PPs) in the environment have recently been well-documented and are a major concern for public health. Their incidence in aquatic ecosystems is the result of their direct release without any prior treatment or insufficient wastewater treatment. Therefore, an efficient and safe posttreatment process for removing PPs must be developed. In this study, we focused on the ability of photocatalysis or combined photocatalysis and biodegradation to effectively and safely remove diclofenac (DCF) and its by-products from water. The heterogeneous photocatalysis system was based on bio-sourced activated carbon obtained from Argania spinosa tree nutshells and Degussa P25 titanium dioxide (ACP-TiO2), and biodegradation involved Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Toxicity tests were conducted with zebrafish embryos to evaluate the applicability of the treatment processes. The results showed that photocatalytic treatment with 0.1 mg/L of ACP-TiO2 9% for 7.5 h is sufficient to eliminate DCF (50 mg L-1) and its by-products from water. Low levels of malformation (<20%) were detected in zebrafish embryos treated with photocatalyzed DCF solutions at 1, 5, and 7 mg L-1 after 4 days of exposure. After 3 h of incubation, P. aeruginosa was found to reduce the toxicity of DCF (10 mg L-1) photocatalyzed for 2 and 4 h. Additional studies should be conducted to elucidate the biodegradation mechanism.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is a membrane technology that separates dissolved species from water. RO has been applied for the removal of chemical contaminants from water and is employed in wastewater reclamation to provide an additional barrier to improve the removal of trace organic contaminants. The presence of a wide variety of influent chemical contaminants and the insufficient rejection of low molecular weight neutral chemicals by RO calls for the need to develop a comprehensive model that predicts the rejection of various chemicals in RO. Yet the role of the interaction between neutral organic compounds and a RO membrane, and how the functional groups of organic compounds affect the interaction have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we first constructed a molecular model for a reference polyamide (PA) membrane. We then investigated the impact of explicit water molecules and PA membrane functionality on the membrane structure using quantum mechanical calculations. We examined solvent-membrane interactions and then solvent-membrane-solute interactions using two neutral test solutes, arsenic and boron, by comparing the theoretically calculated aqueous-phase free energies of interaction with their experimental values. Finally, the validated PA membrane model was used to calculate the free energies of interaction for a wide variety of organic compounds such as haloalkanes, haloalkenes, alkylbenzenes and halobenzenes, which correlated with the experimentally obtained mass transfer coefficients. The correlation indicates that the interaction between organic compounds and PA membranes plays a critical role in the rejection mechanism.

AB In this work, g-C3N4 thin layer @ CeO2 core-shell composite photocatalyst was synthesized by simple hydro thermal and in situ synthesis method for the first time, and it was combined with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to degrade the antibiotic doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) under visible light. A series of techniques were employed to characterize the as-synthesized materials. XRD patterns indicated that the samples were successfully synthesized. SEM and TEM images displayed the core-shell microstructure of the as-synthesized composite. The surface element composition and the valence states of the samples were characterized by XPS. The optical properties of the materials were determined by DRS and FTIR. The results of FTIR and XPS indicated that strong interactions between g-C3N4 and CeO2 had formed during the synthesis process. Photodegradation experiments showed that the addition of H2O2 can greatly enhance the photocatalytic degradation rate of DOX. Active species trapping experiments and ESR experiments demonstrated that superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and holes (O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and h(+)) played major roles in the photocatalytic process. Finally, a possible degradation mechanism was proposed. This work has synthesized a new core-shell structure system for g-C3N4 and CeO2 composite photocatalyst and provides a solution for the purification of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Environmental pollution by neuroactive pharmaceuticals from wastewater discharge is a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. However, the ecotoxicologic effect of waterborne abused drugs remains unclear. Embryos of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to aqueous solutions of 2 hallucinogenic drugs, ketamine (MET) and methamphetamine (MET) (0.004-40 mu M) to assess developmental toxicity, oxidative stress and behavioral alteration in early life stages. The environmentally relevant concentration (0.004 mu M) of both MET and MET significantly delayed blood circulation and hatching time in embryos and altered larval swimming behavior (e.g., maximum velocity and relative turn angle). KET and MET induced similar oxidative stress responses in embryos, which were unrecoverable in hatchlings in drug-free solutions. Early life exposure to the 2 drugs conferred distinct patterns in larval locomotion: KET induced hyperactivity and a less tortuous swimming path, but MET-treated larvae showed hypoactivity and a clockwise swimming direction at high doses. The alteration in locomotor responses were generally similar in mammals and zebrafish. We report sensitive biomarkers (e.g., heartbeat, hatching and swimming behavior) by developmental stage of medaka that reflect environmentally relevant exposures of abused drugs. They could be useful for ecological risk assessment of waterborne neuroactive drugs. The toxicity results implicate a potential ecotoxicological impact of controlled or abused drugs on fish development and populations in aquatic environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide Characterization Factors (CFs) for the toxicity related impact categories in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). The CFs already available were updated whereas others were implemented for the first time by means of USEtox and USES-LCA 2.0 methodologies. The list of PPCPs includes human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity for both models whereas terrestrial and marine ecotoxicity were assessed with USES-LCA 2.0. Moreover, all the available emission compartments were considered for the calculation. The resulting CFs were subjected to a sensitivity analysis and results determined that human toxicological and ecotoxicological effects (ED50 and avlogEC50, respectively) as well as degradation rate in water were the most sensitive parameters. The calculated CFs were used in the environmental assessment of a Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen removal Over Nitrite (CANON) pilot plant. PPCPs were found to have a major impact on freshwater ecotoxicity, accounting for 81% or 97% of the total impact with USES-LCA 2.0 and USEtox, respectively. Moreover, a more precise determination of human toxicity was obtained after updating CFs values calculated with USEtox, with contributions up to 50% of the total impact. Therefore, the provision of new and updated CFs allows a more accurate environmental assessment of processes where PPCPs are present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel nitrogen-doped carbon dot (NCD) decorated onto bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) and carbon nitride (gC3N4) (NCD@BMCN) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) under the visible light irradiation. The homogeneous deposition of 10-20 nm NCD onto the surface of BMCN increases the specific surface area and photocurrent density, which can facilitate the good charge transfer efficiency for the enhanced photodegradation of CIP. The NCD@BMCN exhibits excellent visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity over CIP degradation and the pseudo-first-order rate constants are in the range of 0.036-0.13 min-1, which are dependent on initial pH, photocatalyst dosage and existence of anions. The indirect Z-scheme mechanism for CIP photodegradation with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and superoxide radicals (center dot O2- ) as the dominant reactive species is also proposed, in which NCD plays a role as the mediator to transfer electrons from the conduction band of Bi2MoO6 to the valence band of g-C3N4. Moreover, the NCD@BMCN photocatalyst exhibits good stability and reusability after five consecutive cycles of photodegradation. Results have demonstrated that the NCD@BMCN is a promising Z-scheme photocatalyst for the degradation of CIP, which can be further explored to synthesize a rapid, productive and low-cost NCD@BMCN nanocomposite for the treatment of pharmaceutical-contaminated water and wastewater.

AB The increasing use of pharmaceuticals in human and veterinary medicine, along with their poor removal rates at wastewater treatment facilities is resulting in the chronic release of pharmaceutically-active compounds (PhACs) into the marine environment, where they pose a threat to non-target organisms. A useful approach, as applied in the current study for assessing the effects of PhACs on non-target organisms, is the proteomic approach: the large-scale study of an organism's proteins. Using 'shotgun' proteomics, we identified differentially-expressed proteins based on peptide fragments in the solitary ascidian, Herdmania momus, following a 14-day laboratory experimental exposure to the PhAC carbamazepine (CBZ), an anticonvulsant and antidepressant medication, frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Individuals were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations: 5 or 10 mu g/L of CBZ, in addition to a control treatment. Out of 199 identified proteins, 24 were differentially expressed (12%) between the treatment groups, and thus can potentially be developed as biomarkers for CBZ contamination. Ascidians' phylogenetic position within the closest sister group to vertebrates presents an advantage in examining the pathological effects of PhACs on vertebrate-related organs and systems. Together with the world-wide distribution of some model ascidian species, and their ability to flourish in pristine and polluted sites, they provide a promising tool through which to study the extent and effects of PhAC contamination on marine organisms.

AB Worldwide, the aquatic environment is contaminated by micro-pollutants, such as ingredients of personal care products, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. This contamination is one of the major environmental issues of global concern. Adsorption is one of approach, which has been most extensively discussed within recent years for the reduction of the input of micro-pollutants into the environment. In the present study, the natural clay classified as Na-montmorillonite, was characterized and tested for its potential to remove four model compounds representing different polarity and ionizability: i) diatrizoic acid (DAT), ii) iopamidol (lop), iii) metformin (MTF), and iv) carbamazepine (CBZ). The adsorption efficiency of clay was evaluated by initial compound concentration, effect of pH, contact time and temperature. The results indicated that clay was able to remove the pharmaceuticals from aqueous medium with an efficiency of 70% for CBZ and MTF. In contrast, clay showed a lower removal of 30% for DAT and no removal for LOP. The results indicate that clay could rapidly and efficiently reduce the concentration of CBZ and MTF, which could provide a solution to remove some substances, without undesirable byproduct generation. However, this study clearly demonstrated that removal rates strongly depend on the compound. Albeit chemical structure may play a role for the different degree of removal, this study could not completely explain the sorption mechanism between sorbent-sorbate interactions.

AB In this study, the simultaneous degradation of antibiotics (ampicillin, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (diclofenac and salicylic acid)) including the total organic carbon abatement by solar photoelectro-Fenton process was assessed. Eight liters of solution containing the mixture of the five pharmaceuticals in 1 mmol L-1 Fe2+, 0.05 mol L-1 Na2SO4 at pH 3 and 35 degrees C were electrolyzed applying different current densities (j = 10, 25, and 50 mA cm(-2)) in a solar-electrochemical pilot plant. The pilot plant was equipped with an electrochemical filter press cell with a dimensionally stable anode (DSA type) and an air-diffusion cathode coupled to a solar photoreactor exposed directly to sunlight radiation. All pharmaceuticals were degraded during the first 10 min. A TOC removal efficiency of 99.2% after 100 min of treatment with an energy consumption of 534.23 kW h (kg(TOC))(-1) and 7.15 kW h m(-3) was achieved. The pharmaceutical concentration decay followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The specific energy per unit of mass of ampicillin, diclofenac, salicylic acid, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline was obtained at 11.73, 19.56, 35.2, 11.73, and 39.32 kW h (kg(PD))(-1) for ampicillin, diclofenac, salicylic acid, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline, respectively. With our results, we demonstrated that SPEF is an emerging technology for the treatment of this type of pollutants in short time.

AB In this study, photocatalytic degradation of trimethoprim by synthesized S-TiO2 and Ru/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts was investigated. Both photocatalysts have been immobilized on circular aluminum plates by polysiloxane to investigate their reusability performance. The morphology and structure of the catalysts were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The photocatalytic experiments were carried out using suspended and attached catalysts using a metal halide lamp as a light source. The degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100% and 98.2% at catalyst dose of 0.5 g/L, pH of 7.0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended Ru/WO3/ZrO2 and S-TiO2, respectively. After immobilization of the catalysts on the aluminum plates, the removal efficiencies in five repetitive cycles were 98%, 96.9%, 96.8%, 93.2% and 83.4% using Ru/WO3/ZrO2, while they were 88.6%, 86%, 84%, 78% and 75.9% in case of S-TiO2. The irradiation time of each cycle was 240 min, and the initial trimethoprim concentration was 10 mg/L. The degradation rates of trimethoprim were estimated in the case of suspended and immobilized STiO2 and Ru/WO3/ZrO2. The radical trapping experiments using various scavengers revealed that superoxide radicals, holes and hydroxyl radicals all participated in the photo-degradation process. Furthermore, the transformation products generated during the trimethoprim oxidation process were detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy to identify the possible degradation pathways.

AB Sequential biofiltration (SBF) has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to achieve enhanced biological removal of various trace organic compounds (TOrCs) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents by establishing oxic and carbon-limited conditions. This study investigated options to further advance the feasibility of SBF systems by reducing empty bed contact times (EBCTs). Additional experiments were conducted to investigate the pre-treatment of WWTP effluent by coagulation as an option to further decrease the organic carbon availability during SBF. Results indicated that an EBCT reduction in the first filter stage from 90 to 45 and 30 min adversely affected process performance regarding the removal of organic bulk parameters and several TOrCs over short-term. However, after an extended adaptation period of ten weeks comparable performance was observed in two SBF systems with first stage filters operated at EBCTs of 90 and 45 min. The pretreatment of secondary effluent by coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation was not found to enhance the performance of an SBF system despite substantial removal of organic bulk parameters during the pretreatment. However, despite the vast removal of total phosphorous during coagulation, nutrient limitation was not found to adversely affect the biological performance of the subsequent SBF system.

AB In this study, the removal of selected pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, chlorpheniramine maleate, and paracetamol from water using natural Jordanian zeolite was studied. The influence of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and initial pharmaceutical concentration on the adsorption process was investigated using batch and column methods. The optimal pH for the removal of all selected pharmaceuticals was found to be 2 except for diclofenac sodium where the optimal pH was 6. The optimum adsorption time was found to be 80 min. The percentage removal increased as the initial concentration of the pharmaceuticals increased from 10.0 to 50.0 mg/L except for indomethacin where the removal decreased as the initial concentration increased. After optimization, the highest removal was found to be 88.3, 30.1, 59.0, 85.8, and 12.7% for ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, chlorpheniraminemaleate, and paracetamol, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to evaluate the adsorption efficiencies of the investigated pharmaceuticals. The results demonstrated that Langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data for diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and paracetamol with adsorption capacity (Q(max)) of 4.8, 26.6, and 55.6 mg/g, respectively, whereas Freundlich isotherm fits the experimental data for both ibuprofen and chlorpheniramine maleate. Continues flow experiment was performed on ibuprofen under constant influent concentration and fixed flow rate. Equal eluted fractions of 100 mL were collected and analyzed for ibuprofen content. The results indicated that percentage removal of ibuprofen on zeolite was found to be the highest after fraction 9 with 78% removal.

AB Synthetic dyes are extensively used in textile dyeing, paper printing, color photography, and the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and leather industries. Most synthetic dyes are toxic and highly resistant to removal due to their complex chemical structures. There is a need for investigation of the biological treatment of synthetic dyes at a low cost and in the shortest possible time; synthetic dyes are used especially in the dye and textile industries and are an important polluting agent in the wastewater dumped into the environment by these industries. White rot fungus contains a variety of extracellular enzymes, and these enzymes are used for biological degradation of organic matter. The aim of the present work is to evaluate removal of the textile dye Turquoise Blue HFG by Coprinus plicatilis. Coprinus plicatilis was able to enzymatically decolorize 100% of the dye (dye concentration 10.0 and 25.0mg L-1). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric analyses, before and after decolorization, suggest that decolorization was due to biodegradation. There was an attempt to identify metabolites with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the end of the decolorization process. These results indicate that the samples did not include any detectable metabolite. Therefore, this fungus can be used as an economical and eco-friendly tool to minimize the pollution by industries to a significant extent.

AB The use of cytotoxic substances, such as 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, is carefully controlled; however, these medications may still enter bodies of water through wastewater discharge. These substances may pose risks to stream and river life, as well as to humans via drinking water. In this study, the photochemical fate of 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide was investigated in synthetic waters and four river waters and was found to be the most important attenuation process for each entity in natural surface waters. Bicarbonate alone was found to react with the excited states of 5-fluorouracil, thus enhancing direct photolysis rates. In the presence of nitrate and significant amounts of bicarbonate (close to 2 mM), 5-fluorouracil was rapidly removed (within 1 day) through indirect photolysis. In contrast, natural attenuation was of low importance for cyclophosphamide in most surface waters studied. A long, shallow river or lake with a long residence time (>7 days), very low alkalinity, and significant nitrate levels (>5 mg-N L-1) may be an exception. The phototransformation product of 5-fluorouracil was also identified. However, the total organic carbon experiments yielded important results: photolysis resulted in quick transformation of 5-fluorouracil but minimal mineralization. Additional studies of the toxicity of photobyproducts of 5-fluorouracil are needed to determine the true risk to human health of 5-fluorouracil contamination of surface water, given its near-total photodegradation and resultant, deceptively low detection rate in surface waters.

AB Mesoporous silica SBA-15 and its postfunctionalized counterparts with hydroxymethyl (HM-SBA-15), aminopropyl (AP-SBA-15), and trimethylsilyl (TMS-SBA-15) were prepared and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The removal of a mixture of 12 selected pharmaceuticals was investigated by batch adsorption experiments onto SBA-15 and the grafted materials. SBA-15 showed to have moderate adsorption affinity with amino-containing (atenolol, trimethoprim) and hydrophobic pharmaceuticals. but it displayed minimal adsorption affinity toward hydrophilic compounds. HM-SBA-15 was analogous with SBA-15 in terms of the adsorption efficiency toward all pharmaceuticals. AP-SBA-15 exhibited an increase in the adsorption of two acidic compounds (clofibric acid, diclofenac) but a decrease in the adsorption of estrone and the two amino-containing compounds. Among the grafted materials, TMS-SBA-15 had the highest adsorption affinity toward most pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the adsorption of nine pharmaceuticals to TMS-SBA-15 was significantly higher than that to SBA-15; seven of which showed the removal percentages from 70.6% to 98.9% onto TMS-SBA-15. The number of pharmaceuticals showing high adsorption efficiency onto TMS-SBA-15 did not alter significantly as the pH changed in the range of 5.5-7.6. The results suggest that TMS-SBA-15 is a promising material for the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous phase, especially for the treatment of wastewater from drug manufacturers.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants present mainly in industrial and municipal wastewater. Herein, structurally variable binary and ternary metal hydroxides based on copper, manganese, and aluminum were used for the adsorptive scavenging of the oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotic. A facile hydrothermal method was used for the synthesis of binary CuAl-hydroxide, MnAl-hydroxide, and ternary CuMnAl-hydroxide. Structural and morphological characteristics of the metal hydroxides (MHs) were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformed infrared spectrum (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The adsorptive removal for OTC was found in the order CuMnAl-hydroxide > CuAl-hydroxide > MnAl-hydroxide. The highest removal of OTC by CuMnAl-hydroxide and CuAl-hydroxide was observed at pH 7 while MnAl-hydroxide showed the optimum adsorption at pH 9. All three materials showed different saturation time and equilibrium concentration for OTC adsorption. The mechanism investigation found that strong electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and anion exchange were mainly responsible for the removal of the OTC and adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and equilibrium data was best fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption of OTC was influenced by the presence of Cu (II) and Cr (VI) ions in the aqueous solution due to the competitive adsorption of co-ions. Moreover, the adsorption of OTC was endothermic in nature, and maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 250.07 mg/g at 50 degrees C.

AB Though pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern are increasingly observed in inland water bodies, the occurrence and bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in estuaries and coastal ecosystems are poorly understood. In the present study, bioaccumulation of select pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern was examined in fish from Buffalo Bayou, a tidally influenced urban ecosystem that receives effluent from a major (similar to 200 million gallons per day) municipal wastewater treatment plant in Houston, Texas, USA. Using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, various target analytes were observed in effluent, surface water, and multiple fish species. The trophic position of each species was determined using stable isotope analysis. Fish tissue levels of diphenhydramine, which represented the only pharmaceutical detected in all fish species, did not significantly differ between freshwater and marine fish predominantly inhabiting benthic habitats; however, saltwater fish with pelagic habitat preferences significantly accumulated diphenhydramine to the highest levels observed in the present study. Consistent with previous observations from an effluent-dependent freshwater river, diphenhydramine did not display trophic magnification, which suggests site-specific, pH-influenced inhalational uptake to a greater extent than dietary exposure in this tidally influenced urban ecosystem. The findings highlight the importance of understanding differential bioaccumulation and risks of ionizable contaminants of emerging concern in habitats of urbanizing coastal systems. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB The present study aimed to propose a method to estimate the spatially resolved dataset for human-use antibiotics, which are highly needed in exposure models dealing with regions of various environmental characteristics. In this study, a regression model describing the relationship between the use of antibiotics and a set of socio-economic determinants was developed. It has been demonstrated that economic status (expressed using per capita gross domestic production) dominates the antibiotic use at least in China. Linear regression analysis was used to build the model, resulting in high goodness-of-fit, R-2 (>0.75). Internal and external validations along with residue plot indicated that the model was robust and predictive. The model was successfully applied to allocate the use of antibiotics in China in 2011 at national-, provincial, prefectural-, and county-level, which are comparable to that back-calculated from the available data of wastewater analysis in some cities. Antibiotic uses were higher in East China than other regions and it was found that uses of total antibiotics vary among Chinese counties on four orders of magnitude (0.186-1645 t antibiotics per year per county). Also management practice could be worked out according to our exploration of the impact transition of social-economic factors on antibiotic uses. To our knowledge, this is the first endeavor to explore this economic dominated relationship for estimating spatially resolved use map of antibiotics in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this work is to use environmental-friendly materials (low-cost) as adsorbents for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents. A really difficult category of environmental pollutants is that consisted of pharmaceutical compounds. Many of these compounds are not completely removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and consequently they are detectable in WWTP effluents, surface waters and ground and drinking water all over the world. Therefore, the environmental impact of drugs/compounds is crucial. Activated carbon is the most promising adsorbent material, presenting high adsorption capacity for many pollutants (dyes, metals etc.). However, the need to turn on more environmental-friendly materials leads to the use of low-cost ones derived from agricultural sources. In the present study, potato peels (supplied as wastes from restaurants) were used to produce samples of carbons after (i) pyrolysis or (ii) hydrothermally treatment. After activation with KOH and modification with oxidation agents, the aforementioned materials were used for the removal of two drug compounds (dorzolamide and pramipexole) from synthetic aqueous effluents. The adsorption evaluation was done with a series of adsorption-desorption experiments studying major parameters as the effect of pH, temperature, initial drug concentration, contact time and regeneration ability (desorption pH, cycles of reuse). The characterization was realized with SEM images and FTIR spectroscopy. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the potential of eight low cost and readily available materials as adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBU)) and nutrients was evaluated through batch studies under various environmental conditions. Results showed that wood charcoal, light-weight expanded clay aggregate (LECA), natural zeolites and waste AAC blocks has a potential as promising adsorbents for the elimination of micro-pollutants with the sorption capacity of 0.57-2.83 mg/g for the selected compounds due to their superior properties including higher surface area, pore volume and organic content. Studies revealed that hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and ligand interaction and Vander Waals force are the predominant mechanisms responsible for the sorption process. The selected materials exhibited better removal of phosphate (70-90%) than ammonia (20-81%) and nitrate (14.1-61.8%). Surface area, pore volume, organic content, cation exchange capacity and elemental content (CaO, Al2O3, K2O and Fe2O3) significantly influenced the pollutant removal by the substrates. Being hydrophobic and anionic in nature, DCF exhibited higher removal than IBU and CBZ. Based on the results, the order of preference of material as adsorbent is: wood charcoal > natural zeolite > waste AAC blocks > LECA > blast furnace slag > natural pyrite > brickbats > sand. The results of this batch study will be helpful for selecting appropriate substrate material for the low-cost natural treatment systems where the bio-enhanced sorption/degradation processes help to eliminate the toxic emerging contaminants (ECs) from wastewater.

AB Several studies have shown that organic micropollutants (OMPs) are biotransformed cometabolically in activated sludge systems. However, the individual role of heterotrophs in the microbial consortium is still not clear, i.e., there is still a gap regarding the influence of the heterotrophic activity on the cometabolic biotransformation kinetics and yield of the OMPs. Aiming to answer these questions, experiments with increasing primary substrate concentrations were performed under aerobic heterotrophic conditions in a continuous stirred tank reactor operated at several organic loading rates (OLR) with fixed hydraulic retention time. Moreover, the individual kinetic parameters were determined in batch assays with different initial substrate concentrations using the sludges from the continuous reactor. A set of 15 OMPs displaying a variety of physicochemical properties were spiked to the feeding in the ng L-1 - mu g L-1 range. Results reveal that the biodegradation of the primary carbon source and the biotransformation of the OMPs occur simultaneously, in clear evidence of cometabolic behavior. Moreover, we conclude that the OMPs biotransformation kinetic constant (k(b)(iol)) shows a linear dependence with the OLR of the primary substrate for most of the compounds studied, suggesting that the heterotrophic activity seriously affects the OMPs biotransformation kinetics. However, under typical activated sludge systems operating conditions (hydraulic retention times above 8 h), their biotransformation yield would not be significantly affected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Thirty million people worldwide consume each day nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a heterogeneous group of pharmaceuticals used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies report high NSAID concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents, in surface, ground, and drinking water, and in sediments. NSAIDs are also known to induce toxicity on aquatic organisms. However, toxicity in natural ecosystems is not usually the result of exposure to a single substance but to a mixture of toxic agents, yet only a few studies have evaluated the toxicity of mixtures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity induced by diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and their mixture on a species of commercial interest, the common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of IBP and DCF was determined, and oxidative stress was evaluated using the following biomarkers: lipid peroxidation and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Cyto-genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus test, comet assay, and the specific activity of caspase-3. Results show that DCF, IBP, and a mixture of these pharmaceuticals induced free radical production, oxidative stress and cyto-genotoxicity in tissues of C. carpio. However, a greater effect was elicited by the mixture than by either pharmaceutical alone in some biomarkers evaluated, particularly in gill. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdansk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdansk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg(-1) (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g(-1) of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.

AB This study describes a comprehensive strategy for detecting and elucidating the chemical structures of expected and unexpected transformation products (TPs) from chemicals found in river water and effluent wastewater samples, using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), with post-acquisition data processing and an automated search using an in-house database. The efficacy of the mass defect filtering (MDF) approach to screen metabolites from common biotransformation pathways was tested, and it was shown to be sufficiently sensitive and applicable for detecting metabolites in environmental samples. Four omeprazole metabolites and two venlafaxine metabolites were identified in river water samples. This paper reports the analytical results obtained during 2 years of monitoring, carried out at eight sampling points along the Henares River (Spain). Multiresidue monitoring, for targeted analysis, includes a group of 122 chemicals, amongst which are pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and PAHs. For this purpose, two analytical methods were used based on direct injection with a LC-ESI-QTOF-MS system and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) with bi-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with a time-of-flight spectrometer (GCxGC-EI-TOF-MS).

AB Antibiotics are pharmaceutical compounds widely used to treat a broad range of infections. These chemicals appear to be recalcitrant compounds when released to water systems, and their presence at the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and surface waters has been widely documented. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a sulfonamide commonly used to treat urinary infections, is one of them. Ozonation was proved to be a suitable method to remove SMX antibiotic in water. However, it is stated that a high ozone dosage would be necessary to achieve the complete mineralization of the intermediates. In this work, ozonation is coupled with a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) in order to completely degrade SMX and its metabolites from water solutions. Moreover, a precise description of the microbial community in the bioreactor is provided by means of traditional microscopy and molecular biology techniques. The results obtained showed high Total Organic Carbon removals at the end of the biological treatment (89% removal). Furthermore, nitrates produced during the aerobic SBBR's performance were monitored and eliminated by adding an anoxic stage, achieving an overall nitrogen removal of 86%. A bacterial community analysis of the SBBR during aerobic and aerobic-anoxic conditions was performed, targeting the bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. These results revealed a dominant contribution of bacteria from the Proteobacteria class, with a major contribution from the Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales orders during the bioreactor performance, counting 52% of the total population.

AB Potential effect of ciprofloxacin HCl (GP), oxytetracycline HCl (OTC) and sulfamethazine (SM2) on the common wetland plant (Phragmites australis) was evaluated by measuring root activity, antioxidant enzymes and chlorophyll in leaf, and a study of the accumulation of antibiotics in plant was also included. Plants were incubated in six containers for 62 days and exposed to antibiotics at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L in nutrient solutions. Results illustrated that high antibiotics concentrations (>10 mu g/L) had a toxic effect on root activity and leaf chlorophyll, while hormesis occurred at low antibiotics concentrations (0.1-1 mu g/L). As antibiotics dosages increased, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity significantly declined (5-55% and 9-58%), while peroxidase activity significantly increased. P. australis accumulated antibiotics via passive absorption, exposure to 1000 mu g/L concentrations led to higher CIP, OTC, and SM2 contents in plants (13,834, 6901 and 2047 ng/g dry weight, respectively) than did exposure to 0.1 mu g/L concentrations (345, 165, and 24 ng/g dry weight, respectively). The total antibiotics content in all plants followed the sequence CIP > OTC > SM2, and the distribution of all antibiotics followed the sequence root > leaf > stem. These preliminary results indicated that P. australis could both absorb and tolerate antibiotics concentrations typically found in wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to its low cost, free chlorine is one of the most common disinfectants for wastewater and drinking water treatment. However, the formation of disinfection byproducts has been found to occur after free chlorine disinfection in recent decades. Antipyrine (ANT), an anti-inflammatory analgesic, has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In this work, the removal efficiency of ANT by free chlorine oxidation in ultrapure water was investigated with batch experiments. The influencing factors on the removal of ANT were explored at initial concentrations of ANT from 0.04 to 0.64 mg/L, free chlorine dosage from 0.30 to 1.31 mg/L, and pH from 1.5 to 9.0. The main degradation products were identified by solid phase extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that ANT reacted rapidly with free chlorine in ultrapure water systems and up to 90.6% removal efficiency of ANT was achieved after 25 sec (initial free chlorine 1 mg/L, ANT 0.5 mg/L, pH 7.0). Higher oxidant dosage, lower ANT initial concentration and low pH favor the ANT removal. The main degradation product in ANT chlorination was a monochlorine substitution product (4-chloro-1,2-dihydro-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one), which can be further chlorinated by free chlorine. In addition, the total organic carbon result indicated that ANT is difficult to be mineralized using chlorine.

AB An urgent need exists to assess the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals. The aim of the present study was to assess the uptake and metabolism of waterborne pharmaceuticals in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A further objective was to determine the possibility of monitoring exposure to low levels of pharmaceuticals by bile assays. Rainbow trout were exposed for 10 d under flow-through conditions to mixtures of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, bisoprolol, and carbamazepine) at high and low concentrations. The low concentration was used to mimic the conditions prevailing in the vicinity of the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants. The uptake and the bioconcentration were determined by blood plasma and bile analyses. The average bioconcentration factor in plasma ranged from below 0.1 for bisoprolol to 4.9 for diclofenac, the values being approximately similar at low and high ambient concentrations. The biotransformation of diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen was considered efficient, because several metabolites could be detected in concentrations clearly exceeding those of the unmetabolized compounds. The glucuronicles were the dominant metabolites for all three pharmaceuticals. The total bioconcentration in the bile was two to four orders of magnitude higher than in the plasma. The results of this work show that the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals in environmentally relevant concentrations may be monitored by blood plasma and bile analyses, the latter allowing detection at markedly lower ambient concentration.

AB The ubiquitous occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic environments raises concerns about potential adverse effects on aquatic ecology and human health, including the promotion of increased antibiotic resistance. This study examined the oxidation of three widely detected antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, and trimethoprim) by potassium permanganate [KMnO4; Mn(VII)]. Reaction kinetics were described by second-order rate laws, with apparent second-order rate constants (k(2)) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C in the order of 0 61 +/- 0.02 M-1 s(-1) (ciprofloxacin) < 1 6 +/- 0 1 M-1 s(-1) (trimethoprim) < 36 +/- 0.1 M-1 s(-1) (lincomycin). Arrhenius temperature dependence was observed with apparent activation energies (E-a) ranging from 49 kJ mol(-1) (trimethoprim) to 68 kJ mol(-1) (lincomycin). Rates of lincomycin and trimethoprim oxidation exhibited marked pH dependences, whereas pH had only a small effect on rates of ciprofloxacin oxidation The effects of pH were quantitatively described by considering parallel reactions between KMnO4 and individual acid-base species of the target antibiotics Predictions from a kinetic model that included temperature, KMnO4 dosage, pH, and source water oxidant demand as input parameters agreed reasonably well with measurements of trimethoprim and lincomycin oxidation in six drinking water utility sources Although Mn(VII) reactivity with the antibiotics was lower than that reported for ozone and free chlorine, its high selectivity and stability suggests a promising oxidant for treating sensitive micropollutants in organic-rich matrices (e g, wastewater)

AB This study identified biotransformation products formed from three anthropogenic trace organic compounds (TOrCs) (benzotriazole, triclosan, and trimethoprim) in aerobic and anoxic sludge from a biological nutrient removal (BNR) wastewater treatment system. Liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF) was used to identify intermediate transformation products. A user-defined compound library was used to target unknowns in samples with a mix of TOrCs without requiring chemical standards and developed using EAWAG-BDD predictive software, which included 37 potential transformation products. Biotransformation batch experiments were conducted using activated sludge from anoxic and aerobic redox regimes of a BNR treatment plant located in Southern Nevada, United States. Four intermediates were observed for benzotriazole in both aerobic and anoxic activated sludge, which consisted of two isomers of hydroxy benzotriazole and two isomers of methoxy benzotriazole. Four intermediates were observed for trimethoprim under aerobic conditions, which formed 2,4-diaminopyrimidin-5-yl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanol (TMP 306) and 2,6-diamino-5-hydroxy-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-5,6-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-one (TMP 324) and two demethylation isomers of desmethyl trimethoprim. Triclosan had one confirmed transformation product, triclosan-o-sulfate, formed in both conditions. The identification of these transformation products will allow for more thorough risk assessments to be performed for the target TOrCs.

AB S-doped TiO2 and hybrid MoS2/TiO2 systems have been synthesized, via the sulfidation with H2S of the bare TiO2 and of MoOx supported on TiO2 systems, with the aim of enhancing the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 for the degradation of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, whose residues and metabolites are usually inefficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants. The focus of this study is to find a relationship between the morphology/structure/surface properties and photoactivity. The full characterization of samples reveals the strong effects of the H2S action on the properties of TiO2, with the formation of defects at the surface, as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR), while also the optical properties are strongly affected by the sulfidation treatment, with changes in the electronic states of TiO2. Meanwhile, the formation of small and thin few-layer MoS2 domains, decorating the TiO2 surface, is evidenced by both high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and UV-Vis/Raman spectroscopies, while Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra give insights into the nature of Ti and Mo surface sites. The most interesting findings of our research are the enhanced photoactivity of the MoS2/TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst toward the carbamazepine mineralization. Surprisingly, the formation of hazardous compounds (i.e., acridine derivatives), usually obtained from carbamazepine, is precluded when treated with MoS2/TiO2 systems.

AB The global contamination of water resources with inorganic and organic micropollutants, such as metals and pharmaceuticals, poses a critical threat to the environment and human health. Herein, we report on a bio-derived chitosan-EDTA-beta-cyclodextrin (CS-ED-CD) trifunctional adsorbent fabricated via a facile and green one-pot synthesis method using EDTA as a cross-linker, for the adsorption of toxic metals and organic micropollutants from wastewater. In this system, chitosan chain is considered as the backbone, and the immobilized cyclodextrin cavities capture the organic compounds via host-guest inclusion complexation, while EDTA-groups complex metals. The thoroughly characterized CS-ED-CD was employed for batch adsorption experiments. The adsorbent displayed a monolayer adsorption capacity of 0.803, 1.258 mmol g(-1) for Pb(II) and Cd(II) respectively, while a heterogeneous sorption capacity of 0.177, 0.142, 0.203, 0.149 mmol g(-1) for bisphenol-S, ciprofloxacin, procaine, and imipramine, respectively. The adsorption mechanism was verified by FT-IR and elemental mapping. Importantly, the adsorbent perform is effective in the simultaneous removal of metals and organic pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations. All these findings demonstrate the promise of CS-ED-CD for practical applications in the treatment of micropollutants. This work adds a new insight to design and preparation of efficient trifunctional adsorbents from sustainable materials for water purification.

AB Ranitidine can produce high yields of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) upon chloramination and its presence in water resources is a concern for water utilities using chloramine disinfection. This study assessed the efficiency of water chlorination and ozonation in transforming ranitidine and eliminating its NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) by determining moiety-specific reaction kinetics, stoichiometric factors, and elimination levels in real water matrices. Despite the fact that chlorine reacts rapidly with the acetamidine and thioether moieties of ranitidine (k > 10(8) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7), the NDMA-FP decreases significantly only when chlorine reacts with the less reactive tertiary amine (k=3 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7) or furan moiety (k=81 M-1 s(-1) at pH 7). Ozone reacts rapidly with all four moieties of ranitidine (k= 1.5 x 10(5) - 1.6 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7) and its reaction with the tertiary amine or furan moiety leads to complete elimination of the NDMA-FP. Treatments of ranitidine-spiked real water samples have shown that ozonation can efficiently deactivate ranitidine in water and wastewater treatment, while chlorination can be efficient for water containing low concentration of ammonia. This result can be applied to the other structurally similar, potent NDMA precursors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are a class of emerging contaminants that are present in wastewater effluents, surface water, and groundwater around the world. There is a need to determine rapid and reliable bioindicators of exposure and the toxic mode of action of these contaminants to aquatic organisms. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was used to determine the metabolic profile of Daphnia magna after exposure to a range of sub-lethal concentrations of triclosan (6.25-100 mu g/L), carbamazepine (1.75-14 mg/L) and ibuprofen (1.75-14 mg/L) for 48 h. Sub-lethal triclosan exposure suggested a general oxidative stress condition and the branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, glutamate, and methionine emerged as potential bioindicators. The aromatic amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine are potential bioindicators for sub-lethal carbamazepine exposure that may have altered energy metabolism. The potential bioindicators for sub-lethal ibuprofen exposure are serine, methionine, lysine, arginine and leucine, which showed a concentration-dependent response. The differences in the metabolic changes were related to the dissimilar modes of toxicity of triclosan, carbamazepine and ibuprofen. H-1 NMR-based metabolomics gave an improved understanding of how these emerging contaminants impact the keystone species D. magna. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A laboratory pilot photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR), employing a hybrid TiO2/UV-A catalysis-ultrafiltration process, is evaluated for degradation of diclofenac (DCF), a typical micro-pollutant frequently encountered in source waters. The combination of membrane ultrafiltration with photocatalysis allows TiO2 separation and reuse whereas the automatic periodic membrane backwashing, combined with moderate permeate flux, effectively control membrane fouling, thus permitting stable continuous operation with no wastewater stream. The operation under steady state conditions permitted the assessment of the PMR system performance (for DCF degradation), in terms of water pH and catalyst dosage, in relatively long-term tests. The results demonstrate excellent system performance. Experiments with groundwater, at UV-A radiant power per unit volume 6.57 W/L, show an optimum DCF removal at pH similar to 6 and TiO2 loading near 0.5 g/L with maxima of DCF molecular degradation and mineralization similar to 99.5% and similar to 69%, respectively. Significant differences of photo-catalytic oxidation performance are identified with different water matrices (i.e. ultrapure water, tap water, groundwater), confirming the important role of feed-water characteristics (i.e. presence of organic and inorganic scavengers) on process effectiveness. The new results highlight, among other factors, the need for good knowledge of feed water properties, to successfully design a PMR treatment process for effectively removing organic micropollutant.

AB Modification of commercially available Douglas fir biochar (BC) by iron oxide nanoparticle precipitation from aqueous Fe2+/Fe3+ salt solutions upon NaOH treatment generated a hybrid adsorbent (MBC) that removed three common emerging aqueous contaminants, a stimulant (caffeine) and two anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid) through batch sorption. Fe3O4 particles (12.3 +/- 7.1 nm diameter fundamental particles with aggregates 1-17 mu m diameter) dispersed on the biochar surface provided magnetization and created new adsorption sites for the contaminant uptake. These smaller quasi-spherical, octahedral Fe2O3 particles as well as the spindle-like Fe2O3 particles were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MBC, and the composition was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Adsorption features were evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The Langmuir adsorption capacities on MBC at 35 degrees C have increased from 24.6 +/- 0.4 to 75.1 +/- 1.8 mg/g for caffeine, 17.5 +/- 0.4 to 39.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g for ibuprofen and 106.2 +/- 2.8 to 149.9 +/- 4.5 mg/g for acetylsalicylic acid after Fe2O3 modification. Fast adsorption resulted in equilibrium within 5 min. MBC has potential as a low cost, green adsorbent for pharmaceutical mitigation from water with high adsorption capacities and fast kinetics. The Douglas fir biochar is a byproduct waste from a syn-gas from wood production process covering its production costs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND Amoxicillin (AMX) is one of the pharmaceutical compounds in waters being targeted in wastewater decontamination studies, and some of the technological alternatives to degrade it involve using modified surfaces with transition metal oxides, such as IrO2/Ta2O5|Ti and RuO2/Ta2O5|Ti, forin situproduction of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) to oxidize AMX in aqueous media. RESULTS The IrO2/Ta2O5|Ti 70:30 electrode was best suited for AMX electro-oxidation, with 99.23% removal measured by HPLC-UV-Vis, 81.13% by COD removal, and current efficiency of 41.1% in 0.1 mol L(-1)Na(2)SO(4)after applying 15 mA for 6 h. These results are due to a larger surface area (251.67 cm(2)) and a higher amount of(center dot)OH radicals being generated by cm(2)in neutral pH (3.8 mol L(-1)cm(-2)) compared to the other electrodes. CONCLUSION This paper shows the simulation of the experimental data regarding the complete degradation of AMX (100%) by HPLC, comparing the experimental results and simulation results for AMX degradation using the IrO2/Ta2O5|Ti 70:30. The modeling predicts and validates the disengagement of COD obtained experimentally, considering the mechanism proposed by Trovo and collaborators for the electro-oxidation of AMX to product C6 (C16H22N3O7S) by generating(center dot)OH.

AB The occurrence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment is a global concern. In this study, we employed two different passive samplers Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) and Chemcatcher for in situ measurement of 8 phenolic EDCs in the East River of the Pearl River system over one-year. These data were assessed alongside results from traditional grab sampling. Six chemicals (4tOP, 4NP, BPA, E1, EE2 and DES) were regularly detected in the water samples, of which the three phenols (i.e. 4tOP, 4NP and BPA) were in all samples and at high concentrations (0.4-1040 ng/L for 4tOP, 2.6-58500 ng/L for NP and 11.4-123300 ng/L for BPA). Fewer target chemicals were detected in both passive samplers, with only 4tOP, 4NP and BPA found in most samplers; E1 and DES were occasionally measurable above detection limits. The higher (by about a factor of 2-3) measurements provided by DGT compared to Chemcatcher could be attributed to the effect of the diffusive boundary layer on Chemcatcher uptake or the strong adsorption of target chemicals on the Chemcatcher PES filter. The temporal trends of EDC monthly loadings indicated that they were from different sources and that WWTPs were not effective in EDC removal and/or there was still some untreated wastewater discharged into the rivers.

AB Ketamine has been increasingly used in medicine and has the potential for abuse or illicit use around the world. Ketamine cannot be removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants. Although ketamine and its metabolite norketamine have been detected to a significant degree in effluents and aquatic environments, their ecotoxicity effects in aquatic organisms remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of ketamine and its metabolite, along with the chronic reproductive toxicity of ketamine (5-100 mu g/L) to Daphnia magna. Multiple environmental scenarios were also evaluated, including drug mixtures and sunlight irradiation toxicity. Ketamine and norketamine caused acute toxicity to D. magna, with half lethal concentration (LC50) values of 30.93 and 25.35 mg/L, respectively, after 48 h of exposure. Irradiated solutions of ketamine (20 mg/L) significantly increased the mortality of D. magna; pre-irradiation durations up to 2 h rapidly increased the death rate to 100%. A new photolysis byproduct (M.W. 241) of norketamine that accumulates during irradiation was identified for the first time. The relevant environmental concentration of ketamine produced significant reproductive toxicity effects in D. magna, as revealed by the reduction of the number of total live offspring by 33.6-49.8% (p < 0.05). The toxicity results indicate that the environmental hazardous risks of the relevant ketamine concentration cannot be ignored and warrant further examination.

AB Antidepressants have been found in measurable concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent and receiving waters throughout the world. Studies have shown that these concentrations are typically not overtly toxic, but the psychotropic mode of action of these chemicals warrants examination of their behavioral effects. Exposure of hybrid striped bass to the antidepressants fluoxetine or venlafaxine alone has been shown to cause decreased brain serotonin levels and increased time to capture prey at concentrations typically 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, equally effective doses of fluoxetine and venlafaxine were used to perform a mixture study, using a toxic unit approach to determine whether these antidepressants may act in an additive manner at lower concentrations. The results indicated that mixtures of these antidepressants caused decreased brain serotonin and increased time to capture prey at concentrations lower than reported in previous studies. Low concentration mixtures caused an additive effect on brain serotonin levels and time to capture prey, whereas higher concentrations were less than additive. The results were consistent with the dose addition concept, with higher concentration mixtures potentially saturating the effects on serotonin in the brain. Results from the present study indicate that antidepressants have the potential to be additive on the biochemical and individual scale, which necessitates more robust analysis of antidepressant mixtures and their potential to act together in low concentration scenarios.

AB Antibiotics drugs are essential pharmaceutical compounds that play a vital role in the pharmaceutical industry, hospital, and livestock farming. The large scale of pharmaceutical and husbandry effluents are the primary environmental pollutants in water bodies. Even low concentrations of toxic nitroimidazole residues could lead to severe issues for humans and aquatic environments. Simultaneously, electrochemical sensing of cytotoxic antibiotics provides a critical assurance in quality control laboratories, pharmaceutical industries, and in environment pollutant assessment. The electrode surface modification with an excellent electrocatalyst paves the way for the effective determination of these cytotoxic antibiotics. Herein, Noble metal silver incorporated carrom coin structured cobalt oxide (Ag-Co(3)O(4)NPs) was synthesized through a simple co-precipitation technique, and its electrocatalytic actives sites were improved via calcination at 600 degrees C. The modified electrodes were implemented in the electrochemical detection of cytotoxic Tinidazole (TNZ). The electrochemical characterization shows low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and prominent electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Due to its unique properties, Ag-Co(3)O(4)NPs modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibits excellent sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and low detection level up to the Nanomolar scale. Further, it also provides excellent selectivity among other interfering drugs and species. Meanwhile, it paves strategies for the real-time monitoring of TNZ in biological, pharmaceutical, livestock and various wastewater samples which could paves way for effective application in electrochemical sensors.

AB A novel multifunctional material of MOF-derived porous carbon coated lanthanum oxide (donated as La-MOF-900) had been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal-calcination method, which used in the simultaneous removal of butylparaben (BPB) and As(III). For the single contaminant system, the degradation rate of BPB could reach 98% and retain a high removal efficiency in a wide pH range of 3-9, which covered the most wastewater. In contrast, the removal rate of As(III) reached 90% in the pH of 3, and still 70% of the As(III) can be removed in the pH of 9. For the BPB-As(III) binary system, the presence of As(III) had no obvious impact on the degradation rate of BPB. However, the removal rate of As(III) was suppressed at the presence of BPB because of the competitive reaction of radicals between BPB and As(III). O-2(center dot-), O-1(2), HO center dot and SO4 center dot- were all involved in La-MOF-900/PS system. The composition of porous carbon in the La-MOF-900 was responsible for activating persulfate to degrease BPB and oxidize As(III) to As(V) while La2O3 component of La-MOF-900 acted as adsorbent for the removal of evolved As(V). The proposed strategy would be very indicative for the efficient co-removal of combined pollutants in the aqueous solution.

AB The removal of imidacloprid (IMI) from water by ozonation (O-3) and photo-ozonation (O-3/UV) was comparatively studied, paying particular attention to the kinetics, matrix effect, and mechanistic aspects of the processes. The IMI removal by O-3 was considerably enhanced at alkaline pHs, leading to almost complete removal under 20 min with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.2374 min(-1) at pH 8.25. Three different matrices, Milli-Q water, full-scale vacuum rotating membrane bioreactor plant effluent (VRMBR WW), and laboratory-scale instantaneous fed-batch reactor bioreactor effluent (Bio WW) spiked with IMI, were tested. The ozonation, coupled with UV, improved IMI removal remarkably regardless of the wastewater matrix, and there occurred a six times decrease in ozonation time requirement for 99% IMI elimination at pH 7.25. The IMI degradation mechanism proved that IMI is an ozone-resistant pollutant and is mainly degraded by OH center dot via an indirect mechanism. The second-order rate constants for IMI degradation with OH center dot were calculated as 2.23 x 10(11) and 9.08 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1) for the O-3 alone and O-3/UV processes, respectively. The IMI degradation pathway analysis showed that IMI lost NO2, HNO2, and then Cl- from its structure, and the O-3/UV process yielded fewer by-products than O-3.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are considered as emerging contaminants in the aquatic environments that are not easily eliminated by conventional treatment processes. In the present study, the photocatalytic oxidation of acetaminophen and codeine medicines under UV and solar irradiation was investigated in the aqueous solutions using a novel synthesized zeolite from stone cutting sludge as a support for TiO2 and ZnO. The effect of photocatalyst synthesis conditions including catalyst dose, mixing time, calcination time, and temperature on the efficiency of the pharmaceutical removal were optimized using Taguchi process optimization method. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, the BET surface area, and the Fourier transformation infrared. The results indicated that the performance of ZnO-zeolite for the removal of acetaminophen-codeine under UV and solar radiation with 58.7% and 45.7% was better than that of TiO2-zeolite with 44.3% and 39.2% efficiency, respectively. Removal efficiency under UV and solar radiation was comparable, suggesting that sunlight could be a promising source for treatment of contaminated water by acetaminophen and codeine using photocatalytic degradation. Regeneration of the prepared photocatalysts after 4 cycles revealed a slight decrease in their efficiency. Overall, photocatalytic degradation of the medicines in the water and wastewater using the ZnO-zeolite and TiO2-zeolite could be developed as an efficient treatment process.

AB Herein, a simplistic redox polymerization strategy was utilized for the fabrication of a poly(methacrylic acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel nanocomposite (PMA/nMMT) and probed as a sorbent for sequestration of two pharmaceutical contaminants, viz., amoxicillin (AMX) and diclofenac (DF), from wastewater. The synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite was characterized by the Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques to analyze structural characteristics and sorption interactions. The efficacy of PMA/nMMT was thoroughly investigated for the sequestration of AMX and DF from the aquatic phase with a variation in operative variables like agitation time, sorbent dosage, pH, and initial sorbate concentration. The reaction kinetics was essentially consistent with the pseudo-second-order model with rate dominated by the intraparticle diffusion model as well as the film diffusion mechanism. The Freundlich isotherm appropriated the equilibrium data over the entire range of concentration. Thermodynamic investigation explored the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process. The most possible mechanism has been explained, which includes electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, cationic exchange, and partition mechanism. Economic feasibility, better sorption capacity (152.65 for AMX and 152.86 mg/g for DF), and efficient regeneration and reusability even after four consecutive sorption-desorption cycles ascertained PMA/nMMT as a potential sorbent for AMX and DF uptake from the aqueous phase.

AB BACKGROUNDThe enzymatic process in continuous flow reactors has become attractive owing to the merits of in-line purification, improved mixing and mass transfer, etc. However, the construction of continuous flow reactors requires stable and surface-active monolithic scaffolds for enzyme immobilization.
   RESULTSIn this study, nanofibers of linear polyethyleneimine (LPEI) are formed on the surface of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-treated cordierite honeycomb (named LPEI/PSS cordierite-H) as monolithic scaffold for enzyme immobilization. The controlled self-assembly of LPEI ensures the formation of nanofibers (diameters of 20-80 nm) on the surface of cordierite-H, which roughens the surface and offers many active sites for enzyme loading. The electrostatic interaction between negatively charged enzyme and positively charged LPEI helps the enzyme firmly attach on the surface. The loading capacity of LPEI/PSS cordierite-H was 1.24 mg g(-1). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-loaded LPEI/PSS cordierite-H (HRP@LPEI/PSS cordierite-H) exhibited activity recovery of 55.33%, 2-fold higher than that of HRP-loaded branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI)/PSS cordierite-H (HRP@BPEI/PSS cordierite-H) (23.72%). Furthermore, a silica layer was formed on the surface of HRP@LPEI/PSS cordierite-H through LPEI-induced silicification, which could prevent the enzyme from deactivation under extreme conditions.
   CONCLUSIONThese monolithic biocatalysts have great potential for applications in wastewater treatment and even in other fields such as pharmaceutical synthesis. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Presence of antineoplastic compounds in the marine environment could cause adverse effects even at very low concentrations. The bulk of the produced literature at present has focused on the detection of these compounds in wastewater samples, while only a few papers tackled the more complex solid samples and until now, to the best of our knowledge, none has investigated marine organisms. This work presents the development, optimisation and application of an analytical method for the extraction and determination of the four antineoplastic compounds; cyclophosphamide, vincristine, vinblastine and tamoxifen, from fish tissues by microwave assisted extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Under optimal conditions, recoveries ranged between 60% and 120%, while infra- and inter-day precision were in the 5.0-19.4% and 12.0-20.4% ranges, respectively. Method detection and quantification limits were in the ranges 0.8-1.3 and 2.7-4.3 ng.g(-1) dry weight for tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide, and 46.3-536 and 154-1787 ng.g(-1) dry weight for vinblastine and vincristine, respectively. The developed analytical method was successfully applied for the extraction and determination of target compounds from muscle and liver tissues belonging to three different fish species. The results did not highlight any contamination by target antineoplastic molecules in the investigated fish tissues.

AB Azole antifungal agents are widely used as active ingredients in antifungal pharmaceuticals and agricultural fungicides. An increase in the use of azole antifungals has resulted in an increase in the concentration of these compounds in wastewater and surface water, with potential implications for agriculture. In the present study, bifonazole (BIF) and clotrimazole (CTZ) were selected for investigation because of their widespread use in topical formulations and persistence in the environment. The mycoremediation capacity of BIF and CTZ by mycelia of Lentinula edodes in in vitro culture was evaluated. The main aim of this study was to identify the presumable biodegradation products of the investigated active pharmaceutical substances using the LC/MS/MS method. For this purpose, the media were enriched with the following active pharmaceutical ingredients selected for this study: BIF powder, CTZ powder, and BIF cream, each of them at the same concentration of 0.1mg/mL. Subsequently, thin-layer chromatography coupled with densitometry was used to evaluate the content of BIF and CTZ in mycelium from in vitro cultures of L. edodes. The degradation process was found to affect primarily the imidazole moiety of both investigated compounds. In addition, the amounts of undegraded investigated compounds were found to be 4.98, 9.26, and 4.56mg/g dry weight for BIF powder, CTZ powder, and BIF cream, respectively. Therefore, the findings of this study revealed that L. edodes could be considered for remediation of pollution caused by azole antifungal agents.

AB The photodegradation and phytotoxicity of the pharmaceutical antibiotic, sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and the azo-dye reactive-red-194 (RR194) under visible-light irradiation of TiO2 nanoparticles modified by silver and zirconium was investigated. The results indicated that sulphamethoxazole and its toxic degradation by product, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole and RR-194 could be degraded efficiently by the co-doped Zr/Ag-TiO2 catalyst. PL studies and ROS generation results suggested that the effective charge separation was carried out while irradiation of the modified TiO2 nanoparticles. Phytotoxicity tests demonstrated lower percentage of germination in P. vulgaris (40%), V. radiata (30%) and P. lunatus (30%) of the seeds treated with 50 ppm of SMX, compared to the seeds treated with the degradation products (100%). The results with 50 ppm of RR-194 also showed lower percentage of germination in P. vulgaris (40%), V. radiata (50%) and P. lunatus (30%) compared to the degradation products (100%). Furthermore, significant increase in root and shoot development was observed in the seeds treated with the degraded products when compared with SMX and RR-194. Overall, this study contributes to further understanding the photodegradation mechanisms, degradation products and environmental fate of SMX and RR-194 in water which helps in the evaluation and mitigation of the environmental risk of SMX and RR-194 for water reuse and crop irrigation.

AB The functionalized nano-clay composite adsorbent was prepared, and its properties were characterized using FT-IR, XRD and SEM techniques. The synthesized nano-clay composite was studied with regard to its capacity to remove ibuprofen under different adsorption conditions such as varying pH levels (5-9), initial ibuprofen concentrations (3, 5 and 10 mg L-1), contact time, and the amount of adsorbent (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 g). In order to evaluate the nanocomposite adsorption capacity, the adsorption results were assessed using nine isotherm models. The results showed that the optimum adsorption pH was 6 and that an increase or decrease in the pH reduced the adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was fast and reached equilibrium after 120 min. The maximum efficacy of ibuprofen removal was approximately 95.2%, with 1 g of adsorbent, 10 mg L-1 initial concentration of ibuprofen, 120 min contact time and pH = 6. The optimal adsorption isotherm models were the Freundlich, Fritz-Schlunder, Redlich-Peterson, Radke-Prausnitz, Sip, Toth and Khan models. In addition, four adsorption kinetic models were employed for adsorption system evaluation under a variety of experimental conditions. The kinetic data illustrated that the process is very fast, and the reaction followed the Elovich kinetic model. Therefore, this nano-clay composite can be used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of ibuprofen from aqueous solutions, such as water and wastewater.

AB A reliable and robust analytical method based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detector was developed for the simultaneous determination of five cephalosporin antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Cefradine, Cefaclor, Cefotaxime and Cefoperazone) in various water samples. Under optimised conditions, it was applicable to preconcentrate up to 500 ml of water samples in the OASIS HLB cartridges with reasonable recoveries for all the cephalosporin antibiotics tested. Recoveries were as follows: deionised water, tap water and groundwater, between 84.2 and 98.9%; surface water, between 71.2 and 81.0%; influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), between 56.9 and 72.1%. The method detection limits (MDLs) for different water samples were in the range of 26 to 59 ng l(-1). Real water samples were analysed using the proposed approach to demonstrate the applicability and validation. Negative results were obtained for the tap water and groundwater. However, all the selected cephalosporin antibiotics were identified in the influent and effluent of a local WWTP at ng l(-1)-mu g l(-1) level. In addition, Ceftazidime was found in surface water with a concentration of 0.75-2.60 mu g l(-1). The results indicate that the 'pseudo-persistent' contamination of cephalosporin antibiotics in the water environment could not be neglected.

AB Several studies show that many water bodies in developing countries are increasingly affected by anthropogenic pressure, such as agricultural activities, domestic and industrial wastewater. However, data is scarce in several of such countries, including Panama. Thus, in this work, the ecotoxicological status of selected rivers in Panama with distinct input sources were evaluated using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo bioassays combined with a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry screening of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), using a library of over 3200 chemicals. A total of 68 CECs, including pharmaceuticals and metabolites, pesticides and several industrial chemicals, could be tentatively identified. Additionally, the zebrafish embryo bioassays showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in embryo mortality/abnormalities when incubated with water samples from two rivers, Matasnillo and Curundu (47.5% and 32%, respectively). Importantly, a positive correlation between ecotoxicological endpoints and some of the detected CECs was observed. The findings demonstrate that both rivers are under strong anthropogenic pressure, and therefore, management actions are urgently needed to decrease their level of contamination. Overall, this study further supports the use of the zebrafish embryo bioassay as a fast, high throughput approach for screening the toxicity of water samples, and highlights the advantages of combining ecotoxicological assays with high-resolution mass spectrometry to an expedite assessment of the ecotoxicological status of water bodies.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) has recently been highlighted as a promising multipurpose two-dimensional material. However, free-standing graphene oxide films suffer from poor strength and flexibility, which limits scaling-up of production and lifetime structural robustness in applications. Inspired by the relationship between the organic and inorganic components of the hierarchical structure of nacre found in mollusk shells, we have fabricated self-assembled, layered graphene-based composite films. The organic phase of our composite is produced via environmentally friendly and economical methods based on bacterial production of gamma-poly(glutamic acid) (PGA). Composite films made of GO, PGA, and divalent cations (Ca2+) were prepared through a slow solvent evaporation method at ambient temperature, resulting in a nacre-like layered structure. These biobased nanocomposite films showed impressive mechanical properties, which resulted from a synergistic combination of hydrogen bonding with the bacterially produced PGA and ionic bonding with calcium ions (Ca2+). The GO/PGA/Ca2+ composite films possessed a high strength of 150 +/- 51.9 MPa and a high Young's modulus of 21.4 +/- 8.7 GPa, which represents an increase of 120% and over 70% with respect to pure GO films. We provide rational design strategies for the production of graphene-based films with improved mechanical performance, which can be applied in filtration purification of wastewater in the paper, food, beverage, pigment, and pharmaceuticals industries, as well as for manufacturing of functional membranes and surface coatings.

AB The analytes such as ascorbic acid (AA) present in Sechium edule were extracted (294 mg AA kg(-1) fruit) in an aqueous media for its potential application for Ag-doping onto wurtzite ZnO. The bandgap of ZnO was decreased to 2.85 eV at the optimal Ag-loading of 1.18% (w/w) against 3.13 eV for the control catalyst without using the analytes and, the commercial AA only could reduce the bandgap to 2.91 eV. The saturation photo-electrochemical current density (46.68 mA cm(-2))at E-anode >= 0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl was almost double than pristine ZnO under visible light illumination (lambda(mean) = 525 nm, 18 K lux) and, the current density was insignificant in the dark. The doped catalyst exhibited the maximum 79.5% degradation (71% COD removal) of an anti-analgesic drug, dipyrone (100 mu g L-1 dipyrone, catalyst 100 mg L-1) resulted from the formation of O-2(center dot-) radical (g-factor of 2.002-2.008) and paramagnetic oxygen vacancies (g-factor of 2.020) and, no effect of dye-sensitization was noted. The highest quantum yield was found to be 34.7%. The catalyst loss was 6% after the fourth cycle and the dipyrone degradation was reduced to 70.8%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   RAPID ANALYSIS
AB Ozone oxidation has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment process for the attenuation of trace organic compounds (TOrCs); however, predicting TOrC attenuation by ozone processes is challenging in wastewaters. Since ozone is rapidly consumed, determining the exposure times of ozone and hydroxyl radical proves to be difficult. As direct potable reuse schemes continue to gain traction, there is an increasing need for the development of real-time monitoring strategies for TOrC abatement in ozone oxidation processes. Hence, this study is primarily aimed at developing indicator and surrogate models for the prediction of TOrC attenuation by ozone oxidation. To this end, the second-order kinetic equations with a second-phase Rd value (ratio of hydroxyl radical exposure to molecular ozone exposure) were used to calculate comparative kinetics of TOrC attenuation and the reduction of indicator and spectroscopic surrogate parameters, including UV absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) and total fluorescence (TF). The developed indicator model using meprobamate as an indicator compound and the surrogate models with UVA254 and TF exhibited good predictive power for the attenuation of 13 kinetically distinct TOrCs in five filtered and unfiltered wastewater effluents (R-2 values > 0.8). This study is intended to help provide a guideline for the implementation of indicator/surrogate models for real-time monitoring of TOrC abatement with ozone processes and integrate them into a regulatory framework in water reuse.

AB Beneficial reuse of reclaimed water is the use of domestic or municipal wastewater that has been treated to a suitable quality for a specific use and takes the place of potable and/or raw water that would otherwise be needed from another source. This planned practice has been implemented for decades and has been identified as an important option in water supply portfolios for many communities. However, with unique water resources challenges arising as a result of increasing populations, interannual climate variability, projections of prolonged droughts in some regions, and corresponding shifts from reliance on groundwater to surface water supplies for potable water, conjunctive water reuse is being increasingly recognized as an important approach to increase water use efficiency and to diversify water resources management portfolios. Drought is one of the most important drivers for conjunctive reuse, and national trends indicate a growing interest in providing sustainable water supply solutions through broader application of reuse. This chapter identifies the importance of reuse as part of integrated water resources planning and how conjunctive water reuse can provide a locally available, drought- proof supply of water. There are a number of reuse types that this chapter describes, and it also addresses the shift in thinking about reuse as a potable water supply. With a better understanding of the various types of reuse and how treatment technologies can be employed to meet any water quality objective, informed decisions can be made about how to implement reuse to better address the challenges of a changing climate.

AB BACKGROUND: The antibiotics in industrial and munipical wastewaters could not be removed effectively in conventional anaerobic and aerobic biological treatment plants. Few studies have been performed to investigate the biodegradation and inhibition kinetics of oxytetracycline (OTC) on methanogens and total volatile fatty acids (TVFA). RESULTS: A high rate anaerobic multichamber bed reactor (AMCBR) was effective in removing the molasses-chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the OTC antibiotic with yields as high as 96% at an influent OTC loading rate of 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1 at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.25 days. Increasing the OTC loading rates from 22.22 gOTC m-3 day-1 to 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1 improved both hydrolysis and specific utilization of molasses-COD. The inhibition constants of TVFA (KI-TVFA-meth) and OTC (KI-OTC-meth) on methanogens decreased at OTC loadings > 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1. The direct effect of OTC loadings > 133.3 gOTC m-3 day-1 on acidogens and methanogens was evaluated using the Haldane inhibition kinetic. CONCLUSION: OTC antibiotic was effectively removed in a sequential AMCBR/completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The Haldane inhibition constant (KID) decreased significantly at high OTC loads indicating the increase in toxicity. Copyright (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Photocatalytic ozonation (O-3/UVA/TiO2) of diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and emerging water pollutant, was studied through the influence of some operational variables (gas flow rate, initial concentrations of ozone, DCF and TiO2), ozone consumption and ecotoxicity. Further, the stability and activity of the catalyst was investigated. Both ozone gas and initial diclofenac concentrations highly affected DCF and total organic carbon (TOC:) removals while the gas flow rate exerted a negligible influence under the experimental conditions here applied. Complete elimination of DCF was achieved within 6 min and from 60 to 75% of TOC removals were observed after 60 min of reaction regardless of the water matrix used, ultrapure water or urban waste wastewater. Optimum concentration of TiO2 was found between 0.5 and 2.5 g L-1 and ozone consumption around 6 mg per mg TOC consumed was obtained after 30 min of reaction. Daphnia magna exposition to untreated DCF aqueous solution led to 65% of death of these organisms, though after treatment, ecotoxicity levels of 20% were achieved. Photocatalytic ozonation showed the lowest ozone consumption and ecotoxicity compared to the other ozonation systems tested. Moreover, loss in the catalyst activity was not observed after 8 h of use as well as no leaching of Ti was detected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic transport downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge was evaluated along stream reaches on Mud Creek, Spring Creek, and Decatur Branch in northwestern Arkansas, USA. Water and streambed samples were collected during August and September 2006 and analyzed for multiple antibiotics representing five classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones. sulfonamides, and tetracyclines). Antibiotics within the classes macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonamides were detected in the water column at all three stream reaches. Several of these same antibiotics, as well as antibiotics from the class tetracycline, were measured in streambed material at quantities significantly greater than those observed in the water column. Pseudo-partitioning coefficients ranged from 4 to >8000 L kg(-1). Most of the antibiotics studied were significantly retained in the reaches at Mud Creek and Spring Creek and traveled kilometer-scale distances (S-net, 3.3-20.2 km) with low uptake velocities (nu(f-net), 2.9-16.1 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) and rates (U-net 0.01-37.9 x 10(-6) mu g m(-2) s(-1)). Some antibiotics increased in concentration downstream from the effluent discharge at Decatur Branch, suggesting possible release from within the fluvial channel or additional sources along the stream reach. In general, antibiotics traveled kilometer-scale distances before significant dilution occurred through in-stream processes (e.g., advection, dispersion, sorption, uptake and/or degradation) within the fluvial channel of these effluent-dominated streams.

AB We investigated the occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics, estrogens, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-blockers, and lipid regulators) in three rivers and in the waste streams of six hospitals and four pharmaceutical production facilities in Taiwan. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were acetaminophen, erythromycin-H2O, sulfamethoxazole, and gemfibrozil. NSAIDs were the next most-often detected compounds, with a detection frequency > 60%. The other analytes were not detected or were seen in only a few samples at trace concentrations. The present study demonstrates a significant discharge of human medications from hospital and drug production facilities into surface waters in the Taipei district. The high concentrations of pharmaceuticals found in the Sindian and Dahan rivers demonstrate the alarming degree to which they have been impacted by urban drainage (waste effluents from hospitals, households, and pharmaceutical production facilities). The ubiquitous occurrence at extremely high concentrations of acetaminophen and erythromycin-H2O in both rivers (up to 15.7 and 75.5 mu g/L) and in wastewater from hospitals and pharmaceutical production facilities (up to 417.5 and 7.84 mu g/L) was unique. This finding, in combination with acetaminophen's status as the drug most often prescribed by Taiwan's dominant clinical institute, suggests the potential use of acetaminophen as a molecular indicator of contamination of Taiwan's aqueous environments with untreated urban drainage.

AB Investigations of agricultural chemicals in surface runoff typically target nutrients or specific pesticides; however, numerous other organic compounds are regularly applied to agricultural fields in pesticide formulations, irrigation water, soil amendments and fertilizers. Many of these compounds have toxicological significance. We conducted abroad spectrum analysis of surface runoff from individual irrigated agricultural fields in coastal southern California to characterize organic compounds amenable to analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and to estimate the mass flux of selected chemicals. Aqueous phase extracts contained several pesticides, as well as personal care product ingredients and pharmaceutically active compounds apparently derived from treated wastewater used for irrigation-Several compounds potentially associated with pesticide adjuvants were also present in aqueous phase extracts. Dissolved NOM constituents in water phase extracts included n-fatty acids, aliphatic alcohols and plant terpenoids. Tentatively identified compounds sorbed to suspended particles included pesticides, a fecal sterol, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes, and C(14) and C(16) n-fatty acids and fatty acid esters. Bicyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified in both aqueous and suspended p article phases. Constituent concentrations, including total suspended solids (TSS), varied over the course of the sampled events by up to an order of magnitude, and typically were not correlated with flow. Variation in sorbed organic compound concentrations often did not parallel those for TSS concentration. Mass load estimates were strongly influenced by the choice of sampling interval.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in natural water resources due to incomplete removal in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) is a serious environmental concern at present. In this work, the effects of three pharmaceuticals (propranolol, triclosan, and nimesulide) on Gammarus pulex metabolic profiles at different doses and times of exposure have been investigated by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The complex data sets generated in the different exposure experiments were analyzed with the ROIMCR procedure, based on the selection of the MS regions of interest (ROI) data and on their analysis by the Multivariate Curve-Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) chemometrics method. This approach, allowed the resolution and identification of the metabolites present in the analyzed samples, as well as the estimation of their concentration changes due to the exposure experiments. ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were then conducted to assess the changes in the concentration of the metabolites for the three pharmaceuticals at the different conditions of exposure. The three tested pharmaceuticals changed the concentrations of metabolites, which were related to different KEGG functional classes. These changes summarize the biochemical response of Gammarus pulex to the exposure by the three investigated pharmaceuticals. Possible pathway alterations related to protein synthesis and oxidative stress were observed in the concentration of identified metabolites. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the negative effects of emerging contaminants on the environment, that can potentially induce deleterious effects in aquatic and human life, this paper focuses on the removal from the water of Furosemide, through the adsorption process. Indeed, only a few papers are available in the literature about the Furosemide adsorption and, chitosan films are thus proposed for this purpose as safe, sustainable, and recyclable adsorbent materials. In the present work, the effects on the adsorption process of several experimental parameters such as the pH values, ionic strength, amount of adsorbent/pollutant, and temperature values were investigated. The kinetics models, isotherms of adsorption, and the thermodynamic parameters were studied showing that the Furosemide physisorption occurred on the heterogeneous Chitosan surface, endothermically (Delta H degrees = +31.27 +/- 3.40 kJ mol(-1)) and spontaneously (Delta S degrees = +150.00 +/- 10.00 J mol(-1) K-1), following a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The 90% of the pollutant was adsorbed in 2 h, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 3.5 mg x g(-1). Despite these relatively low adsorption capacities, experiments of desorption were performed and 100% of adsorbed Furosemide was recovered by using concentrated NaCl solutions, proposing a low-cost and green approach, with respect to the previous literature relative to the Furosemide adsorption, fundamental for the pollutant recovery and adsorbent reuse.

AB Population growth and deteriorating health issues have led to an increase in the consumption of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan (LOR), for treating high blood pressure and, as a result, to the frequent detection of these drugs in water and wastewater. The present study focuses on the oxidation of LOR by UV photolysis, UV(/Fe2+)-activated persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) systems. The effects of operating parameters including pH value, reaction time, concentration of oxidant and activator on the efficacy of treatment were studied. The target compound degradation by direct UV photolysis, UV/PS and UV/H(2)O(2)systems proved to be efficient and followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The application of UV/oxidant systems even at lower PS or H(2)O(2)concentrations resulted in more than 95% of LOR degradation in 10 min. In addition, the use of UV/Fe2+-activated oxidant systems led to a further increase in the !c o b s by improving the LOR oxidation in aqueous solution. The effectiveness of LOR mineralization based on total organic carbon (TOC) removal was also considered. The optimized results of the studied systems obtained in ultrapure water were used in groundwater to assess the effectiveness of LOR decomposition in more complex environmental matrix. Moreover, the acute toxicity of LOR solutions before and after the UV/Fe2+-activated PS and H2O2 oxidation to luminous bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) was investigated.

AB The utilization of reclaimed water is a reliable and sustainable approach to enhance water supply in water-deficient cities. However, the presence of micro-organic pollutants (MPs) in reclaimed water has potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of 12 target MPs in the influent and reclaimed water collected from a local wastewater treatment plant, and the ultraviolet (UV)-chlorine process was applied to analyze its ability to remove MPs. The results showed that all 12 MPs were detected in both the influent and the reclaimed water, with the concentrations ranging from 25.5 to 238 ng/L and 8.6 to 42.5 ng/L, respectively. Over 52% of all the target MPs were readily degraded by the UV-chlorine process, and the removal efficiency was 7.7% to 64.2% higher than the corresponding removal efficiency by chlorination or UV irradiation only. The degradation efficiency increased with the increasing initial chlorine concentration. The pH value had a slight influence on the MP degradation and exhibited different trends for different MPs. The formation of known disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) during the UV-chlorine process was 33.8% to 68.4% of that in the chlorination process, but the DBPs' formation potentials were 1.3 to 2.2 times higher. The toxicity assay indicated that UV-chlorine can effectively reduce the toxicity of reclaimed water.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal of twenty-nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two water treatment plants (WTPs) in China were investigated. WTP1 employed ozonation and granular active carbon (GAC) filtration after coagulation and sedimentation, while WTP2 applied anthracite and GAC filtration instead. In the influent, six and four selected PPCPs with total concentrations of 554.97 and 12.94ng/L were detected in WTP1 and WTP2, respectively (in October), among which, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin were detected with highest concentrations due to their widely used as both human and veterinary medicines. PPCPs removal varied significantly among compounds and treatment units. In general, coagulation, filtration and single GAC units worked inefficiently and removed the detected PPCPs by less than 50%, as they were not hydrophobic. Ozonation was capable to eliminate a majority of PPCPs by more than 90%, which, however, presented limited mineralization and generated a certain amount of degradation by-products. To seek the improvement of PPCPs removal by coagulation and flocculation, the feasibility of adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into the coagulation process (Fe2+ or Fe3+) to trigger the Fenton reaction was investigated. Results indicated that only under acidic condition, Fe2+ combined H2O2 efficiently removed PPCPs, while Fe3+/H2O2 also showed some removal capacity compared to coagulation process only. It will be impractical to employ this process under neutral pH. But when acidic wastewater is involved, this process may have its potential application.

AB Tamoxifen is a chemotherapy drug considered as recalcitrant contaminant (with low biodegradability in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment), bioaccumulative, ubiquitous, and potentially hazardous for the environment. This work studies the removal of Tamoxifen from water by advanced oxidation processes, paying special attention to the formation of transformation products (TPs) and to the evolution of toxicity (using the Microtox (R) bioassay) during the oxidation processes. Five types of treatments were evaluated combining different technologies based on ozone, hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation: i) O-3, ii) O-3/UV, iii) O-3/H2O2 (peroxone), iv) UV and v) UV/H2O2. Complete removal of tamoxifen was achieved after 30 min for all the treatments carried out with O-3 while a residual concentration (about 10% of initial one) was observed in the treatments based on UV and UV/H2O2 after 4 h of reaction. Eight TPs were tentatively identified and one (non-ionizable molecule) was suspected to be present by using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. An increase of toxicity was observed during all the oxidation processes. In the case of ozone-based treatments that increase was attributed to the presence of some of the TPs identified, whereas in the case of UV-based treatments there was no clear correlation between toxicity and the identified TPs.

TI Effects of three pharmaceutical and personal care products on natural

AB Treated wastewaters in the United States contain detectable quantities of surfactants, antibiotics, and other types of antimicrobial chemicals contained in pharmaceutical and personal-care products (PPCPs) that are released into stream ecosystems. The degradation characteristics of many of these chemicals are not yet known, nor are the chemical properties of their byproducts. They also are not currently mandated for removal under the U.S. Clean Water Act. Three representative PPCPs were individually tested in this study using a series of laboratory dilution bioassays: Ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic), Triclosan (an antimicrobial agent), and Tergitol NP 10 (a surfactant), to determine their effects on natural algal communities sampled both upstream and downstream of the Olathe, KS wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). There were no significant treatment effects on algal community growth rates during the exponential phase of growth, but significant differences were observed in the final biomass yields (p < 0.001). All three compounds caused marked shifts in the community structure of suspended and attached algae at both the upstream and downstream sites (p < 0.05). Increasing the concentrations of all three compounds over a 3 orders of magnitude range also caused a consistent decline in final algal genus richness in the bioassays. Our results suggest that these three PPCPs may potentially influence both the structure and the function of algal communities in stream ecosystems receiving WWTP effluents. These changes could result in shifts in both the nutrient processing capacity and the natural food web structure of these streams.

AB Anaerobic processes have become increasingly important in the treatment of complex industrial wastewaters, which may not only have high concentrations of organics but may contain toxic, persistent/recalcitrant substances. The present paper reports an investigation into the start-up characteristics, feasibility and performance of the Upflow Anaerobic Biofilter Process (UABP) for treating a pharmaceutical effluent, which would be typical of such wastewaters, with an organic concentration of 20,000 mg L-1 COD and two branched-chain fatty acids believed to be persistent/recalcitrant, pivalic acid (PA) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA). In addition to these, there is a readily degradable component, acetic acid. The data from the start-up process beginning with biomass seeding to stable operation showed that the UABP could be satisfactorily started up in two months by using a multiple seeding protocol. Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) was found to be an important key parameter which can improve the removal rates of all targeted substances. Tracking results derived over a year indicated that the process was able to achieve stable performance at 15 days HRT. Increasing the HRT to 20 days substantially improved removal rates of COD and 2-EHA to 93% and 100%, respectively. This longer HRT particularly improved the removal of pivalic acid from 15% to 90%. The biofilter was then able to maintain this good performance when HRT was subsequently decreased in steps to 1.2 days HRT which brought it towards failure. This investigation demonstrated that the UABP could treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing persistent organics effectively.

AB Trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in biosolids is creating potential threats for reuse of biosolids. Out of the tested 64 trace organic contaminants, seven pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), and three pesticides were detected in biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. This study encompasses the removal of TrOCs and improvement in the aerobic digestion of biosolids by various pretreatments including utilization of indigenous microbes present in biosolids (T1), the effect of an enzymatic pretreatment (T2), biostimulation by the addition of an external carbon source (T3) and the synergic effect of biostimulation and enzymatic pretreatment (T4). After 28 days of aerobic digestion, total PhACs removal was 44% with T1, which improved to 51%, 54% and 62% in T2, T3 and T4, respectively. Also, total pesticides removal was 10% in T1, which enhanced to 44%, 14% and 54% in T2, T3 and T4, respectively. The extracellular enzyme activities were also monitored in all the treatments and the maximum activities (114 +/- 11 U/L lipase, 382 +/- 29 U/L phosphatase, 155 +/- 8 U/L protease, 304 +/- 26 U/L amylase, 108 +/- 7 U/L laccase, and 63 +/- 2 U/L lignin peroxidase) were observed in T4 after 28 days of digestion. Thus, this study aids in providing changing aspects of enzyme profiles during these processes and the enhanced bioremediation of biosolids through the hydrolytic and oxidoreductase enzymes produced by the indigenous microorganisms.

AB Rivers may receive pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and environment estrogens, which are emerging concerns, from various sources. Understanding the fate of these emerging contaminants (ECs) from the sources to their receiving river is important for assessing their ecosystem risk. Here, the occurrence, seasonal variation, spatial distribution, and ecological risk of 22 ECs in water and sediments from the Jilin Songhua River, as well as in the effluents from the riverside Jilin wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated. Results indicated that estriol with the highest median concentration of 21.5 ng L-1 in the river water and with the highest median concentration of 481.5 ng g(-1) in the sediments, and methylparaben with the highest concentration of 29.6 +/- 2.9 ng L-1 in the WWTP effluents were the predominant contaminants. The total concentration of ECs in the river water in the dry season was about 1.5 times higher than that in the wet season. The concentrations of these ECs close to the contaminated tributary and the WWTP were relatively high. Risk assessment showed that the maximum risk quotient value of estrone was 1.07 in the river water and estriol was 2.10 in the effluents. In addition, erythromycin posed generally medium risk in the river water and WWTP effluents. It should be paid attention to the prior control of the three contaminants in the river region.

AB The synthetic progestin levonorgestrel is commonly utilized in human oral contraceptives. It enters the environment as a component of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and has been measured at low ng/L concentrations in surface waters. It has been shown to activate fish androgen receptors, causing the physical masculinization of females, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreases in fecundity. In the present study, the effects of levonorgestrel exposure on early-stage oogenesis in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was examined. Adult females were exposed to 0, 10, or 100ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d using a flow-through exposure system. The ovaries from each female were then removed via dissection and weighed for gonadosomatic index (GSI) calculations, and oocytes from one lobe preserved in Serra's fixative. Total numbers of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes exhibiting a germinal vesicle were then quantified. In a second exposure, blood plasma samples were collected from adult females and analyzed for vitellogenin concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Females exposed to both concentrations of levonorgestrel developed male secondary sexual characteristics in a dose-dependent manner, and ovaries contained significantly fewer late stage oocytes. Exposure to 100ng/L of levonorgestrel resulted in decreased GSI and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations. The results suggest that female exposure to levonorgestrel alone may have profound effects on reproduction in progestin-contaminated environments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3299-3304.

AB The present research investigated the treatment of hospital laundry wastewaters by the combined use of photochemical VUV and UVC reactors. Seven different configurations were tested and the performances of each of them were evaluated based on the removal of the load parameters, detoxification and life cycle assessment (LCA). The characterization of studied wastewaters included analysis of the following parameters: COD, BOD5, TKN, total P, pH, turbidity and conductivity. Acute ecotoxicity was evaluated using Daphnia magna. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was performed to determine the organic fraction and chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the qualitative characterization of priority pollutants. Characterization parameters showed the presence of drugs like lidocaine and dipyrone and a high organic load with a poor biodegradability. Wastewaters presented an extreme acute toxicity against D. magna (EC50, 6.7%). The ozonation process (mainly generated by the VUV reactor) obtained the best results concerning the ratio between the consumed energy and the removed COD and the UVC process presented the lowest environmental impacts for the characterization and normalization parameters of the LCA. Normalization revealed that the highest environmental burdens were associated with human toxicity, ecotoxicity and eutrophication of surface waters as well as to the use of non-renewable resources. VUV/UVC/O-3 process presented the best results considering detoxification (EC50 100%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study shows solar photo-Fenton combined with nanofiltration (NF) to treat microcontaminants (MCs) in actual MWTP effluents. Photo-Fenton was operated at circumneutral pH using (S,S)-Ethylened iamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid trisodium salt (EDDS) as the iron complexing agent (Fe:EDDS in a molar ratio of 1:2) and compared with classical photo-Fenton at pH3. Starting H2O2 concentration was 50 mg/L and Fe was 0.1 mM or 0.2 mM. MC degradation was over 90% in all cases and 35 different MCs were monitored by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry enabling the two processes to be compared under real conditions. NF pretreatment enabled photocatalysis to be run at lower flow rates and with higher starting concentrations reducing the surface area of solar collectors and reagents needed. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were also carried out before and at the end of each treatment evaluated and it seemed clear that MC degradation did not produce intermediates with any significant effect on toxicity. In addition, a detailed economic assessment was also performed. Operating costs were higher at circumneutral pH (0.76 (sic)/m(3)) with EDDS than with classical photo-Fenton at pH3 (0.48 (sic)/m(3)).

AB Using monoclonal antibodies labeled with EU3+ chelates, time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) methods were developed for the determination of trace sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and sulfadiazine (SDZ) in environmental waters. Under the optimized conditions, the developed methods offered (i) low detection limits (9.8 ng/L SMZ, 6.1 ng/L SMX, and 5.4 ng/L SDZ, based on 90% inhibition) which were about I order of magnitude lower than that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), (ii) high selectivity with no cross-reactivity (<0.05%) to similarly structured sulfonamides; (iii) high tolerance to variation of the sample pH (6.0-9.0) and salinity (0-100 mM), as well as the presence of humic acid (0-100 mg/L DOC) and heavy metals (0-1 mg/L concentration each of Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and As(V)) in the samples, and (iv) direct determination with low cost high sample throughput, and low sample consumption (50-100 mu L). The proposed TRFIA procedures were applied to determine sulfonamides in a variety of surface water and wastewater samples without sample pretreatment other than filtration. The satisfactory recoveries (64-127%) and reproducibilities (CV = 0.2-16%) achieved, as well as the good agreement with those given by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and ELISA methods, demonstrated the applicability of the proposed TRFIA methods for routine screening/quantification of sulfonamides in environmental waters.

AB This study investigated the role of soil mixture blocks (SMBs) in the removal of trace organic contaminants and the changes in dissolved organic matter characteristics in a laboratory-scale multi-soil-layering (MSL) system. The experimental setup included three soil-based water treatment systems, namely MSL, MSL without SMBs (zeolite/slag), and a sand filter. The effect of SMBs in the removal of dissolved organic matter in MSL was not significant, but the use of zeolite/slag in MSL enhanced the removal of humic substances and building blocks. Through membrane fractionation, the size distribution of dissolved organic matter in the MSL system was not changed, and the majority of the dissolved organic matter is below 1 kDa. Ten pharmaceutically active compounds and three endocrine-disrupting compounds were used to investigate the removal of selected trace organic contaminants in the MSL system, zeolite/slag, and sand filter. The attenuation of pentoxifylline, caffeine, 17 alpha ethinylestradiol, estrone, and 17 beta-estradiol in the MSL system was similar to that for zeolite/slag, and the removal efficiency was greater than 80%. However, pentoxifylline, caffeine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, estrone, and 17 beta-estradiol exhibited relatively low removal efficiencies in the sand filter compared to those in the MSL system and zeolite/slag. Results from this study provide insight into the removal of selected trace organic contaminants in MSL system, which could be considered as one of the series of barriers to remove trace organic contaminants in wastewater.

AB BACKGROUND The micropollutant carbamazepine (CBZ) is persistent and resistant to conventional wastewater treatment. This study investigated the role of fermentative acidogenic bacteria (FAB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) for CBZ biodegradation and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production. RESULTS The experimental results demonstrated that CBZ biodegradation, total organic carbon and sulfate removal efficiency reached 46%, 36% and 98%, respectively, after 144 h of operation with VFA production of acetic acid (20.72 mmol L-1), propionic acid (3.67 mmol L-1) and butyric acid (4.90 mmol L-1). However, the acetate fraction decreased from 78% to 70% with a decrease in chemical oxygen demand/sulfate (COD:SO42-) ratios from 1.06 to 0.35, respectively, suggesting that acetate was partially oxidized by SRB under substrate/COD limiting conditions. The biodegradation performance of SRB + FAB was also compared with that of a mixed microbial community (MMC). CONCLUSIONS Upon increasing the initial CBZ concentration from 42.3 to 169.2 mu mol L-1, SRB + FAB exhibited much higher CBZ biodegradation (33%) than MMC (12%). Microbial community analyses confirmed the enrichment of VFA-producing species including phylum Firmicutes (2.4% to 36.8%) and class Clostridia (1.3% to 29.6%). Moreover, aromatic and nitroaromatic compound-degrading bacteria such asEscherichiaandDesulfovibriowere also enriched. This signifies the applicability of SRB + FAB to pharmaceutical pollutant biodegradation in the environment. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)

AB Presence of organic pollutants in the wastewater and aquatic environment is one of the serious concerns worldwide. Superior adsorption of organic pollutants on modified clays with organocations is well approved nowadays. Among hybrid materials, clay-polyelectrolyte nanocomposites (CPN) are one of the specifically designed materials for the efficient adsorption of diverse organic pollutants. Due to higher surface area of the clay mineral coupled with a polymer coating, they have an explicit affinity for the organic pollutants. In this background, we have developed statistically significant and mechanistically interpretable quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model for adsorption coefficient of diverse organic pollutants to the protonated montmorillonite poly-4-vinylpyridine-co-styrene (Mt-HPVPcoS), a hybrid CPN. Further, the model was employed to predict the logk(d) value of similar to 0.9 million chemicals from five diverse databases spanning from existing and experimental pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic chemicals and dyes with unknown logk(d) value for the mentioned CPN. The reliability of predicted data is checked with two layers confidence screening i.e. the applicability domain study followed by prediction quality check by 'Prediction Reliability Indicator'. Thus, prediction of each compound can be used for data gap filling by environmental regulatory authorities as well as industries. Followed by, maximum common substructure-based (MCS) algorithm is employed for individual database to extract the important structural scaffold for higher logk(d) to the mentioned CPN.

AB Animal waste products from concentrated animal feeding operations are a significant source of antibiotics to the environment. Monensin, an ionophore antibiotic commonly used to increase feed efficiency in livestock, is known to have varied toxicological effects on nontarget species. The current study builds on prior studies evaluating the impact of dairy management on groundwater quality by examining the transport of monensin in an agricultural field with coarse-textured soils during irrigation with lagoon wastewater. The dairy is located in California's San Joaquin Valley, where groundwater can be encountered <5 m below the surface. Groundwater samples were collected from a network of monitoring wells installed throughout the dairy and adjacent to irrigated fields before and after an irrigation event, which allowed for measurement of monensin potentially reaching the shallow groundwater as a direct result of irrigation with lagoon water. Monensin was extracted from water samples via hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid-phase extraction and quantified with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Irrigation water was found to contain up to 1.6 mu g L-1 monensin, but monensin was only detected in monitoring wells surrounding the waste storage lagoon. Water chemistry changes in the wells bordering the irrigated field suggest that up to 7% of irrigation water reached groundwater within days of irrigation. The study suggests that contamination of groundwater with monensin can occur primarily by compromised waste storage systems and that rapid transport of monensin to groundwater is not likely to occur from a single irrigation event.

AB The presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and artificial sweeteners are of concern to water providers because they may be incompletely removed by wastewater treatment processes and they pose an unknown risk to consumers due to long-term consumption of low concentrations of these compounds. This study utilized pilot-scale conventional and biological drinking water treatment processes to assess the removal of nine PhACs and EDCs, and two artificial sweeteners. Conventional treatment (coagulation, flocculation, settling, non-biological dual-media filtration) was compared to biofilters with or without the addition of in-line coagulant (0.2-0.8 mg Al3+ /L; alum or PACl). A combination of biofiltration, with or without in-line alum, and conventional filtration was able to reduce 7 of the 9 PhACs and EDCs by more than 50% from river water while artificial sweeteners were inconsistently removed by conventional treatment or biofiltration. Increasing doses of PACl from 0 to 0.8 mg/L resulted in average removals of PhACs, EDCs increasing from 39 to 70% and artificial sweeteners removal increasing from similar to 15% to similar to 35% in lake water. These results suggest that a combination of biological, chemical and physical treatment can be applied to effectively reduce the concentration of EDCs, PhACs, and artificial sweeteners.

AB Release of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been emerging as a great concern for ecosystem and human health. Ibuprofen (IBU) represents one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments in spite of the high removal rates occurring in conventional wastewater technologies. To assess the potentiality of phytoremediation in assisting these technologies, the screening of plant species for tolerance and removal ability of pollutants is a very important issue. In this study, the effects of different IBU concentrations on callus cultures of Populus nigra L, a pioneer tree species in the riparian ecosystem, were investigated. Results evidenced a notable tolerance of poplar cells to IBU, especially at high concentrations (IBU 30 mg L-1), which even stimulated growth. At this concentration, the ability to withstand IBU was accompanied by inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, reduction of lipid peroxide content and increase of membrane redox activity. Irrespective of initial IBU concentrations, a complete removal of this compound from the growth medium by poplar cells during a subculture occurred. Antioxidative enzyme activities and polyamine content were stimulated by IBU 0.03 mg L-1, while no effect was found in cells exposed to IBU 30 mg L-1, except for a decrease of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity. These findings put in evidence a notable potential of this plant species for the phytoremediation of IBU-contaminated substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A two-stage pilot-scale thermophilic aerobic suspended carrier biofilm process (SCBP) was set up for the on-site treatment of pulp and paper mill whitewater lining. The microbial diversity in this process was analyzed by length heterogeneity analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA. The primer pair selected for PCR amplification was first evaluated by a computational analysis of fragment lengths in ten main phylogenetical eubacterial groups. The fragment contained the first third of the 16S rRNA gene, which was shown to vary naturally between 465 and 563 bp in length. The length heterogeneity analysis of polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) profile of the biomass attached to carrier elements was found to be diverse in both stages of the SCBP. During normal operating conditions, sequences belonging to beta-Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group and gamma-Proteobacteria were assigned to the most prominent LH-PCR peak. Samples from the suspended biomass consisted of completely different bacterial populations, which were, however, similar in the serial reactors. The pilot process experienced alkaline shocks, after which Bacillus-like sequences were detected in both the biofilm and suspended biomass. However, when the conditions were reversed, the normal microbial population in the biofilm recovered rapidly without further biomass inoculations. This study shows that LH-PCR is a valuable method for profiling microbial diversity and dynamics in industrial wastewater processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The abundant existence of antibiotics within the effluent of wastewater treatment plant seriously threatened their safety recharging. To investigate the fate and biodegradation of those toxic antibiotics within the soil aquifer system, typical antibiotics of amoxicillin (AMX) and tetracycline (TC) were selected and their removal mechanisms were investigated. Experimental results revealed that totally 93.4% and 87.2% of the AMX and TC recharged (10 mu g/L) were, respectively, removed within 1 m depth column operation. Specifically, the aerobic biodegradation, abiotic processes and anoxic/anaerobic microorganism contributed as higher as 37.5%, 33.7% and 28.8% of the AMX reduction, via the controlling tests of NaN3 inhibition and soil sterilisations. By contrast, the percentage contribution of the TC was aerobic (54.3%) 'abiotic processes (32.7%) 'anoxic/anaerobic (13.0%), a higher aerobic degradation whereas weaker anoxic/anaerobic microorganism. Column systems (CSs) were constructed to study the effect of redox conditions (methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, nitrate-reducing, aerobic) on antibiotics degradation, and microbial community results revealed that Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus and Armatimonadetes contributed to the aerobic biodegradation of TC. For comparison, AMX could be efficiently degraded under nitrate reduction (19.95%) > sulfate reduction (16.64%) > methanogenic (9.53%), and Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were the dominant bacteria for AMX degradation. This study provided optimal directions for antibiotics removal within the groundwater recharging systems and is conducive to obtain highly value-added reclaimed water.

AB Biodegradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac sodium (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBP) was evaluated through fungal granules development in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Fungal granules were developed in co-culture of T. polyzona, A. niger, T. longibrachiatum, M. circinelloides and R. microsporus at a retention time (RT) of 2 days and 1 day. Ligninolytic enzymes [laccase (Lac), lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)] were determined. Removal of pharmaceuticals was assessed and metabolites identified using the SPE-UPLC-QToF/MS methods. A pH range of 3-4.6 was found to improve the granulation development from day 6 and the production of ligninolytic enzymes [MnP (253.00 +/- 14.19 U/L), Lac (111.58 +/- 10.00 U/L) and LiP (95.25 +/- 8.22 U/L)]. At steady-state, a removal of 97.41 +/- 0.25%, 99.83 +/- 0.14%, and 99.91 +/- 0.08 were achieved at an RT of 2 days for CBZ, DCF, and IBP, respectively, and of 91.94 +/- 0.05%, 99.31 +/- 0.12% and 97.72 +/- 0.23% at an RT of 1 days for the same PhCs. A variety of chemical reactions have been proposed for degradation pathways catalysed by enzyme-producing fungi, generating fragment ions of intermediate compounds. This study is highly relevant for cost-effective and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment processes in water scare countries.

AB Emerging pharmaceutical contaminants, for example antibiotics, have raised severe challenges to remediation technologies due to their resistance to biodegradation and the ineffectiveness in adsorptive removal or membrane separation. In this study, we observed the direct degradation of antibiotic sulfachlorpyridazine (SCP), one of sulfonamides, by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with high efficiency. Nevertheless, SCP could be rapidly decomposed, but the overall mineralization efficiency was rather low. Then, nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route, was employed as a metal-free catalyst to improve the degradation and mineralization of SCP. A comprehensive investigation of in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), selective radical quenching, and PMS decomposition was performed, revealing the direct and nonradical reactions between PMS and SCP in PMS-based and non-catalytic system without producing free radicals such as (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-. Upon the introduction of N-rGO, the SCP removal rate was similar to the PMS-only reaction, however, an enhanced total organic removal was achieved. This suggests that N-doped nanocarbon materials would achieve a greater extent of mineralization of SCP into inorganic salts, carbon dioxide and water. The findings show that the direct oxidation of SCP with PMS can be used to selectively convert the toxic antibiotics to less or non-toxic organic substances whereas the robust carbocatalysis would contribute to the practical wastewater remediation by metal-free advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).

AB Early stages of ontogenesis determining subsequent growth, development, and productivity of crops can be affected by wastewater and sludge contaminated with pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac (DCF) and paracetamol (PCT; both 0.0001 to 10mg/L) did not affect seed germination and primary root length of onion, lettuce, pea, and tomato. Conversely, 20-day-old pea and maize plants exhibited decrease in biomass production, leaf area (by approx. 40% in pea and 70% in maize under 10mg/L DCF), or content of photosynthetic pigments (by 10% and 60% under 10mg/L PCT). Quantum yields of photosystem II were reduced only in maize (F-V/F-M and phi(II) by more than 40% under 10mg/L of both pharmaceuticals). Contents of H2O2 and superoxide increased in roots of both species (more than four times under 10mg/L PCT in pea). Activities of antioxidant enzymes were elevated in pea under DCF treatments, but decreased in maize under both pharmaceuticals. Oxidative injury of root cells expressed as lowered oxidoreductase activity (MTT assay, by 40% in pea and 80% in maize) and increase in malondialdehyde content (by 60% and 100%) together with the membrane integrity disruption (higher Evans Blue accumulation, by 100% in pea and 300% in maize) confirmed higher sensitivity of maize as a C4 monocot plant to both pharmaceuticals.

AB Increasing numbers of organic micropollutants are emitted into rivers via municipal wastewaters. Due to their persistence many pollutants pass wastewater treatment plants without substantial removal. Transport and fate of pollutants in receiving waters and export to downstream ecosystems is not well understood. In particular, a better knowledge of processes governing their environmental behavior is needed. Although a lot of data are available concerning the ubiquitous presence of micropollutants in rivers, accurate data on transport and removal rates are lacking. In this paper, a mass balance approach is presented, which is based on the Lagrangian sampling scheme, but extended to account for precise transport velocities and mixing along river stretches. The calculated mass balances allow accurate quantification of pollutants' reactivity along river segments. This is demonstrated for representative members of important groups of micropollutants, e.g. pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. A model-aided analysis of the measured data series gives insight into the temporal dynamics of removal processes. The occurrence of different removal mechanismssuch as photooxidation, microbial degradation, and volatilization is discussed. The results demonstrate, that removal processes are highly variable in time and space and this has to be considered for future studies. The high precision sampling scheme presented could be a powerful tool for quantifying removal processes under different boundary conditions and in river segments with contrasting properties.

AB Recently UV/TiO2 photocatalytic treatment for municipal reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) has drawn increasing attention due to its high efficiency and low cost. We determined the organics in ROC samples by a combination of multiple analytical techniques: i.e. electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight (ESI-QToF), photocatalytic degradation method, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). By these multiple techniques we were able to determine the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to be 24.50 ppm, which was composed of high molecular weight (MW) (>2000 Da) natural organic matter (NOM) of 23.36 ppm (95.35%wt.) and low MW (<2000 Da) fluorosurfactants of 1.08 ppm (4.41%), and pharmaceuticals & other organic compounds of 0.06 ppm (0.24%). Using ESI-QToF tandam mass spectrometry, molecular structures of 5 series of fluorosurfactants (63 compounds) and 9 phamaceuticals were elucidated. Conjugated compounds and sample color were monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. No volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in the ROC samples by GC/MS. A combination of these 6 techniques provided a comprehensive method to depict the overall constituents of various organics in ROC. Quantitative estimation of organic compounds and structural determination of surfactants and pharmaceuticals in ROC were also investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A granular sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for 340 days for treating a synthetic wastewater containing fluoroquinolones (FQs), namely ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The SBR was intermittently fed with FQs, at concentrations of 9 and 32 mu M. No evidence of FQ biodegradation was observed but the pharmaceutical compounds adsorbed to the aerobic granular sludge, being gradually released into the medium in successive cycles after stopping the FQ feeding.
   Overall COD removal was not affected during the shock loadings. Activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria did not seem to be inhibited by the presence of FQs (maximum of 0.03 and 0.01 mM for ammonium and nitrite in the effluent, respectively). However, during the FQs feeding, nitrate accumulation up to 1.7 mM was observed at the effluent suggesting that denitrification was inhibited. The activity of phosphate accumulating organisms was affected, as indicated by the decrease of P removal capacity during the aerobic phase. Exposure to the FQs also promoted disintegration of the granules leading to an increase of the effluent solid content, nevertheless the solid content at the bioreactor effluent returned to normal levels within ca. 1 month after removing the FQs in the feed allowing recovery of the bedvolume. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed a dynamic bacterial community with gradual changes due to FQs exposure. Bacterial isolates retrieved from the granules predominantly belonged to alpha- and gamma-branch of the Proteobacteria phylum.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous property have gained much concern in environment remediation. Herein, the Mn-doped UiO-66 (denoted as MnUiO-66) with cubic morphology was fabricated with a facile solvothermal method. To investigate the adsorption performance of MnUiO-66, tetracycline (TC) and Cr(VI) were chosen as the target pollutant. The maximum adsorption capacity of MnUiO-66 for TC and Cr(VI) were 184.493 mg g(-1) and 32.773 mg g(-1), respectively, which were 4.9 and 3.1 times higher than the pristine UiO-66. Effects of the solution pH values, initial concentrations and coexisting ions on adsorption capacity were investigated and the adsorption mechanism based on zeta potential measurement was proposed. The adsorption process of MnUiO-66 over TC and Cr(VI) had the most accordance with pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, which suggested that chemisorption was dominant in adsorption reaction and the MnUiO-66 adsorbent had a homogenous surface for adsorption. Adsorption thermodynamic studies implied that the adsorption process of TC and Cr(VI) on MnUiO-66 were spontaneous and exothermic. In addition, the MnUiO-66 showed excellent adsorption performance in TC-Cr(VI) mixed sample and pharmaceutical wastewater. More importantly, the regeneration experiment indicated the MnUiO-66 adsorbent was recyclable. This work provided a useful insight into the fabrication MOFs-based adsorbent for water purification.

AB The remediation of paracetamol (PA), an emerging contaminant frequently found in wastewater treatment plants, has been studied in the low concentration range (0.3-10 mg L-1) using as adsorbent a biomass-derived activated carbon. PA uptake of up to 100 mg g(-1) over the activated carbon has been obtained, with the adsorption isotherms being fairly explained by the Langmuir model. The application of Reichemberg and the Vermeulen equations to the batch kinetics experiments allowed estimating homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion coefficients, reflecting the dependence of diffusion with the surface coverage of PA. A series of rapid small-scale column tests were carried out to determine the breakthrough curves under different operational conditions (temperature, PA concentration, flow rate, bed length). The suitability of the proposed adsorbent for the remediation of PA in fixed-bed adsorption was proven by the high PA adsorption capacity along with the fast adsorption and the reduced height of the mass transfer zone of the columns. We have demonstrated that, thanks to the use of the heterogeneous diffusion coefficient, the proposed mathematical approach for the numerical solution to the mass balance of the column provides a reliable description of the breakthrough profiles and the design parameters, being much more accurate than models based in the classical linear driving force.

AB Final effluent samples from 10 southern California (United States) wastewater treatment facilities, employing four distinct treatment schemes, were surveyed for selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), alkylphenols, and 21 of their halogenated disinfection byproducts. Chlorinated and brominated standards and isotopically labeled internal standards were synthesized and purified to confirm and more accurately quantify selected disinfection byproducts of salicylic acid, bisphenol A, gemfibrozil, naproxen, diclofenac, technical 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of parent compounds ranged from <10 to 3830 ng/L (gemfibrozil), and those of chloro/bromo byproducts ranged from <4 to 370 ng/L (dibromo nonylphenol). The highest concentrations of parent compounds were measured in effluent that was not subjected to tertiary treatment. The chlorinated and brominated byproduct concentration may be affected by the influent concentration of parent compounds, hydraulic retention times, and chlorine contact times. Salicylic acid was readily halogenated, which is evident from the ratio of halogenated to nonhalogenated species. There were no measured chlorinated byproducts of bisphenol A despite occasionally high concentrations of the parent compound. Not surprisingly, higher concentrations of most brominated species were measured in the treatment plant with the highest bromide concentrations. These results demonstrate the occurrence of novel halogenated byproducts of PPCPs that have limited toxicological data and significant uncertainty with regard to their risk to ecological systems.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are co-introduced into soils by irrigation with reclaimed wastewater. We targeted carbamazepine (CBZ) as a model compound to study the tertiary interactions between relatively polar PCs, DOM, and soil. Sorption-desorption behavior of CBZ was studied with bulk clay soil and the corresponding clay size fraction in the following systems: (i) without DOM, (ii) co-introduced with DOM, and (iii) pre-adsorption of DOM before CBZ introduction. Sorption of the DOM to both sorbents was irreversible and exhibited pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis. Carbamazepine exhibited higher sorption affinity and nonlinearity, and a higher degree of desorption hysteresis with the bulk soil than the corresponding clay size fraction. This was probably due to specific interactions with polar soil organic matter fractions that are more common in the bulk soil. Co-introduction of CBZ and DOM to the soil did not significantly affect the sorption behavior of CBZ; however, following pre-adsorption of DOM by the bulk soil, an increase in sorption affinity and decrease in sorption linearity were observed. In this latter treatment, desorption hysteresis of CBZ was significantly increased for both sorbents. We hypothesize that this was due to either strong chemical interactions of CBZ with the adsorbed DOM or physical encapsulation of CBZ in DOM-clay complexes. Based on this study, we suggest that DOM facilitates stronger interactions of polar PCs with the solid surface. This mechanism can reduce PC desorption ability in soils.

AB The Hydra attenuata regeneration assay was used to identify the teratogenic potential of 10 pharmaceuticals identified in effluent from a large city wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Three types of solvents were used to solubilise the pharmaceuticals (DMSO, acetone and ethanol), at concentrations determined to have no significant effect on measured endpoints. On the one hand, regeneration was significantly inhibited at (nominal) concentrations of 1, 5 and 1 mg/L for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen respectively and at the higher concentration of 50 mg/L for bezafibrate and trimethoprim. On the other hand, carbamazepine and the antibiotics sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline and novobiocin significantly increased regeneration at 25, 5, SO and 50 mg/L respectively. Relatively high IC50 values of 0.9, 3.84, 4.9 and 22.5 mg/L were calculated for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and bezafibrate, respectively. However when subjected to tier two toxicity assessment under EU regulatory guidance using environmentally relevant concentrations a MEC/PNEC value > 1 was calculated for gernfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen indicating teratogenic potential and the necessity for further tier three assessment. A toxicity index (TI) was also calculated using three different techniques, with TI values > 3 (indicating teratogenic potential) found for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and bezafibrate and > 1 (indicating a weak teratogenic potential) found for carbamazepine. These results are discussed in the context of their environmental relevance and toxic potential. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional coagulation is widely used as an ultrafiltration membrane pretreatment process in wastewater reclamation, however it shows little ability to reduce organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) and genotoxicity. In this research, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and potassium ferrate were used respectively with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to enhance coagulation. Filtration experiments of coagulation (CUF), coagulation-adsorption (CAUF) and coagulation-oxidation (COUF) pretreatment combined with densadeg-ultrafiltration processes were conducted under their optimum doses. The effluent water quality of CAUF and COUF could meet the water reuse quality standard for scenic environment use, while total phosphorus in the conventional CUF discharge was higher than the standard. The average removal efficiency of the selected fourteen OMPs was significantly improved by 1.8 times through the CAUF process compared to the CUF process (31.2%), whereas the COUF process (38.4%) showed limited improvement. Prominent reduction of genotoxicity was observed in the CAUF and COUF processes, and the effluent of the CAUF process had the least genotoxicity of 1.0 +/- 0.3 mu g 4-Nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO)/L. Moreover, the average transmembrane pressure increasing rate followed the order of CUF (1.5 kPa/d) > COUF (1.1 kPa/d) > CAUF (0.6 kPa/d), indicated that the enhanced coagulation process could relieve membrane fouling effectively.

AB A comprehensive characterisation of four phenolic compounds in surface water and various emission sources was conducted simultaneously in a typical industrial city upstream of the Taihu Lake watershed. The overall concentrations of the target compounds ranged from 0.15 to 2.75 mu g/L in the surface water and from 0.43 to 377 mu g/L in the emission sources. Relatively high concentration levels were observed in August, during which the rainy season typically occurred in the study area, indicating seasonal emission sources. The spatial distribution revealed severe phenolic-compound contamination in the northeast part of the study area. According to the relationships between the surface water and emission sources, combined-sewer overflow and surface runoff from agricultural activities were identified as seasonal emission sources that were responsible for the increased concentration levels in wet seasons. Indirect discharge of industrial wastewater was proposed as a persistent emission source responsible for the severe contamination level in the northeast region over the entire sampling period, accounting for 16.5% of the phenolic-compound load in a demonstration river section. The findings of this study are useful for identifying the sources of phenolic compounds and controlling the contamination from the main sources in a typical industrial city. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Municipal wastewater can contain large amounts of organic micropollutants. Some of these substances are harmful to the environment, even at low concentrations, e.g. when being discharged untreated into surface water bodies in case of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during or after heavy rainfall events. Constructed wetlands can be very effective in treating CSOs. To date, there have only been few investigations about the retention of micropollutants using retention soil filters (RSFs), which basically are vertical flow constructed wetlands with an additional retention area. Thus, focus of this study was set on the interaction between dry periods, loading events, filter operation time, and the resulting removal of micropollutants originating from CSOs. The removal of 1-H-benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol A was examined in four test-scale RSFs. Removal efficiencies of approximately 70% were found for metoprolol. 1-H-benzotriazole, diclofenac and bisphenol A were removed moderately between 30 and 40%. For carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, negative retention rates were found. No significant correlations were found between removal efficiencies and the length of the antecedent dry period and/or filter operation time. However, the study showed that removal efficiencies depend strongly on respective inflow concentrations. Thickness of the filter layer seems to have an influence as well; does not lead to uniform results, though. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, activation of persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of granular activated carbon (GAC) was studied in order to investigate the degradation of Metronidazole (MTZ) antibiotic in aqueous solution. The results showed that GAC could activate PS effectively better than H2O2. Also, both adsorption and oxidation process induced MTZ removal in the GAC/PS system with remarkable synergistic effect in the combined system. After 240 min, 50% of PS was degraded and 80% of MTZ and 65% of COD were removed under the ambient conditions containing initial MTZ concentration of 100 mg L-1, PS/MTZ molar ratio of 100/1, GAC dosage of 5 g L-1 and initial pH of 3.9. Both PS degradation and MTZ removal followed pseudo first order kinetic with rate constant of 0.0006 min(-1) and 0.0023 min(-1), respectively. Scavenging study using methanol and phenol as a radical scavenger showed that most oxidation of MTZ occurred on the surface or in the boundary layer around catalyst. It was also found that MTZ removal efficiency increased when PS concentration or GAC dosage increased. However, results showed that PS loading is more effective than GAC dosage. The MTZ removal efficiency was still considerable after 4 runs reusability of GAC which implied in-situ regeneration of catalyst. It can be concluded that GAC is a favorable and promising metal-free catalyst for wastewater treatment utilization.

AB This work describes a new, equipment-free, generic method for the determination of sulfur-containing compounds that is based on their ability to slow down the photoreduction kinetics of gold ions to gold nanoparticles. The method involves tracking the time required for a red coloration to appear in the tested sample, indicative of the formation of gold nanoparticles, and compare the measured time relative to a control sample in the absence of the target analyte. The method is applicable with minimal and simple steps requiring only two solutions (i.e., a buffer and a gold solution), a source of light (UV or visible), and a timer. The method responds to a large variety of sulfur-containing compounds including thiols, thioesters, disulfides, thiophosphates, metal-sulfur bonds, and inorganic sulfur and was therefore applied to the determination of a variety of compounds such as dithiocarbamate and organophosphorous pesticides, biothiols, pharmaceutically active compounds, and sulfides in different samples such as natural waters and wastewater, biological fluids, and prescription drugs. The analytical figures of merit of the method include satisfactory sensitivity (quantitation limits at the low mu M levels), good recoveries (from 93 to 109%), and satisfactory reproducibility (from 4.8 to 9.8%). The method is easily adoptable to both laboratory settings and nonlaboratory conditions for quantitative and semiquantitative analysis, respectively, is user-friendly even for the minimally trained user, and can be performed with limited resources at low cost.

AB Trans-ferulic acid (FA), extensively used in pharmaceutical and olive oil industries, causes huge risks to ecological environment due to its biotoxicity and phytotoxicity, leading to the difficulty of biochemical processes in treating FA wastewater. In this study, synergistic degradation of FA via dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and O-3 (plasma-ozone) was studied. The results showed that FA degradation efficiency reached 96.9% after a 40-min treatment by plasma-ozone process, and the energy efficiency of FA degradation was increased by 62.5 and 24.5% compared to single DBD plasma and ozonation treatment. Moreover, FA degradation rate constant in plasma-ozone process was 41% higher compared with the sum of single DBD plasma and ozonation, indicating a significant synergistic effect. Radical diagnosis experiments reveal that a profound increase of center dot OH yield through peroxone (H2O2/O-3) and UV/O-3 pathways is the important mechanism of synergistic degradation of FA in plasma-ozone process, while e(aq)(-) played little role in FA degradation. A degradation pathway of FA by plasma-ozone was also proposed according to the detected intermediates from EEM and LC-MS. This work revealed that plasma-ozone process is an alternative process for FA treatment, and the findings are helpful for understanding FA degradation characteristics and synergistic mechanisms in plasma-ozone process.

TI A novel mariner-based transposon system for the enhanced removal of high
   strength ammoniacal nitrogen in pharmaceutical effluents
SO RSC ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER
AB Industrial wastewater is a major polluting agent in the environment as huge amounts of untreated effluents are discharged from industries causing serious effects to biotic systems. The pharmaceutical industry effluent used in the present study contains a high concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) about 500 mg L-1. In the present study, an efficient NH3-N removing strain was isolated, and enriched in the effluent with a high NH3-N concentration for its efficient removal. The strain which showed higher removal efficiency was identified as Proteus penneri by ribotyping. The wild type P. penneri exhibited low removal efficiency (64%) in 24 hours even after the conventional enrichment method. Hence, the strain was mutated to improve its degradation efficiency using a modified mariner based transposon system. It was constructed by replacing the Kan(r) gene with Gm(r) gene to develop pSC189::miniTn(Gm), since the isolated strain was resistant to kanamycin. Two mutant strains T-55 and T-132 were shown to have enhanced NH3-N removal efficiency by 84% and 81% respectively, in 24 hours. The kinetic rate constants such as pseudo first and second order kinetics were evaluated for the degradation of NH3-N by wild type P. penneri and transposon mutants; both of them followed second order rate kinetics. The NH3-N removal was confirmed by ion chromatography (IC) and Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). To date, there is no report on the strain improvement using transposon mutagenesis for the treatment of NH3-N.

AB The coupling of membrane separation and photocatalytic oxidation has been studied for the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants. The retention properties of two different membranes (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) were assessed. Comparable selectivity on the separation of pharmaceuticals were observed for both membranes, obtaining a permeate stream with concentrations of each pharmaceutical below 0.5 mg L-1 and a rejected flux highly concentrated (in the range of 16-25 mg L-1 and 18-32 mg L-1 of each pharmaceutical for NF-90 and BW-30 membranes, respectively), when an initial stream of six pharmaceuticals was feeding to the membrane system (10 mg L-1 of each pharmaceutical). The abatement of concentrated pharmaceuticals of the rejected stream was evaluated by means of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation using TiO2 and Fe2O3/SBA-15 in presence of hydrogen peroxide as photo-Fenton system. Both photocatalytic treatments showed remarkable removals of pharmaceutical compounds, achieving values between 80 and 100%. The nicotine was the most refractory pollutant of all the studied pharmaceuticals. Photo-Fenton treatment seems to be more effective than TiO2 photocatalysis, as high mineralization degree and increased nicotine removal were attested. This work can be considered an interesting approach of coupling membrane separation and heterogeneous photocatalytic technologies for the successful abatement of pharmaceutical compounds in effluents of wastewater treatment plants.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic pharmaceutical which is commonly found in environmental matrices. It passes through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) almost completely unaffected and has been found to be highly persistent in the environment. The application of sludge in agricultural fields and the use of WWTP effluents for irrigation constitute a potential source of soil contamination. Consequently, the assessment of the interaction between carbamazepine and soils is of crucial importance to understand its fate in the environment. To monitor the sorption behavior of carbamazepine onto agricultural soils, batch equilibrium experiments were performed using soils subjected to distinct long-term fertilizations. In order to follow the adsorption experiments, an UV spectral deconvolution methodology was applied and the results compared with those from micellar electrokinetic chromatography. The results obtained by both methods did not present significant statistical differences at 95% confidence level. Therefore, it was proven that, in the context of adsorption studies, UV spectral deconvolution is a valid alternative to common chromatographic methods, with the major advantage of being a simple and fast procedure. The adsorption of carbamazepine onto the selected soils was satisfactorily described by the Freundlich model. The obtained Freundlich parameters (K-F) (between 1.79 +/- 0.07 and 4.8 +/- 0.2 mg kg(-1) (mg L-1)(-N)) indicate that the adsorption behavior of carbamazepine is dependent on the soil fertilization. Also, it is not extensively sorbed, indicating that carbamazepine present in soils can be a potential source of contamination of surface and ground waters through run-off and infiltration.

AB The extensive production and consumption of pharmaceutical antibiotics are bringing serious environmental issues. Photocatalytic reaction has been emerging as an environment-friendly and effectively means for treating virous pollutants. Herein, we developed an effective photocatalytic system involving a novel plasmonic p-n heterojunction catalyst of Ag/Ag6Si2O7/Bi2MoO6 to efficiently eliminate environmental pharmaceutical pollutants, where the catalyst was synthesized via the in-situ growth of Ag/p-Ag6Si2O7 nanoparticles on n-Bi2MoO6 microspheres during a controlled precipitation-photoreduction process. As we predicted, the optimized plasmonic p-n heterojunction of Ag/Ag6Si2O7/Bi2MoO6 (AASO/BMO-3) shows a remarkable improved photocatalytic performance in eliminating ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). The reasons behind this fact is (1) the formation of p-n heterojunction between Ag6Si2O7 and Bi2MoO6 and (2) the precipitation of Ag nanoparticles with a plasmonic effect on Ag6Si2O7/Bi2MoO6, which made Ag/Ag6Si2O7/Bi2MoO6 possess a better capacity to efficiently separate the photogenerated carriers and utilize the visible-light. Moreover, superoxide free radicals (O-center dot(2)-) and photo-excited holes (h(+)) were determined to be the main active species in degrading antibiotics by the results of quenching and ESR tests. In addition, relevant experiment results indicated that the direct contact between AASO/BMO-3 and antibiotics also played an important role in the efficient elimination of antibiotics. This work gives a new plasmonic p-n heterojunction of Ag/Ag6Si2O7/Bi2MoO6 with an effective degradation and mineralization ability towards broad-spectrum antibiotics in aqueous solutions, further enriching the possibility of applying photocatalytic technology to treat wastewater containing pharmaceutical antibiotics.

AB The present study investigates a synergistic adsorption/photodegradation technique catalyzed by a pectin/chitosan/zinc oxide (Pec/CS/ZnO) nanocomposite for the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) in aqueous solutions under direct sunlight. The Pec/CS/ZnO nanocomposite was prepared by an inotropic gelation method and was characterized using different techniques. The adsorption/photocatalytic activity of the Pec/CS/ZnO nanocomposite for the remediation of CBZ was optimized using Box-Behnken design under response surface methodology. The examined parameters included the amount of Pec/CS/ZnO nanocomposite (0.25-0.75 g L-1), pH (4-10), and run time for adsorption/photo-irradiation (1-5 hours). The efficiency of CBZ degradation was calculated in terms of changes in CBZ concentration using a validated chromatographic assay. The optimum conditions for the remediation of CBZ were 0.5 g L-1 Pec/CS/ZnO nanocomposite, pH 4, and 3 hour run time. Under such conditions, the degradation efficiency of 10 mg L-1 CBZ was found to be 69.5% with a rate constant (k) of 0.00737 min(-1) and half-life time of 94 min. The efficiency of the Pec/CS/ZnO nanocomposite for CBZ remediation was found to be stable and consistent after three cycles of reuse. The presence of other pharmaceutical contaminants such as acetaminophen in wastewater samples was also investigated. The efficiency of CBZ degradation was not significantly affected by the addition of acetaminophen in a 0-15 mg L-1 concentration range which confirmed the selectivity and efficiency of the proposed method for CBZ degradation and removal.

AB The wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the biggest reservoirs of pharmaceutical residues discharged into the environment. Among many pharmaceuticals, derivatives of 5-nitrofuran, whose cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity have been proved, are widely used. The ability of such compounds to accumulate in water and sediments motivated us to analyze the ability of microbial communities of rural and municipal WWTPs to eliminate nitrofurantoin (NFT), nitrofurazone (NFZ), furaltadone (FTD), and furazolidone (FZD). Metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in rural and municipal activated sludge has provided information about the bacterial biodiversity in the WWTPs. In both samples, the most dominant phylum in terms of abundance was Proteobacteria followed by Bacteroidetes; however, microbial community of the municipal WWTP exhibited greater biodiversity than the one of the rural WWTP. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis of the samples and elimination kinetic calculations allowed the determination of FZD, FTD, NFT, and NFZ elimination half-time varying from 104 to 327 h and test system first-order half-lives in the examined WWTP samples (from 31 to 231 h). Moreover, a comparison of the effectiveness of the microbials from two treatment plants, a rural one and a municipal one, revealed the poorer performance of the microbial communities from the smaller, rural WWTP in disposal of the analyzed pharmaceuticals, as after 24 days, the rural WWTP community was able to eliminate from 20 to 62% of 5-nitrofuran derivatives, while the municipal consortium removed over 85% of the compounds from the cultures.

AB Microalgae-mediated biodegradation of antibiotics has recently gained increased attention from international scientific community. However, limited information is available regarding microalgae-mediated biodegradation of SMX in a co-metabolic system. Here we investigated the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by five algal species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Scenedesmus obliquus, Scenedesmus acuminatus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa), and its transformation pathways by C. pyrenoidosa in a sodium acetate (3 mM) co-metabolic system. The results showed that the highest SMX dissipation (14.9%) was detected by C. pyrenoidosa after 11 days of cultivation among the five tested algal species in the absence of other carbon sources. The addition of sodium acetate (0-8 mM) significantly enhanced the dissipation efficiency of SMX (0.4 mu M) from 6.05% to 99.3% by C. pyrenoidosa after 5 days of cultivation, and the dissipation of SMX followed the first-order kinetic model with apparent rate constants (k) ranging from 0.0107 to 0.9811 d(-1). Based on the results of mass balance analysis, biodegradation by C. pyrenoidosa was the main mechanism for the dissipation of SMX in the culture medium. Fifteen phase I and phase II metabolites were identified, and subsequently the transformation pathway was proposed, including oxidation, hydroxylation, formylation and side chain breakdown, as well as pterin-related conjugation. The majority of metabolites of SMX were only observed in the culture medium and varied with cultivation time. The findings of the present study showed effective co-metabolism of a sulfonamide by microalgae, and it may be applied in the aquatic environment remediation and wastewater treatment in the future.

AB Sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic with the high potential for propagation of the antibiotic resistance genes in the environment which pose a serious health effect on human health. The present work deals with the treatment of sulfamethoxazole by employing photocatalytic degradation. TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles were used as catalysts. The morphology and structure of catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of various operating parameters such as catalyst dosage, pH value, initial pollutant concentration, and irradiation source on the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was investigated. It was found out that acidic medium is better for degradation of sulfamethoxazole and hence optimum pH value for UV/TiO2 and UV/WO3 were 4 and 3, respectively. The optimum dosage of TiO2 and WO3 was 500 and 750 mg/l that resulted in removal efficiency of 61.28% and 43.3%, respectively. The effect of initial concentration was also studied: increasing the sulfamethoxazole concentration from 25 to 100 mg/l caused a reduction in removal efficiency. Moreover, it was found that the highest activation of TiO2 was in the presence of UVC irradiation and WO3 in the presence of halogen lamps. Also, the removal of sulfamethoxazole from actual hospital wastewater was studied. The results indicated that photocatalytic degradation was still effective even if the removal efficiency was lowered. TOC analysis proved that although sulfamethoxazole was completely removed from the synthetic solution, secondary photostability pollutants were generated. The obtained results revealed that pseudo-first-order model best fitted experimental data at various irradiation sources considered.

AB Following human excretion and limited removal with wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals are accumulating in rivers worldwide. These chemicals can challenge the health of fish and aquatic organisms and since rivers provide drinking water sources, there is concern for cumulative exposure to humans. In this study, we discovered that sandbar willow (Salix exigua), a predominant riparian shrub along streams throughout North America, has the capacity to quickly remove pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions. Our study tracked [H-3]- or [C-14]-labeled substances including 17-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen in oral contraceptives; the antihypertensive, diltiazem (DTZ); and the anti-anxiety drug, diazepam (DZP); and for comparison, atrazine (ATZ), a root-absorbed herbicide. In growth chambers, willow saplings removed 40-80% of the substances from solutions in 24h. Following uptake, the EE2 and DTZ were retained within the roots, while DZP and ATZ were partly passed on to the shoots. The absorbed EE2 was unextractable and apparently bound to the root tissue, while DTZ, DZP, and ATZ remained largely soluble (extractable). The uptake and translocation of the pharmaceuticals, reflected in the transpiration stream and root concentration factors, were reasonably predicted from their physicochemical properties, including octanol-water partitioning coefficients. These findings suggest the removal of pharmaceuticals as an unrecognized ecosystem service provided by riparian vegetation and especially the inundation tolerant sandbar willow. This encourages the conservation of riparian willows that line riverbanks, to remove pharmaceuticals and other contaminants. This phytoremediation also encourages the preservation of complex, braided channels and islands, which increase the extent of stream shorelines and riparian willows.

AB The North American Great Lakes are a vital natural resource that provide fish and wildlife habitat, as well as drinking water and waste assimilation services for millions of people. Tributaries to the Great Lakes receive chemical inputs from various point and nonpoint sources, and thus are expected to have complex mixtures of chemicals. However, our understanding of the co-occurrence of specific chemicals in complex mixtures is limited. To better understand the occurrence of specific chemical mixtures in the US Great Lakes Basin, surface water from 24 US tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes was collected and analyzed for diverse suites of organic chemicals, primarily focused on chemicals of concern (e.g., pharmaceuticals, personal care products, fragrances). A total of 181 samples and 21 chemical classes were assessed for mixture compositions. Basin wide, 1664 mixtures occurred in at least 25% of sites. The most complex mixtures identified comprised 9 chemical classes and occurred in 58% of sampled tributaries. Pharmaceuticals typically occurred in complex mixtures, reflecting pharmaceutical-use patterns and wastewater facility outfall influences. Fewer mixtures were identified at lake or lake-influenced sites than at riverine sites. As mixture complexity increased, the probability of a specific mixture occurring more often than by chance greatly increased, highlighting the importance of understanding source contributions to the environment. This empirically based analysis of mixture composition and occurrence may be used to focus future sampling efforts or mixture toxicity assessments. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB Safe management of hazardous metals deriving from solid wastes constitutes an important environmental challenge. In the present study, recent progress in the stabilization/solidification of heavy metals from various solid wastes into ceramics and glass-ceramic materials is reviewed. Coal/lignite-fired power plant fly and bottom ashes, steel industry by-products, metallurgical and urban/municipal wastewater sludge, and pharmaceutical wastes are included. The environmental behavior of the ceramics produced is studied via several leaching tests and ecotoxicological analyses. The goal is to assess the potential of these materials for retention of pollutants into their microstructure, for safe use as building materials. These objectives are in line with green chemistry and sustainable development principles. Moreover, the aim of turning waste into useful feedstock for another industrial sector towards symbiosis, ample coordination, and circular economy, is strongly encouraged by current environmental policies. Such secondary resources can be considered as substitute materials in ceramics production, as they contain useful oxides. However, the presence of heavy metals remains a significant environmental issue. Possible leaching of pollutants caused by rain from construction materials incorporating solid wastes would lead to contamination of surface and subsurface water, thus raising critical environmental concerns. Inertization of potentially hazardous metals into environmentally-friendly ceramics and glass-ceramics is shown to be feasible, as concentrations of these elements in the leachates remain within acceptable limits. Certainly, this also depends on the leaching method employed and system parameters. In conclusion, stabilization of these elements into ceramic matrices can be an effective and beneficial alternative for protecting human health and the environment.

AB In this work electrogenerated active chlorine was used to treat fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics that is highly consumed and frequently found in waste and natural waters. Taking into account the structural variety and diverse molecular forms of these pharmaceuticals, their structure-reactivity relationship toward active chlorine was studied. Three representative fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and levofloxacin were considered. Despite structural differences, the primary by-products evidenced that the major reactive part of fluoroquinolones was the piperazyl ring. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were degraded faster than levofloxacin, due to the fact that secondary amines on ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were more reactive toward active chlorine than tertiary amines on levofloxacin. The reactivity of cationic and neutral fdrms of the fluoroquinolones was also evaluated using both experimental and theoretical procedures. Experimental results evidenced that the neutral forms have higher degradation rates than the cationic structures. Theoretical analysis of net charge on atoms (obtained by the natural bonding orbitals method) indicated that the reactive moieties on the neutral form of antibiotics have a high nudeophilicity. Therefore, this form is more susceptible to electrophilic attacks by chlorine species than the cationic one. Additionally, the environmental impact was evaluated considering the evolution of antimicrobial activity and its correlation with the antibiotics transformations. Finally, simulated hospital wastewater containing norfloxacin was treated. The electrogenerated active chlorine removed 100% of the antimicrobial activity in a short period (40 min), indicating that this system is an interesting option for treating hospital wastewaters and decreasing the negative environmental impact of the input of fluoroquinolones into natural media.

AB Ball milling was used to prepare two ultrafine magnetic biochar/Fe3O4 and activated carbon (AC)/Fe3O4 hybrid materials targeted for use in pharmaceutical removal by adsorption and mechanochemical degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. Both hybrid adsorbents prepared after 2 h milling exhibited high removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), and were easily separated magnetically. These adsorbents exhibited fast adsorption of CBZ and tetracycline (TC) in the initial 1 h. The biochar/Fe3O4 had a maximum adsorption capacity of 62.7 mg/g for CBZ and 94.2 mg/g for TC, while values obtained for AC/Fe3O4 were 135.1 mg/g for CBZ and 45.3 mg/g for TC respectively when data were fitted using the Langmuir expression. Solution pH values slightly affected the sorption of TC on the adsorbents, while CBZ sorption was almost pH-independent. The spent adsorbents with adsorbed CBZ and TC were milled to degrade the adsorbed pollutants. The adsorbed TC itself was over 97% degraded after 3 h of milling, while about half of adsorbed CBZ were remained. The addition of quartz sand was found to improve the mechanochemical degradation of CBZ on biochar/Fe3O4, and its degradation percent was up to 98.4% at the dose of 0.3 g quarts sand/g adsorbent. This research provided an easy method to prepare ultrafine magnetic adsorbents for the effective removal of typical pharmaceuticals from water or wastewater and degrade them using ball milling.

AB Metformin (MET) as an emerging contaminant has been detected in surface water and wastewater in numerous countries, due to insufficient retention in classical waste water treatment plants. In order to characterize the uptake of the compound during phytotreatment of waste water, a short term Pitman chamber experiment was carried out to assess the characteristics of MET uptake and transport by roots. Three different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mmol L-1) were applied to cattail (Typha latifolia) and reed (Phragmites australis) roots which were used to investigate the uptake mechanism because they are frequently utilized in phytoremediation. In addition, quinidine was used as an inhibitor to assess the role of organic cation transporters (OCTs) in the uptake of MET by T. latifolia. The transport process of MET is different from carbamazepine (CBZ) and caffeine (CFN). In both T. latifolia and P. australis, the uptake processes were independent of initial concentrations. Quinidine, a known inhibitor of organic cation transporters, can significantly affect MET uptake by T. latifolia roots with inhibition ratios of 70-74%. Uptake into the root could be characterized by a linear model with R-2 values in the range of 0.881-0.999. Overall, the present study provides evidence that MET is taken up by plant roots and has the potential for subsequent translocation. OCTs could be one of the important pathways for MET uptake into the plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study described an analytical method for the identification of common phase II pharmaceutical metabolites in reclaimed water using liquid chromatography high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry after solid phase extraction (SPE). Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated at resolution of 70000 in MS mode and 35000 in data-dependent MS/MS mode, without using lock mass. Firstly, parent drugs and their metabolites were tentatively identified based on accurate mass using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm. A detailed examination of the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for all potential metabolites revealed the presence of two phase II metabolites of sulfamethoxazole, acetylsulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide in reclaimed water. Secondly, the high resolution data-dependent MS/MS spectra of each compound were further investigated using metabolic profiling software. After comparing characteristic ions obtained in MS/MS mode with those predicted by the software and reported in previous studies, the two phase II metabolites were positively identified in reclaimed water. Lastly, the two metabolites were detected and quantified in the reclaimed water samples collected during a period of one month. As a result, averaged concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, acetylsulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide were calculated at 2848 +/- 1367 ng L-1, 1980 +/- 1410 ng L-1, and 2859 +/- 1526 ng L-1, respectively. The two metabolites represented 54% of the source of sulfamethoxazole in reclaimed water suggesting the importance of measuring pharmaceutical metabolites in the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first known report of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide surviving intact through wastewater treatment plants and occurring in environmental water samples.

AB The distribution coefficient (K-D) for the human drug carbamazepine was measured using a non-equilibrium technique. Repacked soil columns were prepared using an Airport silt loam (Typic Natrustalf) with an average organic matter content of 2.45%. Carbamazepine solutions were then leached through the columns at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mL min(-1) representing average linear velocities of 1.8, 3.5 and 5.3 cm h(-1) respectively. Each flow rate was replicated three times and three carbamazepine pulses were applied to each column resulting in a total of 9 columns with 27 total carbamazepine pulses. Breakthrough curves were used to determine K-D using the parameter fitting software CXTFIT. Results indicate that as flow rate decreased from 5.3 to 1.8 cm h(-1), K-D increased an average of 21%. Additionally, K-D determined by column leaching (14.7-22.7 L kg(-1)) was greater than K-D determined by a 2 h batch equilibrium adsorption (12.6 L kg(-1)). Based on these K-D's carbamazepine would be generally characterized as non-mobile in the soil investigated. However, repeated carbamazepine applications resulted in an average 22% decrease in K-D between the first and third applications. Decreasing K-D is attributed to differences in sorption site kinetics and carbamazepine residence time in contact with the soil. This would indicate that the repeated use of reclaimed wastewater at high application rates for long-term irrigation or groundwater recharge has the potential to lead to greater transport of carbamazepine than K-D determined by batch equilibrium would predict.

AB BACKGROUND: Large amounts of pharmaceutical compounds are consumed throughout the world, and after being metabolized in humans are discharged into water streams. Some of them are not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants and, as a result, they are found in some effluents as well as in surface and ground waters.
   RESULTS: Four pharmaceutical compounds (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin and phenacetin) frequently found in wastewaters were selected to be individually photo-oxidized in ultra-pure water by monochromatic UV radiation. The influence of independent variables (pH, temperature, and additional presence of hydrogen peroxide) was established, and first-order rate constants and quantum yields evaluated. The compounds were also oxidized using Fenton's reagent and, after establishing the influence of the operating conditions (ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide concentrations, pH and additional presence of UV radiation), the rate constants for the radical reaction between each pharmaceutical and hydroxyl radicals were determined. Finally, the simultaneous photo-oxidation of mixtures of the selected pharmaceuticals in several types of water (commercial mineral water, groundwater and reservoir water) was performed by means of UV radiation alone and by the combination UV/H2O2. The influence of the independent variables in these processes was discussed, and the kinetic study allowed the determination of various rate constants for each compound.
   CONCLUSION: As the pharmaceutical concentrations theoretically calculated by the proposed kinetic model agree well with the experimental results obtained, this model constitutes an excellent tool to predict the elimination of these compounds when they are present in different natural waters.

AB The surging growth of the pharmaceutical industry is a result of the rapidly increasing human population, which has inevitably led to new biomedical and environmental issues. Aside from the quality control of pharmaceutical production and drug delivery, there is an urgent need for precise, sensitive, portable, and cost-effective technologies to track patient overdosing and to monitor ambient water sources and wastewater for pharmaceutical pollutants. The development of advanced nanomaterial-based electrochemical sensors and biosensors for the detection of pharmaceutical compounds has garnered immense attention due to their advantages, such as high sensitivity and selectivity, real-time monitoring, and ease of use. This review article surveys state-of-the-art nanomaterials-based electrochemical sensors and biosensors for the detection and quantification of six classes of significant pharmaceutical compounds, including anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-cancer drugs. Important factors such as sensor/analyte interactions, design rationale, fabrication, characterization, sensitivity, and selectivity are discussed. Strategies for the development of highperformance electrochemical sensors and biosensors tailored toward specific pharmaceuticals are highlighted to provide readers and scientists with an extensive toolbox for the detection of a wide range of pharmaceuticals. Our aims are two-fold: (i) to inspire readers by further elucidating the properties and functionalities of existing nanomaterials for the detection of pharmaceuticals; and (ii) to provide examples of the potential opportunities that these devices have for the advanced sensing of pharmaceutical compounds toward safeguarding human health and ecosystems on a global scale.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat micropollutants; thus, for 20 years, several complementary treatment systems, such as surface flow wetlands have been used to address this issue. Previous studies demonstrate that higher residence time and low global velocities promote nutrient removal rates or micropollutant photodegradation. Nevertheless, these studies were restricted to the system limits (inlet/outlet). Therefore, detailed knowledge of water flow is crucial for identifying areas that promote degradation and optimise surface flow wetlands. The present study combines 3D water flow numerical modelling and liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Using this numerical model, validated by tracer experimental data, several velocity areas were distinguished in the wetland. Four areas were selected to investigate the waterflow influence and led to the following results: on the one hand, the number and concentration of micropollutants are independent of the waterflow, which could be due to several assumptions, such as the chronic exposure associated with a low Reynolds number; on the other hand, the potential degradation products (metabolites) were also assessed in the sludge to investigate the micropollutant biodegradation processes occurring in the wetland; micropollutant metabolites or degradation products were detected in higher proportions (both number and concentration) in lower flow rate areas. The relation to higher levels of plant and microorganism metabolites suggests higher biological activity that promotes degradation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel kind of Zr based magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs) was prepared by immobilization of UiO-66 onto Fe3O4@SiO2 particles via an efficient one-pot solvothermal method. Subsequently, it was used for adsorptive removal of triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) fungicides from aqueous environments by magnetic solid phase separation. Morphology and physical/chemical features of the MMOFs were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and VSM etc., showing high specific surface area, appropriate functionality, and desirable magnetic property. Several main factors affecting the adsorption performances of TCS and TCC on the MMOFs were systematically investigated and optimized, such as pH value of water sample, amounts/types of adsorbent and salinity. Under the optimized conditions, short adsorption equilibrium time (only 25 min) and outstanding saturated adsorption capacities (476.27 and 602.40 mg.g(-1) for TCS and TCC, respectively) were the remarkable superiorities of the MMOFs compared with that of most reported adsorbents. The MMOFs demonstrated excellent adsorption selectivity for TCS and TCC and anti-interference ability. Also, the reusability for at least 11 cycles was another major profit of the MMOFs that saved cost and prevented waste. Moreover, the MMOFs demonstrated satisfactory removal/purification ability for actual environmental water samples. These benefits propounded a promising outlook of employing the MMOFs for influential removal of pollutants with considerable reliability in the field of wastewater treatment.

AB Amlodipine (AML), an antihypertensive drug, has raised great environmental concerns due to the widespread occurrence in wastewater for its extensive use. In this study, we introduced an effective approach for AML removal via an oxidation reaction with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by magnetic cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), and highlighted the governing role of PMS concentration in the degradation process. Nearly complete removal of 10 mu M AML (92.5%) was achieved in 30 min with 25 mu M PMS and 40 mg/L CoFe2O4 at neutral condition (pH 7.0), while the mineralization was negligible. To enhance the mineralization of AML, PMS concentration was further increased to 10 mM with the mineralization of 70.2%. A total of eight intermediates were identified using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analysis in combination with frontier electron densities calculations, and two major transformation pathways including hydroxylation and dehydrogenation were proposed. Temporal evolution of the intermediates was monitored, of which the differences were tracked as PMS concentration increased from 25 mu M to 1.2 mM. Toxicity changes throughout the degradation process were assessed on ECOSAR program, indicating that higher PMS concentration of 1.2 mM led to further reduction of potential threats, although the toxicity of some intermediates with pyridine structure needs to be further validated. Based on the findings in this study, CoFe2O4/PMS appears to be a promising alternative to remove AML from aquatic environment when appropriate PMS concentration is selected for more pronounced performance.

AB As a result of the widespread use of antibiotics, a large amount of excretions from human and animals, containing antibiotic residues, is discharged into aquatic environments, leading to potential adverse effects on the ecosystems' health. These residues' impact on seasonally ice-covered rivers remains under investigated. To understand the environmental fate of antibiotics with high-detection frequencies and concentration levels, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, and florfenicol were used as models in the present study. A Level IV fugacity model was established and applied to a seasonally ice-covered river receiving municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, the Songhua River in Northeast China. Model validation and sensitivity analysis suggested that the fugacity model could successfully simulate the monitoring concentration within an average difference of one logarithmic unit. The advection process played a major role in the transport and attenuation of the antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. The scenario simulation indicated that increasing the targeted antibiotic concentrations in WWTP effluents to gL(-1) could keep the targeted antibiotic concentrations higher than 10ngL(-1) in the receiving river from the WWTP discharge source to 25km downstream. This finding also demonstrates that the depth of water and ice, as well as flow velocity, play key roles in the fate of antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. To our best knowledge, this is the first major study to combine experimental investigation with modeling to explore the environmental behaviors and fate of antibiotics in such a river.

AB Macrolide antibiotics are one of the major groups of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants that have been detected in aquatic systems. Photocatalytic degradation under UV light is useful for mineralization of various pharmaceutical pollutants but very limited studies are available for degradation of azithromycin (AZY) using visible light. In the present study, a novel ZrO2/Ag@TiO2 nanorod ternary nanocomposite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal and photodeposition method for efficient degradation of AZY under visible light. The composite was detailed characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM analyses, which revealed the formation of cubic ZrO2 and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 nanorods (TNR). More than 90% of azithromycin (20 mg/L) was degraded after 8 h of visible light irradiation. The plausible transformation pathway for azithromycin was proposed based on the LC/MS-IT-TOF analysis. The phytotoxicity evaluation of the azithromycin and its degraded products was assessed on Vigna radiata. The germination index (GI) of azithromycin was found to be 12.3% before degradation while it increased to 81.05% after 8 h of degradation, indicating this photodegradation process achieved nearly complete detoxification. Furthermore, the toxicity of the degradation products was determined on the basis of Escherichia coli colony forming unit assay which confirmed high detoxification efficiency. Thus, this work demonstrated an efficient strategy for visible light degradation and detoxification of azithromycin, which provided new insight on macrolide antibiotic photodegradation and would be promising for antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB This work analyzes the effect of nalidixic acid (NAL) on the kinetics of the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass growth within a "NIPHO" activated sludge reactor treating municipal wastewater. Thus, the effect of this chemical in the degradation rates of carbon and nitrogen sources and net biomass growth rate is evaluated. Activated sludge samples were taken at three different operation conditions, changing the values of hydraulic retention time (2.8-3.8 h), biomass concentration (1400-1700 mgVSS L-1), temperature (12.6-14.8 degrees C), and sludge retention time (11.0-12.6 day). A respirometric method was applied to model the kinetic performance of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass in absence and presence of NAL, and a multivariable statistical analysis was carried out to characterize the influence of the operation variables on the kinetic response of the system, which was finally optimized. The results showed that there was no inhibitory effect of NAL on heterotrophic biomass, with an increase of net heterotrophic biomass growth rate from 1.70 to 6.73 mgVSS L-1 h(-1) at the most favorable period. By contrast, the autotrophic biomass was negatively affected by NAL, reducing the value of net autotrophic biomass growth rate from 25.37 to 10.29 mgVSS L-1 h(-1) at the best operation conditions. In general, biomass concentration and temperature had the highest influence on the degradation rate of carbon and nitrogen sources, whereas hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time were the most influential on net heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass growth rates.

AB The presence of organic micropollutants (MPs) in the aquatic environment is strongly related to their difficult elimination by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, alternative treatment technologies are required to overcome this problem. In this domain, constructed wetlands (CWs) have gained increasing attention in the last years, mainly due to the low-cost, simple operation/maintenance and environmental friendliness of these systems. However, studies on the application of CWs to remove MPs from freshwater aquaculture effluents are still scarce. In this work, planted (Phragmites australis) vertical subsurface flow CWs, at microcosm scale, were investigated for the removal of MPs found in non-spiked freshwater aquaculture effluents, namely atrazine, isoproturon, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC). A wider multi-component set of 36 MPs was also studied by adding these MPs at 100 ng L-1 to the same matrix (alachlor, atrazine, chlorfenvinphos, isoproturon, PFOS, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diclofenac, methiocarb, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, EHMC, simazine, atorvastatin, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, cephalexin, ceftiofur, citalopram, clindamycin, clofibric acid, diphenhydramine, enrofloxacin, fluoxetine, ketoprofen, metoprolol, norfluoxetine, ofloxacin, propranolol, tramadol, trimethoprim, venlafaxine, and warfarin). High weekly removal efficiencies (N87%) were observed for all MPs in both non-spiked and spiked experiments, with the exception of EHMC (removal rates between 0 and 86%). These results emphasize the potential of CWs to remove MPs from freshwater aquaculture effluents, but also the need to enhance the performance of these systems for the elimination of some recalcitrant MPs, such as EHMC, which was found at high concentrations in the studied effluents.

AB The degradation of 0.20 mM sulfamethazine (SMT) solutions was investigated by heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process using pyrite as source of Fe2+ (catalyst) and pH regulator in an undivided electro-chemical cell equipped either with a Pt or a BDD anode and carbon-felt as cathode. Effect of pyrite concentration and applied current on the oxidative degradation kinetics and mineralization efficiency has been studied. The higher oxidation power of the process, named "Pyrite-EF" using BDD anode was demonstrated. Pyrite-EF showed a better performance for the oxidation/mineralization of the drug SMT in comparison to the classic EF process: 95% and 87% TOC removal by Pyrite-EF with BDD and Pt anodes, respectively, versus 90% and 83% by classical EF with BDD and Pt anodes, respectively. The rate constant of the oxidation of SMT by (OH)-O-center dot was determined by the competition kinetics method and found to be 1.87 x 10(9) mol(-1) L s(-1). Based on the identified reaction intermediates by HPLC and GS-MS, as well as released SO42-, NH4+ and NO3- ions, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed for the mineralization of SMT during Pyrite-EF process. Toxicity assessment by means of Microtox method revealed the formation of some toxic intermediates during the treatment. However, toxicity of the solution was removed at the end of treatment.

AB Heavy organic pollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals are found in wastewater and are difficult to remove by microporous adsorbents because of their large size. Mesoporous organosilicas as potential adsorbents for removal of heavy organic pollutants from aqueous phase are investigated. Propylsulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica (SBA-15-SO3H) and propylsulfonic acid-functionalized periodic mesoporous benzene-silica (Ph-PMO-SO3H) are prepared by co-condensation method. Textural and structural characterizations are conducted by X-ray diffraction, N-2 physisorption, solid state NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and confirmed the structural integrity of the materials. Material adsorption behaviors are studied in pesticide, mesosulfuron methyl (MM), removal from aqueous phase. For all the materials, adsorption kinetics are well described by a pseudo-second order model indicating the chemisorption of the MM molecules via acid-basic interaction of the neutral form. Sorption isotherms are 5-shape isotherms and can be well fitted by the Freundlich model. Ph-PMO-SO3H exhibits higher sorption rate (8.95 mg g(-1) h(-1)) and better sorption capacity (9.70 mg g(-1)) than the mesoporous silica SBA-15-SO3H (4.16 mg g(-1) h(-1), 9.4 mg g(-1)). Furthermore, Ph-PMO-SO3H has also the best MM abatement rates in aqueous phase up to 95% for initial concentrations ranging from 4 to 10 ppm than microporous acidic zeolite (HFAU) (similar to 70%) and mesoporous silica SBA-15-SO3H (similar to 70%). The phenyl groups in sulfonic PMO material seem to enhance organic pollutant adsorption capacity either by reducing wall hydrophilicity or by favoring the interaction with MM phenyl rings.

AB By using the metal reducing capacities of bacteria, Pd nanoparticles can be produced in a sustainable way ('bio-Pd'). These bio-Pd nanoparticles can be used as a catalyst in, for example, dehalogenation reactions. However, some halogenated compounds are not efficiently degraded using a bio-Pd catalyst. This study shows that the activity of bio-Pd can be improved by doping with Au(0) ('bio-Pd/Au'). In contrast with bio-Pd, bio-Pd/Au could perform the removal of the model pharmaceutical compound diclofenac from an aqueous medium in batch experiments at neutral pH and with H-2 as the hydrogen donor (first order decay constant of 0.078 +/- 0.009 h(-1)). Dehalogenation was for both catalysts the only observed reaction. For bio-Pd/Au, a disproportional increase of catalytic activity was observed with increasing Pd-content of the catalyst. In contrast, when varying the Au-content of the catalyst, a Pd/Au mass ratio of 50/1 showed the highest catalytic activity (first order decay value of 0.52 +/- 0.02 h(-1)). The removal of 6.40 mu g L-1 diclofenac from a wastewater treatment plant effluent using bio-Pd was not possible even after prolonged reaction time. However, by using the most active bio-Pd/Au catalyst, 43.8 +/- 0.5% of the initially present diclofenac could be removed after 24 h. This study shows that doping of bio-Pd nanoparticles with Au(0) can be a promising approach for the reductive treatment of wastewaters containing halogenated contaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A useful source tracking approach that has emerged over the past few years involves detection of human-specific chemicals found in wastewaters and septage. Chemicals specific to human wastewaters offer some potential advantages over biologically based methods: they are generally faster to prepare and analyze; they are more source-specific because they are not confounded by regrowth in the environment; and chemicals may be more geographically and temporally stable. However, chemicals have received less scrutiny to date, often require specialized equipment, and sample processing is usually more expensive. Additionally, many chemicals specific to human waste streams may occur at concentrations low enough to be diluted below detection limits once the waste stream enters the ambient environment. This chapter describes the different classes of wastewater chemicals and explores the advantages, disadvantages of each as potential source tracking candidates. While no single chemical has emerged as the best, there are several viable candidates for source tracking applications. For initial water sample screenings, optical brighteners (OBs) in detergents have shown considerable promise. Although not as sensitive as most microbial assessments, OBs can be measured with a handheld fluorometer, providing near real-time and relatively inexpensive tracking of signals in the field if the sample contains an OB concentration large enough to produce a measurable signal. Fecal sterols and stanols have been found to work best for source attribution, correlating with fecal indicator bacteria and providing discrimination between humans and several other fecal sources.

AB Water pollution is a serious global issue. Rhodamine B (RhB) is one of the most commonly used colorants in textiles, cosmetic and the pharmaceutical industry. Its release into natural environment is not only hazardous to aquatic life, but also carcinogenic to humans and animals. Thus, the removal of RhB is of great importance to water purification and conservation. This work was performed to remove RhB wastewater by electrochemical oxidization method. The electrochemical oxidation of RhB was set at 1.3 V according to cyclic voltammograms (CVs) experiments. The experimental results illustrated that RhB solution could be rapidly removed. Decolorization of RhB by potentiostatic experiments was fitted to be pseudo first-order reaction. The apparent activation energy was calculated as 16.61 +/- 0.99 kJ mol(-1). Kinetic parameters such as the diffusion coefficient D, electron transfer number and the transfer coefficients beta at 298 K were 8.24 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s, 0.91 and 0.449 separately. The electrochemical reaction was a single electron process. The current-time integral curve manifested that the total electric quantity consumed was only 3.61 C compared with theoretically full oxidation electrical charge quantity 126.45 C in anode cell. Sediments by electropolymerization reaction largely decreased COD value and the electrical energy consumption. Furthermore, the changes of acute toxicity of the RhB degradation to Vibrio fischeri were also examined for the purpose of investigating the potential risk of RhB degradation products to aquatic organisms. The results showed that biotoxicity of the final solution was much lower than that of the original RhB solution. All these proved that electrochemical degradation of RhB was feasible because of its an energy-saving and low biotoxicity.

AB A tube-in-tube membrane reactor, operating with radial addition of H2O2, was employed for the intensification of heterogeneous H2O2/TiO2 photocatalytic processes. Polluted water is continuously fed into the annular space between the shell side of an ultrafiltration membrane and an outer quartz tube. The membrane shell-side surface is coated with a thin-film of TiO2-P25. The oxidant (H2O2) is internally fed to the membrane, which permeates through the membrane pores, being dosed and uniformly delivered to the active catalyst sites. Radiation is externally supplied via four UVC or UVA lamps. The helical movement of water around the membrane shell side improves the radial dispersion of the oxidant, promoting efficiently its UVC photolytic cleavage into %OH within the annular reaction zone. Tests were performed using pure water and a secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, both spiked with 100 mu g L-1 of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The efficiency of the photochemical (UVC and UVC/H2O2) processes was first assessed as a function of H2O2 dose. Then, E2 and EE2 photocatalytic oxidation efficiency by UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2/TiO2 was evaluated according to the amount of TiO2-P25 deposited on the outer surface of the membrane, H2O2 dose, H2O2 addition mode, light source and aqueous solution matrix. The UVC/H2O2/TiO2 system with radial H2O2 addition showed the highest oxidation ability, resulting in E2 and EE2 removal percentages of 51/32% and 48/30%, respectively, for the synthetic/real matrices, using a low UVC fluence (45 mJ cm(-2)).

AB Accelerating the rate-limiting step of Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion is a major challenge for H2O2 decomposition in conventional Fenton process. In this study, the catalytic mechanism of H2O2 by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles and Fe3+ ions was revealed and the abatement of organic micropollutants was investigated. The presence of both MoS2 and Fe3+ can efficiently decompose H2O2. Reaction system of H2O2/MoS2/Fe3+ is found to remove most of the tested pollutants by over 80% (except 65.9% for carbamazepine) within 60 min at pH of 3.0. Effective pH range of this reaction system can be extended to pH of 5.0. Adding MoS2 to Fe3+/H2O2 system promotes the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle and improves the reaction rate between Fe3+ and H2O2. The formation of Mo6+ ions and Mo6+ peroxo-complexes is beneficial to H2O2 decomposition and pollutant degradation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and quenching experiments confirm the important role of hydroxyl radicals in H2O2/MoS2/Fe3+ system. Chloride ions (Cl-) promote degradation, while bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) inhibit degradation. As H2O2 concentration increases from nil to 1.0 mM, the value of total EE/O decreases from 0.083 to 0.003 kWh L-1, and the most energy efficient condition is determined. This study provides a new pathway for efficient decomposition of H2O2 by Fe3+ ions in an extended pH range, which is considered a facile and promising strategy for wastewater treatment.

AB Globally, protected areas offer refugia for a broad range of taxa including threatened and endangered species. In the United States (US), the National Park Service (NPS) manages public lands to preserve biodiversity, but increasing park visitation and development of surrounding landscapes increase exposure to and effects from bioactive contaminants. The risk (exposure and hazard) to NPS protected-stream ecosystems within the highly urbanized southeast region (SER) from bioactive contaminants was assessed in five systems based on 334 pesticide and pharmaceutical analytes in water and 119 pesticides in sediment. Contaminant mixtures were common across all sampled systems, with approximately 24% of the unique analytes (80/334) detected at least once and 15% (49/334) detected in half of the surface-water samples. Pharmaceuticals were observed more frequently than pesticides, consistent with riparian buffers and concomitant spatial separation from non-point pesticide sources in four of the systems. To extrapolate exposure data to biological effects space, site-specific cumulative exposure-activity ratios (Sigma(EAR)) were calculated for detected surface-water contaminants with available ToxCast data; common exceedances of a 0.001 Sigma(EAR) effects-screening threshold raise concerns for molecular toxicity and possible, sub-lethal effects to non-target, aquatic vertebrates. The results illustrate the need for continued management of protected resources to reduce contaminant exposure and preserve habitat quality, including prioritization of conservation practices (riparian buffers) near stream corridors and increased engagement with upstream/up-gradient property owners and municipal wastewater facilities.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4/Douglas fir biochar composites (MBC) were prepared with a 29.2% wt. Fe3O4 loading and used to treat As(III)-contaminated water. Toxicity of As(III) (inorganic) is significantly greater than As(V) and more difficult to remove from water. Removal efficiency was optimized verses pH, contact time and initial concentration. Column sorption and regeneration were also studied. Adsorption kinetics data best fitted the pseudo second order model (R-2 > 0.99). Adsorption was analyzed with three isotherm models at 20, 25 and 40 degrees C. The Sips isotherm showed the best fit at 25 degrees C with a 5.49 mg/g adsorption capacity, which is comparable with other adsorbents. MBC gave faster kinetics (similar to 1-1.5 h) at pH 7 and ambient temperature than previous adsorbents. The Gibbs free energy (Delta G) of this spontaneous As(III) adsorption was - 35 kJ/mol and Delta H = 70 kJ/mol was endothermic. Experiments were performed on industrial and laboratory wastewater samples in the presence of other co-existing contaminants (pharmaceutical residues, heavy metals ions and oxi-anions). The composite reduced the arsenic concentrations below the WHO's safe limit of 0.2 mg/L for waste water discharge. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies found As(III) and less toxic As(V) on Fe3O4 surfaces indicating adsorbed (or adsorbing) As(III) oxidation occurred upon contact with O-2 and possibly dissolved Fe(III) or upon drying under oxic conditions. Under anoxic conditions magnetite to maghemite transformation drives the oxidation. A pH-dependent surface chemisorption mechanism was proposed governing adsorption aided by XPS studies vs pH.

AB Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) are promising as a post-treatment for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. However, the effect of easily degradable carbon sources on the degradation of pharmaceuticals is unclear. This study shows the influence of acetate on the degradation of 26 pharmaceuticals in an MBBR was dose- and compound-dependent: while the degradation of venlafaxine, tramadol and ciprofloxacin was promoted (increase of reaction rate constant (k) by 133%, 212%, 55%) by acetate, its presence caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen, citalopram and diclofenac (decrease of k by 76%, 57%, 44%). The deconjugation of acetyl-sulfadiazine was clearly slowed down (decrease of k by 75%) by the dosed acetate, probably due to feedback inhibition by abundant acetate. 17 out of 25 tested compounds were found to be independent of the acetate dosage, which suggested dosing acetate induced minor effects on most of pharmaceuticals' removal. Enrichment of S- or first eluted enantiomer of 4 beta-blockers and the metabolite metoprolol acid was observed. Both non-enantioselective (rapid at elevated compound concentration) and enantioselective enzymes (slower and predominant at lower compound concentration) played a part in the biodegradation. High doses of acetate slowed down the enantiomeric enrichment of atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and metoprolol acid, which demonstrated that the acetate is able to up- or down-regulate enzymes involved in the enantioselective degradation of 13-blockers and thus reveals a complex co-metabolism relationship between transformation pathways of pharmaceuticals and carbon source.

AB Agricultural water withdrawals account for the largest proportion of global freshwater use. Increasing municipal water demands and droughts are straining agricultural water supplies. Therefore, alternative solutions to agricultural water crises are urgently needed, including the use of nontraditional water sources such as advanced treated wastewater or reclaimed water, brackish water, return flows, and effluent from produce processing facilities. However, it is critical to ensure that such usage does not compromise soil, crop, and public health. Here, we characterized five different nontraditional water types (n = 357 samples) for the presence of pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and disinfectants using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry based method (UPLC-MS/MS). We then evaluated whether the levels of these contaminants were influenced by season. The highest level of herbicides (atrazine) was detected in untreated pond water (median concentration 135.9 ng/L). Reclaimed water had the highest levels of antibiotics and stimulants including azithromycin (215 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (232.1 ng/L), and caffeine (89.4 ng/L). Produce processing plant water also tended to have high levels of atrazine (102.7 ng/L) and ciprofloxacin (80.1 ng/L). In addition, we observed seasonal variability across water types, with the highest atrazine concentrations observed during summer months, while the highest median azithromycin concentrations were observed in reclaimed water during the winter season. Further studies are needed to evaluate if economically feasible on-farm water treatment technologies can effectively remove such contaminants from nontraditional irrigation water sources.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are widely used as pain relief medicines are causing increasing environmental concern due to their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plant and potential toxicity on endocrine, kidney and reproduction in teleost fish. This study focused on the effects of widely used ibuprofen, diclofenac and paracetamol on the hatch and motor ability of early stage zebrafish, by exposing embryos to the target chemicals at 5, 50 and 500 mu g/L starting from 6 h postfertilization (hpf). A significant reduction in hatch rate at 55 hpf was caused by both ibuprofen (-63%) and diclofenac (-58%) at 500 mu g/L. Exposure to high concentration of ibuprofen significantly decreased the spontaneous movement by 25%, and reduced the free swimming distance, duration and speed under dark condition by 41%, 29% and 30%, respectively. High concentration of diclofenac also caused 23% decrease in spontaneous movement, and reduced the swimming distance as well as active duration by 17% and 13% under light stimulation. In comparison, the exposure to paracetamol did not cause any notable effect. Among neuron related genes tested, the expression of neurog1 was down-regulated from ibuprofen and diclofenac exposure by 19% and 26%, while the expression of neurod1 was up-regulated only by ibuprofen (31%). These findings indicated that ibuprofen and diclofenac significantly affected embryo locomotivity and were potentially neurotoxic, thus posing threats to zebrafish development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) has been widely used to generate sulfate radicals for degradation of water organic pollutants in previous studies. However, its impacts on disinfection byproduct formation during post-chlorination of degraded compounds is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of UV irradiation, PS oxidation, and the combined UV/PS advanced oxidation process (AOP) pre-treatments on halomethane formation during the following chlorination of chloramphenicol (CAP), a model antibiotic commonly found in wastewater-impacted water. Results showed that CAP could be transformed to more trichloromethane (TCM) than monochloromethane (MCM) and dichloromethane (DCM) in the presence of excess chlorine. UV photolysis, PS oxidation and UV/PS AOP all directly decomposed CAP to produce halomethanes (HMs) before post-chlorination. Moreover, UV and UV/PS pre-treatments both enhanced the formation of all the HMs in the subsequent chlorination. PS pre-oxidation decreased the TCM formation during post-chlorination, but increased the yields of MCM, DCM and total HMs. UV pre-irradiation significantly increased the bromide utilization of HMs, whereas UV/PS pre-oxidation decreased the bromine incorporation and utilization of HMs from the chlorination of CAP in a low-bromide water. UV irradiation, PS oxidation, and UV/PS AOP can inactivate pathogens and degrade organic pollutants, but this benefit should be weighed against a potential risk of the increased halomethane formation from degraded organic pollutants with and without post-chlorination.

AB This study investigates if ozonation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent can reduce the negative impacts of effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the adsorption of organic micro-pollutants (OMP) onto powdered activated carbon (PAC). Pre-treatment of the water included membrane filtration for the removal of suspended/colloidal organics, ozonation with various specific ozone consumptions, and subsequent OMP spiking to comparable initial concentrations in all of the ozonated waters. This approach allowed for comparative PAC adsorption tests. Adsorption analyses show that the adsorbability of EfOM decreases with increasing specific ozone consumptions. This is also reflected by liquid chromatography with online carbon and UV254 detection (LC-OCD) which shows the ozone-induced disintegration of large EfOM into smaller fragments. Also, small organic neutrals are decreased while the small organic acids peak continuously increases with rising specific ozone consumptions. UV254 demonstrates that the aromaticity of all LC-OCD fractions continuously declines together with increasing specific O-3 consumptions. This explains the varying EfOM adsorbabilities that occur due to ozonation. The ozone-induced decrease of EfOM adsorbability directly translates into reduced adsorption competition against the adsorption of OMP. With higher specific ozone consumptions, OMP removal and OMP loadings increase. The reduced adsorption competition is reflected in the outputs from equivalent background compound (EBC) modeling. In each of the ozonated waters, correlations between the OMP removals and the UV254 removal were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is often detected in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface waters within the ng/l range. There is, however, insufficient research evaluating potential hazards of fluoxetine in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. Taking into account that several SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) act as spawning inducers in bivalves, this study aimed at investigating the effects of fluoxetine exposure in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by assessing its potential to induce spawning at environmentally relevant concentrations (20 and 200 ng/l), as well as alterations of endogenous levels of testosterone and estradiol. Histological analyses of female and male gonads showed a concentration dependent decrease of oocyte and spermatozoan density, with a reduction in the number of oocytes per follicle of 40-70%, and spermatozoan density of 21-25%, relative to controls, following exposure to 20 and 200 ng/l of fluoxetine for 6 days, respectively. There was also a significant increase (1.5-fold) in the endogenous level of esterified estradiol in organisms exposed to 200 ng/l fluoxetine. Overall, the study shows that exposure to low levels of fluoxetine may effectively induce gamete liberation in the zebra mussel as well as alter endogenous levels of estradiol, and evidences the need of further investigating the potential of fluoxetine to alter the endocrine system of molluscs at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB Pharmaceutical products for humans and animals, as well as their related metabolites end up in the aquatic environment after use. Recent investigations show that concentrations of pharmaceuticals are detectable in the order of ng/l - mu g/l in municipal wastewater, groundwater and also drinking water. Little is known about the effects, and the hazard of long-term exposure to low concentrations of pharmaceuticals for non-target aquatic organisms.
   This study was designed to assess the ecotoxicity of furosemide, a potent diuretic agent, and its photoproduct in the aquatic environment. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, rotifers and microcrustaceans to assess acute and chronic toxicity. while the SOS Chromotest and the Ames test were utilized to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds.
   A first approach to risk characterization was to calculate the environmental impact of furosemide by measured environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration ratio (MEC/PNEC). To do so we used occurrence data reported in the literature and our toxicity results. The results showed that acute toxicity was in the order of mg/l for the crustaceans and absent for bacteria and rotifers. Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on the consumers, while the algae did not seem to be affected. A mutagenic potential was found for the photoproduct compared to the parental compound suggesting that byproducts ought to be considered in the environmental assessment of drugs. The risk calculated for furosemide suggested its harmlessness on the aquatic compartment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis, characteristics, and photocatalytic activity of zinc oxide
   nanoparticles stabilized on the stone surface for degradation of

AB Background: The presence of antibiotics such as metronidazole in wastewater even at low concentrations requires searching for a suitable process such as advanced oxidation process (AOP) to reduce the level of pollutants to a standard level in water.
   Methods: In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal method using zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) as a precursor, then, stabilized on stone and was used as a catalyst, in order to degrade metronidazole by photocalytic process. Effective factors on the removal efficiency of metronidazole including the initial metronidazole concentration, contact time, pH, and 0.9 gL(-1) ZnO stabilized on the stone surface were investigated.
   Results: The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed that the synthesized nanomaterials have hexagonal Wurtzite structure. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the average crystalline size of the synthesized ZnO particles was in the range of 1.9-3.2 nm. The spectra represented a sharp absorption edge at 390 nm for ZnO nanoparticles corresponding to band gap of 3.168 eV. The BET-BJH specific surface area of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles was 25.504 m(2)/g. The EDS spectrum of ZnO nanoparticles showed four peaks, which were identified as Zn and O. The maximum removal efficiency was 98.36% for the synthetic solution under a specific condition (pH = 11, reaction time = 90 minutes, ZnO concentration = 0.9 gL(-1) , and the initial concentration of metronidazole = 10 mgL(-1)). The photocatalytic degradation was found to follow pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics.
   Conclusion: Therefore, the ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by thermal decomposition are suitable and effective photocatalytic materials for degradation of pharmaceutical contaminants.

AB An approach to identifying persistent organic contaminants in the environment was developed and executed for Switzerland as an example of an industrialized country. First, samples were screened with an in-house list using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in 13 samples from the Swiss National Soil Monitoring Network and three sediment cores of a n urban and agricultural contaminated lake. To capture a broader range of organic contaminants, the analysis was extended with a suspect screening analysis by LC-HRMS/MS of >500 halogenated compounds obtained from a Swiss database that includes industrial and household chemicals identified, by means of fugacity modeling, as persistent substances in the selected matrices. In total, the confirmation of 96 compounds with an overlap of 34 in soil and sediment was achieved. The identified compounds consist generally of esters, tertiary amines, trifluoromethyls, organophosphates, azoles and aromatic azines, with azoles and triazines being the most common groups. Newly identified compounds include transformation products, pharmaceuticals such as the flukicide niclofolan, the antimicrobial cloflucarban, and the fungicide mandipropamid. The results indicate that agricultural and urban soils as well as sediments impacted by agriculture and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the most contaminated sites. The plausibility of this outcome confirms the combination of chemical inventory, modeling of partitioning and persistence, and HRMS-based screening as a successful approach to shed light on less frequently or not yet investigated environmental contaminants and emphasizes the need for more soil and sediment monitoring in the future.

The presence of both biomass and TiO2 is essential for the effective function of the photocatalytic nanocomposites. With TZPP(5), ca. 80% and ca. 50% mineralisation of AMP and SMX, respectively, was observed after 60 min. The photocatalytic reaction releases inorganic by-products (SO42, NO3 and NH4+) at levels below WHO permissible limits for drinking water. The presence of anions reduces the efficiency of TZPP(5), indicating that it releases electrons and reactive oxygen species that are also responsible for photodegradation of the drugs. However, changing concentrations of electrolyte (NaCl) do not influence its efficiency, suggesting that adsorption may not precede photocatalysis, contrary to common models. Reuse studies suggest a slight loss in photodegradation efficiency (approximate to 6%) of the nanocomposite for AMP in the first two cycles followed by subsequent stability at 70% for subsequent cycles. This is different for SMX, which maintained approximate to 58% removal for all cycles after the 1st cycle. With efficient treatment of raw wastewater from an abattoir, a river, and a hand-dug well for drinking water, the photocatalytic nanocomposite shows potential for treating drinking water especially in point-of-use water treatment devices.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs), the most widely used antibiotics, are frequently detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent. In this study, the removal trends of four typical SAs (sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfapyridine (SPD) and sulfamethazine (SMT)) in lab-scale soil aquifer treatment (SAT) systems, as well as their chlorination behaviors, were evaluated. As much as 68.2-88.9% of SAs in the synthetic water samples (10 mu g L-1 initial concentration) were efficiently removed during steady-state operated SAT, which was the highest for sulfadiazine and lowest for sulfamethazine. Specifically, aerobic biodegradation in the soil played a great role in SA removal and contributed 55.7%, 57.8%, 61.1% and 74.0% to SMT, SMX, SPD and SDZ removal, respectively. Cleavage of the aniline group and desulfation of the SAs were the main pathways for their degradation during soil degradation. Subsequent chlorination could partially eliminate the SAs in the SAT effluent but not entirely, with a removal rate of 8.21% for SDZ, 7.45% for SMX, 14.21% for SPD, 16.52% for SMT, respectively. Electrophilic substitution of the aniline group and reaction with desulfation products produced different chlorinated by-products. The intermediates of the SAs originating from the SAT biodegradation contributed to the formation of chlorinated by-products and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially for organic compounds generated under aerobic biodegradation conditions. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the abundant existence of SAs in the recharging samples would lead to health concerns due to the high concentrations of ARGs and precursors of chlorination by-products, especially with traditional chlorination processes.

AB Millions of pharmaceuticals are prescribed each year. Wastewater treatment plants fail to remove all pharmaceuticals from discharge leading to detectable concentrations entering aquatic ecosystems where the compounds can encounter nontarget organisms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants interact with transporters in the brain and peripheral nervous system to change serotonin levels in the synapse. Sublethal exposure to SSRIs can impact fish feeding behaviors, which can have impacts on ecological fitness. We exposed hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) to low, medium, and high concentrations of sertraline (4.5 +/- 0.84 mu g/L, 35.4 +/- 2.18 mu g/L, and 96.8 +/- 6.4 mu g/L) over six days with six additional recovery days. Concentrations were chosen to compare results with a mixture study previously completed in our lab. Every three days we tracked how long each bass took to consume four fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and conducted destructive sampling to obtain brain and plasma samples. Brain and plasma samples were analyzed for sertraline levels and we calculated whole brain serotonin levels. During the exposure period, bass showed an increased time to capture prey, but time to capture prey returned to control levels during the six-day recovery period. Sertraline was detected in brain and plasma during the duration of the experiment, though not always in a dose-dependent fashion. While we demonstrated a relationship between time to capture prey and decrease whole brain serotonin levels, the decrease in time to capture prey during the recovery period suggests the serotonin levels in the brain are not solely responsible for the outward behavioral expression observed.

AB Many chemicals with different physico-chemical properties are present in municipal wastewater. In this study, the removal of a broad range of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was determined in two biological treatment processes differing in hydraulic retention time: sequential biofiltration (SBF) and soil-aquifer treatment (SAT), operated in Germany and Spain. Occurrence and the degree of removal of more than 150 TOrCs with different physico-chemical properties were analysed, including precursors as well as human metabolites and environmental transformation products (TPs). Ninety TOrCs were detected in the feed water of the SBF system, 40% of these showed removal efficiencies of higher than 30% during biological treatment. In SAT, 70 TOrCs were detected in the feed water, 60% of these could be reduced by more than 30% after approximately 3 days of subsurface treatment. For uncharged and negatively charged TOrCs biological degradation was mainly responsible for the removal, while positively charged TOrCs were most likely also removed by ionic interactions. The detections of TPs confirmed that biodegradation was a major removal process in both systems. The analysis of positively and negatively charged, neutral and zwitterionic TOrCs and the simultaneous analysis of precursors and their biologically formed TPs enabled a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms of their removal in the two systems. On this basis, criteria for site-specific indicator selection were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The release of pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) into aquatic ecosystems poses an environmental risk resulting in a chronic exposure of non-target organisms. A great variety of PhACs, of generally low concentrations, and the complicated sample preparation, makes circumstantial the accurate detection and quantification. Additionally, there is little information published about the spatiotemporal variation of the PhAC load in a larger catchment area utilised for touristic purposes. In addition to the natural biotic and abiotic changes, the seasonal variation of tourism also has a dramatic impact on water quality and the natural ecosystem in larger catchment areas. Therefore, our aim was to develop a reliable solid-phase extraction (SPE)-superaitical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous multi-residue analysis of drugs to reveal the spatiotemporal changes in the PhAC contaminations in the waters of an important touristic region, the catchment area of the largest shallow lake in Central Europe, Lake Balaton (Hungary). The environmental application of the developed method revealed 69 out of the traced 134 chemical compounds, including 15 PhACs, which were detected from natural waters for the first time. Wastewater treatment plant (wwrp) loads have a major role in the PhAC contamination of the studied area; at the same time, the mass tourism-induced PhAC contamination was also detectable. Furthermore, the impact of tourism was indicated by elevated concentrations of recreational substances (e.g., caffeine and illicit drugs) in the touristic season affecting the water quality of this important summer holiday destination.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a sanitizer with increasing use in food, medical and water treatment industries. Amino acids are important components in targeted foods for PAA treatment and ubiquitous in natural waterbodies and wastewater effluents as the primary form of dissolved organic nitrogen. To better understand the possible reactions, this work investigated the reaction kinetics and transformation pathways of selected amino acids towards PAA. Experimental results demonstrated that most amino acids showed sluggish reactivity to PAA except cysteine (CYS), methionine (MET), and histidine (HIS). CYS showed the highest reactivity with a very rapid reaction rate. Reactions of MET and HIS with PAA followed second-order kinetics with rate constants of 4.6 +/- 0.2, and 1.8 +/- 0.1 M-1.s(-1) at pH 7, respectively. The reactions were faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to PAA speciation. Low concentrations of H2O2 coexistent with PAA contributed little to the oxidation of amino acids. The primary oxidation products of amino acids with PAA were [O] addition compounds on the reactive sites at thiol, thioether and imidazole groups. Theoretical calculations were applied to predict the reactivity and regioselectivity of PAA electrophilic attacks on amino acids and improved mechanistic understanding. As an oxidative disinfectant, the reaction of PAA with organics to form byproducts is inevitable; however, this study shows that PAA exhibits lower and more selective reactivity towards biomolecules such as amino acids than other common disinfectants, causing less concern of toxic disinfection byproducts. This attribute may allow greater stability and more targeted actions of PAA in various applications. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, has been widely used in pharmaceutical and personal care products. It undergoes limited degradation during wastewater treatment and is present in biosolids, most of which are land applied in the United States. This study assessed the impact of triclosan (0-100 mg kg(-1)) with and without biochar on soil bacterial communities. Very little C-14-triclosan was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 (<7%) over the course of the study (42 days). While biochar (1%) significantly lowered mineralization of triclosan, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that biochar impacted very few OTUs and did not alter the overall structure of the community. Triclosan, on the other hand, significantly affected bacterial diversity and community structure (alpha diversity, ANOVA, p < 0.001: beta diversity, AMOVA, p < 0.01). Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM) modeling and complete linkage clustering (CLC) revealed a dose-dependent impact of triclosan. Non-Parametric Metastats (NPM) analysis showed that 150 of 734 OTUs from seven main phyla were significantly impacted by triclosan (adjusted p < 0.05). Genera harboring opportunistic pathogens such as Flavobacterium were enriched in the presence of triclosan, as was Stenotrophomonas. The latter has previously been implicated in triclosan degradation via stable isotope probing. Surprisingly, Sphingomonads, which include well-characterized triclosan degraders were negatively impacted by even low doses of triclosan. Analyses of published genomes showed that triclosan resistance determinants were rare in Sphingomonads which may explain why they were negatively impacted by triclosan in our soil.

AB The ubiquitous presence of trace organic chemicals in wastewater and surface water leads to a growing demand for novel removal technologies. The use of isolated enzymes has been shown to possess the capability for a targeted application but requires a clearer mechanistic understanding. In this study, the potential of peroxidase from horseradish (HRP) and laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus (LccPO) to transform selected trace organic chemicals was studied using mass spectrometry (MS)-based in vitro enzyme as- " says. Conversion by HRP appeared to be more efficient compared to LccPO. Diclofenac (DCF) and sotalol (STL) were completely transformed by HRP after 4 h and immediate conversion was observed for acetaminophen (APAP). During treatment with LccPO, 60% of DCF was still detectable after 24 h and no conversion was found for STL. APAP was completely transformed after 20 min. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NAP) were insusceptible to enzymatic conversion. In pharmaceutical mixtures, HRP exhibited a preference for DCF and APAP and the generally less efficient conversion of STL was enhanced in presence of APAP. Transformation product pattern after treatment with HRP revealed polymerization products for DCF while STL showed cleavage reactions. DCF product formation shifted towards a proposed dimeric iminoquinone product in presence of APAP whereas a generally less pronounced product formation in mixtures was observed for STL. In conclusion, theenzymatic treatment approach worked selectively and efficiently for a few pharmaceuticals. However, for application the investigation and possibly immobilization of multiplex enzymes being able to transform diverse chemical structures is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study determined the fate of triclosan, a prevalent wastewater contaminant in recycled waters and surface streams, when soil and crop plants were irrigated at environmentally relevant concentrations. Soil triclosan concentrations were monitored in an 8-wk and in a 16-wk study without plants to determine triclosan degradation. Onion (Allium oschaninii O. Fedtsch.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were assessed for growth and triclosan accumulation at four levels of triclosan exposure (0, 0.015, 0.15, and 1.5 mu g L-1) in irrigation waters within ranges of those found in recycled waters and associated receiving streams. Onions were grown for 8 wk and tomatoes were grown for 8 wk (short-term study) and 12 wk (long-term study) in potting soil. Soil triclosan concentrations increased (5-fold) with triclosan levels applied to soils alone. With repeated application, the half-life of triclosan was 18 d, with low-level accumulation in soil. Bioaccumulation of triclosan was observed in all edible portions of onions (115-435 ng g(-1)), primarily in bulbs, with no discernible impact on biomass. In both short-and long-term tomato studies, triclosan translocated to shoots and fruits (approaching a translocation factor of 1) at the highest level examined. Even at low triclosan concentrations typically found in recycled waters and receiving streams, agricultural irrigation presents an additional exposure route for organic contaminants to humans via commercial crops. Our study indicates that bulb crops, in particular, would likely accumulate high levels of triclosan. However, concentrations detected in both onions and tomato fruits determined here are below current human exposure limits.

AB The anaerobic degradation characteristics of estrone (E-1), estradiol (E-2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) under single and combined conditions were investigated in batch tests and the influence of initial estrogen and sludge concentrations on the biodegradation process was studied. The results indicated that the degradation process of three estrogens was biphasic. The first phase was fast and the second phase was slow. The two phases could be described by the first-order degradation kinetics. In the single degradation experiments, at the fast stage, E-2 degradation rate was the highest for the three estrogens, which was 2 and 5.17 times higher than E-1 and EE2, respectively. However, at the slow stage, EE2 almost could not be biodegraded, and the degradation rate constant of E-1 and E-2 was 0.18 and 0.34 times lower than that at fast degradation phase, respectively. Meanwhile, E-1 was accumulated in the process of E-2 degradation, which indicated that E-1 was a main intermediate product of the E-2 anaerobic biodegradation. In the combined degradation experiments, the degradation rate constants of estrogens had the order of E-1 > E-2 > EE2, and the contribution of fast degradation stage was crucial to the removal of estrogens under anaerobic conditions. The degradation rate constant of estrogens decreased linearly with the initial estrogen concentrations and increased linearly with the sludge concentrations, which indicated that the higher sludge concentrations benefited the removal of estrogens under anaerobic conditions in the real wastewater treatment practice.

AB The knowledge gaps regarding the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in biofilters include the effect of aeration, constant feeding with readily biodegradable organic carbon and the presence of reactive media such as manganese oxides (MnOx). Thus, the goal of this study was to assess the removal of SMX in lab-scale biofilters with various operation variables: aeration, presence of MnOx as an amendment of filtering medium and the presence of readily biodegradable organic carbon (acetate). The sand used in the experiment as a filtering medium was previously exposed to the presence of SMX and acetate, which provided acclimation of the biomass. The removal of SMX was complete (>99%) with the exception of the unaerated columns fed with the influent containing acetate, due to apparent slower rate of SMX degradation. The obtained results suggest that bacteria were able to degrade SMX as a primary substrate and the degradation of this compound was subsequent to the depletion of acetate. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the effluents indicated several biotransformation reactions for SMX: (di)hydroxylation, acetylation, nitrosation, deamonification, S-N bond cleavage and isoxazole-ring cleavage. The relative abundance of transformation products was decreased in the presence of MnOx or acetate. Based on the Microtox assay, only the effluents from the unaerated columns filled with MnOx were classified as nontoxic. The results offer important implications for the design of biofilters for the elimination of SMX, namely that biofilters offer the greatest performance when fed with secondary wastewater and operated as non-aerated systems with a filtering medium containing MnOx.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is becoming increasingly recognized as an important micropollutant to be monitored in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), since it has been detected in effluents at the mu g L-1 level. The IBU metabolites from biological degradation are not completely understood and can represent a threat to natural aquatic systems. P. medicamentivorans was previously isolated from WWTP sludge and found to be capable of IBU degradation. The aerobic biodegradation of ibuprofen by this organism was investigated in a batch lab-scale reactor for the identification of the metabolites formed. The metabolites were analysed and putatively identified by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and GC-MS and biodegradation pathways were proposed. The toxicity and the biodegradability potential of the metabolites were also investigated. The results showed that IBU biotransformation was achieved by hydroxylation followed by the formation of a carboxylic acid in the IBU molecule and by the formation of a catechol, allowing the aromatic ring cleavage. Two biodegradation pathways were proposed: in one, the metabolites generated from the enzymatic action correspond to a less biodegradable chemical structure of the intermediate products (isobutylbenzene and 3-isobutylphenol), with comparatively higher toxicity; in the other mechanism, more oxidable chemical structures were formed with less toxicity and higher biodegradability. This suggests that the biodegradation of IBU by P. medicamentivorans can take place by more than one mechanism regarding the enzymes formed by this Gram-positive bacterium, with subsequent oxidation of the parent compound to overall more soluble and less toxic compounds to fish, daphnia and green algae.

AB Doxorubicin (DOX) originated from users' urine has been an emerging environmental pollutant due to its significant genotoxicity to mankind. Thus, urine source separation is a potential strategy to isolate DOX at a higher concentration and reduce the burden of downstream wastewater treatment. To develop highly efficient, easy separation and retrievable materials for individual patient to conveniently remove DOX from own urine, magnetic Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers were prepared through anchoring amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles on the Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers. Characterizations revealed the magnetic nanoflowers were spherical in shape with a mean size of 15 mu m, and porous and hierarchical in structure. Magnetic nanoparticles located the surface of petals. Multibatch experiments were performed to assess the removal performance of DOX from aqueous solution. The magnetic nanoflowers exhibited excellent removal efficiency of DOX under weakly alkaline condition at ambient temperature. Linear and non-linear analyses were carried out to compare the best fitting kinetics and isotherms. Sorption kinetic data best fitted the pseudo-second order model. The Freundlich isotherm explained equilibrium sorption data with R-2 = 0.993 higher than that for the Langmuir isotherm. When the pH of synthetic urine was adjusted to weakly alkaline (pH 8.0-9.0), over 95% of DOX (20 mg L-1) was removed by a little of magnetic nanoflowers (50 mg L-1) within 5 min. Meanwhile, the magnetic nanoflowers could be easily separated and recovered from the synthetic urine by a magnet. So, for individual urine source separation strategy, the magnetic nanoflower seems to be an efficient, convenient and inexpensive approach to remove DOX from human urine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is an anti-inflammatory drug detected in various aquatic sources and found harmful to aquatic life. In spite of adopting various treatment techniques, complete removal is not observed and remaining DCF can interact with other existing contaminants leading to the generation of more toxic contaminants in wastewater. In the present work, investigations on removal of DCF from aqueous solutions were carried out through Pseudo-emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) technique with pseudo-emulsion consisting of Di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as carrier, n-heptane as diluent and HCl as stripping phase. Morphological features of hollow fiber membrane module were revealed through Field emission scanning electron microscopy which shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of membrane phase before and after extraction of DCF confirms interaction between D2EHPA and DCF. Contact angle measurement shows that due to hydrophobicity and strong capillary force, membrane phase retains within the micropores of the hollow fiber and helps to diffuse DCF forming DCF-D2EHPA complex. Uniform droplet sizes and size distribution of pseudo-emulsion provides high interfacial contact area and higher extraction efficiency. Studies on permeability and investigations regarding the effect of several operational parameters such as concentration of feed phase (F), carrier (C) and stripping phase (S) for the extraction of DCF as well as multivariable optimization were carried out by Response surface methodology using Box-Behnken design approach. 97.50% extraction of DCF was achieved with PEHFSD technique at optimum conditions.

AB The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has pose a huge threat to both human health and environmental ecosystem. However, little is known regarding the pool of ARGs in extracellular DNA (eDNA). In this study ten ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetW, tetX, ermA, ermB, bla(TEM), ampC, cat and cmr) and class I integron (intI1) in the sludge from hospital, pharmaceutical industry, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and swine manure, and sediment in urban lake in the form of both eDNA and intracellular DNA (iDNA) were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that every gram of sludge dry weight contained from 7.31 x 10(3) to 1.16 x 10(10) copies of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and from 1.04 x 10(5) to 2.74 x 10(12) copies of intracellular ARGs (iARGs). The sludge from hospital with the highest ratio of eARGs to total ARGs (11.02-89.63%), followed by the sediment from urban lake, implying that most of the ARGs in these regions were contributed by eARGs. The relative abundance of eARGs were higher than iARGs in sludge from WWTP and pharmaceutical industry, moreover, 1/3 and 5/9 detected eARGs were higher than the ARGs in the iDNA extracted from sludge of hospital and sediment from urban lake, respectively. Furthermore, the transforming ability of eARGs suggesting that adsorbed eARG is more preferentially coupled to the competent cells than free eARG. These findings highlight the need to focus attention on the contribution of eARGs to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance into environment, and also future needs in mitigating the spread of eARGs in the environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have become important because of the risk of harmful effects to ecosystem and drinking water abstraction. This is also the case in shallow dimictic Lake Tegel, located in the city area of Berlin, Germany. Here, drinking water is produced via bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge, and concurrently, a substantial anthropogenic load takes place by micro-pollutants from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The measured mean daily loads of 260 g d(-1) carbamazepine, 180 g d(-1) diclofenac and 60 g d(-1) sulfamethoxazole results in the highest so far reported concentrations from natural waters, which are used as a drinking water resource. In the present study the spatial horizontal and vertical distribution and elimination of these three pharmaceuticals are quantified with the help of high-resolution sampling in Lake Tegel and its entire major in- and outflows. Monthly mass balances are modelled and substance-specific zero-order elimination rates are derived. Diclofenac showed the strongest elimination and revealed a significant seasonality with 50 % elimination in winter, and 95 % in summer. Elimination of carbamazepine was about 40 %; sulfamethoxazole did not degrade at determinable rates. Based on a basic plug-flow approach, a pseudo first-order elimination rate for diclofenac in summer (0.058 d(-1), half-life 12 days) was calculated from horizontal concentration gradient. Apart from presenting the current state of pharmaceuticals pollution in Lake Tegel, results demonstrate the importance of lake-specific mechanisms, such as inflow-outflow balances and seasonal density stratification for the transport of micro-pollutants.

AB Wastewaters are considered as a significant source of pathogenic microorganisms and a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals. Disinfecting agents and antibiotics in these wastewaters can directly or indirectly influence the genetic composition of the present microorganisms and thus the occurrence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. In this study, we have investigated the composition of wastewaters from two Slovak and one Czech hospital. Using in-line solid phase extraction liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (in-line-SPE-LC-MS/MS), we monitored the occurrence of 29 pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs and their metabolites and resistant types of microorganisms. It was found that cotinine (max 1980 ng/dm(3)), tramadol (max 1570 ng/dm(3)), venlafaxine (max 248 ng/dm(3)), codeine (max 136 ng/dm(3)), oxazepam (max 113 ng/dm(3)), and oxycodone (max 102 ng/dm(3)) belong to the group of the most concentrated compounds. The number of coliform bacteria ranged from 5.5 to 7 log CFU/cm(3), while majority of strains were ampicillin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin resistant. The number of Staphylococcus aureus was lower (2.7-3.8 log CFU/cm(3)), with predominance of ampicillin and penicillin resistants. In the next part of the study, the possibility of the application of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes connected as anode for hospital wastewaters treatment was investigated. The obtained results indicate that the BDD anode is able to degrade a large scale of analyzed pharmaceuticals and drugs occurred in wastewaters with more than 60 % efficiency in 30 min.

AB In this study, the electro-oxidation capacities of Na2SO4 and potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes were tested and compared for destruction of the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF) on platinum (Pt) electrode and graphite carbon electrode in aqueous medium. The suitability of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) for electrochemical oxidation was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique performed in the potential range -1.5 to +1.5V versus Ag/AgCl, which confirmed the electro-activity of the selected PhACs. The degradation and mineralization were monitored by ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC. 0.1M Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte was found to be more effective for mineralization of SMX and DCF, with efficiency of 15-30% more than the 0.1M phosphate buffer supporting electrolyte on the platinum (Pt) and carbon electrodes. The Pt electrode showed better performance in the degradation of the two PhACs while under the same conditions than the carbon electrode for both 0.1M Na2SO4 and 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes. The SMX and DCF degradation kinetics best fitted the second-order reaction, with rate constants ranging between 0.000389 and 0.006mol(2) L-2 min(-1) and correlation coefficient (R-2) above 0.987. The second-order degradation kinetics indicated that the rate-determining step in the degradation could be a chemical process, thus suggesting the active involvement of electrolyte radical species in the degradation of SMX and DCF. Results obtained from a real field sample showed a more than 98% removal of the PhACs from the wastewater by electrochemical degradation.

AB In this study, a novel Pandoraea sp. strain WL1 capable of mineralizing p-xylene as sole carbon and energy source was isolated from the activated sludge of a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. A nearly complete degradation of 16.6 similar to 99.4 mg L-1 p-xylene in the liquidzphase was achieved within 6 similar to 18 h accompanied by 15.9 similar to 56.3 mg dry cell weight (DCW) L-1 for bacterial growth. A complete pathway for p-xylene degradation by strain WL1 was presented through identification of a major intermediate (p-toluic acid) and final products (2.193 g(CO2) g(p-xylene)(-1) Of CO2 production and 0.215 g(DCW) g(p-xylene)(-1) of bacterial yield). Kinetics of bacterial growth and p-xylene degradation were evaluated using Haldane-Andrews model and pseudo first-order model, respectively. Furthermore, a biotrickling filter (BTF) was employed to evaluate the application of strain WL1 on the removal of gas-phase p-xylene under gas flow rates of 0.41 similar to 1.98 m(3) h(-1) for inlet loading rates of 5 similar to 248 gm(-3) h(-1). The BTF inoculated with strain WL1 proved to be robust against fluctuations of gas flow rates and inlet p-xylene concentrations. All the results obtained highlight the potential of strain WL1 for the treatment of p-xylene. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from the aqueous environment is a great environmental concern, mainly due to their diversity, high consumption, and sustainability. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the ability of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified by sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ultrasonic treatment in refining wastewaters contaminated with Atenolol -blocker drug (ATN). The physical and structural characteristics of the raw MWCNTs and modified MWCNTs (M-MWCNTs) were analyzed using SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, and FT-IR techniques. The effects of different parameters, including pH, initial concentration, contact time, and temperature were studied and optimized. Subsequently, the adsorption data were analyzed by several kinetic and equilibrium isotherm equations and modeled by artificial neural network (ANN). Highest ATN removal (87.89%) ((q(e,exp)=46.03mgg(-1))) occurred on the adsorbent activated within 10s of ultrasonication time and NaOCl 30%. Moreover, adsorbent modification significantly improved the ATN removal, so that the removal rate on the raw MWCNTs was about 58%, but in the same conditions, M-MWCNTs removed more than 92% of the adsorbate. The adsorption process reached equilibrium after 90min under the optimized pH of 6. According to ANN modeling, approximately the whole values dispersed around the 45 degrees line, indicating a good compatibility between the trial results and ANN-predicted data. The modification of MWCNTs in proper ultrasonic power via appropriate concentration of NaOCl solution removed many of the impurities and significantly improved the adsorption performance of MWCNTs.

AB Activated carbon of babassu coconut mesocarp (ACB), which is an environment-friendly material (low-cost), was evaluated as alternative adsorbent for the adsorption and desorption of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from aqueous solution. ASA is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical easily acquired and prescribed worldwide, and not completely removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). For this reason, properties of ACB (untreated) were characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, Boehm titration method and pH(PZC). The microporous nature of ACB strongly influenced both the adsorption of ASA and the occurrence of physical adsorption bonds, which allows the reversibility of the reaction. ACB surface was rich in carboxylic and phenolic groups. The adsorption was best described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model (89.87 mg g(-1)) at pH 2.0, which represented 80% of ACB adsorption capacity. Conversely, desorption was best represented by pseudo-first-order kinetic model (15.07 mg g(-1)) at pH 6.4, which corresponded to approximately 25% of ASA desorption capacity. Sips isotherm model was best fitted to the equilibrium data of adsorption (50.400 mg g(-1)) at pH 2.0 and desorption (85.213 mg g(-1)) at pH(PZC) 6.4. The negative Delta H degrees showed that adsorption ( - 23.45 kJ mol(-1)) and desorption ( - 5 x 10(5)kJ mol(-1)) were exothermic processes. In addition, the regeneration capability, evaluated through the cycles of reuse, indicated increase of the adsorption and desorption capacities of 53.36% and 32.71%, respectively.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the secondary effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants are of great concern when water reuse is intended. Ozonation and ultrafiltration (UF) are powerful technologies reported to eliminate EDCs. Due to the importance of effluent organic matters (EfOMs) in secondary effluent, the effects of three kinds of EfOM on the treatment of five EDCs using ozonation and OF were investigated. The three kinds of EfOM studied were humic acid sodium salt (NaAH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (NaAg); and the five EDCs were estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol and bisphenol A. The results showed that EfOM accelerated the decay rate of ozone and inhibited the degradation efficiency of EDCs by ozonation in the order NaAH > BSA > NaAg. The ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (UVA(280)) has potential for use as a surrogate indicator to assess EDC removal via ozonation without conducting difficult EDC analyses. When the decline in UVA(280) exceeded 18%, the five EDCs had been completely removed. The OF behavior of NaAH, BSA and NaAg was found to follow the cake filtration law. The fouling potential of EfOM followed the order NaAg > NaAH > BSA; while EfOM on the membrane surface enhanced EDC removal in the order NaAH > BSA > NaAg. The mean retention rate of the membrane was increased by 24%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The properties of EDCs and EfOM cakes both influenced the EDC removal rates due to adsorption, size exclusion and charge attraction.

AB Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) can achieve the time-weighted-average (TWA) concentrations of analytes in the period of deployment. Here we developed an approach based on DGT with a novel binding gel using porous carbon material (PCM) derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) for in-situ measurement of antibiotics in water samples. The diffusion coefficients of 20 antibiotics (nine sulfonamides, ten fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim) in agarose diffusive gel were 1.41 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s to 4.75 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s at 25 degrees C. The capacity of PCM binding gel toward the antibiotics was similar to 100 mu g per gel disc. The masses of the antibiotics accumulated by PCM-based DGT increased linearly with time, and they were almost independent of pH (4.2-8.4) and ionic strength (1-500 mM). The performance of the novel DGT was evaluated using freshwater and synthetic seawater spiked with the antibiotics in laboratory. The results showed good agreement with the theoretical predications except sulfacetamide. The detection limits achieved by the DGT with three devices together for deploying up to seven days were 1.0-18.0 ng/L. Field deployment in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent and seawater showed that the TWA concentrations of antibiotics were 3.8-1342.5 ng/L and 5.6-43.3 ng/L, respectively, which were comparable to those measured by grab sampling. The proposed DGT was an efficient tool for the measurement of antibiotics in environmental waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of pulsed corona discharge (PCD) oxidation for treatment of the nanofiltration concentrate from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The concentrate studied contained high concentrations of micropollutants, since it was produced in the two stage nanofiltration process and filtered to a very high volume reduction factor of 300. The goal of the PCD treatment was to decrease the amount of micropollutants and to increase biodegradability of the concentrate. The energy dose (10 kWh/m(3)) used in the PCD treatment was sufficient to reduce 21% of organic carbon present in the concentrate. However, the PCD treatment degraded efficiently some of the target micropollutants: higher than 92% degradation of diclofenac, carbamazepine, citalopram and furosemide was reached. Degradation rate of the beta-blockers (bisoprolol, sotalol, metoprolol) as well as ketoprofen and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) was lower: 82, 51, 33, 44 and 50% respectively. The BOD7/COD ratio of the NF concentrate was also increased 3.7 times due to the oxidation.
   Based on a linear regression analysis, molecular weight of the micropollutants, the amount of double bonds in their structure and the hydroxyl radical degradation constant were identified as the determining parameters for the degradation rate of the micropollutant in the PCD oxidation. This lead to a conclusion that presence of hydroxyl radicals was more critical for the degradation of the micropollutants than the presence of ozone under the examined conditions.

AB An optimized solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the effective analysis of 35 antibiotics including sulfonamides (SAs), quinolones (QLs), tetracyclines (TCs), macrolides (MALs), lincomycin (LIN), and chloramphenicol (CAP). The addition of 0.1 % formic acid to the mobile phase was favorable for the formation of [M + H](+) and the enhancement in the detection signals, but using ammonium formate decreased [M + H](+) with a corresponding reduction in the response of CAP. The optimal pH range for the SPE was 4.5 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 5.0 with 6 mL aqueous ammonia/methanol (5/95, v/v) as the optimized eluent. An internal standard (IS) was selected for each type of analytes based on similarities in classification and retention time. The detection was completed in less than 10 min and was excellent with method detection limits (MDL) of 0.29 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 4.03 ng/L. The recoveries of the antibiotics in samples from ultrapure water and groundwater were 67.13 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 93.00 % and 68.91 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 92.67 %, respectively. The antibiotics in samples collected from wastewater, surface water, and groundwater were also effectively detected. This newly developed method has the advantages of short detection times, small sample consumption, excellent reproducibility, and high sensitivity. This provides a reliable and promising technique for the simultaneous detection and monitoring of various residual antibiotics in aqueous environmental samples.

AB Anti-cancer drugs are compounds that are of high environmental relevance because of their lack of specific mode of action. They can be extremely harmful to living organisms even at low concentrations. The present study evaluated the toxic effects of four frequently used anti-cancer drugs against plant seedlings, namely Cyclophosphamide (CP), Methotrexate (MTX), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Imatinib (IM). The phytotoxicity experiments were performed with Lactuca sativa seedlings whereas cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations were performed with the well-established Allium cepa assays. MTX was the most phytotoxic compound, followed by 5-FU, CE and IM. Significant differences in the Mitotic Indexes (MI) were observed in three of the studied compounds (MTX, 5-FU and CP), indicating potential cytotoxic activity of these substances. Chromosome aberrations were registered in cells that were exposed to 5-FU, CE and IM. All the four compounds caused the formation of micronucleated cells indicating mutagenic potential. Besides, the assays performed with MTX samples presented a high number of cell apoptosis (cell death). Although it is unlikely that the pharmaceuticals concentrations measured in the environment could cause lethal effects in plants, the obtained results indicate that these compounds may affect the growth and normal development of these plants. So, both tests can constitute important tools for a fast screening of environmental contamination e.g. in the context of the reuse of treated wastewater and biosolids of agricultural purpose.

AB Electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) treatment of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen aqueous solution was investigated in this study. The E-peroxone process combined conventional zonation with electrolysis processes, and used a carbon-polytetrafluorethylene cathode to electrochemically generate H2O2 from O-2 in the sparged ozone generator effluent (O-2 and O-3 mixture). The in-situ generated H2O2 then reacted with the sparged O-3 to produce aqueous center dot OH, which can in turn oxidize pollutants effectively in the bulk solution. The E-peroxone process overcomes several intrinsic limitations of conventional zonation and electrolysis processes for pollutant degradation such as the selective oxidation with O-3 and mass transfer limitations of pollutants to the electrodes, and thus significantly enhanced both ibuprofen degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization. Results show that ibuprofen could be completely degraded much more rapidly in the E-peroxone process (e.g., 5-15 min under all tested reaction conditions) than in zonation (>= 30 min) and electrolysis (several hours) processes. In addition, thanks to the powerful and non-selective oxidation capacity of center dot OH, toxic intermediates formed during ibuprofen degradation could be completely mineralized in the E-peroxone process. The E-peroxone effluent (2 h) thus exhibited much lower toxicity (5% inhibition of bioluminescence of Vibrio fisheri) than the ozonation and electrolysis effluents (22% and 88% inhibition, respectively). The results of this study indicate that the E-peroxone process may provide a promising technology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been shown to be biotransformed in water treatment systems. However, little research exists on the effect of initial PPCP concentration on PPCP biotransformation or on the microbial communities treating impacted water. In this study, biological PPCP removal at various concentrations was assessed using laboratory columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. Pyrosequencing was used to examine microbial communities in the columns and in soil from a soil aquifer treatment (SAT; a method of water treatment prior to reuse) site. Laboratory columns were supplied with different concentrations (0.25, 10, 100, or 1,000 mu g liter(-1)) of each of 15 PPCPs. Five PPCPs (4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol [biosol], p-chloro-m-xylenol, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, and phenytoin) were not removed at any tested concentrations. Two PPCPs (naproxen and triclosan) exhibited removals independent of PPCP concentration. PPCP removal efficiencies were dependent on initial concentrations for biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, chlorophene, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, and valproic acid, showing that PPCP concentration can affect biotransformation. Biofilms from sand samples collected from the 0.25- and 10-mu g liter(-1) PPCP columns were pyrosequenced along with SAT soil samples collected on three consecutive days of a wetting and drying cycle to enable comparison of these two communities exposed to PPCPs. SAT communities were similar to column communities in taxonomy and phylotype composition, and both were found to contain close relatives of known PPCP degraders. The efficiency of biological removal of PPCPs was found to be dependent on the concentration at which the contamination occurs for some, but not all, PPCPs.

AB Fifty-four different organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, corrosion inhibitors and other typical wastewater compounds such as caffeine are repeatedly analyzed in approximately fifty groundwater observation points in a complex faulted and fractured carbonate aquifer system consisting of three spring catchment areas. With the applied HPLC-MS/MS method, achieving method quantification limits (MQL) of 12-28 ng L-1, forty-four of the OMPs are detected in groundwater. Regarding the vertical distribution in the aquifer system the highest variety of OMPs occurs in the shallow aquifer.
   Most frequently detected compounds are atrazine together with the metabolites of several triazines, desethylatrazine (DEA) and desisopropylatrazine (DIA), the corrosion inhibitors 1H-benzotriazole and tolytriazoles and as pharmaceutical residues the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine as well as the analgesic drug phenazone. Median OMP concentrations are in the range of 20-40 ng L-1 with occasionally and locally higher concentrations of up to 6000 ng L-1.
   Defined combinations of OMPs occur repeatedly in the same observation wells and allow to distinguish different input functions. The comparison of detection frequency with the number of prescribed doses gives information about the specific persistence of pharmaceuticals. The analgesic phenazone exhibits a peculiar high detection frequency, although it is recently not prescribed in significant amounts. The detection of the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen (6-17 ng L-1) in a groundwater flow system is reported for the first time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Activated carbon (AC) has been shown to remove precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts. Granular and powdered activated carbon (GAC, PAC) were investigated for their potential to adsorb N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors from blends of river water and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). At bench scale, waters were exposed to lignite or bituminous AC, either as PAC in bottle point experiments or as GAC in rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs). NDMA formation potential (FP) was used as a surrogate for precursor removal. NDMA FP was reduced by 37, 59, and 91% with 3, 8, and 75 mg/L of one PAC, respectively, with a 4-h contact time. In RSSCTs and in full-scale GAC contactors, NDMA FP removal always exceeded that of the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm. For example, whereas DOC breakthrough exceeded 90% of its influent concentration after 10 000 bed volumes of operation in an RSSCT, NDMA FP was less than 40% of influent concentration after the same bed life of the GAC. At full or pilot scale, high NDMA FP reduction ranging from >60 to >90% was achieved across GAC contactors, dependent upon the GAC bed life and/or use of a preoxidant (chlorine or ozone). In all experiments, NDMA formation was not reduced to zero, which suggests that although some precursors are strongly sorbed, others are not. This is among the first studies to show that AC is capable of adsorbing NDMA precursors, but further research is needed to better understand NDMA precursor chemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, molecular size) and evaluate how best to incorporate this finding into full-scale designs and practice.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals have recently been detected at low concentrations in wastewater and surface water. This work reports studies of the direct and indirect photochemical fate and treatment by advanced oxidation of three antidepressant compounds (duloxetine, venlafaxine and bupropion) in solutions of humic acid in order to elucidate their behavior in the natural environment prior to reaching a water treatment facility and potentially entering a potable water supply. Humic acid solution was prepared by adding to distilled water a known amount of organic matter as a photosensitizer. All three antidepressants react very rapidly with hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) rate constants of similar to 10(8) to 10(10) M-1 s(-1), but significantly slower with singlet oxygen ((1)Delta O-2) (similar to 10(3) to 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The steady-state concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and (1)Delta O-2, in a sample of humic acid solution were measured and used with the second order rate constants to show that the hydroxyl radical was an order of magnitude more effective than the singlet oxygen in the solar-induced photochemical degradation of the antidepressants. Excited state dissolved organic matter also accounted for a substantial portion of degradation of duloxetine, decreasing its half-life by 27% under solar irradiation. Several reaction pathways and by-products arising from the photodegradation were identified using gamma-irradiation followed by LC-MS analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work assessed the solar photo-Fenton degradation of nalidixic acid (NXA), a quinolone antibacterial agent, in several different aqueous solutions. It has been proven that the composition of the water clearly affects the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process. The presence of chlorine ions induces the concurrence of different mechanisms involving Cl-center dot and Cl-2(center dot-) radicals, which slow down the process. Up to 35 transformation products (TPs) were identified and their structures characterized by accurate LC-TOF-MS mass measurements during treatment of the different model waters. Photocatalytic degradation was thus observed to proceed mainly through the attack of the hydroxyl radicals on the double bond C-(2)=C-(3) which induce further ring opening. All the TPs identified persisted after total degradation of NXA. NXA in real pharmaceutical effluent was treated by photo-Fenton as a first stage before biological treatment. As NXA has been demonstrated to be recalcitrant to biological treatment, photo-Fenton treatment of the effluent was continued until its total degradation. Although NXA was efficiently degraded, LC-MS analyses demonstrated that some of the TPs identified after the photo-Fenton treatment were also recalcitrant to biological treatment, persisting after the combined treatment. These results show that analytical assessment of photocatalytic water treatments is essential to assure they are functioning as intended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increased use of antibiotics has led to the contamination of the water bodies. Pharmaceutically active compounds can lead to severe effects including the production of antibiotic-resistant microbes, endocrine disruption, toxicity to aquatic organisms, and genotoxicity. Though the antibiotics are found in the aquatic environment at a very low concentration ranging from nanogram to microgram per liter, but exert adverse effects and contribute to pollution. A global medical crisis is unfolding as antibiotics lose effectiveness against a growing number of bacterial pathogens. Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin is one of the frequently used antibiotics for the treatment of both gram-positive and negative bacteria including the infections of the middle ear. It is most commonly used in human and veterinary medicine around the world. Amoxicillin's impact on human health and the environment is uncertain hence it is regarded as an emerging contaminant. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not efficiently remove amoxicillin which contributes to its presence in drinking water and water bodies. Various physicochemical processes and bioremediation are used for the removal of amoxicillin, but antibiotics, being hydrophobic and lipophilic are recalcitrant to degradation and cannot be completely removed from the environment, but in-depth studies are important for the development of better and sustainable technology for cleaner environment. The present review gives an insight into the amoxicillin detection, development of resistance along with its impact and ecotoxicity on living beings. Amoxicillin removal using physicochemical parameters, nanoparticles, phytoremediation, and via the use of bacteria and algae have been discussed in the paper.

AB Formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) from pharmaceutically active compounds has been observed in water supply systems following wastewater chlorination. Although research has been limited thus far, several studies have shown that halogenated DBPs may elicit increased toxicity compared to their parent compounds. For example, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil has been shown to form chlorogemfibrozil (Cl-gemfibrozil) and bromogemfibrozil (Br-gemfibrozil) following chlorination, which are more potent antiandrogens in male Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) compared to their parent compounds. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the bioaccumulative ability of halogenated gemfibrozil DBPs in marine polychaetes via chronic sediment exposures and, consequently, to assess the chronic and acute toxicity of halogenated gemfibrozil DBPs through sediment (in vivo) and aqueous (in vivo and in silico) toxicity evaluations. Following 28 day sediment exposures, Cl-gemfibrozil and Br-gemfibrozil bioaccumulated within Neanthes arenaceodentata, with both compounds reducing survival and growth. The biota-sediment accumulation factors determined for Cl-gemfibrozil and Br-gemfibrozil were 2.59 and 6.86, respectively. Furthermore, aqueous 96 h toxicity tests with N. arenaceodentata indicated that gemfibrozil DBPs elicited increased toxicity compared to the parent compound. While gemfibrozil had an acute LC50 value of 469.85 +/- 0.096 mg/L, Cl-gemfibrozil and Br-gemfibrozil had LC50 values of 12.34 +/- 0.085 and 9.54 +/- 0.086 mg/L, respectively. Although acute toxicity is relatively low, our results indicate that halogenated gemfibrozil DBPs are bioaccumulative and may elicit effects in apex food web organisms prone to accumulation following lifelong exposures.

AB Exploring the new catalytic systems for the reduction of organic and inorganic pollutants from an indispensable process in chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and food industries, etc. Hence, in the present work, authors motivated to synthesize bare reduced graphene oxide (rGO), polyaniline (PANI), three different ratios of rGO-PANI((80:20, 50:50, 10:90)) composites and rGO-PANI(80:20, 50:50, 10:90) supported mono (Pd) & bimetallic [Pd:Au-(1:1,Au- 1:2,Au- 2:1)] nanocomposite by a facile chemical reduction method. Also, it investigated their catalytic performances for the reduction of organic/inorganic pollutants and antimicrobial activities. All the freshly prepared bare rGO, PANI, three different ratios of rGO-PANI((80:20, 50:50, 10:90)) composites and rGO-PANI((80:20, 50:50, 10:90))/Pd & Pd:Au-(1:1,Au- 1:2,Au- 2:1) nanocomposite hybrid catalysts were characterized using UV-Vis, FT-IR, SEM, FE-SEM, EDAX, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy analysis. Among them, an optimized best composition of rGO-PANI((80:20))/Pd:Au-(1:1) bimetallic nanocomposite hybrid catalyst exhibits better catalytic reduction and antimicrobial activities than other composites, as a result of strong electrostatic interactions between rGO, PANI and bimetal (Pd:Au) NPs through a synergistic effect. Hence, an optimized rGO-PANI((80:20))/Pd:Au-(1:1) bimetallic nanocomposite catalyst would be considered as a suitable catalyst for the reduction of different nitroarenes, organic dyes, heavy metal ions and also significantly inhibit the growth of S. aureus, S. Typhi as well as Candida albicans and Candida kruesi in wastewater.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT), applied after activated sludge treatment (AST), has been widely used for wastewater reclamation. AST and SAT show potential for removing micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, the role of sequential combination of AST and SAT on the biodegradation of PPCPs was not clear in previous studies. In this study, the removal characteristics of PPCPs in AST and SAT were evaluated to assess the legitimacy of sequential combination of AST and SAT. SAT showed effective removals of antibiotics (> 80%), including fluoroquinolones and macrolides by sorption, but poor removals of amide pharmaceuticals (i.e. carbamazepine and crotamiton) were observed in both AST and SAT. Additionally, biodegradation contributed to the effective removal of carboxylic PPCPs (i.e. ketoprofen and gemfibrozil) in both ASTs and SAT, but effective biodegradation of halogenated acid and polycyclic aromatic compounds (i.e. clofibric acid and naproxen) was observed only in SAT (82.1% and 81.8%, respectively). Furthermore, the microbial substrate metabolic patterns showed that amino acids, amines, and polymers were biodegradable in SAT, which was fit for the biodegradation characteristics of PPCPs in SAT. For microbial communities, Proteobacteria were dominant in AST and SAT, but Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were more abundant in SAT than AST, which could contribute to the effective removals of halogenated acid in SAT. Considering PPCP biodegradation and substrate metabolism, SAT displays a wider range on the biodegradation than AST. Therefore, we conclude that these two processes can complement each other when used for controlling PPCPs.

AB Pharmaceutical wastes are considered to be important pollutants even at low concentrations. In this regard, carbamazepine has received significant attention due to its negative effect on both ecosystem and human health. However, the need for acidic conditions severely hinders the use of conventional Fenton reagent reactions for the control and elimination of carbamazepine in wastewater effluents and drinking water influents. Herein, we report of the synthesis and use of flexible bifunctional nanoelectrocatalytic textile materials, Fe3O4-NP@CNF, for the effective degradation and complete mineralization of carbamazepine in water. The nonwoven porous structure of the composite binder-free Fe3O4-NP@CNF textile is used to generate H2O2 on the carbon nanofiber (CNF) substrate by O-2 reduction. In addition, center dot OH radical is generated on the surface of the bonded Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) at low applied potentials (-0.345 V). The Fe3O4-NPs are covalently bonded to the CNF textile support with a high degree of dispersion throughout the fiber matrix. The dispersion of the nanosized catalysts results in a higher catalytic reactivity than existing electro-Fenton systems. For example, the newly synthesized Fe3O4-NPs system uses an Fe loading that is 2 orders of magnitude less than existing electro-Fenton systems, coupled with a current efficiency that is higher than electrolysis using a boron-doped diamond electrode. Our test results show that this process can remove carbamazepine with high pseudo-first-order rate constants (e.g., 6.85 h(-1) ) and minimal energy consumption (0.239 kW.h/g carbamazepine). This combination leads to an efficient and sustainable electro-Fenton process.

AB The fate of five benzotriazoles (1H-benzotriazole, BTR; 4-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 4TTR; 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 5TTR; xylytriazole, XTR and 5-chlorobenzotriazole, CBTR) was studied in batch and continuous-flow Lemna minor systems and the role of different mechanisms on their removal was evaluated. Single and joint toxicity experiments were initially conducted using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) protocol 221 and no inhibition on specific growth rate of Lemna minor was observed for concentrations up to 200 mu g L-1. All tested substances were significantly removed in batch experiments with Lemna minor. Excepting 4TTR, full elimination of CBTR, XTR, 5TTR and BTR was observed up to the end of these experiments (36 d), while the half-life values ranged between 1.6 +/- 0.3 d (CBTR) and 25 +/- 3.6 d (4-TTR). Calculation of kinetic constants for hydrolysis, photodegradation, and plant uptake revealed that for all BTRs the kinetic constants of plant uptake were by far higher comparing to those of the other mechanisms, reaching 0.394 +/- 0.161 d(-1) for CBTR. The operation of a continuous-flow Lemna minor system consisted of three mini ponds and a total hydraulic residence time of 8.3 d showed sufficient removal for most target substances, ranging between 26% (4TTR) and 72% (CBTR). Application of a model for describing micropollutants removal in the examined system showed that plant uptake was the major mechanism governing BTRs removal in Lemna minor systems.

AB The present study describes the strategic doping of Fe metal ions into a BiOI microstructure using ex situ and in situ processes to synthesize a Fe-BiOI microstructure and their effect on photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC). The data suggested that in situ Fe-BiOI (Fe-BiOI-In) has superior performance compared to ex situ Fe-BiOI (Fe-BiOI-Ex) due to the uniform dispersion of Fe within the Fe-BiOI material. Calculated bandgaps similar to 1.8, similar to 1.5, and 2.4 eV were observed for BiOI (without Fe), Fe-BiOI-In, and Fe-BiOI-Ex, respectively. Interestingly, Fe incorporation within BiOI might decrease the bandgap in Fe-BiOI-In due to the uniform distribution of metal ions, whereas increasing the bandgap in Fe-BiOI-Ex attributed to nonuniform distribution or agglomeration of metal ions. The uniform dispersion of Fe within Fe-BiOI modulates electronic properties as well as increases the exposure of Fe ions with TC, thereby higher degradation efficiency of TC. The in situ Fe-BiOI material shows 67 and 100% degradation of TC at 10 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The TC degradation was also found to be pH-dependent; when increasing the pH value up to 10, 94% degradation was achieved at 10 mg/L within 60 min of solar irradiation. The analysis was also performed over BiOI, which proves that Fe has a profound effect on TC degradation as Fe(II) tends to trigger oxidation-reduction by utilizing the chelate formation tendency of TC. Therefore, the prepared Fe-BiOI-In has the potential ability to degrade pharmaceutical compounds, especially, TC from wastewater.

AB Electrochemical degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its metabolite acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (Ac-SMX) by Ti/SnO2-Sb/Er-PbO2 were investigated. Results indicated that the electrochemical degradation of SMX and Ac-SMX followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rate constants of SMX and Ac-SMX were 0.268 and 0.072 min(-1) at optimal current density of 10 and 14 mA/cm(2), respectively. Transformation products of SMX and Ac-SMX were identified and the possible degradation pathways, including the cleavage of S-N bond, opening ring of isoxazole and nitration of amino group, were proposed. Total organic carbon removal of SMX was nearly 63.2% after 3 h electrochemical degradation. 22.4% nitrogen of SMX was transformed to NO3-, and 98.8% sulfur of SMX was released as SO42-. According to quantitative structure-activity relationship model, toxicities of SMX and Ac-SMX to aquatic organisms significantly decreased after electrochemical degradation. Electric energy consumption for 90% SMX and Ac-SMX degradation was determined to be 0.58-8.97 and 6.88-44.19 Wh/L at different experimental conditions, respectively. Compared with parent compound SMX, the metabolite Ac-SMX is more refractory and toxic, which emphasizes the importance of taking its metabolites into account when investigating the disposal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Cetirizine, a second-generation antihistamine, has been detected in surface water and wastewater treatment eluent. The presence of Cetirizine and personal care products in the sources for drinking water is a serious concern. Cetirizine in aqueous media is readily degraded over a wide range of concentrations (4.3 to 65 mu mol/L) upon ultrasonic treatment at 640 KHz. When the concentration of CET was below 21.7 mu mol/L, more than 50 degrees A of the initial concentration was degraded within 12 min. The degradation is effectively modeled at individual concentrations by pseudo first order kinetics, however the rate constants varied from 0.148 to 0.025 min(-1) as a function of initial concentration. The degradation kinetics are effectively modeled by Langmuir-Hinshelwood heterogeneous kinetics. Application of the L = H model to the ultrasonic induced degradation of Cetirizine yields a reactivity constant, k(L-H-rxn) = 1.64 mu mol. L-1 . min(-1) and the partitioning constant, KL-H = 0.10 L/mu mol. Ultrasonically induced degradation of Cetirizine was faster under argon and oxygen saturated conditions compared to air saturation. Addition of an equimolar concentration of the hydroxyl radical scavenger, coumarin, during ultrasonic treatment lead to decreased degradation rates by 46 %, demonstrating that pyrolysis and hydroxyl radical oxidation significantly contribute to the degradation process. The primary degradation reaction products, 1-((4-chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methyl)piperazine, 2-(2-(piperazin-1-yeethoxy)acetic acid, 2-(4-((4-chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethanol, and ortho, meta and para hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of CET were identified by LC-MS. Ultrasound induced remediation is a rapid and effective method for remediation of Cetirizine from water.

AB Due to the abundant binding sites and high stability, a synthesized meso-MIL-53(Al) was selected as the backbone and used for immobilizing laccase (Lac-MIL-53(Al)) to catalytically degrade of TCS. XRD, BET and FTIR analyses proved that the carboxyl groups on PTA of meso-MIL-53(Al) could provide sufficient adsorption sites for physically immobilizing laccase through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Although the catalytic efficiency of V-max/K-m slightly decreased from 785 to 607 min(-1) due to the mass transfer limitation upon immobilized, Lac-MIL-53(Al) showed high activity recovery (93.8%) and stability. The conformational analysis indicated the laccase could partially enter into the MOF by conformational changes without impairing laccase, although the laccase molecular (6.5 nm x 5.5 nm x 4.5 nm) was larger than the mesopore sizes of the MOF (4 nm). The kinetics indicated that Lac-MIL-53(Al) could remove 99.24% of TCS within 120 min due to the synergy effect of the adsorption of meso-MIL-53(Al) and catalytic degradation of laccase. Meanwhile, Lac-MIL-53(Al) could remain approximately 60% of activity for up to 8 times reuse without desorption. The GC/MS and LC/MS/MS analyses further confirmed that TCS could be transformed to 2, 4-DCP by laccase via the breakage of the ether bond, or to passivated dimers, trimers and tetramers by the self-coupling and oxidization of the phenoxyl radicals, and finally removed by precipitation. In summary, enzyme-MOF composite might be a potential strategy to control the micropollutants in the wastewater.

AB Heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other wastes released into the environment can significantly influence environmental antibiotic resistance. We investigated the occurrence of 22 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 10 heavy metal concentrations, and the relationship between ARGs and heavy metals in surface sediment from seven sites of Lake Taihu. The results showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between sediment ARG levels, especially for tetracycline and sulfonamides (e.g., tet(A), tet(D), tet(E), tet(O), sul1, sul2 and int-1) and specific heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, among others) in the Lake. In the surface sediments, heavy metals showed an interaction with resistance genes, but the strength of interaction was diminished with increasing depth. For most of the heavy metals, the concentration of elements in the top sediments was higher than that in other depths. Tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(E) and tet(O), beta-lactam resistance genes (SHV, TEM, CTX, OXA and OXY) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sulA, sul1, sul2, sul3 and int-1) were detected. They showed a trend which inferred a statistically significant increase followed by decreases in the relative abundance of these ARGs (normalized to 16S rRNA genes) with increasing depth. This study revealed that tet(A), tet(O), TEM, OXY, int-1, sul1 and sul3 were widespread in surface sediments with high abundance, indicating that these genes deserve more attention in future work.

AB Increased consumption and improper disposal of prescription medication, such as beta (beta)-blockers, contribute to their introduction into waterways and may pose threats to non-target aquatic organisms. There has been rising concern about the impacts of these prescription drugs on coastal ecosystems, especially because wastewater treatment plants are not designed to eliminate them from the discharge. Few studies have characterized the sublethal effects of beta-blocker exposures in marine invertebrates. The overall aim of our research is to identify cellular responses of two commercially important filter-feeding marine bivalves, hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), upon exposures to two beta-blocker drugs, propranolol and metoprolol. In vitro exposures with bivalve digestive gland and gill tissues were conducted where tissues were separately exposed to each drug for 24 h. Tissue samples were analyzed for cellular damage (lysosomal membrane destabilization and lipid peroxidation), total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione-s-transferase activity. Elevated damage and changes in enzyme activities were noted in the exposed tissues at environmentally relevant concentrations. Differences in species and tissue sensitivities and responses to exposures were also observed. These studies enhance our understanding of the potential impacts of prescription medication on coastal organisms. Additionally, this work demonstrates that filter-feeders may serve as good model organisms to examine the effects of unintended environmental exposures to beta-blockers. These studies are part of our ongoing work aimed at evaluation of sublethal biomarkers of pharmaceutical exposures and identification of key events that can contribute to the development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).

AB The treatment performance of ibuprofen (IBP)-enriched wastewater by horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with cattail (Typha angustifolia) and unplanted control mesocosms was investigated. Removal efficiencies of IBP were significantly (p < .05) enhanced in the planted mesocosms (78.5%) compared to those in the unplanted beds (57.9%). An 18S rRNA gene high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was used to investigate the effects of IBP on the structure of the fungal community in these wetland systems. The overall diversity of the fungal community was reduced under the IBP exposure. Taxonomic analysis revealed that 62.2% of the fungal sequences were affiliated with Basidiomycota, followed by Ascomycota (37.4%) at the phylum level. Uncultured fungus (48.2%), Chaetomium sp. (14.2%), Aspergillus sp. (12.4%), Trichoderma sp. (5.7%), Cladosporium sp. (5.4%), and Emericellopsis sp. (5.2%) were identified as dominant genera. At the genus level, a distinct profile of the fungal community in the IBP-enriched mesocosms was observed as compared to the control beds, and as well specific fungal genera were enhanced in the planted beds, regardless of IBP enrichment. However, despite these differences, the composition of the fungal community (as measured by Bray-Curtis similarity) was mostly unaffected by the significant IBP enrichment. On the other hand, a consistent similarity pattern of fungal community structure in the planted mesocosms suggests that the presence of higher macrophytes in the wetland systems may well help shape the fungal community structure.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their degradation products which are present in wastewater and superficial waters are becoming an ecological issue. This research investigated the degradation and mineralization of synthetic solutions of the pharmaceutical compound sildenafil citrate (SC) by single ozonation and ozonation jointed with UV radiation (O-3/UV). The effects of initial drug concentration (50-125 mg L-1), inlet ozone concentration (35-125 g Nm(-3)), and UV radiation on SC degradation and decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated using response surface methodology based on a central composite experimental design. Through the RSM analysis, it was possible to confirm the removal of SC for the entire experimental range. Major intermediates of SC degradation were identified and a degradation pathway was proposed. The kinetics of SC degradation was modeled as a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant ranging between 0.072 and 1.250 min(-1). The SC degradation and TOC removal were strongly enhanced by increasing the concentration of gaseous ozone at the inlet and incorporating UV radiation. The highest TOC removal reached at 60 min was 75%, in the O-3/UV system, with initial SC content of 50 mg L-1 and inlet ozone concentration of 125 g Nm(-3). The degradation rate of SC was increased 3 to 9 times in the presence of UV radiation. Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes appear as a suitable alternative for treatment of the emerging pollutant SC.

AB Many studies have been conducted on the evaluation and monitoring of micropollutants and by-products in wastewater treatment plants. Considering the increase in the production and consumption of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, personal care products, and plasticisers, it is necessary to conduct studies that support the elaboration of laws and regulations that promote the environmentally sustainable use of sludge and effluents. In this work, the biological degradation of amoxicillin was studied under two anaerobic conditions: i) using a 6 L reactor operated under semi-continuous flow; and ii) a batch system with 100 mL sealed glass syringes. According to the statistical analysis, amoxicillin was completely removed from the systems, but biogas production inhibition was observed (p < 0.05). Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis identified amoxicillin penicilloic acid, amoxilloic acid, amoxicillin diketopiperazine and phenol hydroxypyrazine as by-products under anaerobic conditions. Ecotoxicity tests on effluent treated under the batch conditions showed that the addition of higher amounts of amoxicillin inhibited the target species Aliivibrio fischeri and Raphidocelis subcaptata, causing functional decreases of 28.5% and 22.2% when the antibiotic concentration was 2500 mu g L-1. A. fischeri was the most sensitive organism to effluent treated under semi-continuous flow conditions; a continuous reduction in bioluminescence of up to 88.8% was observed after 39 days of feeding, which was associated with by-products accumulation due to unbalanced conditions during anaerobic digestion. Changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the effluent caused the accumulation and removal of AMX-DKP IV and modified the toxicity to Lactuca saliva and R. subcapitata.

AB A novel magnetic nanosphere/nanorod/nanosheet-like photocatalyst Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr was fabricated via a facile one-pot solvothermal method firstly and exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBU) removal, where the removal efficiencies of DCF and IBU were 93.81% and 96.78% after 40 min and 30 min visible LED light irradiation, respectively. The best preparation ratios with Bi2S3 mass were 4% and 1% for DCF and IBU removal respectively, which might be attributed to better crystallinities of (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets respectively. Besides, enhanced charge separation and better crystallinity with introduction of Fe3O4 and Bi2S3 promoted higher photocatalytic performance of Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr compared with pure BiOBr, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/BiOBr. Influencing factors experiments (pH, common anions, DOM) results showed beneficial or detrimental effects to a certain extent. While removal efficiencies in matrices of Yellow River (DCF: 55.65%; IBU: 54.90%) and Wastewater treatment plant (DCF: 68.66%; IBU: 58.90%) exhibited lower than those in ultrapure water. Moreover, h+ and e-played the uppermost roles in the DCF and IBU photodegradation according to active species trapping experiment results. Furthermore, four and two main degradation pathways for DCF and IBU removal respectively through 3D EEMs and HRMS analyses were proposed. Lastly, easy separation from water and excellent reusability proved its better potential for emerging pollutants removal in environment remediation area.

AB In recent years, application of biochar for removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions has been of interest due to favorable physicochemical properties and availability of feedstock. However, adsorption behavior has been reported only for raw and micro biochar particles and taking advantage of biochar nanoparticles, which offer superior specific surface area, did not receive any attention. The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption efficiency of produced nanobiochar from pinewood. For this purpose, removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), a globally prescribed pharmaceutical, at very low concentrations (0.5-20 ppb) on as-produced nanobiochar with average particle size of 60 nm was studied. The results showed that nanobiochar can remove up to 95% of CBZ (74 mu g CBZ/g nanobiochar) after 3 h contact time. Adsorption of CBZ on nanobiochar followed Freundlich isotherm model (R-2 = 0.9822) and pseudo-second order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.9994). It was found that increasing pH from 3 to 8 can enhance the adsorption efficiency by 2.3 folds. Also, due to the presence of surfactant in wastewater, the addition of Tween 80 as a model surfactant was studied in the range of 0 to 1 (Tween 80 to CBZ molar ratio) and the results showed that adsorption efficiency can be enhanced by 57%. Thus, the nanobiochar obtained from pinewood residues can be a promising sorbent for micropollutants. (C) 2017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/ oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90 min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/ H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC-MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process. Four byproducts(benzene-1-ethenyl-4-(2-methypropyl), benzene 1-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-isobutyl, 4'-(2-methylpropyl)acetophenone, ibuprofen methyl ester) were detected after UV-LED catalytic degradation of IBP solution. The present study showed that the UV-LED/catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of IBP in comparison to direct photolysis by UV-LED.

AB Chlorpheniramine is a pharmaceutical pollutant and a precursor of carcinogenic nitrosamines during disinfection/oxidation. In our previous study, graphene oxide coated with magnetite (GO-Fe3O4) was capable of removing chlorpheniramine in deionized water by adsorption. This study investigated the removal of chlorpheniramine and its nitrosamine formation potentials (FPs) by adsorption onto magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influence by using real municipal wastewaters as the background. In the results, the adsorption performances of chlorpheniramine in wastewaters decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 suspension>GO-Fe3O4 particles>activated carbon. Chlorpheniramine adsorptions on GO-Fe3O4 particles and activated carbon were reduced by using real wastewaters as the background, whereas chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 suspension was enhanced due to the effects of surface charge on GO-Fe3O4 and ionic strength variation in water. The fittings of adsorption isotherms indicated that the wastewater background reduced the surface heterogeneity of GO-Fe3O4 suspension and improved the adsorption performance. Appreciable removal efficiencies of NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs were observed when GO-Fe3O4 particles were added in real wastewaters. However, when chlorpheniramine was present in wastewaters, chlorpheniramine adsorption and degradation reaction simultaneously occurred on the surface of GO-Fe3O4, increasing NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs in wastewaters after GO-Fe3O4 addition for chlorpheniramine adsorption. The assumption was further demonstrated by observing the NDMA-FP increase during chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 in deionized water. GO-Fe3O4 is a potential adsorbent for chlorpheniramine removal. Nevertheless, the low treatment efficiencies at high doses limit its application for nitrosamine FP adsorptions in real wastewaters.

AB Many pharmaceuticals inevitably end up in surface waters, exerting unwanted biological activity in nontarget organisms. This effect is confined by the compound's environmental persistence. Regulatory laboratory simulation tests are used in persistence assessment and exposure modeling. While doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of laboratory-derived persistence indicators under field conditions, these remain the only inputs for chemical fate models due to difficulties of measuring persistence in situ, especially at large scales. To improve understanding about relationships between laboratory experiments and the environmental fate in streams, we developed a mathematical model of biodegradation in stream networks and combined it with in-stream monitoring data to (i) test if persistence could be evaluated from field data, (ii) check if persistence extracted from laboratory tests applied in the field, and (iii) locate hot spots of biodegradation in a large river basin. The model describes partitioning, and particle settling and resuspension, and is structurally compatible with those applied for evaluating laboratory simulation tests. Application to the Rhine river basin suggests that biotransformation rate constants extracted from laboratory tests underestimate those in the field, yet the percentage of biotransformation in the Rhine basin is less than in the laboratory tests due effective biotransformation being limited to small- and medium-sized streams. In conclusion, our data show that biotransformation rates can accurately be predicted if (i) monitoring is performed across a wide range in stream order and (ii) precise estimates for consumption and removal rates at wastewater treatment plants are known.

AB This study evaluated the ability of cork to adsorb a broad range of phenolic, pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds: phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol carbamazepine, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, triclosan, and methyl paraben. The effect of variables such as the compound concentrations and the amount of cork were studied resulting in a highly pH dependence in the case of phenolic compounds. Maximum removal percentages and uptake values of 75% (1.61 mg/g) for 2,4-dichlorophenol, 55% (1.25 mg/g) for 2-nitrophenol, 45% (1.47 mg/g) for 2-chlorophenol, 20% (0.63 mg/g) for phenol, and 100% for pentachlorophenol, were obtained for a 30 mg L-1 solution at pH 6, showing that the adsorption process increased with greater electronegativity of the phenolic substituting group. Removal percentages and uptakes of 82% (3.56 mg/g) for naproxen, 57% (2.31 mg/g) for ketoprofen, 50% (1.84 mg/g) for carbamazepine, 50% (1.78 mg/g) for methyl paraben, 100% for sodium diclofenac, and 100% for triclosan, were obtained using 5 mg of cork and a 1 mg L-1 solution of each compound. The adsorption process was almost complete after 30 min for all the micropollutants. Experimental equilibrium data were analysed by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models. Cork has proved to be an effective sorbent for the removal of phenols and emerging contaminants from contaminated waters and is a readily available material that can be acquired at minimal or no cost in cork-producing areas.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is an alternative advanced treatment for wastewater reclamation, and it has the potential to control micropollutants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, the relationship of operating conditions in SAT and removals of micropollutants was not clear. In this study, the effects of operating conditions on the removals of PPCPs were evaluated by using lab-scale columns and plant pilot-scale reactors under different operating conditions. Firstly, weathered granite soil (WGS), standard sand (SAND) and Toyoura standard sand (TS) have different soil characteristics such as total organic carbon (TOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). In the columns with these packing materials, the removals of carboxylic analgesics and antilipidemics were effective regardless packing materials. The removals of antibiotics were more effective inWGS than in TS and SAND, indicating high TOC and CEC enhance the sorption in SAT. Secondly, with the extension of hydraulic retention time (HRT), the removals of sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, crotamiton, and antipyrine were improved inWGS columns, and adaptable biodegradation for moderately removable PPCPs was formed. Thirdly, the removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole and crotamiton were higher in the WGS column under vadose condition than in the WGS column under saturated condition, because of aerobic condition in WGS column under vadose condition. Though long HRT and vadose condition had positive influence on the removals of several PPCPs such as sulfamethoxazole, WGS column with an HRT of 7 days under saturated condition removed most PPCPs.

AB The very large number of emerging contaminants entering the water supply makes it desirable to assess these chemicals' environmental fate and behavior without direct measurements. Structure-property prediction models are promising in this regard, and quantitative molecular similarity assessment (QMSA) is one particularly appealing option. This study has two objectives related to QMSA modeling of emerging contaminants: (1) demonstrating that QMSA models can be used to accurately predict an environmental engineering parameter of interest, e.g., in vitro estrogenicity measurements, for highly diverse chemical classes; and (2) assessing the extent to which QMSA approaches can be used to prioritize among unmeasured chemicals and determine which additional measurements will result in maximally increased model accuracy. The results of this study are promising in both regards. QMSA models were found to predict the test parameter, estrogenicity, with cross validation coefficients (q(2)) as high as 0.84. Results of a paired t-test to evaluate the difference in increased model accuracy associated with QMSA-selection versus random-selection of additional compounds yielded statistically significant P-values < 0.0001. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that QMSA could dramatically reduce the number of laboratory and field measurements required to characterize as-yet unknown environmental fate and behavior parameters for diverse emerging contaminants of regulatory interest. Additional preliminary work points to the promise of QMSA for prediction of fundamental adsorption parameters; e.g., distribution coefficient (K-d) for selected pharmaceuticals onto activated sludge during municipal wastewater treatment.

AB Trinitroglycerin (TNG), a nitrate ester, is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for the treatment of angina pectoris (chest pain) And by the military for the manufacturing of dynamite and propellants. Currently, TNG is considered as a key environmental contaminant due to the discharge of wastewater tainted with the chemical from various military and pharmaceutical industries. The present study describes the use of a nanostructured silica material (Mobil Composite Material no. 48 [MCM-48]) prepared by mixing tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to remove TNG from water. The sorption of TNG onto MCM-48 rapidly reached equilibrium within I It. Sorption kinetics were best described using a pseudo-second order model, whereas sorption isotherms were best interpreted using the Langmuir model. The latter gave a maximum sorption capacity of 55.2 mg g(-1) at 40 degrees C. The enthalpy and entropy of TNG sorption onto MCM-48 were 1.89 kJ mol(-1) and 79.0 J mol(-1). K-1, indicating the endothermic nature of the TNG sorption onto MCM-48. When MCM-48 was heated at 540 degrees C for 5 It, the resulting calcined material (absence of the surfactant) did not sorb TNG, suggesting that the surfactant component of the nanomaterial was responsible for TNG sorption. Finally, we found that MCM-48 lost approximately 30% of its original sorption capacity after five sorption-desorption cycles. In conclusion, the nanostructured silica based sorbent, with high sorption capacity and remarkable reusability, should constitute the basis for the development of an effective technology for the removal of TNG from contaminated water.

AB Persistent and mobile organic compounds (PMOCs) are often detected micropollutants in the water cycle, thereby challenging the conventional wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques. Carbon-based adsorbents are often less effective or even unable to remove this class of pollutants. Understanding of PMOC adsorption mechanisms is urgently needed for advanced treatment of PMOC-contaminated water. Here, we investigated the effect of surface modifications of activated carbon felts (ACFs) on the adsorption of six selected PMOCs carrying polar or ionic groups. Among three ACFs, defunctionalized ACF bearing net positive surface charge at neutral pH provides the most versatile sorption efficiency for all studied PMOC types representing neutral, anionic and cationic compounds. Ion exchange capacity giving quantitative information of sorbent surface charges at specified pH is recognized as a frequently underestimated key property for evaluating adsorbents aiming at PMOC adsorption. A most recently developed prediction tool for Freundlich parameters in PMOC adsorption was applied and the prediction results are compared to the experimental data. The comparison demonstrates the so far underestimated importance of the sorbent surface chemistry for PMOC adsorption affinity and capacity. PMOC adsorption mechanisms were additionally investigated by adsorption experiments at various temperatures, pH values and electrolyte concentrations. Exothermic sorption was observed for all sorbatesorbent pairs. Adsorption is improved for ionic PMOCs on AC carrying sites of the same charge (positive or negative) at increased electrolyte concentration, while not affected for neutral PMOCs unless strong electron donor-acceptor yet weak non-Coulombic interactions exist. Our findings will allow for better design and targeted application of activated carbon-based sorbents in water treatment facilities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water pollution by emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products is one of today's biggest challenges. The presence of these emerging contaminants in water has raised increasing concern due to their frequent appearance and persistence in the aquatic ecosystem and threat to health and safety. The antidiabetic drug glimepiride, GPD, is among these compounds, and it possesses adverse effects on human health if not carefully administered. Several conventional processes were proposed for the elimination of these persistent contaminants, and adsorption is among them. Therefore, in this study, the adsorptive removal of GPD from water using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) supported on silica was explored on a fixed-bed column. The effects of bed-height, solution pH, and flow rate on the adsorptive removal of GPD were investigated. The obtained adsorption parameters using Sips, Langmuir, and Freundlich models were used to investigate the continuous adsorption. The results showed that the drug removal is improved with the increasing bed height; however, it decreased with the flow rate. The effect of pH indicated that the adsorption is significantly affected and increased in acidic medium. The convection-dispersion model coupled with Freundlich isotherm was developed and used to describe the adsorption breakthrough curves. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(m)) was 275.3 mg/g, and the axial dispersion coefficients were ranged between 3.5 and 9.0 x 10(5) m(2)/s. The spent adsorbent was successfully regenerated at high pH by flushing with NaOH.

AB The degradation of micropollutants (MPs), including pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, by ozone-based advanced oxidation techniques (AOP) was investigated in this study. The effect of different factors, such as ozone concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and initial pH, on the removal rate was studied in detail. The combination of UV with ozone/ H2O2 increased the MPs degradation. For example, atrazine removal increased from 12.6% to 66.9%. Increasing the concentration of ozone and H2O2 can enhance the degradation efficiency of MPs, while excess H2O2 plays a role as a scavenger for (OH)-O-?. In addition, the optimizing conditions of degradation of MPs by an ozone-based AOP were investigated in this study. The optimal dosages of ozone for atrazine (ATZ), alachlor (ALA), carbamazepine (CBZ), 17-?-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), were in the range of 0.6?0.75, while for ATZ a much higher dosage (5.4?mg/l) is needed. The optimal dosages of H2O2 concentration were at 0.75, 0.2, 0.47, 0.75 and 0.63?mM, and pH were at 10, 10, 7, 10 and 10, and reaction time at 38.5, 33.5 43, 6 and 6 min, respectively. Ozone-based AOP and in particular combination of UV with ozone and H2O2 is efficient to degrade atrazine, alachlor, carbamazepine, 17-?-ethinylestradiol and pentachlorophenol, and is attractive for future application of real wastewater treatment.

AB The antihypertensive losartan (LOS) has been detected in wastewater and environmental matrices, however further studies focused on assessing the ecotoxicological effects on aquatic ecosystems are necessary. Considering the intensive use of this pharmaceutical and its discharges into coastal zones, our study aimed to determine the environmental concentrations of LOS in seawater, as well as to assess the biological effects of LOS on the marine bivalve Perna perna. For this purpose, fertilization rate and embryolarval development were evaluated through standardized assays. Phase I (ethoxyresorufin O deethylase EROD and dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase DBF) and II (glutathione S-transferase GST) enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Cholinesterase (ChE), lipoperoxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were used to analyze sublethal responses in gills and digestive gland of adult individuals. Lysosomal membrane stability was also assessed in hemocytes. Our results showed the occurrence of LOS in 100% of the analyzed water samples located in Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a range of 0.2 ng/L-8.7 ng/L. Effects on reproductive endpoints were observed after short-term exposure to concentrations up to 75 mg/L. Biomarker responses demonstrated the induction of CYP450 like activity and GST in mussel gills exposed to 300 and 3000 ng/L of LOS, respectively. GPx activity was also increased in concentration of exposure to 3000 ng/L of LOS. Cyto-genotoxic effects were found in gills and hemocytes exposed in concentrations up to 300 ng/L. These results highlighted the concern of introducing this class of contaminants into marine environments, and pointed out the need to include antihypertensive compounds in environmental monitoring programs.

AB In this work, we innovatively applied the 3D amperometry detection, coupled to liquid chromatography, for the determination of a mixture of chromatographically unresolved compounds (two herbicides-monuron and bentazon, one drug-propranolol and the main metabolite of an antiepileptic drug-5-(4MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin). Exploiting the post-chromatographic current integration, a scanning waveform was successfully applied to explore a wide range of potentials (0.0-1.3 V) to find the peculiar oxidative potential value for each compound. This approach allowed us to obtain 3D chromatograms (elution time vs potential vs current) in which coeluted species could be clearly distinguished. Quantitation was easily obtained by extraction of 2D chromatograms (elution time vs integrated current), from the 3D ones, at the optimised waveform time ranges (800-1,000 msec and 1,500-1,700 msec, corresponding to 0.6-0.8 V and 1.0-1.2, respectively). Validation of the proposed 3D amperometry method was performed in terms of linearity, limits of detection and quantitation and repeatability. Matrix effect was studied by statistical treatment on a wastewater effluent. By coupling an on-line solid phase extraction step prior to separation and detection by 3D amperometry, detection limits were significantly reduced (57 ng/L for bentazon, with recovery yields of 82.9 +/- 10.9%). It is worth mentioning that this value fully satisfies the requirements of the 98/83/CE directive for the determination of bentazon in groundwater.

AB Metal-free catalysis for green degradation of aqueous organic pollutants has caused extensive concern in recent years. In this study, hexagonally-ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) was applied to activate persulfate (PS) for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) with superior removal rate of 90% in 20 min. The high catalytic efficiency was probably ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer resulting from the large adsorption capacity of CMK-3. It was found that specific surface areas (SSA), defective sites and functional groups on the activator were highly related to its catalytic efficiency and passivadon. Compared to other nanocarbons, CMK-3 had better reusability due to its ordered mesoporous structure with large SSA and high defective degrees. For the first time, a two-pathway mechanism was proposed for metal-free activation process of PS, indicating that radical and nonradical oxidation worked together in PS activation for complete 2,4-DCP decomposition, and non-radical pathway played a dominant role while radical pathway was critical in accelerating the reaction. center dot OH, SO(4)(center dot-)and O-2(center dot)- all took part in the radical oxidation process, in which the contribution of center dot OH was dominant. Besides, high decomposition efficiency was also achieved in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by the CMK-3/PS system. This research proposed a new electron transfer mechanism for metal-free activation process of PS, which can provide a theoretical support for further studies.

AB Septic systems may contribute micropollutants to shallow groundwater and surface water. We constructed two in situ conventional drainfields (drip dispersal and gravel trench) and an advanced drain field of septic systems to investigate the fate and transport of micropollutants to shallow groundwater. Unsaturated soil-water and groundwater samples were collected, over 32 sampling events Uanuary 2013 to June 2014), from the drainfields (0.31-1.07 m deep) and piezometers (3.1-3.4 m deep). In addition to soil-water and groundwater, effluent samples collected from the septic tank were also analyzed for 20 selected micropollutants, including wastewater markers, hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), a plasticizer, and their transformation products. The removal efficiencies of micro pollutants from septic tank effluent to groundwater were similar among three septic systems and were 51-89% for sucralose and 53 >99% for other micropollutants. Even with high removal rates within the drainfields, six PPCPs and sucralose with concentrations ranging from <03 to 154 ng/L and 121 to 32,000 ng/L reached shallow groundwater, respectively. The human health risk assessment showed that the risk to human health due to consumption of groundwater is negligible for the micropollutants monitored in the study. A better understanding of ecotoxicological effects of micropollutant mixtures from septic systems to ecosystem and human health is warranted for the long-term sustainability of septic systems.

AB Increased use of antidepressants has led to an increase in their detection in final treated wastewater effluents and receiving streams. Antidepressants are intended to modify human behavior by altering brain chemistry, and because of the high functional conservation of antidepressant target receptors in vertebrates, aquatic organisms may be at risk. The antidepressant bupropion is designed to alter brain norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in humans. The objective of the present study was to understand if alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilisxMorone chrysops) brain by bupropion would alter this predator's ability to capture prey. The authors exposed hybrid striped bass to bupropion in a static system for 6d, followed by a 6-d recovery period. During the present study's 12-d experiment, each hybrid striped bass was fed 4 unexposed fathead minnows every 3d, and the time it took the hybrid striped bass to consume each of those 4 fathead minnows was quantified. After each feeding event, hybrid striped bass brains were harvested and analyzed for changes in several brain neurotransmitter concentrations, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and many of their metabolites. Although bupropion altered the concentration of dopamine and many of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations in the brains on day 3 of the exposure, it did not alter the time to capture prey. This suggests that alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass brain does not alter a predator's ability to capture prey.

AB To quantify the extent of antibiotic contamination and to identity the dominant pollutant sources in the Tiaoxi RiverWatershed, surface water samples were collected at eight locations and analyzed for four tetracyclines and three sulfonamides using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The observed maximum concentrations of tetracycline (623 ng L-1), oxytetracycline (19,810 ng L-1), and sulfamethoxazole (112 ng L-1) exceeded their corresponding Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. In particular, high concentrations of antibiotics were observed in wet summer with heavy rainfall. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics appeared in the vicinity of intensive aquaculture areas. High-resolution land use data were used for identifying diffuse source of antibiotic pollution in the watershed. Significant correlations between tetracycline and developed (r = 0.93), tetracycline and barren (r = 0.87), oxytetracycline and barren (r = 0.82), and sulfadiazine and agricultural facilities (r = 0.71) were observed. In addition, the density of aquaculture significantly correlated with doxycycline (r = 0.74) and oxytetracycline (r = 0.76), while the density of livestock significantly correlated with sulfadiazine (r = 0.71). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole were from aquaculture and domestic sources, whereas sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine were from livestock wastewater. Flood or drainage from aquaculture ponds was identified as a major source of antibiotics in the Tiaoxi watershed. A hot-spot map was created based on results of land use analysis and multivariable statistics, which provided an effective management tool of sources identification in watersheds with multiple diffuse sources of antibiotic pollution.

AB The fate of three endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), namely 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), triclosan (TCS) and bisphenol A (BPA), was studied in activated sludge process. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) on their sorption and biodegradation was also investigated. Three continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used, operating at SRT of 3, 10 and 20 days, respectively. Batch experiments with biomass originated from the aforementioned systems showed that 4-n-NP and TCS are significantly sorbed on the suspended solids, while BPA to a lesser extent. The sorption affinity of target compounds did not seem to be affected by SRT, with the exception of 4-n-NP for which higher values of sorption coefficients were calculated at SRT of 3 days. The operation of continuous-flow systems in the presence of 10-40 mu g L-1 of EDCs indicated that more than 90%, 94% and 97% of BPA, TCS and 4-n-NP, respectively, can be removed during the activated sludge process in systems operating at SRT of 3-20 days. Determination of EDCs in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of their mass flux revealed that biodegradation was the principal removal mechanism of EDCs. For SRT values used in this study, this parameter does not seem to affect significantly percentage biodegradation of BPA. On the other hand, biodegradation of 4-n-NP and TCS was enhanced at SRT of 20 days. Calculation of biotransformation rates showed that the highest values for all EDCs were calculated at SRT of 3 days. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India, is a major production site for the global bulk drug market. Approximately 90 manufacturers send their wastewater to a common treatment plant in Patancheru. Extraordinary high levels of a wide range of pharmaceuticals have recently been demonstrated in the treated effluent. As little as 0.2% of this effluent can strongly reduce the growth rate of tadpoles, but the underlying mechanisms of toxicity are not known. To begin addressing how the effluent affects aquatic vertebrates, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to 0.2% effluent for 5 d. Several physiological endpoints, together with effects on global hepatic gene expression patterns, were analyzed. The exposed fish showed both an induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) gene expression, as well as enzyme activity. Clinical blood chemistry analyses revealed an increase in plasma phosphate levels, which in humans indicates impaired kidney function. Several oxidative stress-related genes were induced in the livers; however, no significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities or in the hepatic glutathione levels were found. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes were slightly up-regulated following exposure, and moderate levels of estriol were detected in the effluent. The present study identifies changes in gene expression triggered by exposure to a high dilution of the effluent, supporting the hypothesis that these fish are responding to chemical exposure. The pattern of regulated genes may contribute to the identification of mechanisms of sublethal toxicity, as well as illuminate possible causative agents.

AB The ozonation of four pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) in ultra-pure (UP) water was studied in the pH range between 2.5 and 9. The experiments allowed the determination of the apparent rate constants for the reactions between ozone and the selected compounds. The values obtained varied depending on the pH, and ranged between 239 and 1.27 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) for metoprolol; 2.62 x 10(4) and 2.97 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) for naproxen; 2.31 x 10(3) and 1.21 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) for amoxicillin: and 215 and 1.57 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) for phenacetin. Due to the acidic nature of these substances, the degree of dissociation of each pharmaceutical was determined at every pH of work, and the specific rate constants of the neutral and ionic species formed were evaluated. Additionally, the simultaneous ozonation of the pharmaceuticals in different water matrices was carried out by considering a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and three secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants. The influence of the operating conditions (initial ozone dose, nature of pharmaceuticals and type of water) on the pharmaceuticals elimination efficiency was established, and a kinetic model was proposed for the evaluation of the partial contribution to the global oxidation of both, the direct ozonation reaction and the radical pathway.

AB The present investigation was on the assessment of the fate of 15 organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) under abiotic (predominantly adsorption) and biotic (predominantly bio-sorption/bio-degradation) conditions in columns packed with the aquifer material. The motivation behind this work was to predict the fate of the OMPs during subsurface flow/riverbank filtration (RBF). Columns were packed with aquifer material that was taken out from the laterals of a RBF well, M-15 during its cleaning operation. OMPs that were selected for the study were frequently detected in the river Yamuna, M-15 and other nearby RBF wells. The list included pharmaceuticals and their raw materials, endocrine disruptors, OMPs found in hospital wastes, steroid and personal care products structurally belonging to acrylates, neutral organics, amines, phenols and fatty acids. Among different OMPs, dimethyl maleate, benzoic acid, guanine and lomustine were found to be more mobile than estriol, decanoic acid, 1-tridecanol, 1- eicosanol, triclosan, stearic acid and cetyl alcohol. The mobility depended on the polarity of the OMPs. The retardation factor of non-polar OMPs was more than the polar ones. However, the mobility of the OMPs was considerably restricted in the biotic column. Retardation factors (R-d) for OMPs varied widely in adsorption column from 3 to 772. In biosorption column, R-d ranged from 6 to 1692 showing better removal except for benzophenone. Although, non-polar OMPs may take several years to travel to wells through the sandy aquifer, however, earlier occurrence of some of the polar OMPs cannot be ruled out. Additional treatment for OMPs is must before public distribution.
