AB In this work, the Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and their antibacterial property was confirmed using the plate colony counting method. The SiO2 and Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles were used to prepare the PVDF/SiO2 and PVDF/Ag-SiO2 nanocomposite membranes, respectively. Pure water flux, contact angle and mechanical strength measurement analyses were conducted to characterize and compare the performance of the neat and nanocomposite membranes. Moreover, in order to investigate the structure of the prepared membranes scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to obtain surface and cross-section images. A long-term filtration test was carried out in a bench scale submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) system, fed by real pharmaceutical wastewater, to evaluate the antibiofouling performance of the prepared neat and nanocomposite membranes. In comparison to the neat PVDF, the pure water flux of the nanocomposite PVDF membrane (PVDF/Ag-SiO2; 0.6 wt %) increased about 60% and the water contact angle decreased from about 99 degrees to 89 degrees. The obtained results showed that the nanocomposite PVDF/Ag-SiO2 membrane exhibits considerable antibiofouling properties such that the accumulated dried biofilm as well as the extra cellular polymeric substances (EPSs) collected from the cake layer decreased considerably for the nanocomposite membrane. Moreover, the flux recovery ratio increased from 58% for the neat PVDF membrane to 76% for the nanocomposite PVDF/Ag-SiO2 membrane. The excitation and emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that the accumulated protein on the surface of nanocomposite membranes decreased considerably in a way that the peak corresponding to tryptophan protein-like substances diminished completely, indicating the high antibiofouling potential of nanocomposite membranes. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium removal efficiencies of the neat and nanocomposite membranes were higher than 90% and 95%, respectively, indicating negligible impact of the membrane modification on the effluents' quality.

AB Knowledge of exposure to a wide range of chemicals, and the spatio-temporal variability thereof, is urgently needed in the context of protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems. This paper discusses a computational material flow analysis to predict the occurrence of thousands of man-made organic chemicals on a European scale, based on a novel temporally and spatially resolved modelling framework. The goal was to increase understanding of pressures by emerging chemicals and to complement surface water monitoring data. The ambition was to provide a first step towards a "real-life" mixture exposure situation accounting for as many chemicals as possible. Comparison of simulated concentrations and chemical monitoring data for 226 substance/basin combinations showed that the simulated concentrations were accurate on average. For 65% and 90% of substance/basin combinations the error was within one and two orders of magnitude respectively. An analysis of the relative importance of uncertainties revealed that inaccuracies in use volume or use type information contributed most to the error for individual substances. To resolve this, we suggest better registration of use types of industrial chemicals, investigation of presence/absence of industrial chemicals in wastewater and runoff samples and more scientific information exchange.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has been of concerns for their potential threats to ecosystems and human's health for decades. PPCPs have been detected in water environments worldwide and have been identified in water sources and finished water. To elucidate the potential exposure of PPCPs in drinking water, this study assessed the occurrences and treatment efficiencies of PPCPs in the drinking water of Taiwan. Raw and finished water samples collected from five main drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in February, June, and November 2018 were analyzed. Furthermore, laboratory-scale water treatment processes were conducted to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of these chemicals. Most of the water samples from the DWTPs had a low concentration (<30 ng/L) of PPCPs. Only samples from a DWTP was observed to have higher concentration of ibuprofen (55.6 ng/L), benzophenone (92.5 ng/L), caffeine (390.5 ng/L), and diethyltoluamide (DEET) (434.9 ng/L) in raw water than others. The results of laboratory simulations indicated that the pre-chlorination process was the key step responsible for the removal of PPCPs in conventional water treatment processes, which can remove most of the hormone treatment products, parabens, oxybenzone, and acetaminophen in water sources. However, the filtration process with anthracite as a medium could remove some of the parabens (approximately 11.9%-41.2%), hormones (approximately 18.2%-44.8%), suntan lotions (37.5%-68.8%), and naproxen (30.1%) from Milli-Q water. The removal efficiencies of the aforementioned chemicals were marginally lower in raw water. However, analgesics, caffeine, and DEET cannot be removed effectively through conventional drinking water treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sonochemical degradation of trimethoprim (TMP), a widely used antibiotic, in various water matrices was investigated. The effect of several parameters, such as initial TMP concentration (0.5-3 mg/L), actual power density (20-60 W/L), initial solution pH (3-10), inorganic ions, humic acid and water matrix on degradation kinetics was examined. The pseudo-first order degradation rate of TMP was found to increase with increasing power density and decreasing pH, water complexity (ultrapure water > bottled water > secondary wastewater) and initial TMP concentration.
   TMP degradation is accompanied by the formation of several transformation products (TPs) as evidenced by LC-QToF-MS analysis. Nine such TPs were successfully identified and their time-trend profiles during degradation were followed. An in silico toxicity evaluation was performed showing that several TPs could potentially be more toxic than the parent compound towards Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.

AB An integrated separation process is proposed for recovery and enantioseparation of a chiral antihypertensive drug amlodipine from wastewater. Utilizing this integrated technology, both high recovery (Y) and high enantiomeric excess (ee) were obtained due to the strong enrichment ability of supported liquid membrane with strip dispersion (SLM-SD) and the good enantioseparation ability of organic phase crystallization. These two steps were coupled by an intermediate step: aqueous phase crystallization. In the SLM-SD, an extractant P204 (bi (2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) was dissolved in n-heptane to form a liquid membrane phase, and hydrochloric acid was used as stripping agent. One-stage SLM-SD recycled the amlodipine from wastewater into a stripping phase with a removal (E-AD) of 99.67% and a Y-1,Y-AD of 87.91% after optimizing the parameters: pH and the concentrations of P204, hydrochloric acid, and amlodipine. Sodium hydroxide and (L)-tartaric acid were added into the stripping aqueous phase to obtain amlodipine-1/2(L)-tartrate acid crystals, which were directly used in the subsequent organic phase crystallization without tedious additional steps. The Y-2,Y- (AD) of aqueous phase crystal reached 99% at a pH of over 6.68 and a molar ratio of over 0.5 for (L)-tartrate acid to amlodipine. Using (L)-tartaric acid or (D)-tartaric acid as resolving agent and dimethylsulfoxide as solvent, high-value-added products (R)-amlodipine and (S)-amlodipine were obtained by two steps of organic phase crystallization. The ee of products was over 99% after optimizing the dosages of dimethylsulfoxide and resolving agent. To increase the total yield, the generated mother liquors were re-treated by SLM-SD with the recovery of over 99% for residual amlodipine.

AB Conventional coagulation is widely used as an ultrafiltration membrane pretreatment process in wastewater reclamation, however it shows little ability to reduce organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) and genotoxicity. In this research, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and potassium ferrate were used respectively with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to enhance coagulation. Filtration experiments of coagulation (CUF), coagulation-adsorption (CAUF) and coagulation-oxidation (COUF) pretreatment combined with densadeg-ultrafiltration processes were conducted under their optimum doses. The effluent water quality of CAUF and COUF could meet the water reuse quality standard for scenic environment use, while total phosphorus in the conventional CUF discharge was higher than the standard. The average removal efficiency of the selected fourteen OMPs was significantly improved by 1.8 times through the CAUF process compared to the CUF process (31.2%), whereas the COUF process (38.4%) showed limited improvement. Prominent reduction of genotoxicity was observed in the CAUF and COUF processes, and the effluent of the CAUF process had the least genotoxicity of 1.0 +/- 0.3 mu g 4-Nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO)/L. Moreover, the average transmembrane pressure increasing rate followed the order of CUF (1.5 kPa/d) > COUF (1.1 kPa/d) > CAUF (0.6 kPa/d), indicated that the enhanced coagulation process could relieve membrane fouling effectively.

AB The anti-cancer drug Flutamide (FLUT) is widely used and is of great environmental concern. The solar photo-Fenton (SPF) process can be an effective treatment for the removal of this type of micropollutant. The use of a single addition of 5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ and 50 mg L-1 of H2O2 achieved 20% primary degradation and only 3.05% mineralization. By using three additions of 5 mg L-1 Fe2+, with an initial H2O2 concentration of 150 mg L-1, 58% primary degradation was achieved, together with 12.07% mineralization. Consequently, thirteen transformation products (TPs) were formed. The SPF process was further combined with adsorption onto avocado seed activated carbon (ASAC) as an environmentally friendly approach for the removal of remained FLUT and the TPs. Doehlert design was used to assess the behavior of 13 TPs by optimizing the contact time and the adsorbent mass load. The optimal conditions for removal of FLUT and the TPs were 14 mg of ASAC and a contact time of 40 min. Remained FLUT and the TPs were totally removed using the adsorption process. The mechanisms of adsorption of FLUT and the TPs were strongly influenced by their polarity and pi-pi interactions of the TPs onto ASAC.

AB Drug abuse trends in South Korea were assessed by estimating the consumption rates of drugs that may be abused or misused by performing wastewater-based drug epidemiology. Of the 29 target compounds, 10 were found in samples from three wastewater treatment plants. Ephedrine had the highest mean estimated consumption rate, 574.1 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1). The anti-obesity drugs phendimetrazine and phentermine had the second and fifth highest mean estimated consumption rates, 182.9 and 113.1 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1), respectively. The zolpidem consumption rate was 65.8 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1). Methamphetamine was the only illicit drug detected in wastewater, and the estimated consumption rates (14.9-28.6 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1)) were similar to consumption rates found in previous Korean studies (not detected to 45.8 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1)). The mean estimated meperidine and cis-tramadol (opioid) consumption rates were 120 and 27.5 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1), respectively, and were 8.2 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the consumption rates found in 2013. Methylphenidate was detected in the influent and effluent samples at mean concentrations of 2.7 and 2.6 ng L-1, respectively, but the methylphenidate consumption rate could not be estimated because of the low excretion rate for humans (< 1%).

AB In this study, the fate of several micropollutants (MPs) in wastewater due to coagulation using both fresh and recovered aluminum and iron coagulants was determined. 18 MPs from different groups such as antibiotics, food additives, and surfactants were selected and spiked into the primary influent collected from a local wastewater plant. The distribution of MPs in the recovered coagulant and treated effluent after coagulation was determined for both fresh and recycled coagulants. The distribution of MPs in wastewater and the removal during coagulation were compound specific; MPs with log K-ow < 2.5 were predominantly present in the effluent after coagulation, while MPs with log K-ow > 2.5 were sorbed on the coagulated sludge. The distribution ratio (K-d) of all the MPs (diclofenac, clarithromycin, etc.) with log K-ow > 2.5 was determined along with their extent of accumulation in sludge due to the recycling of coagulants. Compounds such as sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and sulfathiazole, showed low removal during coagulation. The tetracycline group of compounds showed possible chelation with iron and aluminum. Only <10% of the initially spiked MPs with log K-ow > 2.5 was being recycled with the recovered coagulant, thus alleviating the concern of accumulation of the MPs during recycle of the coagulants.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are widely found in the environment due to vast human consumption. Lots of work has been devoted to investigating the occurrence and seasonal variations globally. To fully understand characteristics and cross-year variation of PhACs in Beijing, 35 PhACs were analyzed in 46 sites across Beijing from both urban and suburban areas. Concentrations of target PhACs were ranged from levels of ng L-1 to mu g L-1. Metoprolol (524 ng L-1), caffeine (390 ng L-1) and acetaminophen (156 ng L-1) were the three most abundant non-antibiotics with the highest median concentration, and nalidixic acid (135 ng L-1), erythromycin (64 ng L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (77 ng L-1) were the most abundant antibiotics. Urban and suburban areas are distinguished by PhAC composition in cluster analysis due to different wastewater collection rate. The ratio of easily removable compound group and hardly removable group was then proposed to reflect the wastewater collection rate. The compositional comparison of PhACs in WWTPs' effluents and their receiving rivers further illustrates the impact of WWTPs in urban area. Higher proportion of antibiotics (>30%) in suburban area reflected the impact of presence of livestock farms, which should be concerned. Further statistical analyses show an improving trend of wastewater collection rate, and excluding metoprolol, an anti-hypertension medicine, the total concentration of 13 target PhACs was reduced by 72% during 2013-2017.

AB A novel electrochemical membrane bioreactor (EMBR) was developed for enhancing PPCPs removal from real municipal wastewater. Compared to the control MBR (CMBR) without applying electric field, EMBR exhibited higher removal efficiencies for 14 PPCPs among all investigated PPCPs, including 3 fluoroquinolones, 2 macrolides, 6 sulfonamides and 3 anti-inflammatory drugs, while no significant difference was observed for the rest 8 PPCPs. The enhanced removal of 14 PPCPs was mainly attributed to electrooxidation by the direct anodic oxidation and reactive oxygen species-mediated indirect oxidation. Moreover, membrane fouling rates of EMBR (0.55 +/- 0.10 kPa/d) were significantly reduced compared with CMBR (0.99 +/- 0.09 kPa/d). Microbial activities and community analyses demonstrated that the applied electric field had no noticeable adverse impact on microbial viabilities, richness and diversity. These findings demonstrated that this EMBR enhanced pollutant removal and mitigated membrane fouling simultaneously, highlighting the potential of the novel technology to be used for removing PPCPs from wastewater.

AB The proper choice of dissolved oxygen (DO) is important in aerobic treatment. In this paper, a multi-stage vertical variable diameter membrane bioreactor was developed to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and ceftriaxone sodium. In the 180 days of operation, the performance of COD, BOD5, 6-APA, ceftriaxone sodium removal, sludge index, and microbial enzyme activity under different DOs (from 0.5 to 6.0 mg/L) were investigated. The results showed that the optimal range of DO was 1.5-2.1 mg/L, and the highest removal rates of COD and BOD5 were observed 87.3% +/- 2.4% and 95.3% +/- 1.8%, the corresponding effluent COD and BOD5 were 189 mg/L and 24 mg/L, respectively. To reduce the energy consumption and ensure stability of DO in the reactor, a control strategy based on an improved differential evolution BP fuzzy neural network was built and found that the performance and cost of the controlled DO were improved effectively than that of uncontrolled DO.

AB A tube-in-tube membrane reactor, operating with radial addition of H2O2, was employed for the intensification of heterogeneous H2O2/TiO2 photocatalytic processes. Polluted water is continuously fed into the annular space between the shell side of an ultrafiltration membrane and an outer quartz tube. The membrane shell-side surface is coated with a thin-film of TiO2-P25. The oxidant (H2O2) is internally fed to the membrane, which permeates through the membrane pores, being dosed and uniformly delivered to the active catalyst sites. Radiation is externally supplied via four UVC or UVA lamps. The helical movement of water around the membrane shell side improves the radial dispersion of the oxidant, promoting efficiently its UVC photolytic cleavage into %OH within the annular reaction zone. Tests were performed using pure water and a secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, both spiked with 100 mu g L-1 of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The efficiency of the photochemical (UVC and UVC/H2O2) processes was first assessed as a function of H2O2 dose. Then, E2 and EE2 photocatalytic oxidation efficiency by UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2/TiO2 was evaluated according to the amount of TiO2-P25 deposited on the outer surface of the membrane, H2O2 dose, H2O2 addition mode, light source and aqueous solution matrix. The UVC/H2O2/TiO2 system with radial H2O2 addition showed the highest oxidation ability, resulting in E2 and EE2 removal percentages of 51/32% and 48/30%, respectively, for the synthetic/real matrices, using a low UVC fluence (45 mJ cm(-2)).

AB Nanofiltration (NF) has been recognized as a cost-effective membrane technology for wastewater reclamation, while little information is available about its performance in pilot scale for practical engineering application. In addition, the biofouling issue is always a barrier to membrane process for its long-term stable operation which requires further investigations. In this study, the performance of a pilot-scale two-stage NF system was continually monitored for three months. The membrane autopsy characterization was conducted when the irreversible membrane fouling occurred. The rejections of COD, TOC and TP by NF were 96.5 +/- 1.2%, 91.9 +/- 1.9% and 97.7 +/- 2.1%, respectively. A total of 23 emerging contaminants have been detected in NF influent, including 19 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and four environmental estrogens (EEs). Except for bisphenol A (57.6%) and ibuprofen (69.9%), the rejections of other 21 emerging contaminants were all higher than 80% by the NF system. Microbial community structure analysis showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the two predominant bacteria on the membrane surface with percentages of 34.1%-41.0% and 23.4%-30.6% at phylum level, respectively. At genus level, Stenotrophomonas and Pseudoxanthomonas were primarily dominant in the first stage, while Cloacibacterium and Methyloversatilis showed higher relative abundances in the second stage. Sphingopyxis was an extremely stubborn genus on the membrane surface. Besides, the biodiversity of microbial communities in the first stage was higher than that in the second stage, possibly showing more severe biofouling in the first stage of the two-stage NF system. This study has provided insights to understand the practical performance of NF technology in pilot scale and could give guideline for biofouling control in NF engineering application.

AB Removal of micropollutants from wastewaters is crucial to ensure safe water reuse and protect natural water-courses. Although membrane bioreactors (MBRs) yield improved degradation of organic compounds, hydraulic retention times are often too short to satisfy acceptable removal rates of recalcitrant organics. Often, results regarding micropollutant removal in treatment plants are susceptible to uncontrolled feed concentrations, which are concomitant to seasonality and consumer habits. In this work, we investigate the concentration transients of four selected pesticides (carbendazim, diuron, 2,4-D and atrazine), which were constantly dosed to a MBR pilot plant treating high-strength industrial effluents (COD values ). In addition to the regular MBR operation, two feasible means of extending pesticide retention in bioreactors were evaluated: (i) addition of small concentrations of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the activated sludge and (ii) coupling of the PAC-assisted MBR and a reverse osmosis unit (RO) with recirculation of the retentate. The aim of this work is to provide reliable information on the fate of micropollutants within wastewater treatment plants using different configurations under controlled feed conditions. Results have shown that carbendazim was the only pesticide efficiently (>80%) removed during regular MBR operation, which has been attributed to the presence of electron donating groups attached to its aromatic ring structure. Improved retention of diuron by addition of PAC enhanced its long-term removal, whereas the effect of PAC addition on the removal of 2,4-D and atrazine was only temporary, thus being mainly attributed to an adsorption effect. Additionally, the function of PAC as platform for biofloc formation limited sludge production and slowed down membrane fouling, further improving the general performance of the MBR. The MBR-RO hybrid process was the most effective one in increasing the residence time of pesticides in the bioreactor, regardless of their functional groups and properties, thus facilitating a generalized removal of micropollutants.

AB A porous Z-scheme MnO2/Mn-modified alkalinized g-C3N4 catalyst (MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn) was fabricated by calcination-impregnation method. MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn exhibited higher Fenton-like photocatalytic activity in degrading tetracycline than pure g-C3N4 and alkalinized g-C3N4. The optimal MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15(%) showed the highest catalytic activity with 96.7% tetracycline removal and 74.9% total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency due to the enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. The tetracycline degradation process followed two pathways, and the formation of NO3- further revealed deep mineralization of tetracycline to inorganic substance during the photocatalytic degradation. The highest center dot OH yield of MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15(%) was attributable to synergism of surface grafted hydroxyl groups, Z-scheme charge transfer and H2O2 activation via redox cycles of Mn(IV)/Mn(III)/Mn(II). The Fenton-like photocatalytic mechanism of Z-scheme MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn was presented. Moreover, MnO2/CNK-OH-Mn-15% can effectively dispose of pharmaceutical wastewater with 77.1% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal.

AB The removal of micropollutants from municipal wastewater is challenged by the number of compounds with diverse physico-chemical properties. Ozonation is increasingly used to remove micropollutants from wastewater. However, ozonation does not necessarily result in complete mineralization of the organic micropollutants but rather transforms them into new compounds which could be persistent or have adverse environmental effects. To explore ozone dose dependency of the formation and successive removal of ozonation products, two pilot-scale and one full-scale ozonation plants were operated subsequent to a conventional activated sludge treatment. The results from these trials indicated that the concentrations of several N-oxides, such as Erythromycin N-oxide, Venlafaxine N-oxide and Tramadol N-oxide, increased up to an ozone dose of 0.56-0.61 mg O-3/mg DOC while they decreased at elevated doses of 0.7-1.0 mg O-3/mg DOC. Similar results were also obtained for two transformation products of Diclofenac (Diclofenac 2,5-quinone imine and 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2,3-dione) and one transformation product of Carbamazepine (1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione), where the highest concentrations appeared around 0.27-0.31 mg O-3/mg DOC. The formation maximum of a given compound occurred at a specific ozone dose that is characteristic for each compound, but seemed to be independent of the wastewater used for the experiments at the two pilots and the full-scale plant.

AB A microwave-assisted hydrothermal preparation of heterostructured graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (denoted as GBR-T, T = microwave irradiation time) is performed. The prepared GBR-T photocatalysts are identified by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The photocatalytic performance of these GBR-T is evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) under the visible light (lambda > 420 nm) and solar light irradiation. Among all prepared photocatalysts, ca. 93% of IBP photodegradation can be achieved with a degradation rate constant (k) of 0.011 min(-1) under visible-light irradiation upon the optimal microwave-assisted reaction time of 60 min. The improvement is primarily attributable to the higher crystallization degree, specific surface area and increased charge transfer efficiency as verified by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and TRPL, respectively. The photocatalytic performance of this catalyst is further enhanced in the photodecomposition of IBP (ca. 98.6%) under sun light irradiation. The electron spin resonance (ESR) and liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) studies show that the superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals are the dominant active species in the photocomposition of IBP and degradation intermediates are formed through three probable photodegradation pathways. This investigation provides a simple way to prepare triple 2D heterojuction photocatalysts which could be effectively used in the advanced oxidation process for removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater by using renewable energy.

AB Measuring community consumption of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is notoriously difficult to assess by traditional means such as surveys and seizure data. Previously, we used the approach to demonstrate the prevalence of NPS on a national scale. In the current study we explored the temporal resolution for the analysis of NPS in wastewater from Australia. Samples covering all States and Territories in Australia and both metropolitan and regional areas and were collected bimonthly from October 2017-June 2018 and October 2019-February 2020. A qualitative screening method was applied, screening for 201 NPS. In total, 15 substances were found from a variety of classes of NPS. The most prevalent class was synthetic cathinones, with pentylone, N-ethylpentylone and ethylone found in all periods in at least one site in the earlier sampling period, as well as the amphetamine-like paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA). In the latter period, synthetic cathinones were also the most prevalent, including eutylone, marking the first time that this compound has been detected in wastewater. This study shows the application of wastewater analysis to detect outbreaks of NPS use and temporal differences among sites. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sertraline is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the last few years. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is regularly detected in wastewaters, surface waters, sediments, biosolids and biota. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants are the main contributors to its presence in the environment. The presented study aims to elucidate the processes involved in its removal, concentrating mainly on sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment.
   We performed our laboratory scale experiments in two sets of experiments: 1) batch biodegradation and sorption experiments and 2) flow-through laboratory scale pilot wastewater treatment bioreactors. The batch experiments revealed that sorption to activated sludge was the leading removal process, eliminating up to 90% of sertraline present in the batches. Biodegradation was however the secondary removal process, influenced by the presence of alternative easily biodegradable carbon sources. We postulated chemical structures of ten detected biotransformation products. Among these, we propose the previously recognized metabolite norsertraline, sertraline ketone and hydroxy-sertraline. All the remaining biotransformation products are herein reported for the first time.
   The removal efficiency of approximately 94% was determined after the treatment in the flow-through bioreactors. To support our findings, we sampled influents and effluents from two wastewater treatment plants and untreated wastewater from a psychiatric hospital. Removal efficiencies of 81% and 77% were determined, and along with the parent compound sertraline, the presence of eight transformation products was confirmed in the actual wastewaters.

AB Discharging drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) to sewers could be an efficient waste management strategy with the potential to replace chemical dosing for pollutant control. This study for the first time investigated the fate of 28 different organic micropollutants (MPs) due to the dosing of iron-rich and aluminum-rich DWTS in a pilot rising main sewer. Nine MPs had an initial rapid removal within 1-hr (i.e., 10-80%) due to Fe-DWTS dosing. The formation of FeS particles due to Fe-DWTS dosing was responsible for the removal of dissolved sulfides (80% reduction comparing to control sewer). Further particle characterization using SEM-EDS, XRD and ATR-FTIR confirmed that FeS particles formation played an important role in the removal of MPs from wastewater. Adsorption of MPs onto the FeS particles was likely the possible mechanism for their rapid removal. In comparison to iron-rich DWTS, aluminum-rich DWTS had very limited beneficial effects in removing MPs from wastewater. The degradability of degradable MPs, including caffeine, paraxanthine, paracetamol, metformin, cyclamate, cephalexin, and MIAA were not affected by the DWTS dosing. Some non-degradable MPs, including cotinine, hydroxycotinine, tramadol, gabapentin, desvenlafaxine, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, fluconazole, sulfamethoxazole, acesulfame, saccharin and sucralose were also not impacted by the DWTS dosing. This study systematically assessed the additional benefits of discharging Fe-DWTS to the sewer network i.e., the removal of MPs from the liquid phase thereby reducing its load to the treatment plant. The results corroborate the discharge of Fe-rich DWTS in sewers as an effective and beneficial way of managing the waste by-product. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenic organohalide contaminants present in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) often remain untreated and can be discharged into the environment. Although organohalide respiring bacteria (OHRB) contribute to the elimination of anthropogenic organohalides in natural anaerobic environments, reductive dehalogenation by OHRB in mainstream WWTPs remains poorly understood. In this study, we quantified OHRB during a long-term operation of a municipal WWTP with short hydraulic and sludge retention times (3 h and 1.5-5 days, respectively). The obligate OHRB were detected at high levels (averaging 2.56 +/- 1.73 x 10(7) and 3.11 +/- 1.16 x 10(7) 16S rRNA gene copies/ml MLSS sludge in anoxic and aerobic zones, respectively) over the entire sampling period and throughout the wastewater treatment train. Microcosms derived from mainstream activated sludge contained an unidentified member of the Dehalococcoides genus that metabolically dechlorinated triclosan, used as a representative emerging organohalide antimicrobial, to diclosan, suggesting the potential of anaerobic degradation of emerging contaminants in WWTPs. To further understand the mechanisms for such antimicrobials' removal, an investigation of dechlorination of triclosan by Dehalococcoides strains was conducted. Dechlorination of environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan to diclosan was observed in Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain CG1, yielding 4.59 +/- 0.34 x 10(8) cells/mu mole Cl- removed at a rate of 0.062 mu M/day and a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Notably, both the tolerance of strain CG1 to triclosan and the rate of triclosan dechlorination increased when CG1 was cultured in the presence of both triclosan and tetrachloroethene. Taken together, our results suggest that anaerobic degradation of organohalide antimicrobials might be more prevalent in mainstream WWTPs than previously speculated, though the low growth yields that are supported by triclosan dechlorination seem to indicate that other organohalide substrates could be necessary to sustain OHRB populations in these systems.

AB Implementing advanced wastewater treatment (WWT) to eliminate organic micropollutants (OMPs) is a necessary step to protect vulnerable freshwater ecosystems and water resources. To this end, sorption of OMP by activated carbon (AC) is one viable technology among others. However, conventional AC production based on fossil precursor materials causes environmental pollution, including considerable emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study, we produced activated biochar (AB) from wood and woody residues by physical activation and evaluated their capability to eliminate OMPs in treated wastewater. Activated biochar produced under optimized conditions sorbed 15 model OMPs, of which most were dissociated at circumneutral pH, to the same or higher extent than commercial AC used as a reference. While wood quality played a minor role, the dosage of the activation agent was themain parameter controlling the capacity of ABs to eliminate OMP. Our results highlight the possibility for local production of AB from local wood or woody residues as a strategy to improveWWT avoiding negative side effects of conventional AC production.

AB A terephthalic acid functionalized g-C3N4 (TACN) was newly developed and utilized in the development of visible-light-driven magnetically recyclable TACN/TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2 (TTFS) Z-scheme heterojunction nanophotocatalyst. The characterization was performed by BET surface area analyzer, TEM, UV-vis DRS, VSM, XRD, and XPS. To ensure its practical applicability, the experiments were also performed for real sewage effluent spiked with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in which degradation of 97 % of the 2 mg L-1 of ibuprofen in 120 min, 94 % of the 2 mg L-1 of benzophenone-3 in 150 min, and 94 % of the 2 mg L-1 of carbamazepine in 240 min was achieved upon 330W m(-2) of integrated visible light irradiance. The recycling of the TTFS nanophotocatalyst was achieved without adopting calcination or heating within a short contact time (5 h), maintaining a photocatalytic efficiency of over 83% after 5 cycles, which proves its potential for real practical applications.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern. Recent research has suggested that interactions between pathogens and antibiotic residues in various environmental matrices promote the development and spread of AMR in the environment. The levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment have been analysed globally. Recently, Predicted No Effect Environmental Concentration (PNEC) values for many antibiotics have been suggested, based on their estimated minimal selective concentrations for selected bacterial species. The PNEC values can serve as a guide on the maximum levels of antibiotic residues in an environmental matrix, below which resistance is unlikely to develop. Aim: We aimed to determine which of the antibiotics, considered as ?priority antibiotics? by the World Health Organisation (WHO), most frequently exceeded their PNEC values in the global aquatic environment. Methods: We obtained data from the German Environment Agency pharmaceutical database on means, medians or single values of 12 antibiotic types in five different environmental matrices [municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, industrial wastewater effluent, hospital wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water] across 47 countries. We compared the mean levels of the 12 antibiotics in each environmental matrix to their suggested PNEC values to determine which antibiotic types exceeded PNEC and were most likely to select for resistance. We also determined which environmental matrices and countries had the highest burden of antibiotic residues. Results: Our study revealed that 7.9% of all analyses of antibiotic residues performed in the environmental matrices globally exceeded PNEC. Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin had the greatest proportion ( 30%) of residues exceeding PNEC. Hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater had the highest burden of antibiotic residues exceeding PNEC. No antibiotics exceeded PNEC in drinking water. Conclusion: While most environmental monitoring studies have focused on municipal wastewater treatment plants, the limited number of studies on hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater revealed that a large number of antibiotic residues coming from these sources exceeded their PNEC values. Our study highlights the importance of implementing on -site treatment systems that aim to destroy antibiotics prior to discharging wastewater to surface waters. Attention needs to be focused on the role that environmental matrices, particularly our wastewater sites, play in promoting antibiotic resistance. Novel treatment technologies need to be developed and implemented to increase the removal efficiencies of treatment plants and from antibiotic manufacturing, and decrease the discharge of antibiotic residues into aquatic environments.

AB Currently, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) attempt to achieve the shifting from general pollution parameters control to reduction of organic micropollutants discharge. However, they have not been able to satisfy the increasing ecological safety needs. In this study, the removal of micropollutants was investigated, and the ecological safety was assessed for a local WWTP. Although the total concentration of 31 micropollutants detected was reduced by 83% using the traditional biological treatment processes, the results did not reflect chemicals that had poor removal efficiencies and low concentrations. Of the five categories of micropollutants, herbicides, insecticides, and bactericides were difficult to remove, pharmaceuticals and UV filters were effectively eliminated. The specific photosynthesis inhibition effect and non-specific bioluminescence inhibition effect from wastewater were detected and evaluated using hazardous concentration where 5% of aquatic organisms are affected. The photosynthesis inhibition effect from wastewater in the WWTP was negligible, even the untreated raw wastewater. However, the bioluminescence inhibition effect from wastewater which was defined as the priority biological effect, posed potential ecological risk. To decrease non-specific biological effects, especially of macromolecular dissolved organic matter, overall pollutant reduction strategy is necessary. Meanwhile, the ozonation process was used to further decrease the bioluminescence inhibition effects from the secondary effluent; >= 0.34 g O-3/g DOC of ozone dose was recommended for micropollutants elimination control and ecological safety.

AB The degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by a synthesized ZnO catalyst and under UVA irradiation was examined. ZnO nanostructures were developed by a facile hydrothermal-assisted method. The effect of ZnO heating time and synthesis reaction, pH, catalyst loading, and SMX initial concentration on process efficiency was studied. Water matrices, such as humic acid (HA) solution and surface water (SW), were also used to resemble real environmental water samples. It was observed that when ZnO is synthesized at pH 7.5, nanorods grow on its surface, while nanoplatelets are formed when synthesis takes place at pH 12.5. SMX removal reached 84% after 60 min of treatment in the presence of 200 mg/L ZnO catalyst (8 h-heated at pH 7.5; C-0 = 10 mg/L). The pseudo-first-order kinetic constants of SMX photodegradation were calculated at 0.039, 0.030 and 0.016 min(-1) for 5, 10, and 20 mg/L SMX, respectively. This decreased efficiency was attributed to the excessive coverage of catalyst surface by SMX molecules, evidenced by SEM micrographs produced after treatment. SMX degradation in SW (12.5%) was considerably lower than in UPW (47.4%) due to the presence of natural organic matter in the first. Interestingly, SMX removal was greatly enhanced in HA matrix (99%) and this can be attributed to the ability of HA to sensitize colloidal ZnO. In all cases, morphological changes of ZnO nanostructures were observed after photocatalytic treatment. It was confirmed that SMX degradation takes place through HO center dot by adding HO center dot quenchers, such as tert-butyl alcohol and methanol, in the reactant mixture.

AB Bisphenol (BP) analogues are widely used as industrial materials and various product additives and are inevitably released into environment. However, knowledge on the sources of different BPs, especially those from urban rainfall runoff to the receiving rivers is very limited. In this study, 15 BPs were determined in surface water, sediments, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and rainfall runoff samples in the Pearl River region, South China. Eleven BPs were detected in surface water and sediments of the Pearl Rivers. BPA was the dominant compound up to 2080 ng/L in surface and 1970 ng/g in sediments, followed by BPF, BPS, BPTMC and BPAF. In WWTPs, 10, 9 and 8 BPs were detected in influents, effluents and excess sludges, respectively, with total BPs (Sigma BPs) concentrations in effluents still at thousands ng/L, suggesting incompletely removal of BPs. Five BPs were detected in urban rainfall runoff samples, with the Sigma BPs concentrations up to 7740 ng/L. Mass loads of Sigma BPs from the rainfall runoff (5800 kg/y) were almost equivalent to the source from WWTPs (7370 kg/y) in the region, implying that the urban rainfall runoff was a potential source for BPs into the receiving river. The calculated estrogenic activity contributed by BPs showed low to median risks in sources and receiving rivers. But BPs are always as mixtures with other potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which probably pose high estrogenic activity risks. Hence, effective measures should be taken to decrease the input of EDCs from sources to receiving rivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The existence of micropollutants (MPs) including pathogens in waters poses great risks to ecological safety and human health. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have attracted considerable attention in water treatment for both disinfection and removal of emerging MPs. Here, we investigated the SO4 center dot--mediated kinetic and mechanistic aspects of simultaneous inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a typical MP with high occurrence in wastewater. In the absence of CBZ, (73.8 +/- 2.3) % E. faecalis were inactivated after 12 min of treatment, while in the presence of CBZ, (68 +/- 1.6) % of E. faecalis were inactivated, exhibiting similar inactivation efficiency with or without MP. The second. order rate constant (k) of E. faecalis reacting with SO4 center dot- was determined to be (5.42 +/- 0.64) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). In addition, two distinct types of disinfection models, one based on the quenching ratio (Q model) and the other on steady-state concentration of SO4 center dot- (R model), were developed to predict the inactivation kinetics of E. faecalis. Both models exhibited good performance for describing the disinfection of E. faecalis with RMSE of 0.065 and 0.048, respectively. Our kinetic experimental and modelling results on bacterial disinfection and degradation of CBZ were projected to offer valuable insight into future developments for typical wastewater scenarios where microorganisms and MPs coexist.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), an emerging class of highly recalcitrant water contaminants, have raised considerable concerns in environment community. Graphitic carbon nitride (CN) has shown a great potential towards the photodegradation of water contaminants under visible light irradiation. However, the conventional bulk CN (BCN) presents the amorphous structure, resulting in an inefficient yield of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) for the complete mineralization of PPCPs. This study provides fundamental insights into significantly enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation via improving the crystallinity of the pristine CN materials. Experimental measurements and accompanying density functional theory (DFT) computational analysis suggest that the crystalline carbon nitride (CCN) exhibited an enhanced adsorption ability towards the dissolved O-2. Upon the light irradiation, the adsorbed O-2 molecules readily undergo a direct two-electron reduction reaction on the CCN surface, instead of the conventional two successive single-electron reduction reactions on the BCN surface, to produce H2O2 subsequently converting into center dot OH radicals. Along with the improved charge separation efficiency and electron transfer ability, CCN-based materials show superior photocatalytic activity towards PPCPs-type pollutants, compared with the pristine BCN catalysts. Importantly, the catalyst show excellent photodegradation activities under natural sunlight irradiation, at low PPCPs concentration (20 mu g/L), in the mixed PPCPs solution or in the real wastewater/water samples, indicating the potential of CCN to enable practical ex situ destructive treatment of PPCPs-contaminated groundwater.

AB Aerated lagoons, typically used by small communities, often provide limited removal of wastewater nutrients. Given increasingly stringent wastewater standards, it is imperative that effective, but economical and easy-to-operate, treatment technologies be developed. The Submerged Attached Growth Reactor (SAGR (R)) is a treatment process developed to perform nitrification near freezing temperatures. Previous tests on full-scale installations have shown that SAGR could consistently remove ammonia to below current Canadian standards and provide additional total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand removal. In this study, we evaluated removal of polar chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides, at SAGR installations in two Manitoba First Nations communities (MCN and LPFN) under cold winter conditions. Both showed some removal of diclofenac, naproxen, clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim, likely by biotransformation. Average naproxen removal was 21% (2.53 x 10(3) ng L-1) in MCN and 64% (1.58 x 10(3) ng L-1) in LPFN. Atenolol was well-removed by SAGR, by 80% on average (range of 64%-94%). Clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim removal was similar within and between systems, ranging from 54% to 76% (30.8-3.07 x 10(2) ng L-1 removed). Carbamazepine was detected in nearly all samples, but was not well-removed, consistent with other treatment studies. Overall, results showed that SAGR technology could moderately remove CECs, while providing the designed treatment performance for other parameters. This work will help to improve our understanding of wastewater treatment in small and/or remote communities with limited infrastructure and challenging cold-weather conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rhizobacterial dynamics, relating to pollutant degradation mechanisms, over the course of plant lifespan have rarely been reported when using phytoremediation technologies for pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewater treatment. This study investigated the rhizobacterial dynamics of Typha angustifolia in constructed wetlands to treat ibuprofen (IBP)-polluted wastewater throughout plant development from seedling, vegetative, bolting, mature, to senescent stages. It was found that conventional pollutant and IBP removals increased with plant development, reaching to the best performance at bolting or mature stage (removal efficiencies: 92% organics, 52% ammonia, 60% phosphorus and 76% IBP). In the IBP-stressed wetlands, the rhizobacterial diversity during plant development was adversely affected by IBP accompanied with a reduced evenness. The bacterial communities changed dynamically at different developmental stages and showed significant differences compared to the control wetlands (free of IBP). The dominant bacteria colonized in the rhizosphere was the phylum Actinobacteria, having a final relative abundance of 0.79 and containing a large amount of genus norank_o_ PeM15. Positive interactions were evident among the rhizobacteria in IBP-stressed wetlands and the predicted functions of 16S rRNA genes revealed the potential co-metabolism and metabolism of IBP. The co-metabolism of IBP might be related to root exudates such as amino acid, lipid, fatty acid and organic acid. In addition, positive correlations between the organic compounds of interstitial water (bulk environment) and the rhizobacterial communities were observed in IBP-stressed wetlands, which suggests that the influence of IBP on bulk microbiome might be able to modulate rhizosphere microbiome to achieve the degradation of IBP via co-metabolism or metabolism.

AB Microorganisms with high tetracycline (TC) degradation efficiencies are required for biological processes for TC-containing wastewater treatment. With multiple enrichment cultures, a TC-degrading strain TR5 was isolated from chicken manure mixture in a large broiler farm, which was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical properties. Strain TR5 could degrade TC quickly (similar to 90% within 36 h) with the initial TC concentration of 200 mg/L under optimized conditions via single-factor experiment coupled with RSM. Strain TR5 could detoxify TC and generate much less toxic products as long as cultured more than one day. Three TC-degrading pathways were proposed based on 8 possible products. A transformant containing a plasmid from TR5 acquired TC-degrading ability, indicating that TC-degrading genes were located on this plasmid. Complete sequencing of pYK5 showed that isomerase-, oxidoreductase-, and transferases-encoding genes were found and were inferred to be involved in TC degradation. TR5 may not degrade TC completely and it can utilize some carboncontaining compounds derived from TC via the effect of formylglutathione hydrolase-encoding gene. Our findings showed that strain TR5 could be a promising agent for wastewater treatment, and genes involved in TC degradation are worthy of further investigations for enzyme preparations development.

AB Cyanide-containing organic wastewater is discharged in large quantities by coking, electroplating and pharmaceutical industries, which seriously endangers environmental safety and human health. In this paper, Electrochemical Oxidation-Persulfate (EO-PS) Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) was firstly used to treat high concentration cyanide-containing organic wastewater obtained from a chemical enterprise. The potential application of this process in the treatment of high concentration cyanide-containing organic wastewater was explored for the first time, and the effects of current density, initial pH, temperature and initial concentration on chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) and total cyanide (CN-) removal in wastewater were systematically investigated. The results shown that the EO-PS process had an excellent removal effect on organics and cyanide in high concentration cyanidecontaining organic wastewater which contained 11,290 mg L-1 COD, 4456 mg L-1 TOC and 1280.15 mg L-1 CN-. The COD, TOC and CN- removal at optimized operating parameters for 24 h were 95.8%, 87.8% and 98.4%, respectively. The corresponding electrical energy per order was only 41.6 kWh m(-3) order(-1). In addition, the pollutants removal can be accelerated under conditions of high current density, acidic solution, appropriate temperature and low pollutant concentration, among which low current density, low pH, appropriate temperature and low pollutant concentration can effectively diminish energy consumption. Cyanide, COD and TOC degradation in all reaction conditions followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater are a lurking threat to environment and human health security for any given moment of time owing to its complexity and high vulnerability to cause disease outbreak. Though there are a number of treatment process for wastewater., there is a high need for employing cost-efficient and sustainable method of treatment. Hence a pilot scale horizontal surface flow Constructed Wetland (HSFCW) coupled with Tubesettler was installed at New Delhi, India (February to may 2019). This study reports comparative pollutants removal from hospital wastewater using Constructed Wetlands and associated tubesettler dosed with Hospital wastewater. A pilot scale CW system was used for treating 10m(3)/day of hospital wastewater. The system was tested for 3 Months to evaluate its performance for removing pollutants from the wastewater. The HSFCW coupled with tubesettler achieved over all removal efficiency of 94% (COD), MLSS (97%), TSS (98%), BOD5 (96%), Phosphate (79%). However, process of nitrification was not observed and accumulation of Nitrate up to 197% was observed. The study concluded that it may be due to the presence of pharmaceuticals and other elements present in hospital wastewater. This conclusion was based on the fact that Alkalinity increased by 52% in effluent and pH value also exhibited an average increase of 12%. Further research studies are required to investigate effect of pharmaceutical originating from hospital on treatment efficiency, to incorporate anaerobic setup to complete denitrification-nitrification process and also to determine efficiency of thermophilic, mesophilic, and psychmphilic bacteria with respect to climate and temperature.

AB This study was carried out to increase the treatment efficiency through the improvement of the conventional biological process, and to propose the optimal treatment direction. The optimal treatment conditions were derived based on the results of the spike damage tests in each single process. The removal efficiency of micropharmaceuticals was further increased when an ozone treatment process was added to the biological process compared to the single process. The soil and activated carbon adsorption process was introduced in the post-treatment to remove the micropharmaceutical residues, and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceduticals in the final effluent was more than 85% in spike damage experiment. In particular, the continuous process of biological treatment-ozone-adsorption could ensure the stable treatment of micropharmaceuticals, which had not been efficiently removed in the single process, as it showed more than 80% removal efficiency. Therefore, it is expected that the addition of the ozone oxidation and activated carbon adsorption process to the existing sewage treatment facilities can contribute to the efficient removal of micropharmaceuticals.

AB Antibiotic pollution is one of the factors contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment. Advanced oxidation and irradiation processes have been introduced to eliminate antibiotics from water and wastewater. However, few studies have reported the toxic effects of residual antibiotics and their byproducts induced by a treatment system. In this study, we compared the efficacies of chemical (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and biological (antimicrobial susceptibility test) assays for measuring the concentrations of residual antibiotics after gamma irradiation for degrading amoxicillin, cephradine, lincomycin, and tetracycline. The concentrations of residual antibiotics estimated using the two assay methods were almost identical, except cephradine. In the case of cephradine, inhibited bacterial growth was observed that was equivalent to twice the concentration measured by HPLC in the samples subjected to gamma irradiation. The observed inhibition of bacterial growth suggested the generation of potentially toxic intermediates following antibiotic degradation. These results indicate that biological and chemical assays should be used in concert for monitoring antibiotic contamination and the toxic derivatives of antibiotic degradation. The results demonstrate that these four antibiotics can be decomposed by 2.0 kGy gamma-irradiation without toxic effects of their byproducts.

AB According to the World Health Organization, >360 million people worldwide suffer from mental diseases such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder, for which psychotropic drugs are frequently prescribed. Despite being highly metabolized in the human organism, non-metabolized portions of these drugs are excreted, subsequently reaching wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where they may be incompletely removed during treatment, leading to the contamination of surface waters. In this work, ten psychotropic drugs widely consumed in Brazil (alprazolam, amitriptyline, bupropion, carbamazepine, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluoxetine, nortriptyline, sertraline, and trazadone) were monitored at five WWTPs located in the metropolitan region of Campinas (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). The drugs were determined in the influents, at different stages of the treatments, and in the effluents. Surface waters from the Atibaia River and the Anhumas Creek were also monitored. Quantitation of the pharmaceuticalswas carried out by online solid-phase extraction coupledwith ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated and presented a limit of quantitation of 50 ng L-1 for all the drugs assessed. Six of the substances monitored were quantified in the samples collected from the different treatment processes employed at theWWTPs. These technologies were unable to act as barriers for these psychotropics drugs. The concentrations ranged from 50 to 3000 ng L-1 in the WWTP effluents, while the main contaminants were found in surface waters at concentrations from 25 to 3530 ng L-1.

AB The bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) technology has proven to be an effective and energy-saving method for treating wastewaters containing a single pharmaceutical in the lab-scale. However, the continuous degradation of pharmaceuticals in a scaled-up BEF has never been reported. In this study, a 20-L dual-chamber BEF reactor was designed and tested for treating six model pharmaceuticals. The effect of key operational factors including applied voltage, cathode Fe2+ dosage, initial pharmaceuticals concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT), were assessed. By implementing 0.1 V voltage, 0.3 mM Fe2+ and HRT of 26 h, the six selected pharmaceuticals (500 mu g L-1 for each) were removed completely. Moreover, transformation products during clofibric acid degradation, such as 4-chlororesorcinol, were detected and the relevant transformation pathwaywas proposed. Additionally, it successfully removed these pharmaceuticals in the real wastewater matrix. This paper contributes to scaling-up the BEF process for continuous and effective treating pharmaceuticals-contaminated wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in domestic wastewater has caused great concern. In this study, the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals (Roxithromycin, ROX; Sulfamethoxazole, SMZ) in aerobic granular sludge (AGS) reactors was investigated under condition of different C/N (carbon to nitrogen) ratios. Results showed that higher removal efficiencies of ROX and SMZ (95.2 % and 92.9 %) were achieved in the AGS reactor fed with low C/N influent. Batch experiments further revealed that the removal of ROX was influenced by the adsorption ability of the AGS while SMZ removal was mainly enhanced by biodegradation process. Analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed that the humic acid-like substances were enriched under low C/N condition, which was in accordance with dynamic change of microbial community. The microbes, like Thauera spp. and Xanthomonadaceae, were highly enriched in the reactor with high nitrogen loading rate and functioned as refractory organics degrader. Overall, the AGS process could achieve enhanced pharmaceuticals removal performance by the regulation of microbial community under low C/N influent, which provides insights into a feasible solution for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and trace organic pollutants in AGS reactor.

AB In Mediterranean countries, reuse of reclaimed water is essential for crop irrigation. The occurrence of pesticides in agro-wastewater may represent a risk for human health and environment owing to their release in soil and translocation to plants. The novelty of this work relies on the reuse of reclaimed agro-wastewater polluted with thirteen pesticides for lettuce irrigation. Removing of pesticide residues in agro-wastewater was carried out using natural sunlight and TiO2/Na2S2O8 in a pilot facility located in Murcia (SE of Spain). The studied pesticides were azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpropham, flutolanil, flutriafol, isoxaben, methoxyfenozide, myclobutanil, napropamide, prochloraz, propamocarb, propyzamide and triadimenol, which are commonly used in southeast Spain to treat lettuces grown. Different heterogeneous and homogeneous processes were studied and compared. Previously, the optimization of the process for the selection of the best catalytic system was performed at lab-scale. TiO2 + S2O82-- was selected due to the greater effectiveness, achieving almost complete disappearance after about 400 kJ m(-2) of cumulative UVA exposure. No significant differences were observed in quality parameters of lettuce grown using treated and non-treated agro-wastewater.

AB On considering the critical issues in attaining stringent water quality standards and not creating any environmental impacts, we focused for the first time the economically feasible, emerging technology known as Selfassembly flocculating (Saf process). In which, the study investigated the applicability of bioflocculant (a biopolymer-self-assembly in nature) act as a surrogates on relying the removal of broad spectrum of substances under optimized conditions (Dosage: 90 mg/L; pH: 7; CaCl2). On using different techniques, the results have proved in removing the organic matter such as pharmaceuticals (Gentamycin, Cholecalciferol, Fluvoxamine, 3-OH Desogestrel, and Pheniramine), endocrine disturbing compounds [Phthalic acid, Benzene, 1, 2, 4 -Trime-thoxy 5 (1 Propenyl), Benzene, 1, 2 Dimethoxy 4 (2 Propeny1)-, 1, 2-Benzenedicarboxylic Acid, 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol], fluorescent components (Polysaccharide like material), and others. The toxicological assessment of self-assembly bioflocculant implemented on zebra fish were statistically correlated [r = 0.95, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P-1 WW; r = 0.91, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P2WW] and [r = 0.7 5, p < 0.05 for P1WT; r = 0.095, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P2WT]. This integrated approach supplemented further information of zeta potential (-16 mV in P1WW and -14.6 mV in P2WW decreased to -1.05 mV and -1.56 mV) with particle size distribution to explain via Saf process. In this research, the new insight has established non-toxic, self-assembly, biodegradable, bioflocculant for effective bioremediation.

AB In this study, N-Cu co-doped TiO2 was decorated on the single-walled carbon nano-tube (marked as N-Cu co-doped TiO2@CNTs) via two-step sol-gel/hydrothermal synthesis method for the first time as a novel photocatalyst in coupling with ultrasound (US) waves. The catalyst properties were characterized via BET, Raman, FESEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, EIS, PL, TGA, UV-Vis DRS, EDX and EDS dot mapping. These techniques confirmed the successful doping of both N and Cu elements on the CNTs impregnated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The investigation of effective operational parameters demonstrated that the total removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMXZ) could be achieved under pH of 6.0, catalyst dosage of 0.8 g/L, light intensity of 200 W, US power of 200 W, and initial SMXZ concentration of 60 mg/L within 60 min. SMXZ degradation kinetics over sono-photocatalytic process were in a good agreement with pseudo-first-order model. Quenching experiments illustrated that HO center dot and O2(center dot-) active species were more effective species for SMXZ degradation. The synthesized sono-photocatalyst could be recycled after six consecutive cycles of SMXZ degradation with an insignificant decrease in perfor- mance. A tentative mechanism and pathway for SMXZ were formulated. Pharmaceutical wastewater was treated through the optimum degradation conditions which showed that the sono-photocatalytic degradation eliminated 93% of COD and 89% of TOC within 180 min.

AB Considering the low recyclability of powder adsorbents, an efficient method is needed to fabricate a novel threedimensional (3D) adsorbents. Take advantage of the 3D iron network and admirable adsorption performance of the Fe-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF), a solvothermal method was used to in-situ growing a series of Fe-based MOFs (MIL-53(Fe) MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe)) onto the iron network (MIL stands for Materials of Institute Lavoisier). The successful growing of MILs(Fe) on the iron network was verified by optical microscopy, SEM, XRD, FT-IR and XPS characterizations. As expected, the 3D MILs(Fe) (Fe/MILs) inherited the high adsorption capacity of powdery MILs(Fe), while excellent recycling performance was obtained. Among them, Fe/MIL-100(Fe) exhibited the highest performance towards tetracycline (TC), more than 95% of TC could be removed at fifth adsorption cycle. Mechanism indicated that the pi-pi and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions between Fe/MIL-100(Fe) and TC molecules played an essential role in the adsorption process. Besides, the Fe/MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent was stable in water with negligible iron leaching in solution. It is worth noting that Fe/MIL-100(Fe) kept a high adsorption performance towards TC in a wide pH range of 2-10 and suffered minor influence from the anion and humic acid in solution. Even in actual aqueous solution (tap water, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater), high performance was presented by the Fe/MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent. This work provided a new method to synthesis 3D MILs(Fe) adsorbents for wastewater remediation.

AB In this work, we have investigated the stability of pindolol (PIN), a non-selective beta(1)-blocker detected in the river and wastewater of hospitals, in water solution under solar irradiation. Further, detailed insights into the stability of PIN were obtained by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The kinetics of PIN photocatalytic degradation and mineralization has been studied using four commercial photocatalysts ZnO and TiO2 (P25, Hombikat, and Wackherr). It was found that the major role in degradation of PIN play the reactive hydroxyl radicals. The structures of degradation intermediates were suggested by LC-ESI-MS/MS and DFT calculations. Also, DFT calculations were used to refine molecular structures of intermediates and obtain their geometries. Toxicity of PIN and its mixtures formed during photocatalytic degradation were investigated using mammalian cell lines (H-4-II E, HT-29, and MRC-5). The H-4-II E cell line was the most sensitive to PIN and its photodegradation mixtures. The computational results were combined with the experimental data on the amounts of degradation intermediates for determination of the intermediates that were principally responsible for the toxicity. Intermediate with two hydroxyl groups, positioned on indole ring in meta and para positions, was proposed as the one with the highest contribution to toxicity.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are emerging contaminants that have been widely detected in water bodies in the last decades, with ecological effects toward aquatic biota that have not been fully elucidated. Most studies concerning their toxicity to microalgae have only considered short-term individual PhAC exposure, rather than combined exposure to several compounds for longer time periods. In this study, we investigated the effects of albendazole (ABZ) (anthelmintic) and carbamazepine (antiepileptic), alone and in combination with caffeine, on the growth and production of chlorophyll-a of the microalgaeRaphidocelis subcapitata, during 16 days of exposure. ABZ alone had a more significant effect than carbamazepine alone on the growth rate and maximum cell density of the microalgae (p < .05; analysis of variance). These results were probably related to the effect of ABZ in inhibiting enzyme complexes and cell membrane proteins related to adenosine triphosphate synthesis, which is important for cell growth. The presence of caffeine lowered the toxicities of ABZ and carbamazepine to the microalgae, probably due to its antioxidant properties, positively affecting chlorophyll-a production, growth rate, and maximum cell density. Thus, caffeine had an antagonistic interaction with the studied PhACs. The results reinforce the importance of ecotoxicological assays that compare individual and combined PhAC exposure conditions. Our findings highlighted that caffeine can be a relevant factor influencing such assays, considering its widespread occurrence in impacted water bodies.

AB A comprehensive monitoring of a broad set of antibiotics in the final effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of 7 European countries (Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Germany, Finland, and Norway) was carried out in two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). This is the first study of this kind performed at an international level. Within the 53 antibiotics monitored 17 were detected at least once in the final effluent of the WWTPs, i.e.: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, cefalexin, clindamycin, metronidazole, ampicillin, and tetracycline. The countries exhibiting the highest effluent average concentrations of antibiotics were Ireland and the southern countries Portugal and Spain, whereas the northern countries (Norway, Finland and Germany) and Cyprus exhibited lower total concentration. The antibiotic occurrence data in the final effluents were used for the assessment of their impact on the aquatic environment. Both, environmental predicted no effect concentration (PNEC-ENVs) and the PNECs based on minimal inhibitory concentrations (PNEC-MICs) were considered for the evaluation of the impact on microbial communities in aquatic systems and on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, respectively. Based on this analysis, three compounds, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and cefalexin are proposed as markers of antibiotic pollution, as they could occasionally pose a risk to the environment. Integrated studies like this are crucial to map the impact of antibiotic pollution and to provide the basis for designing water quality and environmental risk in regular water monitoring programs.

AB In this study, a single-chamber Mg-air fuel cell (MAFC) is used to remove phosphorous (P) and to simultaneously recover struvite and electricity from synthetic hydrolyzed urine. The Mg 2+ generated from the anodic oxidation of Mg alloy provides a source of Mg for struvite precipitation. Meanwhile, the cathodic oxygen reduction re- action through a four-electron pathway produces OH- to maintain suitable pH for struvite precipitation and the avoid the addition of exogenous chemical reagents. The P concentration in the e ffluent is lower than 0.5 mg L-1 after a 15-min treatment and meets the sewage grade A discharge standard in China. The P removal e fficiency of urine reaches 99.48% with an e ffluent P concentration of 0.28 mg L-1 after a 25-min operation of MAFC, and the removed P can be completely recovered as high-purity struvite precipitation. The rate constant for P removal is calculated to be 0.46 min(-1) by fitting a first-order kinetic model. The recovered precipitation is identi fied as struvite, and the chemical analysis reveals a struvite purity of 98.26%. The maximum power density of MAFC with P-containing urine as electrolyte reaches 552.32 mW m(-3) , which is 47.39% higher than that of MAFC with P-free electrolyte. The struvite precipitation reaction can promote the electricity production of MAFC. This work provides not only a novel method for purifying and recovering resources from urine but also a new perspective for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MAFC in the future.

AB This study aimed to select a high-performance cation-exchange resin (CER) and estimate its uptake of positively ionized tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), i.e., amitriptyline (AMI), imipramine (IMI), clomipramine (CLO), and desipramine (DES), which are frequently used, and detected in wastewater treatment systems. For the selection of the resin, the one-point check test of AMI in distilled water was examined using several CERs. As a result, the strong-acid polystyrene CER, Dowex 50WX4-200, was selected on the basis of its outstanding uptake of AMI. The maximum adsorption capacities of Dowex 50WX4-200 for removal of the TCAs ranged from 2.53 +/- 0.20 mmol/g to 3.76 +/- 0.12 mmol/g, which are significantly higher when compared with those of previously reported adsorbents. This is likely because the combination of electrostatic and pi-pi interactions between the TCAs and Dowex 50WX4-200 may lead to high uptakes of the TCAs. Additionally, the removal efficiency of DES as a representative of the TCAs was tested in actual wastewater system containing activated sludge and miscellaneous cations. Consequently, the removal efficiencies of the DES in distilled water, aerobic wastewater, and filtered wastewater were 95.68%, 77.99%, and 56.66%, respectively. It is interesting to note that the activated sludge could also contribute to adsorption of the DES, leading to increased removability, while the cations present in the wastewater acted as competing ions, decreasing the removal efficiency.

AB A large number of antibiotic residues are discharged into aquatic environments due to the widespread use of antibiotics in daily life. After a series of processes in the water, the residues will potentially have adverse impacts on water ecosystem and human health. Therefore, it is critical for mediating the pollution to know how the antibiotics transport and distribute in the water. This study utilizes a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model to find out the transport and distribution of antibiotics in a highly polluted area, the Laizhou Bay in China. Furthermore, the model was used to simulate two scenarios in the Laizhou Bay, the antibiotics from sewage treatment plants and the contamination of mariculture. The simulated results show that the model as an effective tool can provide a useful basis for the management of antibiotics-related environmental issues in the Laizhou Bay.

AB The release of untreated or partially treated pharmaceutical wastewater into water bodies has become a serious concern these days as the drugs and their intermediates present affect living forms heavily. Thus, the presented study evaluates the effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin drug on the performance of a technology called microbial fuel cell (MFC) which can generate electricity during wastewater treatment. In the current work, synthetic feed containing ampicillin was fed to two MFCs at different concentrations (10 and 25 mg/L). The MFC fed with 10 mg/L (MFC10) showed 25% higher voltage than the control (MFCC), whereas the reactor fed with 25 mg/L (MFC25) of ampicillin showed 10.2% lower voltage generation than the control. In terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, MFC(10)performed better than MFC(C)followed by MFC25. MFC10 and MFC25 showed comparable ampicillin removal efficiencies of 86% and 84%, respectively. Hence, the ampicillin concentration of 10 mg/L was found to be optimum for enhancing the performance of the MFC. For a concentration close to 25 mg/L or higher, the performance of the MFC was found to be negatively affected. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Phosphate is essential for food production. However, phosphate rock, which is the main natural source, is becoming worse in quality due to the depletion of the reserves and contamination with heavy metals and radioactive elements. Marketable phosphate contains more than 13 wt% of phosphorus (P), but run-of-the-mine phosphate rock is of lower grade (8 to 11 wt% of P). In this study, calcium phosphate granules (CaP granules) produced during anaerobic treatment of vacuum collected black water (feces and urine, BW) were assessed for their potential as a substitute for phosphate rock. The quality assessment was based on elemental composition (macro nutrients and heavy metals), crystallography and morphology analyses, dissolution tests, and quantification of micropollutants. CaP granules contained 10 wt% of P, from which 35% was dissolved within 5 min in citric acid and 85% in H2SO4. The incineration of the CaP granules increased the P content to 15 wt%, by eliminating the remaining organics (29%), pathogens, and organic micropollutants. Heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, As, and Pb) and organic micropollutants in CaP granules were below the Dutch and European regulatory limits for direct fertilizer application. Moreover, incinerated CaP granules complied with the requirements for use in the fertilizer industry. At the current process conditions, CaP granules produced from BW can potentially replace 12% of the phosphate rock used in agriculture as fertilizer.

AB In the Maldivian islands, the lack of sewage wastewater treatment and an improper landfill enhance the potential hazard of emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products. In order to analyze the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the marine biota, sponges were collected in two coral reef areas of Magoodhoo island (Faafu), one near the landfill and the other furthest from the island. Caffeine, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were detected only in the proximity of the landfill, with caffeine showing the highest concentration (28.4 ng/g d.w.), followed by fluoxetine (6.00 ng/g d.w.). Norfluoxetine was below the limit of quantification of 10 ng/g d.w. Nitro xylene, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide and galaxolide were found in both areas, with concentrations of 3.51/6.11/8.54 and< LOQ/1.14/0.62 ng/g d.w., respectively. Due to the vital role of the coral reef for the livelihood and economy of the Maldivian people, attention should be paid to this class of contaminant.

AB Fe3O4-coated pretreated biochars (Fe3O4@PBC) were prepared for the first time by a Fe(III)-ethanol solution impregnation-calcination method. When photo-Fenton catalysts were used, their effectiveness in removing metronidazole (MNZ) from aqueous media was evaluated. Fe3O4@PBC samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, vibrating sample magnetometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods. The results showed that Fe3O4 coating was successfully formed on the surface of HNO3- pretreated biochar, and Fe3O4@PBC can be separated by applying an external magnetic field. The coating of Fe3O4 did not change the pore structure and maintained a high surface area of the biochar. Fe loading significantly affected the photo-Fenton degradation and adsorption ability of MNZ. The highest MNZ removal rate and the greatest catalytic ability were found in the PBC-6.6Fe sample containing 6.6% Fe by mass. Various operating parameters, such as solution pH, H2O2 concentration, and MNZ concentration, were tested during MNZ's photo-Fenton catalytic degradation. The results indicate that the highest MNZ degradation efficiency can be derived from a moderate acidic solution, and the optimal pH is 3. Using PBC-6.6Fe, the increase of H2O2 concentration from 30 to 60mmol<bold>L</bold>-1 promotes the degradation of photo-Fenton, and both an excessive H2O2 and an increase in MNZ concentration suppressed the process. Under the conditions of 0.4g<bold>L</bold>-1 PBC-6.6Fe, 300mg<bold>L</bold>-1MNZ, 60mmol<bold>L</bold>-1H2O2, and initial pH of 3, 95.1% of MNZ was degraded. The PBC-6.6Fe had good stability, and its removal efficiency was still over 92% after five repeated uses. This study confirmed that center dot OH played a dominant role, while O2 center dot-</mml:msubsup> and h+ played a weaker role in the photo-Fenton system. The results indicated that Fe3<mml:msub>O4@PBC served as a prospective visible-light-driven catalyst similar to Fenton for the treatment of wastewater containing MNZ.

AB Biological treatment for volatile organic compound (VOC)-contaminated wastewater with conventional aeration methods causes significant stripping loss of pollutants due to its high volatility. To overcome this problem, the membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was developed. The aim of this study was to reduce acetonitrile (ACN) stripping loss during the aeration process and to evaluate MABR performance under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and ACN surface loading rates. The MABR was operated with an inlet ACN concentration of 300mg/L at four HRT conditions-4, 6, 9, and 12 h. Experimental results indicated that nearly 49% of ACN was stripped due to mechanical aeration, whereas stripping loss due to MABR was approximately 0.1%. A HRT of 6 h was found to be the optimum condition with removal efficiencies of ACN, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total nitrogen (TN) at 98%, 87%, 84%, and 69%, respectively. This MABR could achieve removal of ACN with a maximum surface loading rate and removal capacity of 3.75 and 3.63g/m2<bold>day</bold>, respectively. This study therefore established improved MABR efficiency with shorter HRT requirements.

AB The importance of stereochemistry on the behaviour and effects of chiral pharmaceutical and illicit drugs in amended agricultural soils has been over looked to date. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the enantiospecific behaviour of a chemically diverse range of chiral drugs including naproxen, ibuprofen, salbutamol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, acebutolol, atenolol, chlorpheniramine, amphetamine, fluoxetine and citalopram in soil microcosms. Considerable changes of the enantiomeric composition of ibuprofen, naproxen, atenolol, acebutolol and amphetamine were observed within 56 d. This is significant as enantiomer enrichment can favour the pharmacologically active (e.g., S(-)-atenolol) or less/non-active forms of the drug (e.g., R(-)-amphetamine). Single enantiomer microcosms showed enantiospecific degradation was responsible for enantiomer enrichment of atenolol and amphetamine. However, naproxen and ibuprofen enantiomers were subject to chiral inversion whereby one enantiomer converts to its antipode. Interestingly, chiral inversion was bidirectional and this is the first time it is reported in soil. Therefore, introduction of the less active enantiomer to soil through irrigation with reclaimed wastewater or biosolids as fertiliser can result in the formation of its active enantiomer, or vice versa. This phenomenon needs considered in risk assessment frameworks to avoid underestimating the risk posed by chiral drugs in amended soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-target screening of water samples from the Nidda river basin in central Germany was conducted with the goal to identify previously unknown chemical contaminants and their emission sources. The focus was on organic, water-borne contaminants which were not typical to municipal wastewater. Grab samples of river water from 13 locations on the Nidda and 15 of its tributaries, in sum 112 samples, were analysed with high resolution LC-QToF-MS/MS. To facilitate the identification of substances, features originating from the same compound such as adducts and isotopologues as well as in-source fragments and species with multiple charge states were registered and grouped by a componentization step utilizing both retention times and peak shapes of the features to combine them in a single component. This led to a reduction of the number of features by an average of 1235 per sample (46%). These grouped features were prioritized if these were detected only in specific tributaries or specific river sections, reducing the number of components by an average of 913 per sample (78%). In addition, grouped features were labelled as typically found in municipal wastewater by combining data from 16 wastewater treatment plants located across Germany and Switzerland and comparing this to components detected in the Nidda basin. These were removed, leading to a further reduction of components by an average of 72 per sample (30%) for an average total reduction of 2536 per sample (93%). Finally, nine compounds, with emission sources in three specific tributaries, were identified, including the textile additive Nylostab SEED (R), which was previously not known to be an environmental contaminant, as well as naturally occurring compounds such as highly toxic microcystins.

AB Emerging contaminants, especially, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are not removed well during conventional wastewater treatment and hence pose water quality risk to the environment and potentially to public health. Long-term use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation can lead to accumulation of trace contaminants in the soil, ground water and their subsequent uptake by plants and potentially can enter human food chain. This paper uses biochar as an adsorbent to remove emerging contaminants from treated wastewater by performing fixed bed experiments. Ten emerging contaminants namely, carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine, diethyltoluamide (DEET), diphenhydramine (DPH), meprobamate (MPB), primidone (PMD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), fluoxetine (FXT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and trimethoprim (TMP) were monitored during lab scale experiments. Results from the continuous flow runs showed that the breakthrough curve for compounds caffeine, CBZ, DEET and PFOA follow second order Thomas model with adsorption capacities of 396 mu g g(-1), 392 mu g g(-1), 1160 mu g g(-1) and 32 mu g g(-1) biochar, respectively. Whereas compounds such as DPH, TMP and FXT were completely removed throughout the column runs by biochar. Results for rest of the compounds were interfered by leaching of these compounds from biochar. It was observed that commercially available GAC performed much better than biochar for all the compounds considered. Even at 1% of obtained capacity, biochar amendment to soils where reclaimed water is used for irrigation can reduce the uptake of these compounds by plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and other chemicals lacking water quality standards are frequently found in surface water. While evidence is growing that these contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) - those previously unknown, unrecognized, or unregulated - can affect the behavior and reproduction of fish and wildlife, little is known about the distribution of these chemicals in rural, tribal areas. Therefore, we surveyed the presence of CECs in water, sediment, and subsistence fish species across various waterbodies, categorized as undeveloped (i.e., no human development along shorelines), developed (i.e., human development along shorelines), and wastewater effluent-impacted (i.e., contain effluence from wastewater treatment plants), within the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and 1854 Ceded Territory in northeastern Minnesota, U.S.A. Overall, in 28 sites across three years (2016-2018), 117 of the 158 compounds tested were detected in at least one form of medium (i.e., water, sediment, or fish). CECs were detected most frequently at wastewater effluent-impacted sites, with up to 83 chemicals detected in one such lake, while as many as 17 were detected in an undeveloped lake. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the number of CECs present in developed versus undeveloped lakes, a range of 3-17 CECs were detected across these locations. Twenty-two CECs were detected in developed and undeveloped sites that were not detected in wastewater effluent-impacted sites. The detection of CECs in remote, undeveloped locations, where subsistence fish are harvested, raises scientific questions about the safety and security of subsistence foods for indigenous communities. Further investigation is warranted so that science-based solutions to reduce chemical risks to aquatic life and people can be developed locally and be informative for indigenous communities elsewhere.

AB 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (DClNB) as a typical refractory pollutant, exists in multifarious industrial wastewater widely and poses a serious threat to the environment. An ion exchange membrane (IEM)-free microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) with pre-acclimated bioanode was built and evaluated systematically for treatment of DClNB containing wastewater. Results showed that compared with the non-acclimated or IEM-equipped MECs, the pre-acclimated IEM-free MECs had the best DClNB removal efficiency of 91.3% under COD and DClNB loading rates of nearly 1000 kg m(-3) d(-1) and 100 g m(-3) d(-1). Both of anode pre-acclimation and IEM removal reduced the electron transfer resistance by 71.1 and 194.5 Omega, respectively. Compared to the pre-acclimated IEM-equipped MEC, the cathode current efficiency of pre-acclimated IEM-free MEC increased by 13.7%. Analysis of live/dead cell staining indicated that a higher proportion of live cells was observed in the acclimated anode biofilm (66.1% vs. 47.3%), and the detoxification of DClNB in the pre-acclimated IEM-free MECs was significantly better (p < 0.05) than those of non-acclimated or IEM-equipped MECs. This study contributes to the performance improvement of the MEC process for treatment of toxic industrial wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the mass production and the use of antibiotic drugs, the pollution of antibiotics in the environment is aggravated. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), a kind of photocatalyst, can effectively degrade organics from the water environment. However, agglomeration and low catalytic activity sites are crucial to impeding the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2 nanoparticles. The aim of this study is to develop a MoS2 composite with a higher hydrophily and excellent photocatalytic. In this study, a series of CoS2/MoS2@Zeolite photocatalysts (CoS2/MoS2@Z) with high hydrophily, adsorption capacity and photocatalytic were successfully synthesized by the combination of ultrasonic and facile hydrothermal method to solve these problems. The structure characteristics, photocatalytic efficiency, and photocatalytic degradation mechanism were systematically investigated. It was found that zeolite significantly improved the tetracycline (TC) adsorption by CoS2/MoS2@Z-50, which was conducive to the contact between TC and photocatalyst, and could further improve photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic experiment results showed that CoS2/MoS2 @Z-50 had the best removal effect on TC (96.71%) compared with other samples. The increase of photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the high active sites, separation and transfer of electrons and holes in heterojunction. Besides, the CoS2/MoS2@Z-50 maintained a good stability after five cycles of TC photodegradation. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of CoS2/MoS2@Z-50 was proposed. Synthesis of zeolite-based CoS2/MoS2 heterojunction photocatalyst paves the way for TC photodegradation, which may become an efficient, environmentally friendly and a promising photocatalyst in the field of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed as tertiary treatments for municipal WWTP effluents. UV-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are viable technological alternatives for treating secondary WWTP effluent containing PhACs. This article examines the feasibility of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS technologies at pilot scale, assessing their energy and cost requirements. In addition, life cycle assessment (LCA) impacts associated with the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater with an effective average pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) removal of 80% has also been evaluated. Photolysis (UV) treatment alone was not capable of degrading PhACs to a sufficient extent in WWTP secondary effluent. The addition of 0.4 mmol of PDS or PMS, applying 416 mJ/cm(2 )of UV fluence, resulted in average removals of 84% and 85% for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. The electrical energy (kWh) required to degrade the mix of PhACs by one order of magnitude in 1 m(3) of contaminated water was calculated as 0.9 kWh/m(3)/order and 0.8 kWh/m(3)/order 4 for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. However, the overall cost, including operation, materials and maintenance, of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS, based on an average PhAC removal of 80%, was 0.088 (sic)/m(3) and 0.280 (sic)/m(3), respectively. From the sustainability assessment, the factors with the greatest environmental footprint for the UV/PDS process were chemical production (PDS: 52.9%, PMS: 85%) and electricity consumption (UV/PDS: 33.4%, UV/PMS: 11.2). Finally, the normalized environmental impact analysis showed that UV/PDS was associated with an environmental footprint three times lower than UV/PMS. The overall assessment revealed that UV/PDS is preferable to UV/PMS to remove PhACs in secondary effluents of municipal WWTPs having a lower economic and environmental impact. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study demonstrates the full scale application of iron dosing in a metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the upstream sewer system for multiple benefits. Two different dosing locations, i.e., the WWTP inlet works (Trial-1) and upstream sewer network (Trial-2) were tested in this study. Both dosing trials achieved multiple benefits such as sulfide control, phosphate removal and improved sludge dewaterability. During Trial-1, a sulfide reduction of >90% was achieved at high dosing rates (>19 kgFe ML-1) of ferrous chloride in the inlet works and in Trial-2 the in-sewer ferrous dosing had significant gas phase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentration reduction in the sewer network. The ferrous dosing enhanced the phosphate removal in the bioreactor up to 76% and 53 +/- 2% during Trial-1 & 2, respectively. The iron ending up in the anaerobic sludge digester reduced the biogas H2S concentration by up to 36% and 45%, respectively. The dewaterability of the digested sludge was improved, with relative increases of 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively. The presence of primary clarifier showed limited impact on the downstream availability of iron for achieving the afore-mentioned multiple benefits. The iron dosing enhanced the total chemical oxygen demand removal in the primary clarifier reaching up to 49% at the high dose rates during Trial-1 and 42 +/- 1% during Trial-2. This study demonstrated that multiple benefits could be achieved independent of the iron dosing location (i.e., at the WWTP inlet or in the network). Further, iron dosing at both locations enhances primary settling, beneficial for bioenergy recovery from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents, a detailed investigation for photocatalytic degradation of the drug furosemide (FRS) using zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on ion-exchanged natural zeolite clinoptilolite (ICLT). The ZnO/ICLT nanophotocatalysts were effectively synthesized by sonoprecipitation method which enhanced the photocatalytic performance by increasing the surface area and decreasing the particle size, compared to conventional precipitated samples. Microstructure and optical properties of prepared catalysts were characterized using XRD, XRF, FESEM, surface particle size distribution, TEM, EDX, BET, BJH, DRS and UV-visible spectroscopy techniques. XRD data confirmed the formation of ZnO. FESEM images revealed small particle size of active metals and low numbers of agglomerations which is in accordance with EDX dot mapping results. The average particle size of ZnO in ZnO (15%)/ICLT whit sonication was 20.5 nm whereas it was 34.8 nm without sonication. Moreover, the literature review indicated that ultrasound irradiation during the precipitation of samples has not been studied yet which highlight the importance of evaluating this nanophotocatalyst for wastewater treatment applications. The maximum degradation rate was observed for 15 wt% ZnO among various contents of ZnO used in synthesized nanocomposites. The influence of key operational parameters such as catalyst dosage, initial FRS concentration and pH on the photocatalytic degradation was assessed. Total organic carbon mineralization rate of FRS solution and energy consumption were also assessed to compare the ability of different processes in FRS degradation. Results showed also excellent reusability of fabricated nanophotocatalyst. Finally a plausible degradation mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of FRS was proposed.

AB Pharmaceutical and illicit drugs are emerging contaminants found in the environment globally. Many are chiral and stereochemistry plays an important role on their environmental fate and effects. However, investigations at the enantiomeric level are limited, particularly for complex particulate matrices such as sediments. This is due to further sample processing requirements and a lack of suitable analytical methods. Therefore, here a new enantioselective methodology is proposed for 15 drugs in sediment. Sample treatment by accelerated solvent extraction and solid phase extraction was critical for subsequent enantioselective separations. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, a Chiral-V enantioselective column enabled multi-residue separations of anti-depressants, beta-blockers, beta-agonist, anti-histamine and stimulants. Method trueness for all enantiomers was 86-121% and method quantitation limits were below 3 ng g(-1)dry weight. Application of the method revealed the enantiomeric composition of fluoxetine, amphetamine, propranolol, venlafaxine and citalopram in sediment for the first time. All drugs except venlafaxine were present in non-racemic form, i.e. unequal enantiomer concentrations. This is significant considering drug toxicity towards benthic organisms could be enantiospecific.

AB Acrylamide (AM) is a carcinogen and neurotoxicant, and its growing application in numerous industrial processes is contaminating the environment. In addition, the inhibitory effect of AM makes its biodegradation in the environment challenging. This study investigated AM degradation using a selectively enriched inoculum of mixed sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) isolated from a local wastewater treatment plant in Daegu, Korea. The use of SRB is promising for effectively treating several environmental pollutants, but the feasibility for biodegrading AM has not yet been reported. Experimental results showed that 73% AM (initial concentration: 7 mM) biodegradation was achieved in just 120 h, together with 42% and 96% TOC and sulfate removal, respectively. In addition, the SRB performance was not significantly affected by a threefold increase in the AM concentration; biodegradation performance dropped by only 12%. These results imply SRB immunity toward lethal contaminants and the viability of using SRB in different treatment processes. The kinetic results of batch studies enabled development of a pseudo-first-order kinetic model for AM biodegradation, TOC, and sulfate removal. In addition, although the sulfate removal efficiency was affected by a higher sulfate loading, it had little effect on AM and TOC removal. This study shows the potential of using SRB to effectively degrade recalcitrant pharmaceutical pollutants.

AB Due to many folds increase in application of human and veterinary medicines, pharmaceuticals, a new category of pollutants, have emerged in our environment. They exist as residues in rivers, sewage effluents, streams, surface, ground, and potable water. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one such drug that is used as an antipyretic and analgesic medicine. It is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and is easily available in the market because no medical prescription is necessary for its purchase and use. Paracetamol remains physiologically active even after their expiry period. Their detection in the environment in bioactive form has resulted in adverse effects on nontarget species. To determine the effect of paracetamol on aquatic photosynthetic organic (Cyanobacteria-Nostoc muscorum), present study was performed. Paracetamol (25 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 75 mg/L, 100, 125, and 150 mg/L) exposure showed toxic responses on the test organism by generating oxidative stress (MDA, H2O2,O2.-). Paracetamol caused a significant decrease in growth of cyanobacteria and showed EC(50)113.68 mg/L after the 6th day of treatment. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll, carotenoid, and phycobiliprotein) decreased with paracetamol increase. Antioxidant enzymatic (SOD, CAT, APX, GST, and GR) and osmolyte (Proline) also increased with increase in paracetamol to counteract the oxidative stress.

AB There is increasing environmental concern about the constant presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water, generally attributed to water discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that are unable to completely remove these compounds. The slight, but continuous, presence of these contaminants in reclaimed water (RW) poses a risk of chronic and sublethal toxicity, and the thyroid axis can likely be a target of many of these PPCPs. In this work, we addressed the effects of RW on the Xenopus laevis thyroid system. The AmphibianMetamorphosis Assay (AMA test) was used with modifications by exposing X. laevis tadpoles to RW samples, and to RW spiked with carbamazepine (CBZ) at 100 and 1000 higher than the average levels environmentally relevant (RW 100x and RW 1000x, respectively). Carbamazepine was selected because it is considered a marker of anthropogenic pollution and could have a potential effect on the thyroid axis. The morphological endpoints and histological alterations to the thyroid gland were evaluated. The results suggested the stimulation of the thyroid gland from exposures to the RW samples, supported by tadpoles' accelerated development and by the histological alterations observed in the thyroid gland. Developmental acceleration was also seen in the tadpoles exposed to the RW-100x and -1000x samples at comparable levels to those seen in exposures to RW samples alone. Hence CBZ did not seem to increase the effects of RW on the thyroid axis. Overall, our results suggested endocrine effects of these RW samples regardless of the CBZ concentration.

AB Water is a key solvent, fundamental to supporting life on earth. It is equally important in many industrial processes, particularly within agricultural and pharmaceutical industries, which are major drivers of the global economy. The results of water contamination by common activity in these industries is well known and EU Water Quality Directives and Associated Regulations mandate that NH4+ concentrations in effluent streams should not exceed 0.3 mg L-1, this has put immense pressure on organisations and individuals operating in these industries. As the environmental and financial costs associated with water purification begin to mount, there is a great need for novel processes and materials (particularly renewable) to transform the industry. Current solutions have evolved from combating toxic sludge to the use of membrane technology, but it is well known that the production of these membrane technologies creates a large environmental footprint. Zeolites could provide an answer: their pore size and chemistry enable efficient removal of aqueous based cations via simple ion exchange processes. Herein, we demonstrate efficient removal of NH4+ via both static and dynamic methodology for industrial application. Molecular modelling was used to determine the cation-framework interactions which will enable customisation and design of superior sorbents for NH4(+) capture in wastewater.

AB Among drugs and personal care products, antibiotics arouse interest since they are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and can lead to the development of bacterial resistance. Usually, sewage treatment does not remove most of these compounds. So, these drugs can reach water treatment plants (WTP), where disinfection with chlorine compounds is common. This work aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and preliminary toxicity of the mix of by-products forming due to the chlorination of norfloxacin. This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic indicated for the treatment of urinary infection and gonorrhea, with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). The drug was subjected to chlorination tests, on a bench scale, with several reaction times (from 5 min to 24 h). Analyses of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) were performed for the characterization of the by-products. The MS results showed five peaks attributed to the by-products' formation, of which four were identified. The antibiogram results indicated that the solution that contained the mixture of the by-products lost antibacterial activity against theE.colistrain studied. The acute toxicity tests for theArtemia salinamicrocrustacean showed that the blend of the by-products exhibited higher toxicity than pure norfloxacin.

AB Climate change and the increased demand for food amplified the global problem with water supply for irrigation. This work deals with the reclamation of municipal wastewater (MWW) for irrigation by a membrane bioreactor (MBR), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO). The emphasis was on the comparison of physico-chemical and microbiological parameters with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) guidelines. In addition, the detection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) from the Watch List (EU Decision 2015/495) were examined. Firstly, the MWW was monitored (physico-chemical and microbiological parameters, trace elements, and occurrence of CECs) for six months. Thereafter, the MWW was treated with MBR, NF, and RO. The reclaimed water satisfied the physico-chemical and microbiological quality requirements only after additional NF/RO treatment. Membrane bioreactor efficiently removed methiocarb (>99.9%), tri-allate (>99.9%), clothianidin (88.0%), and clarithromycin (71.9-74.2%), while the removal of azithromycin, acetamiprid, and oxadiazonwas around 30%. The lowand even negative removal during MBR treatment was observed for diclofenac (15%), clothianidin (-14%), imidacloprid (-18%), and diclofenac (-157%). Additional treatment of MBR effluent with NF90 and XLE membranes resulted in complete rejection of detected CECs, while NF270 membrane achieved results between 75% and 91%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB A comprehensive characterisation of four phenolic compounds in surface water and various emission sources was conducted simultaneously in a typical industrial city upstream of the Taihu Lake watershed. The overall concentrations of the target compounds ranged from 0.15 to 2.75 mu g/L in the surface water and from 0.43 to 377 mu g/L in the emission sources. Relatively high concentration levels were observed in August, during which the rainy season typically occurred in the study area, indicating seasonal emission sources. The spatial distribution revealed severe phenolic-compound contamination in the northeast part of the study area. According to the relationships between the surface water and emission sources, combined-sewer overflow and surface runoff from agricultural activities were identified as seasonal emission sources that were responsible for the increased concentration levels in wet seasons. Indirect discharge of industrial wastewater was proposed as a persistent emission source responsible for the severe contamination level in the northeast region over the entire sampling period, accounting for 16.5% of the phenolic-compound load in a demonstration river section. The findings of this study are useful for identifying the sources of phenolic compounds and controlling the contamination from the main sources in a typical industrial city. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spent brewery grains, a by-product of the brewing process, were used as precursor ofbiocharsand activated carbons to be applied to the removal of pharmaceuticals from water.Biocharswere obtained by pyrolysis of the raw materials, while activated carbons were produced by adding a previous chemical activation step. The influence of using different precursors (from distinct fermentation processes), activating agents (potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and phosphoric acid), pyrolysis temperatures, and residence times was assessed. The adsorbents were physicochemically characterized and applied to the removal of the antiepileptic carbamazepine from water. Potassium hydroxide activation produced the materials with the most promising properties and adsorptive removals, with specific surface areas up to 1120 m(2)g(-1)and maximum adsorption capacities up to 190 +/- 27 mg g(-1)in ultrapure water. The adsorption capacity suffered a reduction of < 70% in wastewater, allowing to evaluate the impact of realistic matrices on the efficiency of the materials.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal of five pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the influent and effluent from both a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Samsun, Turkey was investigated. The concentrations of five pharmaceuticals, namely carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and triclosan, were reported in different seasons from autumn 2016 to summer 2017. The targeted PPCPs were analysed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS-MS). Results of the analysis of samples from influent of the DWTP show that the average concentrations of carbamazepine, ibuprofen and triclosan in different seasons were 0.385 mu g/L, 0.038 mu g/L and 0.342 mu g/L, respectively. The maximum concentration of carbamazepine was recorded in spring (0.84 mu g/L), while in summer, triclosan and ibuprofen with values of 0.155 mu g/L and 0.735 mu g/L were highest. However, the concentrations of other selected drugs were below the limit of detection (LOD) or were not detected at all. In the effluent of the DWTP, only triclosan was detected with a concentration 0.565 mu g/L in summer. Similarly, the average concentrations of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and triclosan in the influent of the WWTP in different seasons were 78.76 mu g/L, 2.77 mu g/L, 2.31 mu g/L and 0.58 mu g/L, respectively. Concentrations in the influent of the WWTP were also not negligible, where the maximum concentration of carbamazepine was observed in autumn, ibuprofen and triclosan in winter, paracetamol in spring, and diclofenac in summer. However, in the effluent of the WWTP, only carbamazepine was detected with an average concentration of 2.30 mu g/L. Seasonal variations in the presence/detection of PPCPs in both treatment plants were observed. Statistical tools were applied to verify the obtained results.

AB Distilleries are among the most polluting industries because ethanol fermentation results in the discharge of large quantities of high-strength liquid effluents with high concentrations of organic matter and nitrogen compounds, low pH, high temperature, dark brown color, and high salinity. The most common method of managing this wastewater (distillery stillage) is to use it for soil conditioning, but this requires thickening the wastewater and may cause soil pollution due to its high nitrogen content. Therefore, treatment of distillery stillage is preferable. This review discusses individual biological and physico-chemical treatment methods and combined technologies. In addition, special attention is paid to valorization of distillery stillage, which is a valuable source of polysaccharides and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), as well as natural antioxidants, including polyphenols and other bioactive compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. New directions in improvement of valorization technologies are highlighted, including the search for new eutectic solvents for extracting these compounds. Such technologies are essential for sustainable development, which requires the use of management and valorization strategies for recovery of valuable compounds with minimal disposal of waste streams.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WTTPs) contribute to anthropogenic chemical contamination through the release of treated effluent. A constructed wetland (CW) interfaced with a WTTP could potentially purify and naturalize effluent water. This pilot study aimed to acquire baseline chemical data on the fate and distribution of phthalates in the water, sediment, and vegetation (Typhaspp.) of a fully operational horizontal subsurface flow CW adjoined to a WWTP in Oregon, USA. Sample collection followed the flow of water from entrance to exit of the CW. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the most abundant analogs in all matrices. Results indicate reduction of phthalates in water exiting the CW. Significant concentrations of DBP, DEHP, and other water-soluble phthalates were found in the shoots ofTypha, indicating plant uptake as a potentially important removal mechanism.

AB Removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is of great importance in wastewater reclamation due to their potent negative impacts on human health. Typical polyamide nanofiltration (NF) membranes are negatively charged, which compromises their rejection rate of positively charged PhACs. Herein, we propose to rationally design a novel thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) NF membrane featuring a dually charged metal organic framework (MOF) to effectively remove both positively and negatively charged PhACs. Ethylenediamine (ED) was grafted to the coordinately unsaturated metal sites inside the MIL-101(Cr). The resulting ED-MIL-101(Cr) contained both strong positively charged amine groups inside its channels and negatively charged carboxyl groups at its surface. This dually charged nature of the MOF nanoparticles enabled the ED-MIL-101(Cr)-containing TFN membrane to achieve high rejection rates ( mostly >90%) for both positively (terbutaline, atenolol, fluoxetine) and negatively charged PhACs (ketoprofen, diclofenac, bezafibrate). At the same time, the ED-MIL-101(Cr) TFN membrane had greatly improved water permeance (140% over the control membrane with MOF loading). Calculations based on density functional theory further confirmed the large energy barrier for the migration of both negatively and positively charged PhACs across the nanochannels of ED-MIL-101(Cr). This study highlights a promising potential of dually charged MOF-TFN membranes for efficient removal of trace organic contaminants in wastewater reclamation.

AB There is a consensus among scientists that domestic sewage treatment plants are the main sources of drugs entry into the aquatic environment. Therefore, this work studies the biodegradation of the drugs ranitidine (RNT), diclofenac (DCF), and simvastatin (SVT) (50 mu g L-1, each), in real domestic sewage, using a continuous anaerobic-aerobic reactor with immobilized biomass and an anaerobic batch reactor. The continuous anaerobic-aerobic reactor was operated for 6 months with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h. The initial degradation rates and the maximum oxidation capacities (MOC) of the system were estimated, achieving 90, 72, and 62% removals and 100, 93, and 72% of MOC for RNT, DCF and SVT, respectively, as well as 71% removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). RNT was degraded throughout the reactor, while DCF was degraded mainly in the two anaerobic chambers and SVT in the first anaerobic chamber. Anaerobic batches were used for the identification of biodegradation by-products (2,6-dichloro-N-(2-methylphenyl) aniline and simvastatin acid), the evaluation of the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) inhibition, and the estimation of acute and chronic ecotoxicities using the ECOSAR 1.11 software. The present study showed that, even at environmental concentrations, RNT, DCF, and SVT were capable of inhibiting the SMA. Lipophilicities dictated the behavior of those three drugs. The greater their lipophilicities, the greater the SMA inhibition and their ecotoxicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical torasemide is an important loop diuretic and was 2017 one of the ten most prescribed drugs in Germany. Despite its detection in different compartments of the urban water cycle including drinking water, no studies were so far performed to elucidate its fate in the environment and the occurrence of transformation products (TPs). Therefore, we investigated the phototransformation, microbial degradation, transformation with human liver microsomes and anodic oxidation of torasemide to obtain good coverage of environmentally relevant degradation products. Overall sixteen products were identified, covering the following reaction mechanisms: aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, including further oxidation to carboxylic acids and quinone imines, amide cleavage, N-dealkylation, N-dearylation, and sulfonamide hydrolysis to sulfonic acids. Especially the formation of quinone imines could be of concern as they are highly reactive electrophiles. Torasemide itself was observed in all investigated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples and wastewater-impacted surface waters. The maximum detected concentration was about 350 ng L-1. Only three of the sixteen transformation products were generally observed in at least one of the samples and the most frequently detected TPs were the human metabolites hydroxytorasemide (TP 364a) and carboxytorasemide (TP 378a). The complete removal of TP 364a during wastewater treatment was in agreement with the results of microbial degradation experiments. TP 364a was most likely transformed into TP 378a, which was microbially less degraded in lab experiments. Based on estimated concentrations, TP 378a could reach about 1 mu g L-1 in the investigated wastewater matrices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eliminating pharmaceutical active compounds from source-separated urine is essential for nutrient recovery and reducing the contaminant load to wastewater treatment plants. However, limited oxidation treatment processes have shown satisfactory performance due to strong scavenging effect of urine components. This study proposed a heterogeneous catalytic system by combining biochar with peroxydisulfate (PDS), which effectively removed sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its major human metabolite, N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (NSMX) in urine. The performance of biochar/PDS was investigated in both a complete-mixing reactor and a biochar-packed column. Interestingly, urine components slightly inhibited the degradation of sulfonamides in biochar suspension but significantly improved their removal in biochar-packed column. Further investigation elucidated the PDS activation process and the effects of the main urine components, which explained the different results in biochar suspension and biochar-packed column. The biochar/PDS system mainly produced center dot OH radical, singlet oxygen and surface-bound radicals (SBR), which transformed SMX to products of no apprarent antimicrobial properities. A cost-effective two-stage process was designed utilizing SBR as the major reactive species. This study may help to improve the understanding of the catalytic role of biochar and provide cost-effective treatment options for urine. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrafiltration techniques with membranes of pore sizes under 100 nm have been widely applied in drinking water, wastewater, semiconductor and pharmaceutical process water treatments for nanoparticle (NP) and pathogen removal. The most direct way to evaluate the membrane performance is to experimentally obtain the size fractional retention efficiency. However, the real-life performance of the membrane in terms of fouling (or loading) characteristics and the effects of the concentration of challenging particles and rate of flux (or filtration velocities) on the filtration efficiency during fouling have not been well understood. In this study, systematic filtration experiments for filtration efficiency at clean and loaded conditions were conducted for three different 50 nm rated membrane filters, including PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), PCTE (Polycarbonate Track-Etched) and MCE (Mixed Cellulose Ester) membranes, against 5, 10 and 20 nm Au NPs at different feed concentrations and fluxes. The results showed that the effects of feed concentration and flux are significant. This study provides important insights of retention mechanisms and efficiency for different ultrafiltration membrane structures at varied filtration velocities and fouling characteristics giving clear directions of future NP ultrafiltration research.

AB Antibiotics are specific compounds generally found in pharmaceutical wastewater. Antibiotics are composed of high molecular weight aromatic compounds with persistent characteristic and potentially inhibitor to bacterial growth in biological treatment. While on the contrary, the electrocatalytic process is suitable for highly stable pollutant treatment. Reactor was set by regulating the performance of anode and cathode into their optimum efficiencies and called as Hybrid Advanced Oxidation Process (HAOP). Cylinder cathode made of carbon cloth was put vertically inside the tube and circled around Ti/PtIr plate anode. A mixer was installed to enhance the diffusion flow of pollutants towards oxidants generated on the electrode surface. EAOP, EFRP, and EFP were the main mechanisms for pollutant removal. A 100% COD removal indicating complete degradation of pollutant into CO2 and H2O. UV-VIS spectra peaks at lambda 470, 340 and 240 nm detected in raw wastewater were no longer found in treated water. The result of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) analysis supported those findings, in which four peaks at m/z 821, m/z 759, m/z 700 and m/z 144 were not detected after treatment.

AB Antibiotic-like organic pollutants are harmful for aquatic ecosystems and seriously disrupt the ecological balance. Herein, we design a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene oxide aerogel anchored with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (3D CoFe2O4/N-rGA) via simple hydrothermal method, which can be used for peroxomonosulfate (PMS) activation toward rapidly and highly efficient degradation of tetracycline (TC). Nitrogen doped into the graphene cellular network can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of the anchored CoFe2O4 by weakening the O-O band, creating new active sites and acting as an excellent electron bridge through synergistic effects. The degradation efficiency of TC is detected to be as high as 85% only within 10 s and the degradation rate can remain above 90% after five cycles under the presence of 3D CoFe2O4/N-rGA and PMS. The catalyst also has a high efficiency for various antibiotic and pharmaceutical wastewater containing multiple antibiotics degradation.

AB Anticancer drugs have been detected in the aquatic environment, they have a potent mechanism of action and their consumption is expected to drastically increase in the future. Consequently, it is crucial to routinely monitor the occurrence of anticancer drugs and to develop effective treatment options to avoid their release into the environment.
   Prior to implementing a monitoring program, it is important to define which anticancer drugs are more prone to be found in the surface waters. In this study the consumption of anticancer drugs in the Lisbon region (Portugal), Belgium and Haryana state (India) were used to estimate the concentrations that can be expected in surface waters.
   Moreover, one important aspect is to define the major entry route of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment is it hospital or household effluents? The results disclosed in this study showed that in Belgium and Lisbon, 94 % of the total amount of anticancer drugs were delivered to outpatients, indicating that household effluents are the primary input source of these drugs and thus, upgrading the treatment in the domestic wastewater facilities should be the focus.

AB Petal-like ZnS-SnS2 heterojunctions with Z-scheme band alignment were prepared by one-pot solvothermal strategy. The optimal (1:1) ZnS-SnS2 can degrade 93.46 % of tetracycline and remove 73.9 % COD of pharmaceutical wastewater under visible-light irradiation due to the efficient production of H-center dot, O-center dot(2)-, h(+) and OH. The toxicity evaluation by ECOSAR prediction and the growth of E. coli indicates efficient toxicity reduction of tetracycline by photocatalysis and the non-toxicity of ZnS-SnS2. The attacked sites on tetracycline by reactive species were analyzed according to Fukui index, and two degradation pathways of tetracycline were inferred via the identification of intermediate products. Tetracycline degradation efficiency and the energy consumption in different water bodies were compared, and it was found that the electrical energy per order (EE/O) was the lowest in Ganjiang River. The valence band offset (Delta E-VBO) and conduction band offset (Delta E-CBO) of ZnS-SnS2 were 1.02 eV and 0.22 eV, respectively. The probable photocatalytic mechanism of ZnS/SnS2 heterojunctions with Z-scheme band alignment based on Delta E-VBO and Delta E-CBO was first presented.

AB Manure fertilization and wastewater irrigation can introduce the biologically potent synthetic progestins into agricultural soils, causing endocrine disruption in organisms of nearby surface waters. Therefore, this study investigated the sorption and desorption potential of etonogestrel, medroxyprogesterone, gestodene, norgestrel, cyproterone acetate, levonorgestrel, and dienogest in five agricultural soil-water systems. Sorption data were well-described by the linear sorption model. In most batch systems, cyproterone acetate exhibited the highest affinities for soils, followed by etonogestrel, medroxyprogesterone, levonorgestrel, gestodene, norgestrel, and dienogest. The sorption magnitudes (logK(oc) or logK(d)) were significantly correlated with the progestin hydrophobicities (R-2 = 0.72-0.86, p < 0.05). The K-d values of the progestins were also significantly correlated with organic carbon content and pore volumes of the soils (R-2 = 0.68-0.98, p < 0.05). In addition, 0.5 M urea resulted in 3-19% decreases in K-d values of the progestins. Taken together, these data indicated that hydrophobic partitioning interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, and pore filling were the sorption mechanisms for the progestins in soil-water systems. No significant desorption hysteresis was observed for the progestins, indicating that they can be readily desorbed under rainfall or irrigation events. Based on the sorption and desorption data, we estimated the dynamic transport of the progestins in conventional agricultural management systems, and predicted the concentrations of the progestins as a function of soil-sorbed concentration, water-soil ratio, and dilution factor of receiving waters. This study will improve the understanding of the risks posed by the progestins under field-scale hydrological conditions.

AB Estrogen in streams threatens aquatic animals, especially where wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent contributes to baseflow. We investigated total estrogen (E1+E2+E3) as estradiol equivalent (E2) and ethynylestradiol (EE2) concentration in Cibolo Creek (Cibolo), a groundwater-fed stream near San Antonio, TX, receiving effluent via two WWTP. We collected water samples bi-monthly from late spring to early fall 2018 in Cibolo and WWTP effluent, and used ELISA analysis and discharge measurements to determine concentrations and loads of estrogens. We measured several environmental variables to investigate what factors influenced estrogen concentrations in Cibolo downstream from WWTP inputs. Mean concentrations of WWTP effluent (E2, 41.43 +/- 15.48; EE2, 11.40 +/- 2.07 ng L-1) were higher compared with concentrations in Cibolo, both downstream (E2, 30.09 +/- 25.85; EE2, 6.33 +/- 1.92 ng L-1) and upstream (E2, 12.91 +/- 11.12; EE2, 4.5 +/- 1.38 ng L-1) of WWTP inputs. Both E2 and EE2 concentrations decreased downstream from WWTP inputs, a section of stream without large quantities of fine sediments for sorption, indicating potential dilution or chemical and biological degradation. Effluent into Cibolo via the first, and older, WWTP contributed the most estrogen load in Cibolo. Median concentrations of E2 and EE2 were 19 and 5 ng L-1, respectively, downstream of WWTP inputs, concentrations known to affect reproductive processes of aquatic biota and impair human health. Results suggest estrogens may pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems wherever WWTP effluent comprises a majority of baseflow, though further studies are required in this stream to verify biological impacts.

AB The degradation of diclofenac sodium (DCF) in pre-magnetization Fe-0/persulfate (Pre-Fe-0/PS) and Fe-0/PS systems were studied in detail in this study. The influencing operational conditions (initial PS dosage, Fe(0)dosage, and pH) were studied for their effects on the DCF degradation. The removal rate constant for DCF by the Pre-Fe-0/PS system was 2.1-6.2 times higher than that of the Fe-0/PS system. A higher TOC removal efficiency (81.5%) was observed during the mineralization of DCF in the Pre-Fe-0/PS process than that of the Fe-0/PS process (70%). The results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirmed that the Pre-Fe-0/PS system could produce much more(center dot)OH and SO(4)(-center dot)at a faster rate than the Fe-0/PS system. Moreover, the degradation mechanism of DCF by the Pre-Fe-0/PS process was elucidated. This work would provide a perspective on the Pre-Fe-0/PS process for efficient degradation of DCF, exhibiting advantages to removing DCF, such as broaden the range of working pH and reduce the amount of chemicals. So, it is an efficient and potential method to remove DCF from wastewater by the Pre-Fe-0/PS process.

AB Organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin in river waters may impair aquatic ecosystem health and drinking water quality. To evaluate micropollutant fate and turnover on a catchment scale, information on input source characteristics as well as spatial and temporal variability is required. The influence of tributaries from agricultural and urban areas and the input of wastewater were investigated by grab and Lagrangian sampling under base flow conditions within a 7.7-km-long stretch of the Ammer River (southwest Germany) using target screening for 83 organic micropollutants and 4 in vitro bioassays with environmentally relevant modes of action. In total, 9 pesticides and transformation products, 13 pharmaceuticals, and 6 industrial and household chemicals were detected. Further, aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity, estrogenicity, and oxidative stress response were measured in the river. The vast majority of the compounds and mixture effects were introduced by the effluent of a wastewater-treatment plant, which contributed 50% of the total flow rate of the river on the sampling day. The tributaries contributed little to the overall load of organic micropollutants and mixture effects because of their relatively low discharge but showed a different chemical and toxicological pattern from the Ammer River, though a comparison to effect-based trigger values pointed toward unacceptable surface water quality in the main stem and in some of the tributaries. Chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays covered different windows of analyte properties but reflected the same picture.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Pharmaceutical residue pollution remains as an underexplored issue, especially in Asian countries. Along with that line, the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in tap water and its associated potential health risks, involving a total of 80 Putrajaya residents. Besides, this study also aimed to evaluate public awareness (knowledge, attitude, and practice) levels with regards to pharmaceutical handling. The highest pharmaceutical residue occurrence was caffeine (0.38 ng/L) while the lowest was diclofenac (0.14 ng/L). These pharmaceutical residue occurrences in tap water were linked with rapid urbanization and industrialization in river water, poor removal efficiencies in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants as well as improper pharmaceutical waste handling and disposal from the general public. The potential health risks (RQ(T)) indicated residents in Putrajaya with ages between 61 and 75 were exposed to the highest health risks caused by the pharmaceutical residues in tap water. In general, low public awareness (knowledge, attitude, and practice) levels were identified with only 44.5% of Putrajaya population having good knowledge, 27.5% having good attitude and 1.6% having good practice related to pharmaceutical handling and its effect to tap water quality. Findings of this study reflected the importance of public awareness program to educate the general public on proper unused/expired handling and disposal to minimize pharmaceutical pollution.

AB Treatment of waste and drinking waters has gained importance in both emerging and industrialized countries. New pharmaceutical products, industrial processes, agricultural activities are reducing water quality. To solve these problems we propose an efficient and thus economical purification method which uses commercial available natural zeolites as coating material on engineered porous ceramic substrates produced by additive manufacturing. The filters were produced varying the coating thickness and processing parameters such as calcination time and temperature. A testing device was assembled to investigate the filters' performance by exposing them in flowing water (240 Lh(-1)). The micropollutant adsorption was tested in three different water matrices (distilled water, surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluent). A range of 0.05 mg NH4-N g(-1) up to 3.1 mg NH4- NH4-N g(-1) zeolite of ammonium nitrogen was observed on the processed filters. Good filter stability expressed as weight loss (<5%) was observed. The adsorption of ten tested micropollutants showed an overall efficiency of 41.5% and 43% on the surface modified zeolite filters. Natural zeolite filters showed good specific adsorption capacity for metoprolol, citalopram, venlaflaxine and clarithromycin whereas the surface modified zeolite (SMZ) filters adsorb better hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac, candesartan, mecoprop and irbesartan.

AB The current work is focused on the use of nanofiltration in the removal of micropollutants, specially drugs (diclofenac and ibuprofen) and heavy metal (zinc sulphate and zinc nitrate) from wastewater. The commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membranes (AFC 80, AFC 40, AFC 30) were characterised by demineralised water and the ability of the membranes to reject drugs and zinc(II) was subsequently examined. The influence of the operating conditions on the rejection and the permeate flux was evaluated. The operating conditions tested included the transmembrane pressure (5-30 bar); the effect of the feed concentration on the heavy metals rejection (50-200 mg L-1); the effect of ionic strength on the diclofenac and ibuprofen rejection (0-10 g L-1 NaCl) and the volumetric flow rate (5-15 L min(-1)). It has been shown that increasing the transmembrane pressure increases the intensity of the permeate flow and rejection. Drugs rejection also increases with increasing bulk feed flow rates; however, decreases with increasing ionic strength (NaCl concentration in feed). Experimental data indicated that concentration polarisation existed in the membrane separation process. The stable permeation flux and high rejection of drugs and heavy metals indicated the potential of NF for the recovery of drugs and zinc(II) from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients, especially antibiotics, are micropollutants whose continuous flow into hydrological cycles has the potential to mediate antibiotic resistance in the environment and cause toxicity to sensitive organisms. Here, we investigated the levels of selected antibiotics in four wastewater treatment plants and the receiving water bodies. The measured environmental concentrations were compared with the proposed compound-specific predicted no-effect concentration for resistance selection values. The concentration of doxycycline, amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin within the influents, effluents, surface waters and river sediments ranged between 0.2 and 49.3 mu gL(-1), 0.1 to 21.4 mu gL(-1); (<)0.1 and 56.6 mu gL(-1); and 1.8 and 47.4 mu gkg(-1), respectively. Compared to the effluent concentrations, the surface waters upstream and downstream one of the four studied treatment plants showed two to five times higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and sulfamethoxazole. The risk quotient for bacterial resistance selection in effluent and surface water ranged between (<)0.1 and 53, indicating a medium to high risk of antibiotic resistance developing within the study areas. Therefore, risk mitigation and prevention strategies are a matter of priority in the affected areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics released into the environment through anthropogenic activities exert selective pressure, driving bacteria towards increasing antimicrobial resistance. The prevalence of antibiotics and the ecological risks posed in the riverine estuarine of Larut River and Sangga Besar River, which included wastewater effluents from hospital, zoo, and poultry slaughterhouse sources were investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS) were used to extract and quantify the antibiotic residues from 22 antibiotics belonging to six major antibiotic classes (sulfonamide, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, phenicol, trimethoprim, and tetracycline). Sixteen antibiotic residues were detected with concentrations ranging from limit of detection (LOD) to 1 262.3 ng/L. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides were the most frequently detected compounds. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin detected in hospital and zoo effluents posed a high risk to algae while tetracycline had low to medium ecological risks toward all the relevant organisms from aquatic environments (algae, invertebrate Daphnia magna, and fish).

AB The application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as suspended heterogeneous catalysts in electro-Fenton (EF) process for water treatment is almost inexistent. Fe-MOFs synthesized from phthalic acid-based linkers were spindle-shaped MIL(Fe)-88B and NH2-MIL(Fe)-88B crystals, whereas their calcination yielded nano-ZVI@C and nano-ZVI@C-N. The lipid regulator gemfibrozil was spiked into 0.050 M Na2SO4 solutions or urban wastewater and treated in electrolytic cells with an air-diffusion cathode to generate H2O2. The nano-ZVI@C-N catalyst obtained at 800 degrees C showed the highest activity, with high stability as deduced from the low iron leaching and high recyclability. Almost total drug removal and significant mineralization was feasible in both matrices at near-neutral pH. The presence of core-shell nano-ZVI and Fe3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped fusiform porous carbon rods was revealed, ensuring the Fe(III) conversion to Fe(II). Carbon doping with N contributed to the enhanced catalytic activity, and the strong magnetism facilitated the post-treatment catalyst recovery.

AB Propylene glycol (PG), commonly used in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries and considered non-PBT, is still an emerging contaminant of concern due to its widespread use. In this study, an isolate of a bacterial consortium obtained from an effluent treatment plant,MC1S, was used to degrade PG. The growth kinetics of the isolate was studied under aerated and non-aerated conditions. The isolate was able to effectively grow in saline water under aerated conditions using PG as the substrate. Using response surface methodology (RSM), the effect of pH, salinity, PG concentration, phosphate and nitrate concentration on cell growth and PG degradation was investigated. The isolated bacterium,MC1S, was capable of degrading PG with a maximum of 79% COD reduction observed and was able to withstand comparatively high salinity of the medium. Solution pH and salinity were the most important parameters affecting degradation. Salinity less than 0.1 M and pH close to 8 appeared to be the optimum conditions for PG degradation. HPLC analysis of the treated sample appeared to show the presence of three daughter products. Using RSM, a quadratic equation model between COD reduction and the process variables was developed. The results indicated that aerobic treatment of PG under specific conditions was the best approach for the specific isolate.

AB The wastewaters produced in many different operations in the pharmaceutical industry are considered as an environmental problem because of their hazardous and potential for impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater by combination of electrocoagulation (EC), electro-Fenton (EF) and photocatalytic oxidation (PcO) processes was investigated. Initially, EF or EC processes were applied to degrade and decompose recalcitrant organic pollutants and PcO was then sequentially carried out to remove total organic carbon (TOC) and mineralise remaining compounds from wastewater. The performance of sequential implementation of EC + EF, EC + PcO and EF + PcO processes was investigated by using different current densities, catalysts, reaction times and process order. The most effective degradation was observed in the 1 h EF using 5 mA/cm(2) pulsed current density and optimum Fe:H2O2 molar ratio as 1:10 and then 4 h PcO using 1.5 g/L TiO2 and 10 mM H2O2.

AB The global detection of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in waterbodies and the search for low-cost alternatives to fossil activated carbon have fostered research on the application of modified biochars in complex wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Gasification char - a promising prospect for adsorptive OMP removal - was obtained as by-product in a novel, multi-staged gasification process. The gasification system was designed for medium-scale energy production (530 kW combined heat and electrical power output) from spruce woodchips and relies on a floating-fixed-bed gasifier with a preceding pyrolysis step. The resulting floating-fixed-bed gasification char (FFBC) 'as-is' - i.e. without further modification - and a commercial powdered activated carbon (PAC) were used in adsorption, desorption and kinetic assays with pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, and industrial chemicals, in order to test the suitability of FFBC as OMP adsorbent in different water matrices (spiked water and WWTP effluent). OMP levels were quantified via HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS and Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm fitting was performed. The characterization of FFBC showed a high C-content (91.43%), low ash- content, porous texture (A(BET) = 308.15 m(2) g(-1)), and aromatic, heterogeneous structure (confirmed via FTIR) with basic character (pH = 9.50). For both tested adsorbents, high removal rates > 90% of OMPs with high logD were found at an equivalent dosing of 60 mg l(-1) FFBC approximate to 10 mg l(-1) PAC, whereas X-ray contrast agents exhibited lower affinity. The governing removal mechanisms are hydrophobic and pi-interactions, pore-size effects and - to a limited extent - hydrogen bond formation. Dissolved organic matter in WWTP effluent inhibits OMP adsorption, as observed in decreasing isotherm fitting parameters. The investigated bio-adsorbent - derived from renewable energy, regional supplies, and a process lean in the use of chemicals - could be an inexpensive alternative in adsorptive wastewater treatment.

AB Membrane bioreactor technology has become increasingly popular for treating various industry wastewater because of its high treatment efficiency, small footprint and excellent effluent quality. Performance of aerobic granules (AG) and activated sludge (AS)-based submerged membrane bioreactors implemented for tomato paste processing wastewater treatment was investigated and compared in this work, particularly in terms of membrane fouling and microbial community structure at different conditions. The results revealed that the chemical oxygen demand in the aerobic granular system showed slightly better removal efficiencies (92%) than those in the activated sludge system (90%) while the performance of activated sludge membrane bioreactor is more stable over the experimental test time. According to the total filtration resistance, the aerobic granular system demonstrated superiority initially, while the activated sludge system performed better with disintegrated aerobic granules. Indeed, the membrane fouling resulted from disintegrated aerobic granules was most serious, which was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy. In addition, the cleaning efficiency was 96% in the aerobic granular system, which was nearly 10% higher than that of the activated sludge system. The difference between the bacterial community structures in both systems was analyzed, and the dominant bacteria were transformed into Rhodocyclaceae and ASSO-13 at the family level indicating that consortia gradually became the predominant bacteria in the tomato paste processing wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) contain a diverse range of organic groups that present a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health. However, their actual fate in rivers remains only partially understood. The occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of PPCPs in aquatic systems have received global research attention. However, few studies have focused on the Longgang River in Shenzhen City, South China. This study was the first to simultaneously identify and quantify five PPCPs residues in the mainstream of Longgang River. All surface water and sediment samples were analyzed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The five assessed PPCPs were all detected in the mainstream of the Longgang River, with sediment concentrations much higher than water concentrations. Fluconazole and Triclosan were the dominant PPCPs in water and sediments, with maximum concentrations of 55.86 ng/L and 19.24 mu g/kg, respectively. Others were present at mean concentrations below 40 ng/L in water and 15 mu g/kg in sediments. The recovery rates of the five PPCPs ranged from 57.2% to 110.6%, which were within the limits of reliability. These results demonstrate that sewage treatment plants exhibited different degrees of removal effects for the five PPCPs and showed a natural attenuation trend along the Longgang River for all PPCPs except carbamazepine. The trace amounts of individual PPCPs residues in the river posed a low risk to aquatic organisms in the mainstream, although the potential risks created by low dose exposure and bioaccumulation of PPCPs should be considered.

AB Dexamethasone (DEX) is a type of corticosteroid medication that is commonly used for the treatment of human and animal diseases. The presence of its residual in wastewater can cause human mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process (COP) in the presence of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles in DEX removal. This experimental study was conducted in a laboratory and batch scale. In this study, a batch reactor with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 45 m was used. The ozone concentration was determined using an iodometric method. The effects of some parameters such as solution pH, contact time, ozone concentration, and catalyst concentration on the process efficiency were investigated. Al2O3 nanoparticles were characterized by the scanning electron microscopy X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The DEX concentration was measured using an ultraviolet light spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 241 nm. According to the results, the optimal value of solution pH and catalyst dose in the COP was obtained to be 10 and 0.5 g/L, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the process efficiency was 100% in the presence of 10 mg/L of the initial pollutant concentration after 12 min, and magnesium oxide nanoparticles caused an increase in the removal efficiency (67%) compared to the single ozonation process without catalyst). Due to the lack of sludge production and accessibility, this process can be used as a useful approach for the removal of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Information on sales and emission of selected pharmaceuticals were used to predict their concentrations in Japanese wastewater influent through a > 300 of pharmaceuticals data sink. A combined wastewater-based epidemiology and environmental risk analysis follow was established. By comparing predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of pharmaceuticals in wastewater influent against measured environmental concentrations (MECs) reported in previous studies, it was found that the model gave accurate results for 17 pharmaceuticals (0.5 < PEC/MEC < 2), and acceptable results for 32 out of 40 pharmaceuticals (0.1 < PEC/MEC < 10). Although the majority of pharmaceuticals considered in the model were antibiotics and analgesics, pranlukast, a receptor antagonist, was predicted to have the highest concentration in wastewater influent. With regard to the composition of wastewater effluent, the Estimation Program Interface (EPI) suite was used to predict pharmaceutical removal through activated sludge treatment. Although the performance of the EPI suite was variable in terms of accurate prediction of the removal of different pharmaceuticals, it could be an efficient tool in practice for predicting removal under extreme scenarios. By using the EPI suite with input data on PEC in the wastewater influent, the PEC values of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent were predicted. The concentrations of 26 pharmaceuticals were relatively high (> 1 mu g/L), and the PECs of 6 pharmaceuticals were extremely high (> 10 mu g/L) in wastewater effluent, which could be attributed to their high usage rates by consumers and poor removal rates in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Furthermore, environmental risk assessment (ERA) was carried out by calculating the ratio of predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) to PEC of different pharmaceuticals, and it was found that 9 pharmaceuticals were likely to have high toxicity, and 54 pharmaceuticals were likely to have potential toxicity. It is recommended that this is further investigated in detail. The priority screening and environmental risk assessment results on pharmaceuticals can provide reliable basis for policy-making and environmental management.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants in the aquatic environments. Their presence poses toxicological effects in humans and animals even at trace concentrations. This study investigated the presence of antibiotics, anti-epilepsy and anti-inflammatory drugs in river water of selected rivers in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for screening of sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones antibiotics. The samples were collected in upper-stream, middle-stream and lower-stream regions of the rivers and effluent of selected wastewater treatment plants. Pre-concentration of the samples was conducted using lyophilisation and extraction was conducted using solid phase extraction (SPE) on Waters Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced cartridge. The percentage recovery after sample clean-up on SPE was 103% +/- 6.9%. This was followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The detected analytes were sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin and carbamazepine. Carbamazepine and erythromycin were detected in high concentrations ranging from 81.8 to 36,576.2 ng/L and 11.2 to 11,800 ng/L respectively, while clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were detected at moderate concentrations ranging from 4.8 to 3280.4 ng/L and 6.6 to 6968 ng/L, respectively. High concentrations of pharmaceuticals were detected on the lower-stream sites as compared to upper-stream sites.

AB Activated carbon (AC), used for removal of organic micropollutants in European wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), is usually produced from non-renewable resources that need to be transported over long distances. Utilising local residual biomass as a raw material may be advantageous in terms of sustainability. This study investigated the environmental and energy balances of using biowaste and biomass from landscape management for micropollutant removal at a commercial scale WWTP. Both residual biomasses were processed using the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) technique to obtain a press cake that was used as feedstock for AC production. The results showed a lower global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand in comparison to a fossil-based conventional AC Differences in GWP between residual and fossil ACs were enhanced when the end-of-life incineration step was considered, and residual AC had a lower social risk associated with its production. Energy efficiency of AC production was substantially increased by utilising waste heat generated in the pyrolysis process of biochar production and by using electricity generated in a combined heat and power plant using biogas from the methanation of IFBB press fluids. Converting residual biomass into activated carbon using IFBB and a state-of-the-art pyrolysis and activation unit along with energy recovery would improve WWTP sustainability and self-sufficiency in terms of the raw materials required.

AB A three-dimensional electrochemical system was employed as an advanced treatment technology for treatment of tetracycline-containing wastewater. An initial tetracycline concentration of 20.17-100.23 mg/L, pH range of 2.43-9.18, and current density of 1.03-15.72 mA/cm(2) were implemented for the optimization and modeling of the process within the framework of a three-factor, five-level Box-Wilson central composite design-based response surface methodology and least squares support vector machine. The results of statistics corroborated that three main effective factors and reactor performance were very well described by the second-order polynomial equation (coefficient of determination = 0.94, mean square error = 0.0042, root mean square error = 0.065, average absolute deviation = 2.51, and mean absolute error = 0.037). Under the optimal conditions introduced by the desirability function approach, 90.42 (+/- 2.3)%, 49.91 +/- (8.4)% and 28.80 +/- (16.70)% of tetracycline, chemical oxygen demand, and total organic carbon could be removed using the three-dimensional electrochemical process from wastewater. The findings of this study demonstrated that the three-dimensional electrochemical system was as an effective, simple, and economic process compared to other electrochemical systems that have been recently used for antibiotics removal and could be considered as a promising technology for further investigations.

AB Alterations of the physical-chemical properties of the oceans due to anthropogenic activities are, at present, one of the most concerning environmental issues studied by researchers. One of these issues is ocean acidification, mainly caused by overproduction and release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic sources. Another component of environmental degradation is related to the production and release of potential toxic compounds, namely active pharmaceutical ingredients, into the aquatic environment that, combined with oceanic acidification, can cause unpredictable and never before considered deleterious effects on non-target marine organisms. Regarding this issue, the hereby study used predictions of future ocean acidification to simulate realistic scenarios of environmental exposure to a common therapeutic drug, salicylic acid (SA), in the marine gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis under different pH values. This species was exposed to a range of pH values (8.2, 7.9 and 7.6), and to already reported environmentally realistic concentrations (5, 25 and 125 mu g/L) of SA. To evaluate the effects of these environmental stressors, key physiological biomarkers (GSTs, CAT, TBARS, AChE and COX) and shell hardness (SH) were quantified. Results from the present study showed that CAT and GSTs activities were enhanced by SA under water acidification; increased lipid peroxidation was also observed in organisms exposed to SA in more acidic media. In addition, the hereby study demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of SA through the inhibition of AChE. Effects were also observed in terms of COX activity, showing that SA absorption may be affected by water acidification. In terms of SH, the obtained data suggest that SA may alter the physical integrity of shells of exposed organisms. It is possible to conclude that the combination of seawater acidification and exposure to toxic xenobiotics (namely to the drug SA) may be strenuous to marine communities, making aquatic biota more susceptible to xenobiotics, and consequently endangering marine life in an unpredictable extent.

AB Purpose Pharmaceutical contaminants, including antibiotics, present in the environment, especially water resources, are a main concern for human and environmental health due to their stability and non-degradability. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the photocatalytic removal of penicillin G antibiotic from simulated wastewater using a photocatalytic process [UV/ZnO] in an isotherm and kinetic study. Methods In the current research, the ZnO nanoparticles [ZnO NPs] were initially characterized by scanning electron microscope [SEM] and X-ray diffraction [XRD]. Then, its efficiency was investigated in the photocatalytic degradation process of penicillin G. The evaluated parameters in the adsorption process penicillin G antibiotic were pH [1-5], penicillin G concentration [10-30 mgL(-1)], NP dosage [0.5-4.5 gL(-1)] and contact time [5 to 200 min]. Then, the effect of pH [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and], penicillin G concentration [10-30 mgL(-1)], NP dosage [0.01-1.5 gL(-1)] and contact time [5 to 200 min] in the photocatalytic degradation (UV/ZnO) was studied. The residual penicillin G concentration was measured using a spectrophotometery at a wavelength of 283 nm. Results The results indicated that the penicillin G removal efficiency of photocatalytic process [UV/ZnO] using ZnO was 74.65% at the concentration of 10 mgL(-1), the pH value of 5, the ZnO NP dosage of 0.1 gL(-1) and the contact time of 180 min, as well as the kinetics of degradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Conclusion It can be concluded that the use of this process is appropriate an effective for the removal of the antibiotic pollutants.

AB A variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including some known to be obesogenic, can be found in household wastewater. Many are only partially treated by wastewater treatment and drinking water purification systems and can enter municipal drinking water supplies. We evaluated drinking water consumption habits in a cohort of obese pediatric patients to determine the percentage that might avoid exposure to EDCs from drinking municipal tap water. Obese (BMI >= 95th percentile) children presenting to an obesity clinic serving a largely poor and rural population were studied. Self-reported race/ethnicity, insurance status, and details concerning type and volume of water consumed were obtained from their medical records. Most homes were supplied with municipal, rather than private well water (90.6% vs. 9.4%, respectively). A majority (76.4%) of patients with municipal water as their water supply only drank bottled water. "Taste" and "Health Concerns" were the most commonly endorsed reasons for eschewing tap water. Bottled water consumption among low socioeconomic status patients may reduce their risk for exposure to EDCs in municipal tap water. Further studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of this observation.

AB Although passive sampling is widely accepted as an excellent tool for environmental monitoring, their integration with suspect or non-targeted screening by high-resolution mass spectrometry has been limited. This study describes the application of the organic-diffusive gradients in thin-films (o-DGT) passive sampler as a tool for accurate measurement of both targeted and suspect polar organic contaminants (primarily pharmaceuticals) in wastewater. First, performance of o-DGT was assessed alongside the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and active sampling at two wastewater treatment facilities using targeted analyses. Overall, water concentrations measured by o-DGT, POCIS, and 24-hr integrative active samples were in good agreement with each other. There were exceptions, including a systematic difference between o-DGT and POCIS at certain sites that we propose was a result of site-specific conditions and a difference in sampling rates between the two techniques. The second component of this work involved suspect screening of the o-DGT extracts using high-resolution, high mass accuracy quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF). Lamotrigine, venlafaxine, and desmethylvenlafaxine were three suspect compounds identified and selected as proof-of-concept case studies to determine the feasibility and accuracy of o-DGT for estimating water concentrations based upon predicted sampling rates using a previously validated o-DGT diffusion model. Semi-quantification of the suspect compounds was conducting using an average surrogate response factor based on the suite of compounds measured by the targeted analyses. This, combined with the modelled sampling rates provided time-weighted average wastewater concentrations of the identified suspects within a factor of 2 of the true value, confirmed by isotope dilution with mass labelled internal surrogates. To the knowledge of the authors, this work is the first to demonstrate the utility of the o-DGT passive sampler as a potential environmental screening tool that can be integrated into the rapidly advancing field of nontargeted high resolution mass spectrometry.

This paper aimed to examine the diagnostic catalytic properties and efficacy of a novel synthesized photocatalyst, namely FeNi3@SiO2@ZnO magnetic nanocomposite, for the removal of tamoxifen (TMX) from wastewater under simulated sunlight. According to the results, it was found that TMX was completely degraded operating under optimized conditions (i.e. pH = 7, catalyst dose = 0.01 g/L, initial TMX concentration = 20 mg/L and reaction time = 60 min). The reaction kinetics of TMX degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics model. The final by-products from the TMX photodegradation were water, carbon dioxide, acetic acid, nitroacetic acid methyl ester, 2-methyl-2-pentenal, and 4-methyl-2-pentanol. In addition, the synthesized photocatalyst could successfully performed five consecutive photodegradation cycles. The obtained results revealed that the synthesized FeNi3@SiO2@ZnO magnetic nanocomposite holds a great potential to be applied as a photocatalyst for the degradation of TMX on an industrial scale.

AB New analytical methods are needed to efficiently measure the growing list of priority pharmaceuticals in environmental samples. In this regard, a rapid, sensitive, and robust method was developed for quantitation of 168 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction protocol and instrumental efficiency were specifically addressed to increase analytical workload and throughput. The optimized protocols, which are five times more efficient than US EPA Method 1694, enabled analyte recoveries that ranged from 77% to 117% for 162 analytes with method quantitation limits (MQLs) as low as 0.1 ng L-1 . To verify the suitability of the improved analytical method for environmental samples, 24-h composite samples of raw wastewater and wastewater effluent, along with downstream surface water, were analyzed. Overall, 143/168 target compounds were identified in at least one of the samples, and 130/168 analytes were present at concentrations above their MQLs. The total mass concentration of the measured analytes decreased by 93% during wastewater treatment. The analyte concentrations in the wastewater effluent were comparable to those measured in surface water 1 km downstream of the wastewater discharge point. Ultimately, the comprehensive method will serve as an important tool to inform the occurrence, fate, transport, and toxicity of a large suite of priority pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites in natural and engineered systems.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used pharmaceuticals to treat pain, fever and inflammation. NSAIDs are also known to have many side effects including adverse effects on reproduction in both humans and animals. As NSAIDs usage is not regulated they are frequently detected at high concentrations in the environment. In order to understand the effect of NSAIDs on zebrafish sex differentiation, we used seven different NSAIDs which were either Cox-1 selective, Cox-1 biased, non-selective or COX-2 selective. We show that at higher concentration, NSAIDs are toxic to zebrafish embryo as they lead to mortality and hatching delay. Gene expression analysis following short term exposure of NSAIDs led to downregulation of female specific genes including zp2, vtg2 foxl2 and wnt4. Long term exposure of larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of Cox-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs resulted in male-biased sex ratio which confirmed the qRT-PCR analysis. However, the Cox-1 selective acetylsalicylic acid and the Cox-1 biased ketoprofen did not alter sex ratio. The observed male-biased sex ratio could also be due to induction of apoptosis process as the genes including p21 and casp8 were significantly upregulated following exposure to the Cox-2 selective and the nonselective NSAIDs. The present study indicates that NSAIDs alter sex differentiation in zebrafish, primarily through inhibition of Cox-2. This study clearly demonstrates that the use of NSAIDs and their release into the aquatic environment should be carefully monitored to avoid adverse effects to the aquatic organisms.

AB Nowadays, alternative options to conventional wastewater treatment should be studied due to rising concerns emerged by the presence of pharmaceuticals compounds (PhCs) in the aquatic environment. In this work, a combined system including biological treatment by activated sludge plus adsorption with activated carbon is proposed to remove three selected drugs (acetaminophen (ACT), caffeine (CAF) and ibuprofen (IBU)) in a concentration of 2 mg L-1 of each one. For it three sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were operated. SBR-B treated a synthetic wastewater (SWW) without target drugs and SBR-PhC and SBR-PhC + AC operated with SWW doped with the three drugs, adding into SBR-PhC + AC 1.5 g L-1 of a mesoporous granular activated carbon. Results showed that the hybrid system SBR-activated carbon produced an effluent free of PhCs, which in addition had higher quality than that achieved in a conventional activated sludge treatment in terms of lower COD, turbidity and SMP concentrations. On the other hand, five possible routes of removal for target drugs during the biological treatment were studied. Hydrolysis, oxidation and volatilization pathways were negligible after 6 h of reaction time. Adsorption mute only was significant for ACT, which was adsorbed completely after 5 h of reaction, while only 1.9% of CAF and 5.6% of IBU were adsorbed. IBU was the least biodegradable compound.

AB The degradation of a pharmaceutical mixture (gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen) by TiO2/UV-A in different aqueous matrices was evaluated. The matrix components affected the operational conditions, rate constants, and removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals, as well as toxicity. For sewage treatment plant effluent, a TiO2 concentration three-fold higher (450 mg L-1) and an irradiation time 1.5-3 times longer were required to reach the same efficiency of degradation as the pharmaceuticals in deionized water and surface water matrices. An improvement in the rate constants and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals was achieved by adding 6 mg L-1 of H2O2 and 150 mg L-1 of TiO2 in deionized water and surface water, but not in the sewage treatment plant effluent, due to the coupling of 450 mg L-1 of TiO2 and 50-200 mg L-1 of H2O2. Overall, TiO2/UV-A efficiently degraded all compounds, but an additional step is needed for the removal of residual toxicity.

AB There is no existing applicable law that regulates compounds of emerging concern (CECs), so they remain a global concern because they are easily taken up by organisms. Because of the current need, different processes have been developed capable of removing CECs. A membrane bioreactor (MBR) system and a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system with a 35% filling ratio were tested on real urban wastewater under 6 and 10 h of hydraulic retention time to remove pharmaceutical compounds. The mixed-liquor suspended solids changed between 5,200 and 5,700 mg/L and the temperature varied between 12.6 degrees C and 28.1 degrees C simulating real conditions. The plant received a shock with the mix of pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin) used to study its behavior. The removal of ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and ciprofloxacin was above 83.7%, 48.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, regardless of the process and the operative variables; these removal rates increased when the temperature increased.

AB Hormesis is an ecotoxicological phenomenon referred to as the biphasic dose-response effect. At a low concentration of toxic substances, a hormetic stimulating effect occurs, while an inhibitory effect occurs at higher concentrations. The phenomenon of hormesis may hinder the interpretation of toxicity test results and lower the actual toxicity of test samples. In this study, a hormesis phenomenon was observed and analysed during toxicity tests of wastewater from constructed wetlands containing two pharmaceutical substances, diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), against the marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri. To eliminate the hormesis phenomenon, a change in the diluent (ISO 11348-3:2007) to synthetic sea water (ISO 10253:2006) is proposed. The hormesis phenomenon was observed only during the analysis of wastewater toxicity with the standard toxicity test (with the diluent). The use of synthetic sea water eliminated the hormetic effects because of the presence of additional components in the sea water, such as MgCl2, Na2SO4, CaCl2, KCl, NaHCO3, and H3BO3, which increased the sensitivity of A. fischeri to the pharmaceutical substances. The use of different media in toxicity tests may have significant effects on the toxicity classification of the tested compounds or wastewater. Additionally, the toxicity of tested pharmaceuticals towards A. fischeri was analysed. The IC50 values of DCF were 8.7 +/- 1.1 mg L-1 (for diluent) and 13.9 +/- 0.9 mg L-1 (for synthetic sea water) whereas those of SMX were 50.5 +/- 2.3 and 55.3 +/- 1.6 mg L-1, respectively.

AB Gradually increasing concentrations of diclofenac (DCF), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, in water bodies is an emerging concern because of the persistent characteristics and harmful environmental impact of the drug molecule. In this study, electro-oxidation using a novel copper (Cu) - reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode is indicated to be an efficient technology for treating DEC-laden wastewater. The Cu-rGO dispersed carbon film (similar to 1 mm thickness) is synthesized by carbonization and H-2-reduction of a phenolic polymeric film in situ dispersed with a Cu salt and GO. The synthesized self-standing carbon film electrode is used for electro-oxidation of aqueous DCF. Analytical microscopic techniques are used to study the physicochemical properties of the material. Cyclic voltammetry analysis shows the prepared electrode generating a high oxidative current response. Approximately 100% DCF degradation is measured within 1 h at 1 V constant biased potential. Dual roles of Cu-rGO are presented as rGO facilitating direct oxidation via enhanced electron mobility at the electrode surface and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) participating in indirect oxidation by generating OH radicals in aqueous phase. The Cu NPs show an over-potential of -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (100 mM KCI) for oxygen evolution, indicating indirect oxidation of DCF. The high non-faradic current density of 4 mA cm(-2) generated at the positive potential (1 V) indicates direct oxidation of DCF. This study clearly indicates electro-oxidation using the Cu-rGO-dispersed carbon film electrode to be an efficient technique for remediation of pharmaceutical pollutants-contaminated wastewater.

AB Microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands (CW-MFCs) with different circuit operation conditions and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were constructed to evaluate their ability to remove and accumulate pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (sulfadiazine (SDZ), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP)) during four months running process. The abundance level of corresponding sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was also investigated. The results showed that closed circuit operation of CW-MFC contributed to the decrease in mass loading of COD, NH4+-N, PPCPs, and wastewater toxicity in the effluent. Additionally, closed circuit operation with low HRT contributed to enhancing selected PPCP mass accumulation on electrodes by electro-adsorption, and thus the higher sulfonamide ARG abundance was detected in the electrodes and effluent. Moreover, the composition of bacteria was greatly influenced by the mass accumulation of PPCPs revealed by redundancy analysis results. Procrustes analysis results further demonstrated that bacterial community contributed greatly to the ARGs profiles. Therefore, ARGs with their host bacteria revealed by network analysis were partially deposited on electrode substrates, and thus ARGs were effectively accumulated on electrodes. Function analysis of the bacterial community from PICRUSt predicted metagenomes revealed that closed circuit mode enhanced the abundances of the function genes of metabolic and the multiple ARGs, suggesting that closed circuit operation exhibited positive effects on metabolic process and ARG accumulation in CW-MFC system.

AB The present study evaluated the removal capacity of a UASB-HRAP treatment system, combining anaerobic and microalgae-based, aerobic treatment, for eleven organic micropollutants present in raw sewage, including pharmaceuticals, estrogens and xenoestrogens. The UASB reactor and the HRAP were operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 h and 8 days, respectively. Influent and effluent samples from the UASB and HRAP were collected periodically. All the target compounds were detected in raw sewage, with an occurrence ranging from 70 to 100%. Removal rates in the UASB reactor were generally incomplete, ranging from no removal (-25.12% for the hormone EE2-ethinylestradiol) to 84.91% (E2 - estradiol). However, the overall performance of the UASB + HRAP system was highly efficient for the majority of the compounds, with removal rates ranging from 64.8% (ibuprofen) to 95% (estrone). Gemfibrozil and bisphenol A were the only exceptions, with overall removal rates of 39% and 43%, respectively. Hormones were the compounds with the highest removal rates in the system.

AB Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat a variety of diseases. Consequently, these compounds have been found in water and wastewater matrix. Despite studies have proven its toxicity, just a few works investigate techniques to degrade and mineralize them. To solve this issue, this work presents the degradation and mineralization of prednisone (PRED) by electrochemical advanced oxidation (EAO) using a boron-doped diamond supported on niobium (Nb/BDD) anode in synthetic and real wastewater. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the PRED oxidation mechanisms. CV suggest that PRED will be oxidized via HO center dot and other oxidants generated from the ions present in the liquid matrix (S2O82-, SO4 center dot-, HCIO, ClO- etc.). Different EAO conditions as initial pH (3, 7 and 11) and applied current densities (5, 10 and 20 mA cm(-2)) were evaluated. The best result was obtained at alkaline pH (11) and a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), achieving 78% of degradation and 42% of mineralization. Using the best conditions, the EAO was applied as a polishing treatment stage to remove PRED from a biological pretreated municipal wastewater spiked with PRED. The results indicate that EAO applied in the real matrix provides better results than the synthetic solution, probably associated with the presence of ions that can be electrochemically converted into oxidant species, resulting in higher kinetic constant, mineralization current efficiency and lower energetic consumption. Therefore, the EAO process without the addition of chemicals has proven to be an effective alternative as a tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater contaminated with PRED. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study reports on the propranolol (PRO) degradation performance and product toxicity of an ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED)/chlorine process. The effects of experimental parameters including solution pH, chlorine dosage, and water matrix constituents on PRO removal were evaluated. Up to 94.5% of PRO could be eliminated within 15 min at a PRO-to-chlorine molar ratio of 1:4. The overall removal efficiency of PRO was non-pH dependent in the range of 5-9, while the initial rate was accelerated under alkaline conditions. The presence of Cl-/HCO3- had little influence on the PRO degradation, whereas either humic acid or NO3- had an obvious inhibitory effect. Radical scavenger experiments showed that both HO center dot and Cl center dot primarily contributed to the PRO degradation, and electron paramagnetic resonance data demonstrated the generation of O-1(2). The transformation of PRO during this process led to five detected products, which exhibited a higher acute toxicity than the parent compound according to the bright luminescent bacillus T3 method. It is worth mentioning that under the same ultraviolet illumination intensity, the degradation of PRO under UV-LED/chlorine gave a better performance than UV254/chlorine, but the EEO of the former is obviously higher than the latter. So further research is required on improving the electric current to photon conversion efficiency for UV-LED. Additionally, the UV-LED/chlorine system was effective in the degradation of other drugs including sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and gatifloxacin, suggesting the possible application of the UV-LED/chlorine process for the removal of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment.

AB Antibiotic contamination in drinking water sources has been increasingly prominent in recent years. The water quality in the Chongqing area is not only essential for the local people but also is crucial for the downstream of Yangzi River. To understand the level of antibiotic contamination in the large-scale drinking water sources, this study measured antibiotic residues in nine large-scale drinking water sources (five urban drinking water sources and four township drinking water sources) in Chongqing area of the Yangtze River. Results demonstrated that eight antibiotics of three categories in total were detected, including sulfonamide metformin (SMX), sulfonamide metformin (SMZ), erythromycin (ERM), Roxithromycin (ROM), Tylosin (TYL), Lincomycin (LIN), Chloramphenicol (CAP), and Florfenicol (FF). The mass concentration of antibiotic residues in five urban drinking water sources ranged from 13.9 to 76.6 ng/L, with an average of 46.4 ng/L, and that in four township drinking water sources ranged from 20.6 to 188.1 ng/L, with an average of 88.45 ng/L. The mass concentrations of antibiotic residues in Chongqing area were much lower than those in other cities. Antibiotics posed the maximum risk with a value of 0.005 for 0-3 months of the infant. The risk quotients of antibiotic residues in all water sources were much lower than 1 and thus did not pose a direct threat to human health.

AB Parabens are used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Parabens react with aqueous chlorine, which is used in disinfection processes, leading to the formation of halogenated parabens. In the presence of Br-, parabens and HOBr (formed via oxidation of Br-) can react to form brominated parabens. Brominated parabens may result in pollution of river water through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants. The present study involved measuring brominated paraben concentrations in the Kitakami River, northern Japan, which flows through urban and agricultural areas. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity was also assessed using a yeast (YCM3) reporter gene and HepG2 ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) assays. Dibrominated methylparaben (Br2MP), ethylparaben (Br2EP), propylparaben (Br2PP), butylparaben (Br2BP), and benzylparaben (Br2BnP), and monobrominated benzylparaben (Br1BnP) were detected in 25-100% of river samples during the sampling period from 2017 to 2018 at median concentrations of 8.1-28 ng/L; the highest concentrations were measured during the low flow season (November) in urban areas (P < 0.01). In the yeast assay, 12 compounds exhibited AhR activity (activity relative to beta-naphthoflavone; 4.4 x 10(-4) -7.1 x 10(-1)). All monobrominated parabens exhibited higher activity than their parent parabens, however, further bromination reduced or eliminated their activity. In the EROD assay, five compounds caused significant induction of CYP1A-dependent activity at 100 mu M (P < 0.05). Monobrominated i-butylparaben (BrliBP) and s-butylparaben (Br1sBP), Br1iBnP, and Br2BP exhibited activity in both yeast and EROD assays. We found novel aspects of brominated parabens originating from PPCPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photoreaction with the Fe(III)-oxalate complex has been reported to play an important role in various photochemical reactions in the natural atmospheric environment, and are applicable to treat various recalcitrant compounds in wastewater. We previously showed that a Fe(II) oxalate (FeOx) crystal can be recovered from the wastewater generated from soil washing, which can then be applied to the photoreaction for degradation of recalcitrant pollutants; however, photoreactions with FeOx compounds have not been fully reported yet. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the photoreaction characteristics of FeOx recovered from wastewater, to demonstrate the feasibility of its application to wastewater treatment. The physical and chemical properties of FeOx were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The photoreaction of FeOx showed high methylene blue (MB) removal efficiencies similar to the reaction with TiO2, indicating that FeOx is applicable to the photoreaction for degradation of pollutants. Furthermore, the photodegradation of MB with FeOx was observed under visible light, as opposed to TiO2. MB could be removed by the photoreaction of FeOx under both basic and acidic pH conditions. Under basic pH conditions, MB could be removed by FeOx via both photoreaction and surface adsorption. The concentration of FeOx affected light penetration and Fe and oxalate levels in the solution, resulting in different MB removal kinetics. The photoreaction efficiency of FeOx could be affected by both photoreaction of Fe and oxalate in the solution and photoreaction and adsorption reaction of the FeOx surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of aqueous oxytetracycline (OTC) from an aqueous solution antibiotic using H2O2/Fe2+ process was studied in one 1 L batch chemical reactor. The extent of OTC degradation (20 mg/ L) was investigated from a known initial pH solution, temperature and the type of catalyst (Fe2+, Fe3+) and for various initial concentrations of OTC, H2O2 and Fe2+. The degradation efficiency achieved was found to be very important (90.82% and 90.63%) at initial pH solution of 3 and 4, respectively. However, the type of catalyst and the reaction temperature had a slight impact on the final degradation of OTC. The results showed that the OTC removal increased with increasing initial H2O2 concentration in the range of 70 to 150 mg/L and initial Fe2+ concentrations in the range of 2 to 5 mg/L. The highest degradation efficiency obtained at ambient temperature was 90.95% with initial concentration of OTC of 10 mg/L, H2O2 = 150 mg/ L and Fe2+ = 5 mg/L. Moreover, biodegradability improved from 0.04 to 0.36 and chemical oxygen demand degradation was 78.35% after 60 min of treatment. This study proved that Fenton process can be used for pretreatment of wastewater contaminated by OTC before a biological treatment.

AB Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water, wastewater, soil, sediment and tissue samples. Concerns regarding the comparability of data obtained in different laboratories has been a major bottleneck to incentivize the compilation of publicly available of ARGs quantifications gathered from different reports. In this study, the influence of the DNA extraction kits (NZY Tissue gDNA Isolation kit or DNeasy PowerWater kit) and of the operator on the DNA extraction yield and on qPCR genes quantification was assessed. Since in wastewater and water samples the matrix effect can affect the DNA recovery and, therefore, gene quantification, an internal standard, consisting in a cloned gene not found in environmental samples, was tested. The aim was to assess how qPCR determinations in wastewater and water samples can be affected by the matrix effect. The results show that the DNA extraction operator did not significantly influence DNA yield. The use of distinct kits resulted in qPCR gene quantifications that did not differ in more than 1 log-unit mL(-1). The matrix effect, assessed based on the use of an internal standard, was associated with an underestimation that ranged 0.1-0.9 log gene copy number mL(-1) of sample, irrespective of the water type.
   The reliability on the use of a DNA extraction kit that costs about 3 times less than the most commonly used can be an incentive for the use of DNA based analyses of ARGs in environmental waters. Moreover, the fact that both the DNA extraction operator and the reduced matrix effect have little influence on the final results, are good news, encouraging the compilation of data produced in distinct laboratories. Nevertheless, harmonization efforts are still necessary to minimize bias that may be due associated with other conditions, such as equipment.

AB Raw wastewater from final processing unit of pharmaceutical industry contains high organic loading and obstinate compounds causing treatment of this wastewater a major challenge. In this study a novel approach for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater has been discussed. Anaerobic pretreatment of raw pharmaceutical wastewater was done using microbial fuel cell (MFC), followed by aerobic microalgal treatment with T. indica in photobioreactor in batch mode. Combined MFC and algal treatment process showed potential reduction in heavy metals concentration along with decrease of COD, TOC, nitrate and phosphate content. The observed COD, TOC, nitrate and phosphate in raw wastewater was 90.29, 97.05, 81.60 and 94.87 %, respectively. However, after treatment of raw wastewater in photobioreactor without pretreatment, 66.30 % COD, 67.17 % nitrate, 70.03 phosphate and 78.14 % TOC reduction were observed. T. indica achieved 16.40 and 15.69 mg L-1 d(-1) of lipid productivity in PW1 and PW2 whereas it showed 0.085 and 0.089 g CO2 L -1 d(-1) of CO2 Fixation rate. This study demonstrates combination treatment processes of wastewater improve environmental sustainability and enables greener routes of biofuels production.

AB Groundwater treatment sludge was a ferrihydrite-rich solid waste and abundantly generated for potable water production in groundwater treatment plant. Here we demonstrated an alternative strategy to reuse the sludge for preparing nano-rod erdite particles (EPs) via a facile hydrothermal method with only adding Na2S. The produced EPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM results showed that with the molar ratio of N2S to Fe in the sludge increasing from 1 to 2, the product EPs grew long from 0.5-1 mu m to 1-4 mu m. The product EP-0.2, prepared at the molar ratio of 0.2, was amorphous aggregates with dotted distribution of hexahedral pyrite. With the molar ratio increasing to 2, the product EP-2 was in the form of nanorod, and exhibited high TC adsorption capacity of 1960.8 mg/g, approximately 15 times of that of EP-0.2. By adding 0.02g EP-2, the removal rate of TC was 92.5% at the initial TC concentration of 1000 mg/L, higher than that of active carbon, diatomite, polyaluminium chloride and polyferric sulfate, and nearly 100% TC and 51.5% total organic carbon were removed from pharmaceutical wastewater. EP-2 was completely hydrolyzed to yield Fe oxyhydroxide in TC-containing solution, which exhibited adequate hydroxyl groups to link the -NH2 group at the side chain of TC molecules, resulting in high TC adsorption. This is the first report of recycling groundwater treatment sludge for preparing nano-rod erdite particles, which can be serve as low-cost materials in wastewater treatment. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A sensitive quantification method using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed for determination of 19 anthelmintic drugs (ADs) belonging to seven structural groups (Benzimidazoles, Diphenylsulfides, Imidazothiazoles, Hexahydropyrazines, Macrocylic lactones, Salicylanilides, Tetrahydropyrimidines) in environmental water and sediment samples. Eleven SPE cartridges, sample pH, elution solvents were tested to determine the optimal conditions for extraction. Among these investigated SPE types, the best recoveries for 19 target ADs were obtained from Oasis HLB cartridge with 37-102%, 45-103%, 37-88%, 28-82% and 31-90% for spiked river water, tap water, rainwater, wastewater, and sediment respectively (with RSD < 15%), except for closanteL The 19 ADs were separated within 10 min by a BEH C18 column and monitored in both positive and negative ions modes with switching electrospray ionization source. The cross-talk interferences were solved by identification of secondary mass spectrum of substances through MRM-IDA-EPI scanning using Qtrap. These interference peaks could be efficiently eliminated by setting MRM segments or using Qtrap to obtain tertiary fragmented information. The developed methods were satisfactory in terms of linearity, accuracy, and precision, and used eight isotopically labeled compounds as internal standards to correct matrix effects. Method quantification limit (MQL) for 19 ADs was below 1.1 ng/L, OA ng/L, 5.4 ng/L and 23 ng/g for river water, tap water, wastewater, and sediment, respectively. The validated method was successfully used to investigate the occurrence of anthelmintics in water and sediment samples from Chengdu, China. All ADs were detected in environment with the concentrations at ng/L level. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater stabilisation ponds are the simplest, and most economical and maintainable way of municipal wastewater treatment. The fate of selected emerging contaminants using algal monocultures has been studied. However, in an actual wastewater treatment plant, it is likely to be different. Accordingly, a need was felt to take up this study. A waste stabilisation pond based wastewater treatment plant having five ponds in an area of approximately 14 hectares and working for 30 years was selected. High removal (> 75%) was observed in the case of paracetamol and carbaryl. Moderate removal efficiencies (50-75%) were found for malathion, erythromycin, clofibric acid and 17beta-estradiol while low (< 50%) removal efficiencies were witnessed in the case of aldrin, endosulfan, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, hexachlorocyclohexane and diclofenac. Results show that most of the removal takes place in initial ponds, with higher efficiencies in summer and lower in winter. Results suggest that waste stabilisation pond based wastewater treatment plant is capable of removing emerging contaminants to some extent.

AB A semi-empirical model of heat-activated and iron-activated persulfate (PS) processes applied to the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) in water at low concentration (0.0025 mM) has been proposed and validated. In heat-activation systems, carried out at pH 3, temperature was varied from 25 degrees C to 65 degrees C, and acid-activation of PS showed an important initial role in the process. In iron-activated experimental series, iron concentration was changed from 0.009 mM to 0.18 mM at two different temperatures (25 degrees C and 35 degrees C), heat-activation was negligible with iron being the main activation mechanism and acid-activation showing also an important initial effect on process performance. High model prediction capability for both CBZ degradation and PS decomposition profiles was obtained in each case. Finally, the model was validated including supplementary experiments based on Fe(II) additions (0.018 mM each) and PS additions (0.17 mM) throughout the treatment. Developed model in this work is a powerful predictive tool for the application of PS in the removal of contaminants of emerging concern in water.

AB The main goal of this work was to produce an easily recoverable waste-based magnetic activated carbon (MAC) for an efficient removal of the antiepileptic pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater. For this purpose, the synthesis procedure was optimized and a material (MAC4) providing immediate recuperation from solution, remarkable adsorptive performance and relevant properties (specific surface area of 551 m(2) g(-1) and saturation magnetization of 39.84 emu g(-1)) was selected for further CBZ kinetic and equilibrium adsorption studies. MAC4 presented fast CBZ adsorption rates and short equilibrium times (< 30-45 min) in both ultrapure water and wastewater. Equilibrium studies showed that MAC4 attained maximum adsorption capacities (q(m)) of 68 +/- 4 mg g(-1) in ultrapure water and 60 +/- 3 mg g(-1) in wastewater, suggesting no significant interference of the aqueous matrix in the adsorption process. Overall, this work provides evidence of potential application of a waste-based MAC in the tertiary treatment of wastewaters.

AB Aquaculture in treated wastewater (TWW) has been practiced around the world, yet this field of research is backed with only scant scientific data, especially the aspect of the bioaccumulation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate how fish culture in tertiary TWW (TTWW) affects commercially important traits, such as fish survival, growth rate and health, and to assess the potential risks associated with food safety and consumer protection. Cyprinus carpio juveniles were raised in 0%, 50% and 100% Trww, for five months. Fish performance and health parameters were not affected by exposure to TTWW. The levels of heavy metals in the fish muscle were below the FAO and EU maximal permitted levels in edible fish. Seven out of 40 screened OMPs were detected in the TTWW samples at least once. Out of the 19 analyzed OMPs in fish tissues, four were detected in exposed fish. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were detected in the muscles and livers of fish grown in 50% and 100% TTWW at measurable concentrations. Carbamazepine-epoxide and diphenhydramine concentrations were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the muscle of the exposed fish, while diphenhydramine was detected above the LOQ level in two liver samples of fish grown in 100% TTWW. Based on the presented findings, TTWW can be successfully used for growing fish, and TTWW-grown fish met all the existing standards for heavy metals accumulation. However, the issue of OMP's bioaccumulation needs to be further studied in different fish species and culture conditions to broaden the perspective of the findings.

AB The removal of imidacloprid (IMI) from water by ozonation (O-3) and photo-ozonation (O-3/UV) was comparatively studied, paying particular attention to the kinetics, matrix effect, and mechanistic aspects of the processes. The IMI removal by O-3 was considerably enhanced at alkaline pHs, leading to almost complete removal under 20 min with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.2374 min(-1) at pH 8.25. Three different matrices, Milli-Q water, full-scale vacuum rotating membrane bioreactor plant effluent (VRMBR WW), and laboratory-scale instantaneous fed-batch reactor bioreactor effluent (Bio WW) spiked with IMI, were tested. The ozonation, coupled with UV, improved IMI removal remarkably regardless of the wastewater matrix, and there occurred a six times decrease in ozonation time requirement for 99% IMI elimination at pH 7.25. The IMI degradation mechanism proved that IMI is an ozone-resistant pollutant and is mainly degraded by OH center dot via an indirect mechanism. The second-order rate constants for IMI degradation with OH center dot were calculated as 2.23 x 10(11) and 9.08 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1) for the O-3 alone and O-3/UV processes, respectively. The IMI degradation pathway analysis showed that IMI lost NO2, HNO2, and then Cl- from its structure, and the O-3/UV process yielded fewer by-products than O-3.

AB Background The successful application of Fish plasma model (FPM) will greatly simplify the risk assessment of drugs. At present, the FPM has been applied to the risk assessment of several human drugs with high hydrophobicity. However, its applicability to a wide variety of compounds needs to be tested. Field work about distribution characteristics of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in water and in fish plasma plays a key role in promoting the successful application of FPM. However, there are few reports on the distribution of EDCs in fish, especially in wild fish plasma. Results The distribution of 31 EDCs, including seven estrogens, eight androgens, six progesterones, five glucocorticoids, and five industrial compounds, in water and plasma of five categories of wild fishes in Taihu Lake was studied and the typical FPM was tested by the field data. The detected concentration of most compounds is relatively low (< 10 ng/L), and the industrial compounds are the predominant pollutants with the highest concentration up to 291.7 ng/L (Bisphenol A) in water. In general, glucocorticoids were detected at the highest concentrations in plasma of all kinds of fishes, followed by industrial compounds and estrogens. Except for glucocorticoids (up to 43.61 for Cortisone), the average concentrations of the other four categories of EDCs in fish plasma were generally low (< 10 mu g/L). The available measured bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of 20 kinds of EDCs were in the range of 0 to 5626. The bioaccumulation of EDCs in fish plasma is not only hydrophobicity-dependent, but is also both fish species-specific and compound-dependent. The classical FPM was tested and the results indicated that the good coincides of measured log BAFs and the theoretical log BCFs were only observed for limited EDCs (7 out of 20). The present available FPM generally underestimated the Log BAFs of most hydrophilic EDCs (log Kow < 3.87, 11 out of 20) whereas overestimated the Log BAFs of several high hydrophobic EDCs (Log Kow > 3.87) in fish plasma. Conclusion Although the present FPM is barely satisfactory, it is still promising for predicting the accumulation of EDCs in fish plasma and for further environmental risk assessment.

AB With a high rejection coefficient for trace pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), forward osmosis (FO) membrane separation has become a cutting-edge technology in water treatment owing to its low energy consumption and low membrane fouling. Wastewater contains many types of PPCPs, and one pharmaceutical molecule affects the separation behaviors of other pharmaceuticals in FO. Therefore, simultaneous FO of multiple PPCPs needs to be investigated. In this study, the separation behaviors of four trace pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxadn (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), acetaminophen (ACP), carbamazepine (CBZ)), individually (termed "single pharmaceuticals") and in combination (termed "binary pharmaceuticals" as two pharmaceuticals were studied simultaneously), during FO were investigated at trace concentrations using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that for single pharmaceuticals, the molecular sieve dominates their retention rate-the retention rate increases with increasing Stokes radius of the molecules (29.1 -> 94.8% for 0.35 -> 0.47 nm). For binary pharmaceuticals, the retention rates of both pharmaceuticals without charge decrease with increasing total molecule number (for ACP + CBZ, 31.4 -> 52.1% (ACP), 75.1 -> 83.0% (CBZ)). Negatively charged pharmaceuticals are mutually exclusive with the negatively charged FO membrane, resulting in the increase of the retention rate of pharmaceuticals (83.1 -> 90.1% (CIP) when CIP + ACP -> CIP SMX). In the presence of a positively charged pharmaceutical, the retention rate of negatively charged pharmaceuticals decreases (85.7 -> 80.4% (SMX) when SMX + ACP -> SMX + CIP) because the positively charged pharmaceutical neutralizes the negative charge on the FO membrane surface, resulting in the weakening of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged pharmaceutical and FO membrane surface. The positively charged molecule attracts the negatively charged molecule, forming a couple of molecules with larger molecule weight and increasing the retention rate of the pharmaceuticals (80.4 -> 882% (SMX) when pH = 7 -> 5 for SMX + CIP). The results suggest that the interactions between pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored in the process of removing PPCPs by FO. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous increase of the human population worldwide has led to an increase of pharmaceuticals' consumption, such as diclofenac (DCF), a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), that is not removed by wastewater treatment processes. Although there is some research regarding the effects of DCF on animals and aquatic invertebrates, information concerning its influence on plants' metabolism is still scarce. Through an integrated approach, using combined biochemical and molecular biology techniques, this work aimed to evaluate the phytotoxicity of DCF in Solanum lycopersicum L., focusing on the primary plant processes: nitrogen (N) assimilation and photosynthesis. The exposure of tomato plants to increasing concentrations of DCF (0, 0.5, and 5 mg L-1) revealed that glutamine synthetase (GS) was differentially affected, in an organ-dependent manner, by this contaminant at the gene expression, protein, and activity levels, with an increased activity of 0.2-fold in shoots of plants treated with the lowest concentration of DCF although a general decrease was registered for the SlGS gene family expression, revealing that post-translational regulation was in order, since GS2 polypeptide content did not change. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity was generally enhanced, accompanied by increases of 0.4- to 1.9-fold in proline levels, revealing GDH as an important compensatory route for both N assimilation and proline production under stressful conditions. No alterations in most photosynthetic endpoints were noticed after DCF treatments, but small decreases of 0.1- to 0.8-fold in the accumulation of RuBisCO-encoding transcripts were observed, along with a reduction in starch content. Some alterations in the soluble polypeptide profile were also detected in response to DCF, evidencing the participation of some stress-related proteins in the plant's response to DCF.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) especially anthropogenic compounds in sewage systems affects their ultimate fate in the environment which is challenging to ascertain the heterogenic nature of the compound and causes co-occurring effects in most aquatic samples. So, our study have focused on current approaches to the chemical and structural characterization of DOM with the detailed classification of individual compounds such as the molecular levels of volatile organic, inorganic materials, drugs and endocrine disrupting compounds. Analytical techniques for example high performance gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) with high-resolution liquid chromatography (HR-LCMS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM) has resulted in advancing the parametric studies. In addition, the toxicological assessment of an aquatic organism (zebrafish as a model) has ensued in enlightening the risk of contaminated sources. The result of the research highlighted the efficacy of high-throughput approaches to assess the environmental impact of sewage water.

AB The wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the biggest reservoirs of pharmaceutical residues discharged into the environment. Among many pharmaceuticals, derivatives of 5-nitrofuran, whose cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity have been proved, are widely used. The ability of such compounds to accumulate in water and sediments motivated us to analyze the ability of microbial communities of rural and municipal WWTPs to eliminate nitrofurantoin (NFT), nitrofurazone (NFZ), furaltadone (FTD), and furazolidone (FZD). Metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in rural and municipal activated sludge has provided information about the bacterial biodiversity in the WWTPs. In both samples, the most dominant phylum in terms of abundance was Proteobacteria followed by Bacteroidetes; however, microbial community of the municipal WWTP exhibited greater biodiversity than the one of the rural WWTP. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis of the samples and elimination kinetic calculations allowed the determination of FZD, FTD, NFT, and NFZ elimination half-time varying from 104 to 327 h and test system first-order half-lives in the examined WWTP samples (from 31 to 231 h). Moreover, a comparison of the effectiveness of the microbials from two treatment plants, a rural one and a municipal one, revealed the poorer performance of the microbial communities from the smaller, rural WWTP in disposal of the analyzed pharmaceuticals, as after 24 days, the rural WWTP community was able to eliminate from 20 to 62% of 5-nitrofuran derivatives, while the municipal consortium removed over 85% of the compounds from the cultures.

AB In a water scarcity scenario, the reused wastewater could be an essential source for agricultural irrigation considering that 60% of fresh water is destined to this area. In this study, an organic fertilizer (Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, DTPA) was used as a new chelating agent of iron for photo-Fenton's application at neutral pH using LEDs. Secondary effluents with different characteristics were tested for propranolol removal and bacterial inactivation. With DTPA, the best results were achieved with MBR matrix: 94.0% of propranolol removal and total bacterial inactivation after 120 min. IFAS matrix showed the worst results: 63.2% of propranolol removal and only 2-log reduction for Total Coliforms. The performance of DTPA as chelating agent was compared with EDTA and EDDS with two matrices. In MBR matrix, propranolol removal with EDTA was 100% in 15 min, while DTPA and EDDS reached similar results at 120 min (94.0 and 91.3%), respectively. The iron precipitation was evaluated, and DTPA showed high stability with Fe2+ (only 10.4% of iron reduction instead 97.3% for EDDS). In addition, it looks like that the stability of iron chelates plays an important role in bacterial inactivation. Thus, the experiments with DTPA showed the lowest bacterial growth-on-the-plate after 72 h of the end of the experiment. Biodegradability and phytotoxicity were also evaluated and the experiments with DTPA had the lowest toxicity. The results of the experiments performed with DTPA were compared with the values in Proposal for agricultural water reuse suggesting that treated effluent accomplish the requirements for agriculture.

AB Organic micropollutants (MPs), such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds, and waste breakdown products occurring in waters at ng/L-mu g/L levels are a threat to ecosystems and human health. Adsorption of MPs using granular activated carbon (GAC) is an increasingly common treatment process. Biochar is a promising low-cost, environmentally sustainable surrogate for GAC in diverse water quality applications. Challenges remain, however, for accurately simulating real-world biochar and GAC adsorbers in laboratory experiments. The goal of this research was to develop a scale-up procedure for predicting the adsorption of organic MPs from water containing background dissolved organic matter (DOM) by GAC and biochar using bench-scale column tests. The removal of 11 native MPs in wastewater effluent by GAC and biochar was quantified using pilot-scale adsorbers and rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs). Batch isotherm studies were conducted and RSSCT data were fit with two different surface and pore diffusion models to obtain equilibrium and kinetic parameters for each MP-adsorbent combination. The diffusion models were used to predict MP breakthrough at full scale, and predictions compared with pilot column data. A third scale-up approach was applied using a fouling index to account for the effects of DOM competition and pore blockage on MP uptake. A fourth approach was applied using direct empirical correlation between early MP breakthrough in RSSCT and pilot columns. The criterion for comparison of the ability of model-based and empirical scale-up approaches to accurately simulate pilot-scale adsorption was the number of bed volumes treated until MP breakthrough at 10% of the influent concentration (BV10%). Data obtained in this study as well as from the literature were used to develop an empirical regression based on RSSCT BV10% values to provide a user-oriented, conservative approach to predicting full-scale MP breakthrough that can be used for the design and operation of biochar and GAC treatment systems.

AB Activated carbon from the shell of the cashew of Para (SCP) was produced by chemical activation with ZnCl using the ratio of SCP: ZnCl2 1.0:1.5 at 700 degrees C. The prepared activated carbon (SCP700) was used for the removal of two emerging contaminants, 4-bromophenol (4-BrPhOH) and 4-chloroaniline (4-ClPhNH2) that are primarily employed in the industry. Different analytical techniques were used to characterize the activated carbon. From the N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained the specific surface area of 1520 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.492 cm(3) g(-1). The functional groups were identified by the FTIR technique and quantified by modified Boehm titration. The results revealed the bearing of several functional groups on the SCP700 surface, which may utterly influence the removal of the emerging contaminants. The equilibrium experiments showed that the maximum uptaken capacities (Q(max)) achieved at 45 degrees C were 488.2 (4-BrPhOH) and 552.5 mg g(-1) (4-ClPhNH2). The thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the processes of 4-BrPhOH and 4-ClPhNH2 adsorption are exothermic, spontaneous, energetically suitable, and the magnitude of Delta H degrees is compatible with physisorption. The mechanism of the adsorption of the emerging contaminants onto the carbon surface is dominated by microporous filling, hydrogen bonds, pi-stacking interactions, and other Van der Waals interactions. The use of activated carbon for the treatment of industrial synthetic wastewater with several inorganic and organic molecules commonly found in industrial effluents showed a very high percentage of uptaking (up to 98.64%).

AB The increasing use of pharmaceutical products also increases their release in aquatic environment. These contaminants are considered emerging pollutants, and induce adverse ecological and human health effects. The antidiabetic metformin is one example that has been detected in the aquatic environment at unusual concentrations. This fact indicates that conventional wastewater treatment is inefficient on eliminating this compound. Here we show that metformin can be effectively removed from water by photocatalysis. We found the optimised conditions for pH and concentration of catalyst on the photocatalytic process. TiO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 were successful in oxidising metformin under UV radiation following a pseudo-first order kinetics. Intermediates of metformin photodegradation appeared after photocatalytic treatment. Toxicity analysis showed that the degradation products are non-toxic to Lactuca sativa seeds.

AB Anaerobic digestion, the principal method of stabilizing biosolids in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), can efficiently and largely attenuate the antibiotic resistances in biosludge. This study aims to investigate the effect of oxidative pretreatment with ultrasound irradiation combined with ozone (US/O-3) on the mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD and TAD) for the biosludge bearing trace fluoroquinolones contaminants-levofloxacin (LEVO) which was widely used in recent years. During the oxidation, the trace-level LEVO was almost completely degraded. The methanogenic activity in US/O-3 pretreated TAD dosed 0.1 mg/L LEVO was much higher than those in single MAD and TAD, therefore leading to a remarkable increase in biogas production. The identification of levofloxacin intermediates during chemical degradation was analyzed using LCMS technique and the reaction pathway based on them was proposed. Hydroxyl radicals provided by US/O-3 contributed to oxidative ring opening of LEVO as well as degradation of other biomacromolecules in the biosludge. Besides, the quinoline resistance genes-qnrA and qnrS declined significantly by 1-2 orders of magnitude in US/O-3-pretreated TAD, indicating that the active radicals produced by US/O-3 oxidized and degraded LEVO and therefore inactivated the antibiotic resistant bacteria or genes in the biosolids. Meanwhile, the composition and structure of the microbial community altered and the diversity and richness of total bacterial and potential human pathogens decreased, the pattern of which was correlated with LEVO-resistant genes. Among the well-known AD-related phylum including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Methanobacteria as well as Thermotogae which has been previously detected in TAD and performed organic hydrolysis and degradation, the potential LEVO-resistant bacteria were probably affiliated to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Thermotogae. This study revealed the contribution of US/O-3 pretreatment to the anaerobic digestion in terms of ARGs reduction for trace-LEVO- exposed biosludge and could provide useful guidance for controlling the dissemination of ARB and ARGs in sewage sludge.

AB This study investigates the potential of fluorescence excitation/emission matrices (EEM) measurement as a tool to predict N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation in water reuse applications. In particular, samples from a pilot-scale membrane biological reactor (MBR) followed by nanofiltration (NF) advanced water treatment plant, are used for the study. Concentrations of both, specific NDMA precursors and NDMA formation potential (FP) are correlated with different EEM peaks. The specific precursors investigated are: erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, venlafaxine, o-desmethylvenlafaxine, ranitidine and citalopram, while the NDMA FP is conventionally measured by the NDMA formation potential test. EEM peaks investigated are obtained by fluorescence regional integration as well as by the peak picking method generating I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, and I-5 peaks. Results showed that protein-like materials are correlated with the bulk NDMA FP and specific NDMA precursors. Additionally, selected fluorescence peaks such as I-1, I-2 and I-4 are strongly correlated with NDMA precursors throughout the MBR-NF pilot plant. The removal of NDMA precursors and EEM peaks also correlated well (R-2 > 0.8). This data shows that fluorescence EEM can be a promising tool to monitor the concentration of NDMA precursors and their removal in water reuse application. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microalgae-mediated biodegradation of antibiotics has recently gained increased attention from international scientific community. However, limited information is available regarding microalgae-mediated biodegradation of SMX in a co-metabolic system. Here we investigated the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by five algal species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Scenedesmus obliquus, Scenedesmus acuminatus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa), and its transformation pathways by C. pyrenoidosa in a sodium acetate (3 mM) co-metabolic system. The results showed that the highest SMX dissipation (14.9%) was detected by C. pyrenoidosa after 11 days of cultivation among the five tested algal species in the absence of other carbon sources. The addition of sodium acetate (0-8 mM) significantly enhanced the dissipation efficiency of SMX (0.4 mu M) from 6.05% to 99.3% by C. pyrenoidosa after 5 days of cultivation, and the dissipation of SMX followed the first-order kinetic model with apparent rate constants (k) ranging from 0.0107 to 0.9811 d(-1). Based on the results of mass balance analysis, biodegradation by C. pyrenoidosa was the main mechanism for the dissipation of SMX in the culture medium. Fifteen phase I and phase II metabolites were identified, and subsequently the transformation pathway was proposed, including oxidation, hydroxylation, formylation and side chain breakdown, as well as pterin-related conjugation. The majority of metabolites of SMX were only observed in the culture medium and varied with cultivation time. The findings of the present study showed effective co-metabolism of a sulfonamide by microalgae, and it may be applied in the aquatic environment remediation and wastewater treatment in the future.

AB In this paper, in-situ fabrication of tungsten oxide (WO3) on carbon nano-tube (CNT) was performed via sol-gel/hydrothermal method to prepare WO3/CNT nanocomposites and then coupled with visible light and ultrasound (US) irradiations for sono-photocatalytic removal of tetracycline (TTC) and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TEM, UV-VIS DRS, FESEM, EDS, TGA, BET, BJH, EIS, and EDX techniques. The characterization tests, indicated successful incorporation of CTNs into the WO3 framework and efficient reduction of charge carries recombination rate after modifying with CNT. The investigation of experimental parameters verified that 60 mg/L TTC could be perfectly degraded at optimum operational parameters (WO3/CNT: 0.7 g/L, pH: 9.0, US power: 250 W/m(2), and light intensity: 120 W/m(2) over 60 min treatment. Trapping experiments results verified that HO% radicals and h(+) were the main oxidative species in degradation of TTC. The as-prepared photocatalysts could be reused after six successive cycles with an approximately 8.8 % reduction in removal efficiency. Investigation of the effect of real pharmaceutical wastewater revealed that this system is able to eliminate 83.7 and 90.6 % of TOC and COD, respectively after 220 min of reaction time. Some compounds with lower toxic impact and molecular weight, compared to raw pharmaceutical wastewater, were detected after treatment by sono-photocatalysis process. The biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater was improved significantly after treatment by WO3/CNT sono-photocatalysis.

AB The present study evaluates the removal capacity of two high rate algae ponds (HRAPs) to eliminate 12 pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and 26 of their corresponding main metabolites and transformation products. The efficiency of these ponds, operating with and without primary treatment, was compared in order to study their capacity under the best performance conditions (highest solar irradiance). Concentrations of all the target compounds were determined in both water and biomass samples. Removal rates ranged from moderate (40-60 %) to high (>60 %) for most of them, with the exception of the psychiatric drugs carbamazepine, the ss-blocking agent metoprolol and its metabolite, metoprolol acid. O-desmethylvenlafaxine, despite its very low biodegradability in conventional wastewater treatment plants, was removed to certain extent (13-39 %). Biomass concentrations suggested that bioadsorption/bioaccumulation to microalgae biomass was decisive regarding the elimination of non-biodegradable compounds such as venlafaxine and its main metabolites. HRAP treatment with and without primary treatment did not yield significant differences in terms of PhACs removal efficiency. The implementation of HRAPs as secondary treatment is a feasible alternative to CAS in terms of overall wastewater treatment, including organic micropollutants, with generally higher removal performances and implying a green, low-cost and more sustainable technology.

AB The increase in the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in the environmental compartments is becoming emerging concern as it reflects their inefficient treatment in the wastewater treatment plants which are the main sources of these micropollutants. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed and frequently detected pain medications in wastewater treatment plants. A lab scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for seven months and acute inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on activated sludge was tested with respirometry. Culture amendment with different concentrations of NSAIDs in the presence as well as absence of nitrification inhibitor resulted in considerable variation in the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) profiles. The decrease in OUR and nitrate production rate governed with reduced heterotrophic and nitrification activity. The kinetics of half saturation for growth and maximum autotrophic growth rates are determined to be affected negatively by the acute impact of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals even at the environmentally relevant concentrations. High removal of tested NSAIDs was observed even for the first time introduce with these compounds.

AB Micropollutants cover a variety of compounds that mainly originate from the pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors. Even at trace concentrations, the discharge of micropollutants into water bodies pose a serious threat to the environment and human health. Their removal from wastewaters at treatment plants before their discharge into the environment has become one of the leading topics of research. Physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods have been listed in the literature for efficient removal of a variety of pollutants. In this study, seven micropollutants, namely 4-tert-octylphenol, atrazine, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, fluoxetine, estrone, penconazole, and di-n-octyl phthalate, are spiked into municipal simulated synthetic wastewater and treated by a laboratory-scale electrooxidation (EO) system using oxidized titanium and graphite electrode as anode and cathode, respectively. Sensitive determination of the selected micropollutants by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) before and after treatment is performed after their pre-concentration using an eco-friendly switchable solvent liquid-phase microextraction method (SSLPME). The pH value, applied current, and reaction period are optimized to enhance the removal efficiency of micropollutants. Results show that the highest removal efficiency of all micropollutants is obtained at pH 3, 20 min reaction period, and 3 A applied current. The operational costs are also investigated in this study.

AB Chemcatcher(R) and POCIS passive sampling devices are widely used for monitoring polar organic pollutants in water. Chemcatcher(R) uses a bound Horizon Atlantic (TM) HLB-L sorbent disk as receiving phase, whilst the POCIS uses the same material in the form of loose powder. Both devices (n = 3) were deployed for 21 days in the final effluent at three wastewater treatment plants in South Wales, UK. Following deployment, sampler extracts were analysed using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Compounds were identified using an in-house database of pharmaceuticals using a metabolomics workflow. Sixty-eight compounds were identified in all samplers. For the POCIS, substantial losses of sorbent (11-51%) were found during deployment and subsequent laboratory analysis, necessitating the use of a recovery factor. Percentage relative standard deviations varied (with 10 compounds exceeding 30% in both samplers) between individual compounds and between samplers deployed at the three sites. The relative performance of the two devices was evaluated using the mass of analyte sequestered, measured as an integrated peak area. The ratio of the uptake of the pharmaceuticals for the POCIS versus Chemcatcher(R) was lower (1.84x) than would be expected on the basis of the ratio of active sampling areas (3.01x) of the two devices. The lower than predicted uptake may be attributable to the loose sorbent material moving inside the POCIS when deployed in the field in the vertical plane. In order to overcome this, it is recommended to deploy the POCIS horizontally inside the deployment cage.

AB BACKGROUND In the last decade, many researchers demonstrated the biological activities of native Bombyx mori silk sericin (SS), and its use is widespread in the cosmetic and biomedical field. However, SS is a polluting material from the silk fibroin textile industry. This paper aims to demonstrate that the industrial wastewater-derived SS has many biological properties, and can be used as an eco-friendly product for cosmetic/pharmaceutical purposes with an important impact on the circular economy.
   RESULTS We focused on the SS derived from an ad hoc extraction process or industrial degumming wastewater. Both products were preserved with three different methods: lyophilization, spray-drying and sterilization. All SS were characterized in terms of amino acid content, molecular weight, physical-chemical properties, morphology and size distribution; then we evaluated the biological properties, the cytocompatibility/cytoprotective profile, and the immunomodulatory abilities of SS. Free radical scavenging, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-elastase activities of waste SS were confirmed. Waste and standard SS were cytocompatible on human fibroblasts; all SS samples inhibited the proliferation of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner. Waste SS showed a significant effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10 release.
   CONCLUSIONS These results pave the way for using textile wastewater-derived SS to obtain high-value-added products for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical purposes. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The objective of the presented paper is to characterize the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater during ozonation in laboratory-scale conditions. Almost 100 pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from different therapeutic classes were studied in effluent from the wastewater treatment plant, Devinska Nova Ves, used for ozonation. Telmisartan, diclofenac, and fexofenadine were found at the highest concentrations (1800 ng/dm(3), 680 ng/dm(3), and 620 ng/dm(3), respectively). The concentrations of another 13 pharmaceuticals and metabolites exceeded 100 ng/dm(3), and the rest of the compounds were below 100 ng/dm(3). These water samples underwent ozonation in intervals of 0-10 min. The flow of ozone during the test was 50 mg O-3/min. The results show that the removal of pharmaceuticals is significant after the first minute of ozonation, when most of the studied compounds were below the limit of quantification. The total concentration of the studied compounds after the first minute decreased to 190 ng/dm(3) (97.2% removal efficiency). More than 99% removal efficiency was achieved after 10 min of ozonation.

AB The palm (Elaeis guineensis), known as dende, is an important oleaginous Brazilian plant with a high performance of oil production. In this work, a 2(3) full experimental design was performed and the response surface method (RSM) was used to indicate the optimum parameter of caffeine adsorption on Elaeis guineensis endocarp activated carbon, since the endocarp is the main by-product from dende oil production. It was set the adsorbent point of zero charge (pH(pzc)), and the material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The RSM results indicate removal efficiency (%) at the optimal conditions, 0.20 g of adsorbent, and caffeine initial concentration of 20 mg/L, and acidic medium was about 95%. Based on ANOVA and F test (F-calculated > F-standard), the mathematical/statistical model obtained fits well to the experimental data. The overall kinetic studies showed time was achieved after 5 h and caffeine adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemisorption is a predominant mechanism. Redlich-Peterson and Sips models best represented the experimental data (0.967 < R-2 < 0.993). Thermodynamic revealed that caffeine adsorption was spontaneous at all temperatures studied, exothermic, and probably with changes in the adsorbate-adsorbent complex during the process. The tests conducted in different water matrixes corroborate the suitability of this adsorbent to be used in caffeine removal even in a complex solution.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are considered as emerging contaminants in the aquatic environments that are not easily eliminated by conventional treatment processes. In the present study, the photocatalytic oxidation of acetaminophen and codeine medicines under UV and solar irradiation was investigated in the aqueous solutions using a novel synthesized zeolite from stone cutting sludge as a support for TiO2 and ZnO. The effect of photocatalyst synthesis conditions including catalyst dose, mixing time, calcination time, and temperature on the efficiency of the pharmaceutical removal were optimized using Taguchi process optimization method. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, the BET surface area, and the Fourier transformation infrared. The results indicated that the performance of ZnO-zeolite for the removal of acetaminophen-codeine under UV and solar radiation with 58.7% and 45.7% was better than that of TiO2-zeolite with 44.3% and 39.2% efficiency, respectively. Removal efficiency under UV and solar radiation was comparable, suggesting that sunlight could be a promising source for treatment of contaminated water by acetaminophen and codeine using photocatalytic degradation. Regeneration of the prepared photocatalysts after 4 cycles revealed a slight decrease in their efficiency. Overall, photocatalytic degradation of the medicines in the water and wastewater using the ZnO-zeolite and TiO2-zeolite could be developed as an efficient treatment process.

AB Hyporheic zones are the water-saturated flow-through subsurfaces of rivers which are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple physical, biological, and chemical processes. Two factors playing a role in the hyporheic attenuation of organic contaminants are sediment bedforms (a major driver of hyporheic exchange) and the composition of the sediment microbial community. How these factors act on the diverse range of organic contaminants encountered downstream from wastewater treatment plants is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated dissipation half-lives (DT50s) of 31 substances (mainly pharmaceuticals) under different combinations of bacterial diversity and bedform-induced hyporheic flow using 20 recirculating flumes in a central composite face factorial design. By combining small-volume pore water sampling, targeted analysis, and suspect screening, along with quantitative real-time PCR and time-resolved amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we determined a comprehensive set of DT50s, associated bacterial communities, and microbial transformation products. The resulting DT50s of parent compounds ranged from 0.5 (fluoxetine) to 306 days (carbamazepine), with 20 substances responding significantly to bacterial diversity and four to both diversity and hyporheic flow. Bacterial taxa that were associated with biodegradation included Acidobacteria (groups 6, 17, and 22), Actinobacteria (Nocardioides and Illumatobacter), Bacteroidetes (Terrimonas and Flavobacterium) and diverse Proteobacteria (Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae). Notable were the formation of valsartan acid from irbesartan and valsartan, the persistence of N-desmethylvenlafaxine across all treatments, and the identification of biuret as a novel transformation product of metformin. Twelve additional target transformation products were identified, which were persistent in either pore or surface water of at least one treatment, indicating their environmental relevance.

AB 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) is one of the main compounds responsible for estrogenic activities in sewage and natural waters and has been found in these matrices all around the world, thereby justifying the development of technologies for its removal. In this work, pure or TiO2-containing molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) were prepared using E2 as template. The materials were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, adsorption/desorption of N-2, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization analyses showed that TiO2 was incorporated in the polymers and that all materials could be characterized as mesoporous and had surface areas ranging from 238 to 279 m(2)g(-1). Adsorption studies showed MIP-TiO2 had a high capacity to adsorb E2 from the water phase leading to q(max) values of 15.16 to 26.49 mg g(-1) at temperatures from 25 to 45 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process is endothermic, spontaneous, and entropically driven. The results also showed that the presence of TiO2 decreases the adsorption performance of MIP-TiO2 when compared with MIP (without the photocatalyst) during the adsorption. However, the application of MIP-TiO2 in a process of adsorption followed by photocatalysis resulted in 100% of E2 removal allowing the reuse of adsorbent. In addition, MIP-TiO2 maintained its E2 removal capacity even after five cycles of regeneration-reuse, which shows the ability of UV light to regenerate the specific adsorption sites. The results presented in this paper show MIP-TiO2 has potential to be applied in water treatment systems to remove E2.

AB In view of the valorisation of the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus biomass, it was used for the biosorption of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, namely salicylic acid and ibuprofen, from water. Microalgae biomass was characterized, namely by the determination of the point of zero charge (pH(PZC)), by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Kinetic and equilibrium batch experiments were carried out and results were found to fit the pseudo-second order equation and the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. The Langmuir maximum capacity determined for salicylic acid (63 mg g(-1)) was larger than for ibuprofen (12 mg g(-1)), which was also verified for a commercial activated carbon used as reference (with capacities of 250 and 147 mg g(-1), respectively). For both pharmaceuticals, the determination of thermodynamic parameters allowed us to infer that adsorption onto microalgae biomass was spontaneous, favourable and exothermic. Furthermore, based on the biomass characterization after adsorption and energy associated with the process, it was deduced that the removal of salicylic acid and ibuprofen by Scenedesmus obliquus biomass occurred by physical interaction.

AB Numerous substances from different chemical sectors, from the pharmaceutical industry to the many consumer products available for everyday usage, can find their way into water intended for human consumption and wastewater, and can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, the disinfection process is an essential stage in water and wastewater treatment plants to destroy pathogenic microorganisms but it can form degradation byproducts. Sodium hypochlorite is the most common disinfectant, but the most important drawback associated with this kind of compound is the generation of toxic disinfection byproducts. Many studies have been carried out to identify alternative disinfectants, and in the last few years, peracetic acid has been highlighted as a feasible solution, particularly in wastewater treatment. This study compares the transformations of five emerging pollutants (caffeine, tramadol, irbesartan, diclofenac, trazodone) treated with peracetic acid, to evaluate their degradation and the possible formation of byproducts with those obtained with sodium hypochlorite. Although peracetic acid has many advantages, including a wide field of use against microorganisms and a low toxicity towards animal and plant organisms, it is not as effective in the degradation of the considered pollutants. These ones are recovered substantially and are unchanged quantitatively, producing a very low number of byproducts.

AB Previous research has shown that unspiked OECD 309 tests can be used to quantify chemical biodegradation in surface waters, relying on chemical residues already present in the water. Here we test the hypothesis that unspiked OECD 309 tests can quantitatively predict chemical persistence in the environment by comparing chemical half-lives assessed in the laboratory against those measured in the field. The study object was a Swedish lake heavily impacted by treated municipal wastewater. Half-lives in the field were measured by mass balance over 12 weeks. In parallel, half-lives in the lab were determined with an unspiked OECD 309 test run for 60 days. Chemical analysis was conducted using a non-target screening approach. The field study yielded a half-life <100 days for 38 chemicals for which the dominant source was wastewater; 32 of these were also detected in the lab test, whereby 18 had half-lives with a well-constrained uncertainty that did not intersect infinity. For 14 of the 18 chemicals, the field and lab half-lives agreed within a factor 3. In summary, the lab test predicted chemical attenuation in the field well. Limitations of the approach include the need for measurable chemical concentrations in the water body and failure to account for some attenuation mechanisms like phototransformation.

AB Wastewaters (WW) are important sources for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) into the environment. Hospital WW (HWW) contain higher loads of micro-pollutants and AMR markers than urban WW (UWW). Little is known about the long-term dynamics of H and U WW and the impact of their joined treatment on the general burden of AMR. Here, we characterized the resistome, microbiota and eco-exposome signature of 126 H and U WW samples treated separately for three years, and then mixed, over one year. Multi-variate analysis and machine learning revealed a robust signature for each WW with no significant variation over time before mixing, and once mixed, both WW closely resembled Urban signatures. We demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and microbiota of H and U WW. Our results present considerable targets for AMR related risk assessment of WW.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges, including the need to provide a cost-effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater, as well as adapting to the effects of climate change. The horizontal levee is a multi-benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes. The wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise, while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent. To assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions, a 0.7-ha experimental system was studied over a two-year period. The removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology; rapid and near complete removal (>97%) of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface, whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal. Removal of Fthorn coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology, with up to 99% removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow. For phosphate, removal was not as sensitive to hydrology, but significant removal (>83%) was still observed when overland flow was eliminated. Although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations, parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows, which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings. Rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints (i.e., the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow) and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface.

AB The enzymatic factory of ligninolytic fungi has proven to be a powerful tool in applications regarding the degradation of various types of pollutants. The degradative potential of fungi is mainly due to the production of different types of oxidases, of which laccases is one of the most prominent enzymatic activities. In the present work, crude laccases from the supernatant of Pleurotus citrinopileatus cultures grown in olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW) were immobilized in crosslinked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), aiming at the development of biocatalysts suitable for the enzymatic treatment of OOMW. The preparation of laccase CLEAs was optimized, resulting in a maximum of 72% residual activity. The resulting CLEAs were shown to be more stable in the presence of solvents and at elevated temperatures compared to the soluble laccase preparation. The removal of the phenolic component of OOMW catalyzed by laccase-CLEAs exceeded 35%, while they were found to retain their activity for at least three cycles of repetitive use. The described CLEAs can be applied for the pretreatment of OOMW, prior to its use for valorization processes, and thus, facilitate its complete biodegradation towards a consolidated process in the context of circular economy.

AB The occurrence and persistence of pharmaceutical products (PPs) in the environment have recently been well-documented and are a major concern for public health. Their incidence in aquatic ecosystems is the result of their direct release without any prior treatment or insufficient wastewater treatment. Therefore, an efficient and safe posttreatment process for removing PPs must be developed. In this study, we focused on the ability of photocatalysis or combined photocatalysis and biodegradation to effectively and safely remove diclofenac (DCF) and its by-products from water. The heterogeneous photocatalysis system was based on bio-sourced activated carbon obtained from Argania spinosa tree nutshells and Degussa P25 titanium dioxide (ACP-TiO2), and biodegradation involved Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Toxicity tests were conducted with zebrafish embryos to evaluate the applicability of the treatment processes. The results showed that photocatalytic treatment with 0.1 mg/L of ACP-TiO2 9% for 7.5 h is sufficient to eliminate DCF (50 mg L-1) and its by-products from water. Low levels of malformation (<20%) were detected in zebrafish embryos treated with photocatalyzed DCF solutions at 1, 5, and 7 mg L-1 after 4 days of exposure. After 3 h of incubation, P. aeruginosa was found to reduce the toxicity of DCF (10 mg L-1) photocatalyzed for 2 and 4 h. Additional studies should be conducted to elucidate the biodegradation mechanism.

AB Widespread disposal of landfill leachate to municipal sewer infrastructure in the United States calls for an improved understanding of the relative organic-chemical contributions to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) waste stream and associated surface-water discharge to receptors in the environment. Landfill leachate, WWTP influent, and WWTP effluent samples were collected from three landfill-WWTP systems and compared with analogous influent and effluent samples from two WWTPs that did not receive leachate. Samples were analyzed for 73 per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 109 pharmaceuticals, and 21 hormones and related compounds. PFAS were detected more frequently in leachate (92%) than in influent (55%). Total PFAS concentrations in leachate (93 100 ng L-1) were more than 10 times higher than in influent (6950 ng L-1) and effluent samples (3730 ng L-1). Concentrations of bisphenol A; the nonprescription pharmaceuticals cotinine, lidocaine, nicotine; and the prescription pharmaceuticals amphetamine, carisoprodol, pentoxifylline, and thiabendazole were an order of magnitude higher in landfill leachate than WWTP influent. Leachate load contributions for PFAS (0.78 to 31 g d(-1)), bisphenol A (0.97 to 8.3 g d(-1)), and nonprescription (2.0 to 3.1 g d(-1)) and prescription (0.48 to 2.5 g d(-1)) pharmaceuticals to WWTP influent were generally low (<10 g d(-1)) for most compounds resulting from high influent-to-leachate volumetric ratios (0.983). No clear differences in concentrations were apparent between effluents from WWTPs receiving landfill leachate and those that did not receive landfill leachate.

AB With limited budgets, utilities may forego potable reuse of municipal wastewater to meet regulations requiring nitrate and contaminant removal from discharges. At 85% recovery, reverse osmosis (RO)-based potable reuse rejects contaminants into a concentrate flowrate that is 6.7-fold lower than wastewater discharges. This study evaluated the footprint and cost savings associated with treating nitrate and contaminants in RO concentrate vs. wastewater effluent. Pilot-scale ozone and biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment of RO concentrate provided design parameters needed for this comparison. Addition of 60 mg C per L methanol as a carbon source was needed to achieve complete denitrification of 70 mg N per L nitrate within a 30 min BAC empty bed contact time. Combined with pre-ozonation at 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC, this treatment removed >74% of fipronil, imidacloprid, atenolol, DEET and sulfamethoxazole. Estimates indicated that applying ozone/BAC treatment to RO concentrate rather than conventional wastewater effluent for contaminant removal prior to discharge would offset 60% of the footprint and 25% of the cost required for the RO-based potable reuse train. Considering these savings, the reuse train cost could be recouped if the product water were sold at rates below those current in southern California. These results suggest synergy rather than competition between potable reuse and contaminant removal.

AB Along with many other Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (PhACs), Diclofenac (DIC), Ibuprofen (IBU) and Paracetamol (PARA) are the most common type of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently reported in drinking and treated waters. Membranes can be used to inhibit the passage of micropollutants (Pharmaceuticals) into water that can be further reused. In this study, two types of loose nanofiltration membranes, that usually are applied for large molecular weight organics, were tested for the filtration of selected small molecular weight drugs from synthetic wastewater. Effect of pH on membrane efficiency showed that behavior of drugs altered with changing pH. Results showed impressive treatment of drugs in the order, DIC (99.7%) > IBU (81.2%) > PARA (49%) along with Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (95.3%) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (84%) removal. Interestingly, nanofiltration of wastewater containing IBU tablet increased to 90.2% as compared to pure drug (80.5%). Mixture of drugs showed decreased removal of DIC (23%) while removal rates for IBU and PARA increased to 17.1 and 67% respectively. Moderate to high rejection percentage was not due to the molecular sizes of the model drugs but hydrophobicity of drugs played role. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Binary solvent dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (BSDLLME) was combined with liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of selected drug active compounds with high accuracy and precision. Optimization studies for the extraction parameters were carried out to lower the detection limits of seven drug active compounds. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) values were calculated in the range of 0.01-6.1 and 0.05-20 ng mL(-1), respectively. Recovery studies were also carried out with wastewater matrix to check the applicability of the developed method. The percent recovery values ranged between 95-105 and 90-116% for 75 and 125 ng mL(-1) spiked samples, respectively. The recovery results obtained established the applicability of the developed method for the quantification of all analytes in the selected matrix. Thus, the developed method can be used for the simultaneous determination of analytes with high accuracy and precision.

AB The strain TN638 was isolated from Tunisian soil contaminated with industrial wastewater and selected for its potent antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC 6538 and Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) ATCCC 19117, and Gram negative bacteria: Agrobacterium turnefaciens (A. tumefaciens) ATCC 23308 and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) ATCC 14028 and fungi: Candida albicans (C. albicans) ATCC 10231, Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) ATCC 58938 and Fusarium sp. Solidestate fermentation (SSF) dry crude extract of the TN638 strain presents a strong inhibitory activity notably against the phytopathogenic microorganism A. turnefaciens ATCC 23308 and the two pathogenic bacteria S. aureus ATCC 6538 and L. monocytogenes ATCCC 19117 with a zone of inhibition of 48, 34 and 34 mm respectively. According to the morphological characteristic, the complete 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence determination [1492 bp deposited in National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database under the accession no. LN854629.1; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LN854629.1/] and the phylogenetic analysis, we can deduce that our isolate is an actinomycete bacterium belonging to the genus Streptomyces and the most closely related strain was Streptomyces cavourensis (S. cavourensis) NRRL 2740 T (99.9%). We propose the assignment of our strain as Streptomyces cavourensis (S. cavourensis) TN638 strain. Work-up and purification of the strain extract using different chromatographic techniques afforded seven bio-compounds namely: Cyclo(Leu-Pro) (1), Cyclo-(Val-Pro) (2), Cyclo-(Phe-Pro) (3), nonactin (4), monactin (5), dinactin (6) and trinactin (7). The chemical structures of compounds 1-7 were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1D and 2D spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and comparison with literature data. The three purified diketopiperazine (DKP) derivatives (1-3), demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against A. turnefaciens ATCC 23308 and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028. The four pure macrotetrolides (4-7), exhibited strong inhibitory effect against all tested Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria notably against A. tumefaciens ATCC 23308 and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) around 8 mu g/mL quite similar to that of ampicillin. Thus, we propose the use of the (SSF) active extract of the S. cavourensis TN638 strain as safe biological product to control disease caused by plant pathogen A. tumefaciens. Also, the purified active molecules produced by this strain could be used in pharmaceutical field.

AB Horizon scanning is a systematic approach increasingly used to explore emerging trends, issues, opportunities, and threats in conservation. We present the results from one such exercise aimed at identifying emerging issues that could have important scientific, social, technological, and managerial implications for the conservation of inland waters in Canada in the proximate future. We recognized six opportunities and nine challenges, for which we provide research implications and policy options, such that scientists, policy makers, and the Canadian society as a whole can prepare for a potential growth in each of the topic areas we identified. The issues spanned a broad range of topics, from recognizing the opportunities and challenges of community-enabled science and the need to consider the legal rights of nature, to the likely increase of pharmaceuticals in wastewater due to an aging population. These issues represent a first baseline that could help decision makers identify and prioritize efforts while simultaneously stimulate new research avenues. We hope our horizon scan will pave the way for similar exercises related to the conservation of biodiversity in Canada.

AB In this study, the visible-light-driven Z-scheme g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/rGO heterojunctions with 2D/2D/2D configurations are prepared via a facile, rapid and low temperature microwave-assisted method. The physicochemical properties and morphologies of these heterostructured photocatalysts are characterized by various spectroscopies such as XRD, XPS, TEM/SEM, PL, FT-IR, UV-Visible spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The prepared g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/3 wt% rGO photocatalysts (incorporated with optimal 3 wt% of rGO) possess ca. 86 and 98% of ibuprofen (IBF) photodegradation under the visible light (lambda > 420 nm) and solar light irradiation, respectively. The formation of well crystallized structure, morphology (nanoplates structure of Bi2WO6), higher visible light absorption and specific surface area (25.4 m(2) g(-1)) are responsible for the superior performance of g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/3 wt% rGO. Moreover, the larger interfacial contact (identified by HRTEM) between triple 2D g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/rGO heterostructures can lead to surpassing interfacial charge carrier dynamics and reduce the combination of electron-hole pairs. IBF photodegradation intermediates and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are further investigated by using LC-MS/MS, indicating the superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) are involved in the photodegradation of IBF and accordingly five intermediates are produced via three possible reaction pathways. The anti-hormonal effects of IBF and the photodegraded intermediate products are also evaluated by yeast-based bioassays. The results show that the intermediate products of photodegraded IBF have lower antagonistic effect on human hormone receptors than the pristine IBF.

AB A novel multifunctional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 (UiO = University of Oslo) was fabricated to adsorb pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) under near neutral conditions. We designed a wrinkle structure on the surface of UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 by seeded growth strategy. These wrinkles were composed of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and outermost UiO-66. It made the specific surface area of the MOFs increases, and provided multiple active sites for a representative pollutant salicylic acid (SA) adsorption. Moreover, lattice defects formed during secondary growth facilitating the coordination interaction between SA and the secondary building unit of UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 under near neutral conditions. These advantages made the adsorption capacity of per unit mass UiO-66 in UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 about 42% higher than that of the pristine UiO-66, and the removal rate of 1 mg L-1 SA reach 64.5% in real wastewater. Furthermore, magnetic Fe3O4 particles in the wrinkles exhibited outstanding magnetic separation performance. So that UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 can be effectively separated from the liquid media and regenerated after adsorption. The results show that the wrinkled MOFs could be used as an excellent candidate for SA adsorption in real wastewater. More importantly, this strategy could guide the preparation of different kind of MOFs to adsorb PPCPs in wastewater.

AB The discharge of effluent from the pharmaceutical industries is a major source of environmental pollution due to the toxic and at times carcinogenic nature of contaminants. The current work investigates the treatment of pharmaceutical industry effluent (PIE) using ultrasonic horn, operated individually and in combination with oxidants. Under controlled operating conditions, the effect of addition of hydrogen peroxide (ratio of COD of PIE: H2O2 varied over the range from 1:1 to 1:10), ozone (flow rate of 400 mg/h) and Fenton's reagent (FeSO4:H2O2 ratio of 3:5) was investigated as a possible process intensification strategy. The combined approach of ultrasound, ozone and CuO catalyst (0.3 g/L) as well as US + H2O2 + Ozone was also studied. The combined operation of US with H2O2 and Ozone resulted in a 73 % COD reduction, whereas the combination of the US, ozone and CuO catalyst gave maximum COD reduction of 92 %. The study also focused on identification of intermediate products formed during the PIE treatment. The component analysis of PIE before and after treatment was carried out by high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HR-LCMS). The research work has clearly established that cavitation in combination with other AOPs can be effectively used for the treatment of PIE with a significant increase in the extent of COD reduction for the combination approach.

AB Studies conducted globally have identified wastewater effluent as a key source of UV filters released into the aquatic environment. We assessed the annual release of UV filters from wastewater treatment plant effluent in Australia and evaluated the removal of these chemicals during wastewater treatment. Effluent samples were collected from 33 sites alongside matching influent samples. Sample collection predominately occurred during the Australian Census in August 2016, which allowed for accurate per capita normalisation of the results. A subset of sites was also sampled over the Southern Hemisphere summer (December-February) period. Five UV filters were detected with at least one detected in 95% of effluent samples. The summed concentration of UV filters ranged from 130 ng L-1 to 8400 ng L-1 and averaged 2800 (+/- 1900) ng L-1. Of the target UV filters, 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA) and benzophenone 4 (BP4) showed the lowest removal efficiencies (11 +/- 36% and 51 +/- 43%, respectively) across all sites and were the most abundant in effluent. Average estimated removal efficiencies of the other compounds were between 59 (+/- 24) % (4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC)) and 74 (+/- 22) % (benzophenone 1 (BP1)). We did not find a trend in seasonal differences in the per capita release of UV filters in effluent samples. We estimate that approximately 40% of UV filter loads measured in influent are breaking through to the effluent resulting in the release of approximately 20 kg day(-1) of the selected UV filters into the aquatic environment from treated wastewater effluent in Australia.

The adsorption characteristics of ACF were identified according to the kinetics, isotherm, pH, and ionic strength experiments. The results revealed that ACF can effectively remove these pharmaceuticals, and the adsorption capacities of CBZ, PRO, and DCF by ACF were 1.27 +/- 0.06, 1.07 +/- 0.08, and 0.95 +/- 0.08 mmol g(-1), respectively. Moreover, the adsorption of ACF for CBZ was independent of pH and ionic strength, whereas that of anionic diclofenac decreased at alkaline pHs and high concentrations of NaCl. Using a syringe system packed with ACF mat, the scavenging ability of intermittently generated secondary sewage was evaluated. As a result, the residual concentration of PRO and CBZ could not be even detected after consecutive 10 runs in secondary sewage mixture solution. This indicates ACF has the powerful potential for removing pharmaceutical micropollutants in the actual aqueous solutions. FTIR and XPS analyses showed that hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonding contributed to the adsorption process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water pollution by pharmaceuticals is a global issue and its remediation is important. To overcome this, we synthesised super hydrophobic nanoporous 3-dimensional ordered nanomaterials with multifunctional binding chemistry for highly efficient adsorption of estrogen (17 beta-estradiol). Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesised via Tours method and methoxylether polyethylene glycol (mPEG) was covalently introduced onto GO surface via facile amidation mild process to give GO-mPEG. GO-mPEG was anchored on nanoporous SBA-15 and homogenously reduced in-situ to SBA-rGO-mPEG. XRD analysis confirmed successful synthesis of SBA-15 and cross-linked GO/rGO-mPEG on SBA-15 surface. Image analysis revealed the architecture of SBA-15 as porous 3-dimensional silica network and presence of interwoven/crosslinked thin-films of GO-mPEG on SBA-15 surface. EDX mapping/elemental analysis showed expected elements were present. FTIR and textural analysis revealed the presence of different functional groups and high surface area as well as porosity, respectively. Optimal molar ratio experiments showed that 0.5SBA-rGO-mPEG had the highest sorption capacity. The relatively large surface area, 3-dimensional nanoprous silica structure and excess of polyamide/amido-carbonic functional groups on nanocomposites were suited for adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol. Equilibrium time was 30 min and effect of pH on adsorption was negligible. Sorption kinetic process of SBA-rGO-mPEG suited the pseudosecond-order model and equilibrium data fitted both Freundlich and Langmuir models. Qm values of 57.1, 78.5, 102.6 and 192.3 mg/g was recorded for SBA-GO, 0.1SBA-rGO-mPEG, 0.25SBA-rGO-mPEG and 0.5SBA-rGO-mPEG, respectively. H-bond, hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions were the sorption mechanism of SBA-rGO-mPEG after detailed analysis of data. Adsorbents was regenerated/re-used after 4 cycles with high remediation from environmental/real water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pollution of pharmaceuticals has attracted a lot of concerns during recent years. The goal of this study was to identify targets of ecological concern considering human use pharmaceuticals marketed in China. We constructed a database for 593 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) by collecting their information on use and emission (e.g. production, human excretion, and removal by wastewater treatment) to calculated predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) by using an adapted European Medicines Agency method. PECs were comparable to the reported measurements for most APIs, demonstrating that the adapted method is reliable for the prioritization practice. Then PECs were compared to toxicity thresholds of three aquatic taxa (algae, daphnia, and fish). As a result, a total of 31 APIs, which were potentially risky and should be taken into consideration in future studies, were identified. Three APIs would pose a high risk with risk quotient (RQ) greater than 10. Six APIs were identified with moderate risks (1 < RQ < 10), and four of them were not reported before: rifaximin, griseofulvin, amikacin, and niclosamide. Of the 22 APIs with low risks (0.1 < RQ < 1), 17 have never been monitored previously in China and even worldwide. This study has yielded some probable antibiotics that should be considered as monitoring targets in China in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phthalic acid esters (PAEs), especially dibutyl phthalate (DBP) pollution in the environment, have attracted worldwide attention. Four Phragmites australis-based, mesocosm-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) were operated for one year to study the removal efficiency and mechanisms of DBP in the reclaimed water. The average removal efficiencies for DBP were 93.77 +/- 3.27%, 94.9 +/- 2.60% and 97.0 +/- 3.00% in the VFCWs under HLRs of 0.33, 0.22 and 0.11 m/d, respectively. DBP can be accumulated and degraded by wetland plants and its concentration in the roots (0.256-8.45 mg/kg) were higher than in the leaves (0.243-0.482 mg/kg). The concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and phthalic acid (PA) were 0.142 -2.35 mg/kg and 0.113-0.545 mg/kg respectively in the plant tissues. The concentrations of DBP were 38.2-271 mu g/kg in the substrates. Mass balance for DBP indicates that the estimated plant uptake and substrate adsorption of total DBP is negligible. This suggests that biodegradation and other process are the primary pathways for DBP removal in VFCWs. The results of 16S rDNA and ITS rDNA high-throughput sequencing indicated that both bacterial and fungal community diversity decreased with the exposure of DBP. Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium and Curvularia genera may be the main participants in the biodegradation of DBP in the CWs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens, the alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid such as methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), butylparaben (BuP) are used as a preservative in food, personal care products (PCPs), and pharmaceuticals, due to their antimicrobial properties. Parabens are continuously released into the environment, during washout of PCPs, disposal of industrial waste from the pharmaceutical and paper industries. Parabens have been detected in the indoor dust, wastewater stream, surface water of rivers, and the marine system. Recent eco-toxicological data and the environmental presence of parabens, has raised concerns regarding the safety and health of environment/humans. Thus, to further understand the toxicity of parabens, the present study was carried out in the soil nematode and well established biological model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study, LC50 of MeP, EtP, PrP and BuP for 72 h exposures from L1 larva to adult stage was found to be 278.1, 217.8,169.2, and 131.88 mu g/ml, respectively. Further exposure to 1/5th of LC50 of parabens yielded an internal concentration ranging from 1.67 to 2.83 mu g/g dry weight of the organism. The toxicity of parabens on the survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction of the C. elegans was found in the order of BuP > PrP > EtP > MeP. Worms exposed to parabens show significant down-regulation of vitellogenin genes, high levels of reactive oxygen species and anti-oxidant transcripts, the latter being concordant with nuclear localization of DAF- 16 and up-regulation of HSF-1 and SKN-1/Nrf. Hence, parabens caused endocrine disruption, oxidative stress and toxicity in C elegans at environment relevant internal concentration of parabens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and potential sources of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters from a large coastal city Qingdao, North China, were investigated. Forty-five compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that 28 compounds of PPCPs were detected. The most frequently detected compounds were atrazine, clarithromycin, nonylphenol, and bisphenol A with the detection rates > 90%. Paracetamol showed the highest concentration up to 4400 ng/L (mean 152.5 ng/L), followed by ampicillin (max. 2980 ng/L) with the highest mean concentration (229.3 ng/L), iopromide (max. 1744 ng/L, mean 74.5 ng/L), atrazine (max. 1612 ng/L, mean 96.1 ng/L), and bisphenol A (max. 1384 ng/L, mean 78.3 ng/L). The contamination levels and composition profiles of PPCPs along the rivers flowing through rural and urban areas and in seawater showed large spatial variability. Typical source markers and principle component analysis were used to track and differentiate the potential PPCP sources. The emphases of the study were the influence of animal farming in rural areas on PPCP composition profiles and the ecological risk. The results indicated that PPCPs in Qingdao surface water mainly came from three potential sources, i.e., treated wastewater (effluents from WWTPs), untreated wastewater, and nonpoint sources in agricultural areas.

AB The use of pharmaceutical drugs has systematically increased, resulting in their environmental presence and exertion of effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Diclofenac (DCF) is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug, frequently found in the aquatic compartment. The present work analyzed the ecotoxicological effects of DCF in the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor and in the marine fish Solea senegalensis. In addition, the putative toxic effects of DCF along a simulated food chain were studied, by feeding individuals of S. senegalensis with H. diversicolor previously exposed to DCF. Biomarkers of anti-oxidant defense (catalase, CAT), phase II metabolism (glutathione S-transferases, GSTs) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) were quantified. The obtained results demonstrated that DCF did not affect CAT activity in organisms of both species directly exposed through the water, suggesting the absence of oxidative effects. In addition, organisms directly or indirectly exposed to DCF showed an increase of GSTs activities, suggesting an additional challenge to the metabolism of the exposed individuals. However, significant decreases in the activities of CAT and AChE were observed in fish fed with worms previously exposed to DCF. These data suggest that direct or indirect exposure to DCF may cause significant physiological modifications in aquatic organisms. In addition, exposure of wild organisms via contaminated food may lead to toxicological effects which may differ from alterations elicited by direct exposure. Such toxicological differences, between direct (waterborne) and trophic (via contaminated feed) exposures were qualitatively distinct, and need to be fully addressed when considering the consequences of environmental contamination by therapeutic drugs.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical classes worldwide. They have reached the focus as environmental pollutants in the current scientific research, due to their potential risks to aquatic organisms even in the lower ng L-1 range. The objective of this study was to determine the kinetic behavior of selected GCs and to identify their main transformation products (TPs) in lab scaled biodegradation experiments. Therefore, we analyzed the removal of 13 GCs in aerated incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a German municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as inoculum. For all steroids, an exponential decrease of the concentrations was observed, which was modelled by pseudo-first order kinetics. Overall, the rate constants k(biol )ranged from 0.07 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1) (triamcinolone acetonide) to 250 L g(ss)(-1)d(-1) (prednisolone). These results emphasize the broad variation in the biodegradability and recalcitrance of certain GCs. The selection of the studied GCs enabled a deduction of microbiological stability related to functional groups. Based on the identified TPs, a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated. Moreover, the identified TPs are characterized by an intact steroid core structure. Thus residual endocrine activity cannot be ruled out. The main observed reactions were regioselective hydrogenation of carbon double-bonds, degradation of the steroid C17 side-chain, ester hydrolysis and oxidative hydroxylation. In total, 41 TPs were tentatively identified and 22 of them were unambiguously confirmed via reference standards. Additionally, 12 TPs were detected in the effluents of municipal WWTPs and, to the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of eight of these TPs has been shown for the first time. These TPs might significantly contribute to the detected residual endocrine activities in the aquatic environments. Therefore, there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies, in particular for persistent steroid hormones with elevated potencies. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence of chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) was investigated in treated wastewater intended for reuse in agriculture. An agarose hydrogel diffusion-based passive sampler was exposed to the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Cyprus, which is equipped with membrane bioreactor (MBR). Passive samplers in triplicate were exposed according to a time-series exposure plan with maximum exposure duration of 28 days. Composite flow-proportional wastewater samples were collected in parallel with the passive sampling exposure plan and were processed by solid phase extraction using HORIZON SPE-DEX 4790 and the same sorbent material (Oasis HLB) as in the passive sampler. The analysis of passive samplers and wastewater samples enabled (i) the field-scale calibration of the passive sampler prototype by the calculation of in situ sampling rates of target substances, and (ii) the investigation of in silico predicted transformation products of the four most ecotoxicologically hazardous antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin). Additionally, the wastewater samples were subjected to the analysis of seven preselected antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile resistant element (int1). All extracts were analyzed for chemicals in a single batch using a highly sensitive method for pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and illicit drugs by liquid chromatography tandem MS/MS (LC-QQQ) and for various other target compounds (2316 compounds in total) by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). 279 CECs and all investigated ARGs (except for bla(CTX-M-32)) were detected, highlighting potential chemical and biological hazards related to wastewater reuse practices. 16 CECs were prioritized following ecotoxicological risk assessment, whereas sul1 and the mobile resistant element (int1) showed the highest abundance. Comprehensive monitoring efforts using novel sampling methods such as passive sampling, wide-scope target screening and molecular analysis are required to assure safe application of wastewater reuse and avoid spread and crop uptake of potentially hazardous chemicals.

AB For the first time, the operational feasibility of the solar photo-Fenton process at neutral pH in continuous flow has been tested for three consecutive days. The aim of the treatment was to remove of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from wastewater treatment plant secondary effluents. To this end, a 5 cm-deep raceway pond reactor was run in continuous flow mode and the degradation of the CECs present in real secondary effluents was monitored at their natural concentrations. To keep dissolved iron at neutral pH, ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) was used to form the complex Fe(III):EDDS as an iron source for the photo-Fenton reactions. At pilot scale the effects of the Fe(III):EDDS molar ratio (1:1 and 1:2) and hydraulic residence time (HRT) (20 and 40 min) on CEC removal were studied. The best operating condition was 20 min of HRT, giving rise to a treatment capacity of 900 L m(-2) d(-1), with CEC removal percentages of around 60%. The reactant concentrations were 0.1 mM Fe(III):EDDS at a 1:1 M ratio and 0.88 mM H2O2. Under these operating conditions, the short-term stability of the process was also demonstrated, thus pointing out the potential of this solar technology as a tertiary treatment.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria have been used in this study for zirconia nanoparticles synthesis through green technology for adsorption driven bioremediation of tetracycline from wastewater. The characterization of synthesized nano zirconia has been performed by employing dynamic light scattering, field emission-transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and point of zero charge analysis. The zirconia nanoparticles have shown average particle size similar to 15 nm, monoclinic and tetragonal crystal structure with 6.41 nm of crystallite size, the presence of elemental zirconium and oxygen, and the occurrence of functional groups like 0-Zr-OH, Zr-O-Zr and Zr-O bonds. The zirconia nanoparticles mediated adsorption of tetracycline has been found to be effective at solution pH 6.0 and in a very less contact time 15 min. Strong electrostatic interaction between zwitterionic form of tetracycline and protonated surface of zirconia nanoparticles is the governing adsorption mechanism in this study. The kinetic study has been performed on the basis of the tetracycline adsorption process revealing that the adsorption phenomenon follows pseudo-second order kinetic, further suggesting chemisorption of tetracycline over zirconia nanoparticles. The Langmuir isotherm model has been found to be the best fitted model among the all isotherm models indicating the involvement of monolayer uptake of tetracycline on the surface of zirconia nanoparticles. Moreover, the maximum tetracycline adsorption capacity of zirconia nanoparticles calculated by the Langmuir isotherm model is close to 526.32 mg/g. This finding is quite reasonable to accept that zirconia nanoparticle may be used as an alternative adsorbent to mitigate the tetracycline contamination in wastewater.

AB Population growth and deteriorating health issues have led to an increase in the consumption of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan (LOR), for treating high blood pressure and, as a result, to the frequent detection of these drugs in water and wastewater. The present study focuses on the oxidation of LOR by UV photolysis, UV(/Fe2+)-activated persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) systems. The effects of operating parameters including pH value, reaction time, concentration of oxidant and activator on the efficacy of treatment were studied. The target compound degradation by direct UV photolysis, UV/PS and UV/H(2)O(2)systems proved to be efficient and followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The application of UV/oxidant systems even at lower PS or H(2)O(2)concentrations resulted in more than 95% of LOR degradation in 10 min. In addition, the use of UV/Fe2+-activated oxidant systems led to a further increase in the !c o b s by improving the LOR oxidation in aqueous solution. The effectiveness of LOR mineralization based on total organic carbon (TOC) removal was also considered. The optimized results of the studied systems obtained in ultrapure water were used in groundwater to assess the effectiveness of LOR decomposition in more complex environmental matrix. Moreover, the acute toxicity of LOR solutions before and after the UV/Fe2+-activated PS and H2O2 oxidation to luminous bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) was investigated.

A synthesized Co-based perovskite (LaCoO3) was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in order to degrade CBZ. Results showed that LaCoO3 exhibited an excellent performance in PMS activation and CBZ degradation at neutral pH, with low cobalt leaching. The results of FT-IR and XPS verified the high structurally and chemically stability of LaCoO3 in PMS activation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis suggested the generation of radical species, such as sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Radical quenching experiments further revealed the responsibility of SO4 center dot- as the dominant oxidant for CBZ oxidation. Ten products were detected via the oxidation of CBZ, with the olefinic double bond attacked by SO4- as the initial step. Hydroxylation, hydrolysis, cyclization and dehydration were involved along the transformation of CBZ. The toxicity of CBZ solution was significantly reduced after treating by PMS/LaCoO3.

AB In the present work we compared the biological activity of DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF as molecules of most biodegradation pathways of DCF and selected transformation products (2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 2,6-dichloroaniline) which are produced during AOPs, such as ozonation and UV/H2O2. We also examined the interaction of DCF with chlorogenic acid (CGA). CGA is commonly used in human diet and entering the environment along with waste mainly from the processing and brewing of coffee and it can be toxic for microorganisms included in activated sludge. In the present experiment the evaluation of following parameters was performed: E. coli K-12 cells viability, growth inhibition of E. coli K-12 culture, LC50 and mortality of Chironomus aprilinus, genotoxicity, sodA promoter induction and ROS generation. In addition the reactivity of E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strain in wastewater matrices was measured. The results showed the influence of DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF on E. coli K-12 cells viability and bacteria growth, comparable to AOPs by-products. The highest toxicity was observed for selected, tested AOPs by-products, in comparison to the DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF. Genotoxicity assay indicated that 2,6-dichloroaniline (AOPs by-product) had the highest toxic effect. The oxidative stress assays revealed that the highest level of ROS generation and sodA promoter induction were obtained for DCF, 4'-OHDCF and 5-OHDCF, compared to other tested compounds. We have also found that there is an interaction between chlorogenic acid and DCF, which resulted in increased toxicity of the mixture of the both compounds to E. coli K-12, comparable to parent chemicals. The strongest response of E. coli SM biosensor strain with recA:luxCDABE genetic construct in filtered treated wastewaters, comparable to control sample was noticed. It indicates, that E. coli SM recA:luxCDABE biosensor strains is a good tool for bacteria monitoring in wastewater environment. Due to toxicity and biological activity of tested DCF transformation products, there is a need to use additional wastewater treatment systems for wastewater contaminated with pharmaceutical residues.

AB In this study, a lab-scale multiple draft tubes airlift loop membrane bioreactor (Mt-ALMBR) was used for treating acidic 7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) wastewater under different pHs (3.54-6.20) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (48 h, 36 h, 24 h and 16 h). During about 200 days operation, under HRT of 48 h and pH condition about 6.0, the optimum average COD and BOD5 removal rates were reach to 84.4 +/- 2.1% and 94.9 +/- 0.8%, and the highest 7-ACA removal rate also observed as 77.6%. Biodegradation, membrane rejection, hydrolysis and sludge adsorption were the four main pathways of 7-ACA removal. With the increase of pH, biodegradation, membrane rejection and hydrolysis had significant positive impacts on 7-ACA removal, while adsorption had a negative impact. Moreover, mathematical models for 7-ACA removal rate and pH were calculated to guide the operation of Mt-ALMBR. Biodegradation was the main pathway to remove 7-ACA when pH was > 4.17.

AB Production of sustainable clean energy can be achieved by co-pyrolysis of agricultural residues and wastewater sludge. Herein, non-additive thermal behaviour of co-pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge and ginkgo biloba leaf residues was investigated. Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis was not obvious at elevated temperatures. Further, kinetics of co-pyrolysis was studied by fitting Coats-Redfern integration method to thermogravimetric (TG) curve. The change of heat and mass transfer in the reactor caused the change of dynamic parameters. Moreover, hybrid particle swarm optimization and gradient boosting decision tree (PSO-GBDT) algorithm was designed to boost the energy production at full-scale pyrolysis plant by monitoring TG curves. PSO-GBDT model well predicts mass loss rate of the mixture at different heating rates confirming that co-pyrolysis of PS and GBLR can results in high energy production by increasing PS pyrolysis. Designing PSO-GBDT model help to reduced waste production by resourceful treatment of waste in to energy.

AB Dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the water environment has become an increasing concern. There have been many reports on ARGs in surface water, but little is known about ARGs in groundwater. In this study, we investigated the profiles and abundance of ARGs in groundwater in comparison with those in surface water of Maozhou River using high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR). Totally 127 ARGs and 10 MGEs were detected by HT-qPCR, and among them the sulfonamides, multidrug and aminoglycosides resistance genes were the dominant ARG types. According to the results of HT-qPCR, 18 frequently detected ARGs conferring resistance to 6 classes of antibiotics and 3 MGEs were further quantified by qPCR in the wet season and dry season. The absolute abundance ranged from 1.23 x 10(5) to 8.89 x 10(6) copies/mL in wet season and from 8.50 x 10(2) to 2.65 x 10-(6) copies/mL in the dry season, with suit and sul2 being the most abundant ARGs. The absolute abundance of ARGs and MGEs has no significant difference between the wet season and dry season while the diversity of ARGs in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season (p < 0.05). Totally 141 and 150 ARGs were detected in the water and sediments of Maozhou River, respectively. A total of 116 ARGs were shared among the groundwater, river water, and sediment, which accounted for 67.1% of all detected genes. Redundancy analysis further demonstrated that the environmental factors contributed 70.7% of the total ARG variations. The findings of large shared ARGs, abundant Total Coliforms and large wastewater burden in the groundwater provide a clear evidence that anthropogenic activities had a significant impact on groundwater.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) contains a large number of pathogenic microorganisms; therefore disinfection is an indispensable unit for its treatment. This study compared the formation and formation potential of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and assessed the variations of acute toxicity for both of first physical treatment effluent (FPTE) and second biological treatment effluent (SBTE) of HWW under five different disinfection processes, including free chlorine (Cl-2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), ozone (O-3), ultraviolet (UV) and ultraviolet/chlorine (UV/Cl-2). Firstly, the optimal parameters of each disinfection process for FPTE and SBTE were determined respectively based on the required disinfection efficiency (i.e., controlling the concentration of fecal coliforms). The amounts of total DBPs in different disinfection processes under the optimal disinfectants dosage followed the order of Cl-2 > UV/Cl-2 > ClO2 > UV approximate to O-3, which demonstrated that the amount of DBPs formation was closely related to the dosage of chlorine. Meanwhile, the amounts of total disinfection by-products formation potential (DBPFP) under the optimal disinfectants dosage followed the order of UV/Cl-2 > UV approximate to Cl-2 > O-3 > ClO2. Besides, it was found that with the reduction of chlorine dosage, the formed DBPs in UV/Cl-2 disinfection process decreased. However, UV/Cl-2 disinfection process might degrade organic compounds into more DBPs precursors, leading to higher DBPFP than that in Cl-2 disinfection process. Significantly, some specific DBPFPs such as haloketones-FP (HKFP), chloral hydrate-FP (CHFP) and tri-chloronitromethane-FP (TCNMFP) in O-3 disinfection process were found higher than that in Cl-2 disinfection process, which could be attributed to the formation of O-3 oxidation by-products, for instance aldehydes, methyl ketones and trivalent nitrogen compounds. Additionally, apart from O-3, the growth inhibition rate of Chlorella vulgaris increased in all the other disinfection processes and the order of the acute toxicity in each disinfected effluent was consistent with that of DBPs formation.

AB Since bacterial consortia involved in conventional wastewater treatment processes are not efficient in removing diclofenac (DCF), an emerging pollutant frequently detected in water bodies, the identification of microorganisms able to metabolise this pharmaceutical compound is relevant. Thus, DCF removal was investigated using bacteria isolated from aqueous stock solutions of this micropollutant and identified as Bacillus and Brevibacillus species using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A 100% DCF removal was achieved after 17 hours of experiment at 20 degrees C in a nutrient medium; the biodegradation kinetic followed a pseudo-first order (k(biol) = 11 L center dot g(SS)(-1)center dot d(-1)). Quantitative assessment of DCF removal showed that its main route was biotic degradation. The main degradation product of DCF, 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac (4 '-OH-DCF), was identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry. Since the ecotoxicological impact of 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac was not reported in the literature, the ecotoxicity of DCF and its metabolite were tentatively evaluated using Vibrio fischeri bioassays. Results from these tests showed that this metabolite is not more toxic than its parent compound and may hopefully be an intermediate product in the DCF transformation. Indeed, no significant difference in ecotoxicity was observed after 30 min between DCF (50 should be writtten in subscript all along the manuscript in EC50 = 23 +/- 4 mg center dot L-1) and 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac (EC50 = 19 +/- 2 mg center dot L-1). Besides, the study highlighted a limit of the Microtox (R) bioassay, which is largely used to assess ecotoxicity. The bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri was impacted due to the production of microbial activity and the occurrence of some carbon source in the studied medium.

AB Activated carbon (AC) and activated biochar (ABC) are widely used as sorbents for micropollutant removal during water and wastewater treatment. Spent adsorbents can be treated in several ways, e.g., by incineration, disposal in landfills, or reactivation. Regeneration is an attractive and potentially more economically viable alternative to modern post-treatment practices. Current strategies for assessing the performance of regeneration techniques often involve only repeated adsorption and regeneration cycles, and rarely involve direct measurements of micropollutants remaining on the adsorbent after regeneration. However, the use of regenerated adsorbents containing such residual micropollutants could present an environmental risk. In this study, the extraction of eight active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) commonly found in treated effluents was evaluated using 10 solvents and sorption onto three different carbon materials. An optimized extraction method was developed involving ultrasonication in 1:1 methanol:dichloromethane with 5% formic acid. This method achieved recoveries of 60 to 99% per API for an API concentration of 2 mu g/g char and 27 to 129% per API for an API concentration of 1 mg/g char. Experiments using a mixture of 82 common APIs revealed that the optimized protocol achieved extraction recoveries above 70% for 29 of these APIs. These results show that the new extraction method could be a useful tool for assessing the regenerative properties of different carbon sorbents.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a recalcitrant pharmaceutical often detected in wastewater and in the environment. CBZ can be removed from wastewater through advanced oxidation treatment methods such as ozonation. In this study, CBZ and its transformation product 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) were ozonated, and the formation and transformation of their ozonation products were investigated using liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The main products, 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM) and BQD were quantified using isolated standards and LC-UV. Of the original CBZ concentration, 74% was transformed into BQM and 83% of BQM was further transformed into BQD. Both products are more stable than CBZ and could still be detected after 240 min of ozonation. Another major product, 2,2 '-azanediyldibenzaldehyde (TP225) was for the first time identified using NMR. Twelve further CBZ products were identified.

AB This study compares the performance of several ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), in combination with filtration, in terms of trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal efficiency and energy and cost requirement. It was shown that the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) scavenging rate of the secondary wastewater effluent decreased as a result of an additional pretreatment step, leading to an increase of ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures at the same ozone dose. Adding filtration such as sand filtration or granular activated carbon filtration (GACF) as a pretreatment increased the removal efficiency of TrOCs by all tested ozone-based AOPs and reduced the minimum effective ozone dose for TrOC elimination. When the applied ozone dose is more than this minimum effective ozone dose, the elimination of TrOCs can be observed. For example, because of the use of anion resin filtration, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol elimination contributed by the process of ozone-based AOP increased from 34.6 to 42.1% at an ozone dose of 1.0 g O-3/g dissolved organic carbon. Ozone-based AOPs coupled with filtration as a pretreatment were found to be more cost-efficient than the single AOPs at all ozone dose levels. The energy consumption of ozone-based AOPs was decreased by more than 25% when applying GACF as a pretreatment. In comparison with other filtration techniques, the pretreatment of secondary effluents by GACF before ozonation was proven to be the most cost-effective method for TrOC elimination.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; POLLUTION; MARKETS; SYSTEM
AB Background China's industrial wastewater pollution control policy urgently needs to change from government enforcement to market economy incentive, especially in regions with mature market economic conditions and improved legislative basis like Yangtze River Delta. The economic principles of Water Emissions Trading policy are to achieve a win-win situation in which pollution could be controlled meanwhile abatement costs are minimized. Existing regulations lack rules and restrictions for cross-industrial wastewater emission trading, nevertheless not all wastewater from various industrial sectors are suitable for emissions trading with each other. This study attempted to determine tradable levels of wastewater emissions rights within the selected 10 industries based on the similarity of wastewater composition. Results The result is presented in a tradable level matrix. It shows that of all industrial wastewater, the most suitable for emissions trading are, respectively, Textile and Paper Production, Manufacture of General Purpose Machinery and Manufacture of Transport, and then Chemistry Production and Pharmaceuticals. Conclusion Generally, this paper provides a systematic calculation method according to the similarity analysis to formulate cross-industrial wastewater emissions trading for policy reference. At the end of the article, a rationality analysis of the domestic wastewater emissions trading pilot programs was made. Even though the current wastewater emissions trading situation is not up to expectations, individual enterprises actively achieved emission reductions to play as the supply sides in the wastewater emissions trading under economic incentive from such a policy.

AB Background The anti-diabetic pharmaceutical metformin is frequently analysed in the aquatic environment. Its impact on the fish microbiome is studied to get a deeper knowledge about the consequence of the metformin presence in river systems. Gut microbiome analyses were performed on larval brown trout with metformin including environmental concentrations. Therefore, the fish were exposed to metformin in concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L. Especially, the lower metformin concentrations were measured in river waters containing percentages of conditioned wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Results Two complementary molecular biological methods for population analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene regions V1-V3, i.e.: (1) 16S amplicon sequencing and (2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both analyses demonstrated significant microbiome alterations even at low metformin concentrations being analysed in German rivers. The amplicon sequencing revealed the most distinct shifts in the Firmicutes phylum, or more specifically, within the Bacillales order, which were most affected by metformin exposure. Within the Bacillales order, the Planococcaceae family, which is described to provide essential amino acids for the fish, completely disappeared after metformin treatment. Conversely, the percentage of other bacteria, such as Staphylococcaceae, increased after exposure to metformin. Similarity profiles of the microbiomes could be generated using the Sorensen index calculation after PCR-DGGE analyses and confirmed shifts in the composition of the brown trout intestinal microbiome after metformin exposures. In vitro gene expression analyses of virulence factors from fish pathogens, previously identified in the fish microbiomes DNA extracts, were conducted in the presence or absence of environmentally relevant concentrations. Here, marker genes of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila were detected and quantified via PCR approaches, firstly. An increased expression of the species-specific virulence genes was observed after normalisation with control data and ribosomal housekeeping genes. Conclusion Environmentally relevant concentrations of metformin can alter the composition in gut microbiome of brown trout in different ways. Both, the metformin-induced expression of virulence genes in fish pathogens in vitro and the impact of metformin on the microbiome composition in vivo in larval brown trout open the discussion about a possible long-term effect on the vitality, growth, and development in more mature brown trouts.

AB Chlorination is a common disinfection method in water treatment. This method can be converted into an advanced oxidation process by incorporating UV irradiation during water treatment. This study investigated the degradation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) by chlorination and UV/chlorination in water. HCTZ is a diuretic medication that has been frequently detected in wastewater. For chlorination, the second-order rate constant for the reaction between HCTZ with free available chlorine was found to increase with increasing pH from 5 to 8 due to the increase of the anionic HCTZ fraction. UV/chlorination was found to be more efficient in removing HCTZ as compared with chlorination due to the presence of reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radicals. For transformation by-products, chlorination was found to produce two by-products via chlorination and hydroxylation reactions that occurred at the aromatic ring of HCTZ. For UV/chlorination, an additional by-product formed through a radical reaction at the heterocyclic moiety of HCTZ was detected. Based on the Escherichia coli inhibition study, chlorination and UV/chlorination were found to increase the toxicity of the HCTZ solution. This result indicated that even UV/chlorination showed higher effectiveness in removing HCTZ; however, it also has the potential to generate toxic by-products and effluent. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is a membrane technology that separates dissolved species from water. RO has been applied for the removal of chemical contaminants from water and is employed in wastewater reclamation to provide an additional barrier to improve the removal of trace organic contaminants. The presence of a wide variety of influent chemical contaminants and the insufficient rejection of low molecular weight neutral chemicals by RO calls for the need to develop a comprehensive model that predicts the rejection of various chemicals in RO. Yet the role of the interaction between neutral organic compounds and a RO membrane, and how the functional groups of organic compounds affect the interaction have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we first constructed a molecular model for a reference polyamide (PA) membrane. We then investigated the impact of explicit water molecules and PA membrane functionality on the membrane structure using quantum mechanical calculations. We examined solvent-membrane interactions and then solvent-membrane-solute interactions using two neutral test solutes, arsenic and boron, by comparing the theoretically calculated aqueous-phase free energies of interaction with their experimental values. Finally, the validated PA membrane model was used to calculate the free energies of interaction for a wide variety of organic compounds such as haloalkanes, haloalkenes, alkylbenzenes and halobenzenes, which correlated with the experimentally obtained mass transfer coefficients. The correlation indicates that the interaction between organic compounds and PA membranes plays a critical role in the rejection mechanism.

AB The uncontrolled release of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals into the environment is a worldwide increasing problem. Thus, highly efficient treatment technologies for wastewater are urgently needed. In this work, seven kinds of typical antibiotics (including water and alcohol soluble ones) are successfully separated from the corresponding aqueous and ethanolic solutions using highly regular laminated membranes. Our membranes are assembled with 2-4 mu m titanium carbide nanosheets. The solvent permeance through such titanium carbide membrane is one order of magnitude higher than that through most polymeric nanofiltration membranes with similar antibiotics rejection. This high flux is due to the regular two-dimensional (2D) structure resulting from the large aspect ratio of titanium carbide nanosheets. Moreover, the electrostatic interaction between the surface terminations and the antibiotics also affects the rejection and enhances the antifouling property. Such 2D titanium carbide membranes further broaden the application scope of laminated materials for separation and purification of high value added drugs in academia and industry.

AB Air-liquid exchange process could spread pathogens and pharmaceutical emerging pollutants into the air as aerosol particles in an Urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs). These particles can later be transported to places where such pollution is unforeseen. In this study, measurements were conducted in the aeration area of a UWTP in northern Taiwan. According to this investigation, nanoparticles are major contributors to both the number and volume concentration of particles. Most fluorescent particles may be bacterial aggregates or fungal species. Moreover, nine common emerging contaminants were analyzed and found in both air and water samples. Among these contaminants, the most abundant chemicals in the air were erythromycin-H2O (191.45 pg/m(3)) and methamphetamine (39.02 pg/m(3)). These results imply that UWTPs could be an emission source of emerging contaminants and bioaerosols, and the potential risk of inhalation exposure should be carefully evaluated.

AB Pharmaceuticals in water have adverse effects on aquatic environment. Anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation coupled to dissimilatory manganese(Mn) (IV)- or iron(Fe) (III)-oxides reduction is potentially efficient but unexplored. In this study, batch experiments were performed using different Mn(IV) and Fe(III) species with a microbial inoculum pre-cultivated with 15 mM chemically-synthesized Mn(IV) and 10 mg L-1 metoprolol. Results show 26% caffeine and 52% naproxen are degraded with Mn(IV) as terminal electron acceptor and insignificant biodegradation for other pharmaceuticals tested. Reduction of Mn(IV) from drinking water treatment is coupled to anaerobic biodegradation of metoprolol and propranolol, resulting in removal efficiencies of 96% and 31%, respectively. The results indicate that adsorption contributes to the pharmaceutical removal during the first 10 days of incubation, while biodegradation is the main removal mechanism in the whole period. Fe(III) can also be used as electron acceptor in anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation. Over half of the added metoprolol is degraded with both chemically-synthesized Fe(III) and Fe(III)-citrate as terminal electron acceptors. However, this process did not occur when using Fe(III) from drinking water treatment or Fe(III)-based sorbents. This study indicates that anaerobic pharmaceutical biodegradation coupled to dissimilatory Mn(IV) or Fe(III) reduction is possible, and promising for application to cleaning wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB This work aims to control foaming in a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) by optimizing the organic loading rate (OLR) and sludge retention time (SRT) values to decrease the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production used for the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Four lab-scale SMBRs were operated for a period of more than 8 months to determine the biokinetic coefficients and optimize the SMBR systems operation under the SRT of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 days and OLRs of 0.03-0.32 gCOD/L.day. The investigation revealed that the lowest foaming quantity was at an organic loading rate of 0.32 gCOD/L.day and a sludge retention time of 15 days related to few protein concentration of EPS. The results also showed that the foaming quality at the OLR of 0.03 gCOD/L.day was higher compared to the greater OLRs in all SRTs. It was found that the yield (Y), the endogenous decay coefficient (k(d)), the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), and the saturation constant (K-s) of four SMBRs were in the range of 0.073-0.310 mg/mg, 0.985-3.119 day(-1), 1.249-3.672 day-1, and 2.63-106.671-232.55 mg/mg, 1-3.156 day mgCOD/L, respectively. Furthermore, the most appropriate operating condition to activated sludge among the SMBRs was the OLR of 0.1 gCOD/L.day and SRT of 15 days. Under these optimum conditions, a 92.8 % COD removal efficiency and 3.708 1/day mu(max) were achieved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as one of the reservoirs of antibiotics. Although nitrifying bacteria have been reported to be capable of degrading various antibiotics, there are very few studies investigating long-term effects of antibiotics on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria. In this study, cephalexin (CFX) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) were selected to assess chronic impacts on nitrifying sludge with stepwise increasing concentrations in two independent bioreactors. The results showed that CFX and SDZ at an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge, as evidenced by removal efficiencies of more than 88% and 85%, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) made a major contribution to the biodegradation of CFX and SDZ via cometabolism, compared to limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nitriteoxidizing bacteria. Chronic exposure to CFX (>= 30 mu g/L) could stimulate ammonium oxidation activity in terms of a significant enhancement of ammonium oxidation rate (p < 0.01). In contrast, the ammonium oxidation activity was inhibited due to exposure to 30 mu g/L SDZ (p < 0.01), then it recovered after long-term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 AWL SDZ. In addition, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of AOB decreased distinctly from 23.8% to 28.8% in the control phase (without CFX or SDZ) to 14.2% and 10.8% under exposure to 100 mu g/L CFX and SDZ, respectively. However, the expression level of amoA gene was up-regulated to overcome this adverse impact and maintain a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and antibiotics. The findings in this study shed a light on chronic effects of antibiotic exposure on kinetic and microbial responses of enriched nitrifying sludge in WWTPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) consisting of natural and synthetic estrogens, namely estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was quantified in wastewater samples. The aim of this study was to assess the removal efficiency for the selected estrogens (E-1, E-2, E-3 and EE2) and reduction of estrogenic activity in wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using different processes. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were used to quantify the selected estrogens in wastewater samples. Estrogenic activity was assessed using the T47D-KBluc gene reporter assay. Results revealed a decrease in estrogen concentrations observed in the effluents of all the WWTPs, except for E-2 at Daspoort where no removal was noted. In general, the highest removal for total estrogens was observed at Phola (84%) combining three processes (AP, BF and wetland). The AS at Daspoort had a highest removal of 75% for E3; while at Zeekoegat the highest removal reached 61% for EE2. The PST at Daspoort had no removal recorded for all the compounds, except for the EE2 (33%). The AP and BF systems at Phola contributed to a higher removal of selected compounds. Downstream of the wetland at Phola no removal was recorded for E-3; while the highest removal reached 61% for E-1. The best performance in terms of the overall influent-to-effluent removal efficiency was observed at Phola WWTP, where E-1 removal of 85% was recorded.
   The highest estrogenic activity in the effluent was reported at Phola, with an average estradiol equivalent (EEQ) value of 6.3 +/- 6.7 ng/L. However, no anti-estrogenic activity was detected in any of the samples. The daily mass load discharged from the effluent of the three WWTPs was higher for E-1 recorded at Zeekoegat (8002.3 +/- 6416.3 mg/d), followed by Daspoort (3509.8 +/- 849.0 mg/d) and finally Phola (176.1 +/- 34.9).

AB Sewage sludge handling is becoming a concern in Europe due to its increasing amount and the presence of contaminants, such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Currently, over 70% of sludge in Europe is treated thermally by incineration or used as fertilizer in agriculture. New thermochemical methods are under development and are expected to be implemented in the near future. This paper considers the life cycle environmental impacts of the following five alternatives for sludge handling, taking into account the presence of heavy metals and PPCPs: i) agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge; ii) agricultural application of composted sludge; iii) incineration; iv) pyrolysis; and v) wet air oxidation. The results suggest that anaerobic digestion with recovery of nutrients and electricity has the lowest environmental impacts in 11 out of 18 categories considered. For the mean to maximum resource recovery, composting is the worst alternative, followed by pyrolysis with lower recovery rates. Agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge has the highest freshwater ecotoxicity due to heavy metals, unless their concentration is in the lowest range, as found in some European sewage sludge applied on land. Therefore, stricter control of heavy metals in the sludge is needed for this option to limit freshwater ecotoxicity to the levels comparable with the thermal processes. The results also indicate that PPCPs have a negligible contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity when compared to heavy metals in the anaerobically digested sludge. Since thermal processes are currently drawing attention due to their potential benefits, the findings of this work suggest that their adoption is environmentally beneficial only if high resource recovery rates can be achieved.

AB The widespread overuse of antibiotics has led to the serious risks human life and environmental sustainability. Even though porous carbon composite derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) has been recognized as an efficient adsorbent for sequestering antibiotics owing to its unique properties, the major drawback is the use of the expensive material, such as terephthalic acid (H2BDC), as an organic ligand, thus weakening its cost effectiveness and practical applicability. Herein, we successfully recovered H2BDC from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste bottles via ultrasound-assisted, phase-transfer-catalyzed alkaline hydrolysis under mild conditions. The process conditions were statistically optimized by applying response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design. As results, 99.91-100% H2BDC recovery was achieved under the following optimized conditions: NaOH concentration = 14.5%; temperature = 83.2 degrees C; and time = 1.5 h. High-purity H2BDC was used as an organic ligand in the synthesis of magnetic porous carbon (alpha-Fe/Fe3C) composite derived from iron-based MOF, and its utilization as an adsorbent for the removal of TCH from aqueous solution was investigated. The as-prepared alpha-Fe/Fe3C composite comprised alpha-Fe, Fe3C, and graphitic carbon and exhibited mesoporous structure and superparamagnetic behavior, resulting in an effective adsorption performance and magnetic separation. Its adsorption properties were examined in terms of solution pH, contact time, initial TCH concentration, and temperature. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm data were well-suited to the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, respectively. Considering its excellent reusability and magnetic separability, the alpha-Fe/Fe3C composite showed immense potential for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater remediation.

AB This manuscript aimed to identify the energy demand, and environmental aspects and impacts of crop fertilisation with human urine when compared to using mineral fertilisers. The Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment methods were adopted covering the options from "cradle to grave". The fertilisation with human urine included the collection, storage, transportation, application and field emissions, while the fertilisation with mineral fertilisers included primary production of fertilisers, transportation, application and field emissions. The reference flows were based on the fertilisation of 1 ha of maize with 225 kg of nitrogen, 29 kg of phosphorus and 48 kg of potassium oxide. We analysed the environmental aspects such as nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, energy demand and water depletion, as well as environmental impacts such as global warming, human toxicity, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, water scarcity and resource depletion. The agricultural fertilisation with full volume of human urine closer to the source presented smaller energy demand and environmental impact indicator values when compared to solid mineral fertiliser, despite the uncertainties. The fertilisation with human urine was more advantageous with transportation distances up to 134 km (energy demand) and 84 km (environmental categories) by truck compared to 1841 km of mineral fertiliser. Ammonia volatilisation control was key to reduce acidification and eutrophication indicator values. When considering additional gains such as the reduction of water demand and wastewater generation from a waterless collection of human urine, the indicator values of environmental aspects and impacts of fertilisation with human urine were smaller than those with mineral fertiliser and reached a break-even point of 193 km (energy demand) and 185 km (environmental categories). The nutrient cycling through resource-based sanitation offers an opportunity to expand sanitation access with smaller environmental impacts and more efficient water-energy-nutrient nexus.

AB Many water and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are fitted with a UV system that provides post treatment disinfection before the water is released to receiving water. This paper presents a study on expected removal for the pharmaceutical venlafaxine (VEN) in a typical UV unit at a municipal WWTP with analysis of removal rates of an advanced oxidation process using UV irradiation with injection of H2O2. The study is supported by bench scale degradation experiments on VEN. Results demonstrated that UV can completely degrade VEN, but the addition of H2O2 increased pseudo first order rate constant by up to 2.5 times. Extrapolations of the lab data indicated that removal rates of VEN at the UV disinfection unit of a typical municipal WWTP are approximately 0.4% at standard operating conditions. With the addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2, degradation of VEN can be increased by ten times over existing UV treatment. By studying the impact of adjusting parameters such as UV intensity, UV dosage, and H2O2 dosage, a framework is set to allow researchers and engineers to move forward with developing UV/H2O2 systems that meet their future design needs for pharmaceutical removal.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are a major source of human pharmaceutical residues (PR) in the aquatic environment, which are considered to be of emerging concern. The microalga Chlamydomonas acidophila has shown to be a promising technology to recover the nutrients from wastewater and therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of this species to also remove PRs commonly present in wastewaters (atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, lidocaine, propranolol and simvastatin). Batch assays were carried out (50 mL, 90 rpm, 43 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), 22 degrees C) comprising the wastewater with the pharmaceutical mixture M three concentrations: CHigh, CModerate and CEnv. The results demonstrated that this microalga does not seem to be affected by pharmaceuticals in wastewater M concentrations well above those detected in urban effluents; additionally it is able to degrade the antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin better than other microalgae species and enhances their removal from wastewater by 93-65 % and 64-50 %, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibited a high assimilation of ammonium and phosphates reaching values of around 9 mgNH(4)L(-1)d(-1) and 3 mgPO(4)L(-1) d(-1) compared to other species. Therefore, Chlamydomonas acidophila appears to be a promising agent for urban wastewater treatment.

AB Alterations occurring in the effluent organic matter (EfOM) during ozonation could be detrimental depending on the final application of the treated effluent. In this work, the fate of EfOM in different ozonized wastewaters was assessed through the monitoring of general water quality parameters and organic fractions determined through size-exclusion chromatography combined with organic carbon detection (SEC-OCD) analysis. These different components of EfOM were distinguished based on relative molecular weights and assigned to fractions named as biopolymers, humic substances, building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals and acids. The significant abatement (60-90%) of an ozone-refractory micropollutant (MP) was employed as reference to simulate potential scenarios in which also the presence of these species is wanted to be attenuated. Ultraviolet absorbance at 254 rim (UVA(254)) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions ranged from 40 to 80% and from 10 to 45%, respectively, for ozone doses between 0.6 and 1.0 mM, depending on the organic matter content (both dissolved and suspended) and alkalinity of the effluents. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis showed 21-27% reductions in Membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluents, whereas for conventional activated sludge (CAS) samples this value increased (6-35%) during the oxidative treatment. This was attributed to the continuous solubilization of humic substances, according to SEC-OCD results. Moreover, accumulation of lower molecular weight fractions such as building blocks or acids was observed in all the tested effluents, and attributed to the breakdown of largest EfOM fractions, mainly humic substances. Relationships proposed in this work between humic substances evolution, water quality (UVA(254)) and process parameters (immediate ozone demand (IOD), IOD-normalized hydroxyl radical exposure (integral[(OH)-O-center dot]dt/IOD) and transferred ozone dose (TOD)) might be useful for EfOM variations estimations along ozonation.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) has been solely employed for the removal of charged ions from water, showing limited feasibility compared to other conventional technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO). In this work, we propose to use CDI with activated carbon electrodes for simultaneous removal of inorganic salt and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs). This approach is based on the inherent sorption potential of activated carbon CDI electrodes towards organic species. We show that salt removal by CDI is only slightly affected by the presence of different TOrCs (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, estrone, and phentoxifylline). Sorption and removal of TOrCs (taking place concomitantly) was most effective for the hydrophobic compounds (bisphenol A and estrone) and was not affected by the presence of salt or the applied electric field. Sequential desorption of salt and TOrCs into two separated streams was achieved by short-circuiting the two electrodes and washing the electrodes with water and ethanol, respectively. Notably, the described process produces separate waste streams for salts (i.e., water) and organics (i.e, ethanol), which can facilitate their disposal or further treatment. Altogether, the study shows the high potential of the proposed CDI application, which may be valuable for treating water or wastewater streams contaminated with both salt and TOrCs.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are potentially effective for the removal of antibiotics, yet the inherent process and mechanism of antibiotic removal remain insufficiently elucidated. This study investigated the removals of eight antibiotics (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, roxithromycin) from domestic sewage in CWs of different flow types, substrates, plants, and hydraulic loading rates in two seasons. The results showed that the CWs performed efficiently for treating antibiotic contaminated urban wastewater. Flow type deciding redox condition is the domain factor of antibiotic removal through affecting methanogenic degradation. Photolysis is significant in half-substrate systems during summer with exposure to strong sunlight, while adsorption is noteworthy in full-substrate systems during winter with cold weather. Furthermore, plant presence may limit the anaerobic processes of antibiotics via radial oxygen loss. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Densely populated countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh, arc considered to be major contributors to the increased occurrence of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Several factors make low-and middle-income countries vulnerable to increased emergence and spread of AMR in the environment including, limited regulations on antimicrobial drug use, high volume of antimicrobials used in human medicine and agricultural production, and poor wastewater management. Previous monitoring campaigns to investigate the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment have employed targeted analysis in which selected antibiotics are measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). However, this approach can miss several important contaminants that can contribute to the selective pressure that promotes maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Nontarget analysis by suspect screening and reanalysis of stored digital data of previously ran samples can provide information on analytes that were formerly uncharacterized and may be chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). In this study, surface waters in both urban and rural sites in Bangladesh were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibiotic residues and other pharmaceuticals. Utilizing targeted analysis, the antibiotics with the highest concentrations detected were ciprofloxacin (1407 ng/L) and clarithromycin (909 ng/L). In addition, using high-resolution LC/MS/MS in the first ever application of retrospective analysis in samples from Bangladesh, additional antibiotics clindamycin, lincomycin, linezolid, metroniclazole, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, and sulfapyridine were detected. Prevalence of amoxicillin transformation products in surface waters was also confirmed. In addition, medicinal and agricultural antifungal compounds were frequently found in Bangladeshi surface waters. This later finding - the near ubiquity of antifungal agents in environmental samples - is of particular concern, as it may be contributing to the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant fungal (e.g. Candida auris) disease recently seen in humans throughout the world.

AB Triclosan (TCS), an emerging contaminant linked to antimicrobial resistance, has been the focus of many surface water studies to date. However, these initial studies have predominantly used sampling locations downstream of large volume (i.e., >0.5 million gallons per day) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This approach overlooks potential inputs from their low volume counterparts as well as non-point sources, such as sewage network leaks, biosolid application to agricultural fields and leach fields associated with septic systems. Here we examine the range of concentrations, overall loading, and potential controls on TCS delivery to the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek (EBBC), a rural to suburban watershed located in southeastern Pennsylvania. TCS measurements were collected from 13 locations in the EBBC during baseflow conditions and immediately following a storm event. A regulatory database review identified WWTP density an order of magnitude greater than the national average, thereby confirming their pervasiveness in rural to urban systems. Detectable concentrations of TCS in the EBBC ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ng/L during baseflow conditions and 0.5 to over 1000 ng/L following a storm event. The lack of a statistical relationship between TCS concentrations and yields with the number of upstream WWTPs and/or volume of treated effluent during both sampling periods confirm the importance of individual WWTP practices and the volume of the receiving water body, while a positive statistically-significant relationship between TCS concentrations and upstream developed open space following the storm event was likely influenced by runoff of spray-applied treated wastewater and/or sewage network leaks. Furthermore, the presence of detectable concentrations of TCS in sub-watersheds with no WWTP systems implies field applied biosolids or treated wastewater, as well as septic tank related leach fields are all viable sources of TCS. These findings suggest we must greatly expand our consideration of sources for emerging contaminants in waterways. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, many studies highlighted the consistent finding of irbesartan in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in some rivers and lakes in both Europe and North America, suggesting that no >80% can be removed by specific treatments. The present investigation attempts to study the chemical fate of irbesartan in a simulated chlorination step, mimicking the conditions of a WWTP. A total of six disinfection by-products were identified, five were completely new, and separated on a C-18 column by employing a gradient HPLC method. Initially, a complete mass fragmentation pathway of the drug was established with the help of MS/TOF, and subsequently, the disinfection by-products were subjected to MS/TOF mass studies to obtain their mass and fragment pattern. The MS results helped to assign tentative structures to the disinfection products, which were verified through 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The chemical structures of the new compounds have been justified by a proposed mechanism of formation. A preliminary ecotoxicity assessment with the crustacean Daphnia rnagna showed that some of the identified by-products were up to 12-times more toxic than rbesartan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 27 pharmaceuticals with diverse physicochemical properties in a year-long monitoring campaign in the Chaobai River, China. The correlation between the distribution of pharmaceuticals in the river and the adjacent sources was elucidated. The results indicate that the agriculture area was the most polluted area with a median summed pharmaceutical concentration of 225.3 ng L-1, followed by the urban area and the mountain area with the corresponding values of 136.9 and 29.9 ng L-1, respectively. In terms of individual compounds, 22 out of 27 compounds were detected with concentrations ranging from <1 to 1972 ng L-1. Caffeine, carbamazepine, azithromycin, bezafibrate, metoprolol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and trimethoprim were pharmaceuticals with relatively high levels, with median concentrations ranging from 3.3 to 25.6 ng L-1 and detection frequencies ranging from 40% to 97%. Higher concentrations were mainly observed during cold seasons, with mean concentrations 1 to 52 times as high as those during warm seasons. Spatial analysis reveals that the pharmaceutical concentrations in different areas were impacted by different sources. A wastewater treatment plant was an important source in the urban area, while the agriculture area was impacted by various treated and untreated wastewater sources. The species sensitivity distribution model and risk quotient (RQ) method were combined in the ecological risk assessment. The results indicate that the multi-substance potentially affected fraction (msPAF) values of the sampling sites were below 0.04%, whereas nearly half of RQ values were higher than 1. Caffeine was proposed as a priority compound due to its high contribution rate (i.e., 79%) to the cumulative msPAF value, which implies that increased control and management of untreated wastewater sources along the Chaobai River is necessary.

AB Antibiotics used for human and veterinary purposes are released into the environment, resulting in potential adverse effects, including the development and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Here we investigated the dynamic fate of 36 antibiotics in a large river basin Dongjiang in South China, and discussed their potential antibiotic resistance selection risk. Based on the usage, excretion rate, wastewater treatment rate, human population and animal numbers the emissions of 36 frequently detected antibiotics were estimated for the Dongjiang River Basin. The total usage of the 36 antibiotics in the basin was 623.4 tons, which included 37% for human use and the rest for veterinary purposes. After being metabolized and partially treated, the amount of antibiotics excreted and released into the environment decreased to 267.6 tons. By allocating the high-precision antibiotic discharge inventory to 42 sewage plants and 17 livestock farms, an improved GREAT-ER (Geography referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for European Rivers) model for the Dongjiang River Basin, with a well calibration river flow network based on the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), was established to simulate the dynamic fate of 36 antibiotics. The simulation results showed that antibiotics contaminated >50% of the river sections. The modelled concentrations in water were almost within an order of magnitude of the measured concentrations. Antibiotic contamination in the dry season was obviously higher than that in the wet season. The concentrations of the antibiotics were always higher at the discharge zones and lower reaches of the river basin than the other reaches. The antibiotic resistance risk assessment showed that 23 out of the 36 antibiotics (nearly 65%) could pose high risks in the river basin. For those river reaches with high risks, the risk levels could mostly be reduced to low risk levels with a certain distance (15 km) from the pollution source. Therefore, more attention should be paid to those impact zones in term of antibiotic resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oceans are the ultimate sink for many of the over 100 million man-made substances. Until now, monitoring was limited to a reduced number of targeted persistent organic pollutants, reaching open waters mainly via atmospheric deposition. However, the composition and fate of the thousands of pollutants reaching the marine environment though wastewater discharges from coastal sources remain largely unexplored. By combining a newly developed nontarget screening (NTS) workflow and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), we have identified over 500 sewage-derived contaminants occurring in the ocean. Samples from the NE Atlantic contained this anthropogenic imprint at distances over SO km from the coastline and >500 m depth, beyond the continental margin. The range of identified compounds spans from pharmaceuticals and personal care products to food additives and industrial chemicals, including several that have never been reported in the environment, as they escaped conventional targeted analytical methods. Predicting the effects of the continuous input of this chemical "cocktail" on marine ecosystems is a formidable challenge, since 40% of the detected compounds lack information regarding their use and ecotoxicity.

AB Some artificial sweeteners (ASs) are used in pig feeds, although little is known on this regard. An investigation was conducted by determining seven common ASs in pig feed, manure, wastewater, compost, and soil from 16 pig farms in Tianjin, China. Saccharin (SAC) was predominant in feed (1.41-326 mg/kg) and manure samples (1.06-401 mg/kg). The annual mass loads of ASs in pig feeds were estimated at 5.69-119, 4.92-149, and 1.29-35 kg per 10(3) piglets, hogs, and sows, respectively. The annual emission of ASs via biowaste (i.e., manure) was estimated at 3.58-85.2, 0.04-26.2, and 0.08-9.97 kg per 10 3 capita for the three dominant ASs, i.e., SAC, neotame (NEO), and cyclamate (CYC). On a global scale, SAC was also widely detected at concentrations of 0.01-326 mg/kg in pig feed from China, Switzerland, Japan, Chile, and the United States, suggesting the worldwide use of ASs in pig feed. NEO and CYC were found in 41% and 30% of the feed samples, respectively, at concentrations of 0.05-70 mg/kg, whereas other ASs were barely found with rather lower concentrations. The annual mass loads of ASs consumed via pig feed consumption were estimated at 2400 tons worldwide. Thus, pig farming is an important source of ASs to the environment.

AB This study presents a nontarget approach to detect discharges from pharmaceutical production in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and to estimate their relevance on the total emissions. Daily composite samples were collected for 3 months at two WWTPs in Switzerland, measured using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, and time series were generated for all features detected. The extent of intensity variation in the time series was used to differentiate relatively constant domestic inputs from highly fluctuating industrial emissions. We show that an intensity variation threshold of 10 correctly classifies compounds of known origin and reveals clear differences between the two WWTPs. At the WWTP receiving wastewater from a pharmaceutical manufacturing site, (i) 10 times as many potential industrial emissions were detected as compared to the WWTP receiving purely domestic wastewater; (ii) for 11 pharmaceuticals peak concentrations, >10 mu g/L and up to 214 mu g/L were quantified, which are clearly above typical municipal wastewater concentrations; and (iii) a pharmaceutical not authorized in Switzerland was identified. Signatures of potential industrial emissions were even traceable at the downstream Rhine monitoring station at a >4000-fold dilution. Several of them occurred repeatedly, suggesting that they were linked to regular production, not to accidents. Our results demonstrate that small wastewater volumes from a single industry not only left a clear signature in the effluents of the respective WWTP but also influenced the water quality of one of Europe's most important river systems. Overall, these findings indicate that pharmaceutical production is a relevant emission source even in highly developed countries with a strong focus on water quality, such as Switzerland.

AB The biological effects of endocrine-active compounds and increasing water temperatures as a result of climate change have been studied extensively and independently, but there is a dearth of research to examine the combined effect of these factors on exposed organisms. Recent data suggest that estrogenic exposure and rising ambient temperatures independently impact predator-prey relationships. However, establishing these connections in natural settings is complex. These obstacles can be circumvented if biomarkers of estrogenic exposure in resident fish can predict changes in predator-prey relationships. To test the effects of estrone and temperature, the piscivore bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) was exposed for 30 days to estrone at concentrations (90 +/- 17.6 ng/L [mean +/- standard deviation] and 414 +/- 146 ng/L) previously shown to reduce prey-capture success. Exposures were conducted at four temperatures (15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C) to simulate breeding season ambient temperatures across the natural range of this species. A suite of morphological and physiological biomarkers previously linked to estrogenic exposures were examined. Biomarkers of estrone exposure were more commonly and severely impacted in male fish than in female fish. Notably, the gonadosomatic index was lower and gonads were less mature in exposed males. Additionally, temperature modulated the effects of estrone similarly in males and females with fish exposed at higher temperatures typically exhibiting a decreased morphological index. This study provides evidence that alterations in hepatic function and gonadal function may cause shifts in metabolism and energy allocation that may lead to declining prey capture performance.

AB In this work the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction technique (DLLME) is presented as an important alternative to the classical extraction methods and was used to extract and concentrate estrogens' before its quantification by HPLC in environmental water samples. For the evaluation of the analytical methodology, the following conditions were used: sample volume 8 mL, extraction solvent 200 mu L of chlorobenzene, and dispersive solvent 2000 mu L of acetone. The enrichment factor (EF) was 140 for estrone, 202 for 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 199 for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Limit of detection was 20 ng L-1 for E1, 3.1 ng L-1 for E2, and 2.7 ng L-1 for EE2. Repeatability and intermediate reproducibility presented values of relative standard deviation lower than 10%. Finally, recovery tests were performed to evaluate the water matrices' effects on the extraction performance, resulting in recoveries between 76 and 110% in surface water and between 84 and 109% in wastewater.

AB Wastewater treatment plants in large urban agglomerations are worldwide among the main sources of emerging contaminants in aquatic systems. The present study is a first comprehensive characterization of potentially harmful emerging contaminants in sewage of a Chinese urban area. The study area Haikou City is located at the coast of tropical Hainan Island. A GC/MS based non-target screening approach for the identification of a wider range of lipophilic to semi-polar organic sewage constituents was applied. Pollution originating from sewage was tracked in the urban coastal waters by using selected source-specific indicators.
   A set of sewage constituents with a high structural diversity was identified comprising both, industrial and household chemicals. Ingredients of personal care products, pesticides and pharmaceuticals were found, that were rarely reported from other regions of the world. This observation might be attributed to different environmental legislation and consumption habits in China. Exceptionally high concentrations of the illegal drug ketamine with up to 1100 ng L-1 were detected, suggesting its high popularity and consumption rate. Noteworthy, sewage constituents reported here for the first time were the pharmaceuticals marmesin, oxolamine and ansimar also with high concentrations of up to 1200 ng L-1.
   Elevated concentrations of sewage indicators in the main city area suggest the overflow of the sewage system, in particular in the period of a typhoon event. Tracing the sewage contamination in the surface water system of the coastal urban area of Haikou revealed a lower level of pollution. The concentration ranges point to no acute risks for the coastal ecosystem due to sewage inputs from the city area.
   Generally, the detected spectrum of municipal emerging contaminants has to be considered for the testing and technical improvement of wastewater treatment techniques, for regular monitoring of the surface water quality and for environmental impact assessment in China. Furthermore, the compound spectrum reported here is a good reference point for the composition of municipal sewage in other emerging economies.

AB In recent years, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) for the treatment of industrial wastewaters (IWWs) has been repeatedly proposed. However, despite the number of tests reported in literature, only a few of them were conducted on real IWWs. In this study, real pharmaceutical IWWs showing an intense recalcitrant color were treated by PEC and H2O2-assisted PEC (UV/TiO2/Bias and UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias, respectively) on TiO2 meshes having sub-micrometric features obtained by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation. Photolysis (UV), chemical oxidation (H2O2) and H2O2-assisted photolysis (UV/H2O2) were tested in the same reactor for comparison. The configuration UV/H2O2/TiO2/bias showed the best results in term of decolorization efficiency and rate, where decolorization was 55 % (single-step H2O2 dosing) and 44 % (three-step H2O2 dosing), after 2 h of contact time. In the same contact time, UV and UV/TiO2/Bias processes did not give decolorization. A more effective COD removal was measured for the PEC processes, UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias (-24 %) and UV/TiO2/Bias (-20 %), while COD removal by UV was almost 0 %. Correspondingly, the SOUR values showed that PEC combined with a single-step H2O2 dosage was the most effective configuration, leading to the highest biodegradability of the treated IWW with respect to the other processes. The energy consumption analysis demonstrated that PEC+ H2O2 (single-step dosage) optimized energy costs.

AB This study presents the development and validation of a comprehensive quantitative target methodology for the analysis of 2316 emerging pollutants in water based on Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q-ToF-HRMS/MS). Target compounds include pesticides, pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, industrial chemicals, doping compounds, surfactants and transformation products, among others. The method was validated for 195 analytes, chosen to be representative of the chemical space of the target list, enabling the assessment of the performance of the method. The method involves a generic sample preparation based on mixed mode solid phase extraction, a UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS screening method using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode, which provides MS and MS/MS spectra simultaneously and an elaborate strong post-acquisition evaluation of the data. The processing method was optimized to provide a successful identification rate > 95 % and to minimize the number of false positive results (< 5 %). Decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) were also introduced in the validation scheme to provide more realistic metrics on the performance of a HRMS-based wide-scope screening method. A new system of identification points (IPs) based on the one described in the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC was applied to communicate the confidence level in the identification of the analytes. This system considers retention time, mass accuracy, isotopic fit and fragmentation; taking full advantage of the capacities of the HRMS instruments. Finally, 398 contaminants were detected and quantified in real wastewater.

AB Dissipation potential of four algae viz. Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris was investigated against ten antibiotics (sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamonomethoxine, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, lomefloxacin, levofloxacin and flumequine) in a series of synthetic wastewater batch culture experiments, maintained at 20, 50 and 100 mu g L-1 initial concentration levels and incubated over a period of 40 days. Generally, the antibiotic removal was achieved with overall dissipation percentage (%) varying among the algal species and different antibiotics. Biodegradation was the major antibiotic removal mechanism from the dissolved fraction, with minor contributions of bioadsorption, bioaccumulation, and abiotic factors. The antibiotics dissipation followed the pseudo-first-order-kinetics with the fastest antibiotic degradation rate achieved by H. pluvialis. The Monod kinetics was successfully applied to explain the relationship between the algal growth and the removal of antibiotics and nutrients in the batch cultures. S. capricornutum and C. vulgaris showed more affinity for the macrolides and fluoroquinolones than sulfonamides, while, H. pluvialis and S. quadiricauda showed relatively higher preference for sulfonamides than the other antibiotic groups. A total of 10 transformation products were identified and the transformation pathway was proposed, accordingly. Most of the transformation products had lower toxicity compared with their parent antibiotics.

AB Lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases E.C. 3.1.1.3) are enzymes produced by mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria that catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols into glycerol and fatty acids. Lipases are versatile in lipid biotechnology due to their selective properties, which have been applied in recent years in emulsifiers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, flavors, fragrances, as well as for the pretreatment of lipid-rich wastewater, the bioremediation of oils and biodiesel synthesis. This review offers information collected over the last 10 years on lipase sources as well as advances in production, purification strategies and the main applications in industry.

AB The presence of antibiotics in the environment can threaten the ecosystem. The current work was an aim to degrade the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) antibiotic from the aqueous solution and hospital wastewater by the photo-Fenton process. The experiments were carried out in a quartz reactor and effects of operational parameters such as pH, H2O2:Fe2+ ratio, reaction time, and SMX antibiotic concentration were evaluated. After optimizing the parameters, the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process was tested for eliminating SMX from the hospital wastewater. The optimal conditions for SMX removal by the photo-Fenton process were obtained at pH 3, H2O2:Fe2+ ratio of 11:2, the initial SMX concentration of 25 mg/L, and the reaction time of 15 min. At optimized conditions, the removal efficiency of the SMX and chemical oxygen demand was attained 98.06% and 87.65%, respectively. The efficiency of the photo-Fenton system for removing SMX antibiotics from the hospital wastewater was obtained 67.42%. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model was well fitted the data for SMX removal using the photo-Fenton process. Accordingly, the photo-Fenton process is an effective method for removing SMX antibiotics from aqueous solutions and hospital wastewaters.

AB This work focuses on applying supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) for eliminating residues of pharmaceutical, endocrine-disruptor and pesticide species from the reject of reverse-osmosis-treated secondary municipal wastewater. SCWO, a well-known treatment method for organic sludge and highly concentrated wastewaters, has not yet been investigated with reverse osmosis (RO) retentates of municipal secondary effluents. The results shown here, focusing on batch SCWO of municipal effluent RO retentate spiked with emerging pollutants, demonstrate the potential of utilizing this single advanced-oxidation generic treatment to fully-mineralize the vast variety of organic species encountered in municipal wastewater effluents, while at the same time lowering its total organic carbon concentration by up to 99%. The chosen model pollutants (carbamazepine and 17 beta-Estradiol both in synthetic solution and within a real effluent RO retentate matrix) and the effluent's background organic matter, started to degrade already at subcritical conditions, however near-complete mineralization of the full matrix (including transformation products) was invariably attained only at fully-established supercritical conditions (450 degrees C-540 degrees C). The extreme hydrothermal oxidation conditions applied in this work allowed for simultaneous oxidation of target molecules and background organic species throughout the applied temperature range, while the phenomenon known as "radicals scavenging" by the background organic matter, was not observed. A new technique is introduced in this work for controlling the pressure within semi-batch SCWO experiments.

AB A hybrid anaerobic/aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (A/O MBBR) system was established for wastewater treatment which contained tetracycline (TC) at the "mu g/L" level. The pilot-scale system was contained an 11.87 L anaerobic unit, a 32.29 L aerobic unit and a 21.53 L secondary sedimentation tank. Results for the single-factor experiment showed that the optimal temperature for this A/O MBBR was 25 degrees C with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal rate at 85.71% +/- 0.94% and 90.46% +/- 1.45%, respectively. Otherwise, the A/O MBBR system showed a high organic load that when the influent COD concentration was about 450 mg/L, the removal efficiency of COD and NH4+-N was 84.51% +/- 1.23% and 81.24% +/- 1.35% respectively, with effluent concentration of 71.94 +/- 5.18 and 7.24 +/- 0.63 mg/L respectively. The highest TC removal efficiency occurred at an influent concentration of 50 mu g/L under 8 h of hydraulic retention time, and the average degradation rate during this phase was 50.03% +/- 1.67%. In addition, the highest TC removal amount was 73.40 mu g/L occurred at a fourth phase when the initial concentration of TC was 206.46 mu g/L, showing the desired performance than many existed municipal sewage treatment plants. Moreover, this research provides a case study of a pilot-scale model for TC wastewater biodegradation and practical application.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in water bodies is associated with the increasing consumption of these substances and limited elimination from wastewater. Pharmaceutical residues and their metabolites may have an unfavorable impact on fish and other aquatic biota. As the purification of wastewater from tramadol is very limited and the knowledge on its effects on non-target organisms is low, we decided to assess the subchronic impact of tramadol hydrochloride on fish-on the mortality, growth and histopathology, together with the impact on selected indices of oxidative stress. The juvenile growth toxicity test was carried out on zebrafish (Danio rerio), in accordance with the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation Guidelines 215 (Fish, Juvenile Growth Test). The fish were exposed to a range of tramadol hydrochloride concentrations (0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 600 mu g/L) for 28 days. The outcome of this study suggests that chosen concentrations of tramadol hydrochloride did not affect either mortality or growth (regarding weight, length and specific growth rate). However, the results of this study indicate that 28-day exposure can negatively influence selected indices of oxidative stress, which is a harmful imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in an organism. A significant increase was observed in glutathione S-transferase activity in the experimental group exposed to 2 mu g/L tramadol hydrochloride, compared to the control. Moreover, lipid peroxidation was observed in groups exposed to 20 and 200 mu g/L, in comparison to the control.

AB In light of the environmental policy orientation of continuous upgrading emission limits, quantitatively understanding the comprehensive cost of wastewater treatment of chemical industrial parks, a common landscape globally, will be vital for facilitating sustainable water management of the parks. This study modeled the economic cost of wastewater treatment in chemical industrial parks from the perspective of life cycle thinking. The full-process cost of wastewater treatment is accounted, including freshwater withdrawal, construction and capital costs of wastewater treatment facilities, operation costs, sludge treatment costs, and 'feed-in tariffs' of wastewater to centralized wastewater treatment plants (CWWTPs) of the park. After applying the model to HSEDA, a typical chemical industrial park, we found the total wastewater treatment cost of the chemical industrial park in 2016 was 654 million Chinese Yuan (about 97 million USD), accounting for 29 % of the tax revenue of the park. Energy, chemicals, and labor costs in the sum accounted for more than 60 % of the full-process cost. The cost of freshwater withdrawal, in-plant treatment cost, and CWWTP cost accounted for 54 %, 33 %, and 13 % of the total cost, respectively. The top two pillar industries the dyestuff manufacturing industry and the pharmaceutical industry, have a cost of 29 CNY and 21 CNY per ton of wastewater, respectively. Moreover, the marginal cost increment associated with a much stricter emission standard by targeting TN control is discussed by employing different technologies. Finally, key measures for improving wastewater treatment in the chemical industrial park are proposed.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are not monitored nor regulated consistently, but may have negative effects on human health and ecosystem balance. Although pharmaceuticals and personal care products are among the main ECs found in surface and wastewater, their toxicity and fate are currently not sufficiently studied. In this study, we analyzed for the first time a group of 46 ECs in the secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of Prague. Thirty-seven compounds were identified in the discharge to surface water. Three compounds had no toxicology information on Artemia salina: furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and tramadol. We performed acute toxicity (LC50) tests and enzyme assays after 24 and 48 h at room temperature and 28 degrees C for these three compounds. LC50 ranged from 225.01 mg/L for furosemide, the most toxic, up to above 14,000 mg/L for tramadol. Changes in enzymatic activity for GST, GPx, AChE, and LDH when A. salina were exposed to LC25 for each contaminant were conspicuous and significant in a contaminant-, exposure time-, and temperature-dependent manner. These biochemical markers complement the toxicity profile of these contaminants in aquatic ecosystems and highlight the need for further research on other ECs and their implications, and the regulations required to protect human and ecological health.

AB Ozonation followed by a polishing moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was implemented in pilot and laboratory to remove the residual pharmaceuticals and toxicity from wastewater effluent, which was from a pilot hybrid system of MBBR and activated sludge, receiving municipal wastewater. The delivered ozone dosages achieving 90% pharmaceutical removal were determined both in pilot and laboratory experiments and they were normalised to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), illustrating our findings were comparable with previously published literature. During wastewater ozonation, the intensity of natural fluorescence was found to be greatly associated with the concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals. In pilot experiments, toxicity, measured by Vibrio fischeri, increased after ozonation at delivered ozone dosages at 0.38-0.47 mg O-3/mg DOC and was completely removed by the subsequent polishing MBBR. Laboratory experiments verified that the polishing MBBR was able to remove the toxicity produced by the ozonation.

AB To encourage the reutilization of treated wastewaters as an adaptation strategy to climate change it is necessary to demonstrate their quality. If this is ensured, reclaimed waters could be a valuable resource that produces very little environmental impact and risks to human health. However, wastewaters are one of the main sources of emerging pollutants that are discharged in the environment. For this, it is essential to assess the presence of these pollutants, especially pharmaceutical compounds, in treated wastewaters. Moreover, the different treatment processes must be evaluated in order to know if conventional and natural treatment technologies are efficient in the removal of these types of compounds. This is an important consideration if the treated wastewaters are used in agricultural activities. Owing to the complexity of wastewater matrixes and the low concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in these types of samples, it is necessary to use sensitive analytical methodologies. In this study, the presence of 11 pharmaceutical compounds were assessed in three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gran Canaria (Spain). Two of these WWTPs use conventional purification technologies and they are located in densely populated areas, while the other studied WWTP is based in constructed wetlands which purify the wastewaters of a rural area. The sampling was performed monthly for two years. A solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was applied for the analysis of the samples, and the 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in all the studied WWTPs. The concentrations were variable and ranged from ngL(-1) in some compounds like diclofenac or carbamazepine to mu gL(-1) in common pharmaceutical compounds such as caffeine, naproxen or ibuprofen. In addition, removal efficiencies in both conventional and natural purification systems were evaluated. Similar removal efficiencies were obtained using different purifying treatments, especially for some pharmaceutical families as stimulants or anti-inflammatories. Other compounds like carbamazepine showed a recalcitrant behavior. Secondary treatments presented similar removal efficiencies in both conventional and natural wastewater treatment plants, but conventional treatments showed slightly higher elimination ratios. Regarding tertiary system, the treatment with highest removal efficiencies was reverse osmosis in comparison with microfiltration and electrodialysis reversal.

AB While wastewater treatment standards have been progressively increasing, emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals can nonetheless pass through treatment and end up in our watersheds. Pharmaceuticals in the parts-per-billion range can impact fish behavior, survival, and recruitment in the wild. However, the ecological risk posed by whole municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), a complex mixture, is not clear. This knowledge gap is particularly evident for early lifestages (ELS) of fish, and because effluent discharge events are typically short, the effects of short-term MWWE exposures to ELS fish are particularly important from an environmental perspective. Here we tested the effects of rapid 30-min exposures, and short-term 24- and 72-h exposures to MWWE on development, behaviors, and stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, larvae, and juveniles. We obtained 24-h composite samples of tertiary-treated MWWE that contained a mixture of chemicals with affinities for serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and ion-channel receptors. Embryos exposed to 5%, 10%, and 50% MWWE experienced developmental delays in somitogenesis and hatching rate, although there was no effect on survival. Embryonic photomotor responses were affected following 30-min and 24-h exposures to 10% and 50% MWWE, and larval visual motor responses were reduced from 24-h exposure to 10% MWWE. Exposure to 10% MWWE dulled the juvenile cortisol and lactate response following an acute air-exposure. Compromised behavioral and stress performances demonstrate the capacity of MWWE to impact phenotypes critical to the survival of fish in the environment. Taken together, we found that zebrafish were sensitive to toxic effects of MWWE at multiple life-stages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are the most consumed therapeutic classes worldwide and are released to the environment in their original form as well as potentially active metabolites and/or degradation products. Consequences of the occurrence of these compounds in the environment are primarily related to bacterial resistance development.
   This work presents a validated analytical method based on solid phase extraction (SPE) using HLB cartridges, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for quantification of seven different fluoroquinolone antibiotics, namely ciprofloxacin (CPF), enrofloxacin (ENR), lomefloxacin (LOM), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), prulifloxacin (PLF) and moxifloxacin (MOX) and its application to detect the target compounds in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Linearity was established through calibration curves in solvent and matrix match using internal calibration method in the range of 50-1300 ng L-1 and all the fluoroquinolones showed good linear fit (r(2) >= 0.991). Accuracy ranged between 80.3 and 92.9%, precision was comprised between 7.2 and 14.6%, and 10.7 and 18.1% for intra- and inter-batch determinations, respectively. Method detection and quantification limits ranged from 6.7 to 59.0 ng L-1 and 22.3-196.6 ng L-1, respectively.
   Influents and effluents of fifteen WWTPs of North of Portugal were analyzed. OFL was the fluoroquinolone found at the highest concentration, up to 4587.0 ng L-1 and 987.9 ng L-1, in influent and effluent, respectively. NOR and PLF were not detected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, low-cost and efficient iron oxide nanoparticle incorporated on mesoporous biochar was prepared from effluent treatment plant (ETP) sludge collected from the textile industry. This sludge contains a higher amount of Fe due to the use of ferric chloride as a coagulant in the treatment of wastewater generated during the process. The raw sludge and prepared biochar was extensively examined by various sophisticated techniques like XRF, XRD, BET, TGA, XPS, RAMAN, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, and VSM. TEM and XRD analysis confirms the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles on mesoporous biochar. The prepared biochar was found to possess BET surface area of 91 m(2) g(-1). Several parameters like pH, dose, initial concentration, temperature and time were optimized for the adsorptive removal of ofloxacin (OFL) from aqueous solution. Biochar (named as BTSFe) achieved approximate to 96% removal efficiency of OFL with a maximum adsorption capacity (q(m)) of 19.74 mg g(-1) at optimum condition. pi-pi electron-donor-acceptor and H bonding were the major mechanisms responsible for the OFL adsorption. Kinetic and equilibrium thermodynamic study of showed that the adsorption of OFL was represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the process was exothermic and spontaneous. Additionally, Redlich-Peterson and Freundlich isotherms best fitted the experimental data indicating multilayer adsorption phenomenon. Biochar was magnetically separated and thermally regenerated after each cycle for five times with a nominal overall decrease of approximate to 8% in removal efficiency. Leaching of iron during the adsorption process was also checked and found to be within the permissible limit. This study provides an alternative application of the textile industry sludge as an efficient, low-cost biochar for the removal of emerging pharmaceutical compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the demand for potable water increases, direct potable reuse of wastewater is an attractive alternative method to produce potable water. However, implementation of such a process will require the removal of emerging contaminants which could accumulate in the drinking water supply. Here, the removal of atrazine, a commonly used herbicide, has been investigated. Using real and synthetic wastewater, as well as sludge from two wastewater treatment facilities in the United States in Norman, Oklahoma and Fayetteville, Arkansas, atrazine removal has been investigated. Our results indicate that about 20% of the atrazine is removed by adsorption onto the particulate matter present. Significant biodegradation of atrazine was only observed under aerobic conditions for sludge from Norman, Oklahoma. Next-generation sequencing of the activated sludge revealed the abundance of Noncardiac with known atrazine degradation pathways in the Norman aerobic sludge, which is believed to be responsible for atrazine biodegradation in our study. The detection of these bacteria could also be used to determine the likelihood of biodegradation of atrazine for a given wastewater treatment facility.

AB In this study, iron foam combined ozonation was employed as an advanced oxidation process to treat the organic contaminants in real pharmaceutical wastewater. It was found that this procedure worked well in a wide range of pH, the existence of iron foam in ozonation system markedly elevated the mineralization level of organic contaminants. Within the reaction time of 120 min, iron foam combined ozonation achieved 53% of DOC removal percentage, which was 21% higher than that of ozone alone. Meanwhile, the biodegradability of the pharmaceutical wastewater was improved, a large part of the organic pollutants containing benzene rings and amino groups were effectively degraded, and a certain amount of phosphate and nitrogen also get removed. In iron foam combined ozonation, zero valent iron played the role as an activator. It was oxidized into iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, the electrons transferring among different valences of iron stimulated the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which accounted for most of the organic contaminants degradation.

AB The selective degradation of recalcitrant antibiotics into byproducts with low toxicity and high biodegradability has been increasingly popular using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this paper, two Fe-based heterogeneous catalysts, bentonite supported Fe-Ni composite (BNF) and biochar-supported Fe composite (Fe/C), were tailored and comprehensively characterized for distinctive physicochemical properties, crystalline structures, and interfacial behaviors. Two widely used antibiotics, sulfapyridine (SPY) and oxytetracycline (OTCs) at their common concentrations in pharmaceutical wastewaters (250 and 10 mg L-1) were tested for degradation in three PMS-based oxidation processes, i.e., PMS, PMS-BNF, and PMS-Fe/C, respectively. Results demonstrated that a large amount of PMS (10 and 1 mM) could effectively remove SPY (0.385 min(-1), 100% removal) and OTC (2.737 min(-1), 100% removal) via O-1(2) derived from PMS self-decomposition and non-radical pathway, respectively. Additional Fe-based catalysts (0.5 g L-1 Fe/C and BNF) significantly reduced the PMS consumption (1 and 0.25 mM) and accelerated the reaction rate (1.08 and 5.05 min(-1)) of SPY and OTC removal. Moreover, the supplementary catalysts shifted the degradation route. The biochar matrix in Fe/C composite contributed to predominant interaction with PMS forming O-1(2), which preferably attacked SPY via hydroxylation. In contrast, the redox-active Fe-Ni pairs induced SO4 center dot(-) formation, which could selectively degrade OTC through decarboxylation. Thus, these results are conducive to tailoring advanced yet low-cost heterogeneous catalysts for eco-friendly treatment of antibiotics-rich industrial wastewaters.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants present mainly in industrial and municipal wastewater. Herein, structurally variable binary and ternary metal hydroxides based on copper, manganese, and aluminum were used for the adsorptive scavenging of the oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotic. A facile hydrothermal method was used for the synthesis of binary CuAl-hydroxide, MnAl-hydroxide, and ternary CuMnAl-hydroxide. Structural and morphological characteristics of the metal hydroxides (MHs) were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformed infrared spectrum (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The adsorptive removal for OTC was found in the order CuMnAl-hydroxide > CuAl-hydroxide > MnAl-hydroxide. The highest removal of OTC by CuMnAl-hydroxide and CuAl-hydroxide was observed at pH 7 while MnAl-hydroxide showed the optimum adsorption at pH 9. All three materials showed different saturation time and equilibrium concentration for OTC adsorption. The mechanism investigation found that strong electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and anion exchange were mainly responsible for the removal of the OTC and adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and equilibrium data was best fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption of OTC was influenced by the presence of Cu (II) and Cr (VI) ions in the aqueous solution due to the competitive adsorption of co-ions. Moreover, the adsorption of OTC was endothermic in nature, and maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 250.07 mg/g at 50 degrees C.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using heterogeneous photocatalysis in presence of TiO2 nanoparticles has become a lucrative method because the convectional wastewater and biological treatments usually fail to remove the detrimental effect of different drugs and hormones on the environment. The nanoparticles recovery and reuse is the most challenging task in practice. The main goal of the present study is to recover and reuse of photocatalyst by immobilizing it on the membrane surface. Consequently, two types of immobilization technique have been used here, one is surface immobilization by dipped coating, and other is impregnation of catalyst during fabrication of the membrane. To conduct photocatalysis, an indigenous photo membrane reactor has also been fabricated during the research work. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles has not only improved the catalytic property of the membrane, but also the contact angle analysis has confirmed the enhanced hydrophilic as well as antifouling property of the surface modified membrane. The fabricated membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To analyses the performance of photo membrane reactor as well as TiO2 coated or impregnated membranes, the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibacterial drug, was performed using the developed system and the removal percentage of CHD obtained from the system was found to be quite appreciable. The results show that the recovery and reuse of the catalyst by the present system is very much significant. Meanwhile, the developed reactor can be operated in cross flow configuration under batch, semi-batch and continuous mode.

AB Alternative water sources for crop production need to be identified in order to meet increasing food demand under climate change scenario. However unconventional water source can contain micropollutants like endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals due to their persistence after the most common wastewater treatments. Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world's population which requires high volumes of water to achieve optimal yields. For this reason also low micropollutants concentration can represent a serious problem due to the stack in the trophic chain. At the state of art, the effects of these compounds on crops yield and quality remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, the aim of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine and ibuprofen on the growth of Oryza sativa (L.) and their presence in the grain. We also investigated the possible interactions of biofertilizer based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with the pollutants to evaluate if their use affected the grain pollutants content due to irrigation with polluted water. The results show that the polluted solution has caused an increase in rice yield (+51 %) and growth. The interaction between the polluting treatment and the mycorrhizal fungi has caused an increase in photochemical efficiency values compared to the control (+2.63 %). Instead, only with AMF treatment an inhibitory effect on the growth (-42 %) and photochemical efficiency (-5.4 %) have been observed. An ibuprofen (119.3 ng g(-1)) and caffeine (from 52 to 1060 ng g(-1)) translocation in rice grain has been observed. As far as we know, this is the first study reporting the presence of exogenous caffeine, and ibuprofen in rice grain suggesting further evaluations about the possible agronomical, environmental and human health risks effects of these pollutants.

AB Pesticides and pharmaceuticals are widely used in modern life and are discharged into wastewater after usage. However, a large number of transformation products (TPs) are formed through abiotic (hydrolysis/photolysis, etc.) and biotic (aerobic/anaerobic degradation by micro-organisms) wastewater treatment processes, and the structure and potential risk of TPs are still unclear. In this study, a suspect and non-target screening was performed to monitor these chemicals with HPLC-QTOF-MS. We identified 60 parent compounds by suspect screening in three Chinese wastewater treatment plants with the commercial database of pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and they were confirmed by authentic standards. Then, suspect and non-target screening strategies based on the predicted diagnostic fragment ions were used to screen TPs of the 60 parent compounds. We tentatively identified 50 TPs and confirmed thirteen of them with authentic standards. Among 13 quantified TPs, about 40% of them showed higher concentration than their parent compounds in effluent. Especially, cloquintocet, as a TP of cloquintocet-mexyl, had a concentration ratio TP/parent = 14,809 in effluent. Twenty-five TPs had higher predicted toxicity than the corresponding parent compounds by calculating their LC50 values towards aquatic organisms using toxicity prediction software. Twenty identified TPs were firstly reported in this study. These results indicate the importance of TP analysis in environmental monitoring in wastewater.

AB Sewage treatment plants effluent is considered the primary source of many micropollutants in aquatic systems since their biological treatment is commonly unable to remove persistent micropollutants. However, its efficacy can be achieved with the aid of advanced treatment technologies, such as membrane processes. This work evaluated the removal efficiency of 7 pharmaceuticals (Ketoprofen, Prednisone, Fenofibrate, Fluconazole, Betamethasone, Loratadine and 17 alpha-Ethinyl estradiol) in a hybrid system (EGSB-MBR) where an ultrafiltration membrane was submerged in an anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. This integrated system improved the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals (>84 %) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The EGSB reactor alone showed COD reductions around 92 %, while the EGSB-MBR system achieved COD reductions above 98 %. Furthermore, the permeate showed lower concentrations of nutrients (P, N-NH4+) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) than the effluent from the anaerobic reactor alone. Anaerobic biodegradability tests, together with bioreactor results, pointed out the mechanisms involved in the removal of each drug. The risk assessment showed that the permeate presented a low probability of risk to human health and that the OF membrane was able to reduce the risk of the final effluent.

AB Occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in surface water bodies can cause adverse effects on non-target organisms. When surface waters are used as drinking water sources, temporal variability in EOC concentrations can potentially impact drinking water quality and human health. To better understand spatiotemporal variability of EOCs in drinking water sources in Central Pennsylvania, EOCs were evaluated in six drinking water sources during a two-year study period (April 2016-June 2018) in the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). The study was conducted in two phases: Phase I was a spatially distributed sampling approach within the SRB focusing on seven human pharmaceuticals and Phase II was a temporally intensive sampling regime at a single site focusing on a broader range of EOCs. Concentration-discharge relationships were utilized to classify EOC transport dynamics and understand the extent to which hydrologic and anthropogenic factors, such as surface runoff and wastewater effluent, may contribute to EOC occurrence. Overall, EOCs were present at higher concentrations in colder seasons than warmer seasons. Thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide, and caffeine exhibited accretion dynamics during high-flow periods, suggesting higher transport during surface runoff events. Human pharmaceuticals known to persist in wastewater effluent were inversely correlated with discharge, indicating dilution characteristics consistent with diminished wastewater signals during high-flow periods. Acetaminophen exhibited near-chemostatic transport dynamics, indicating nonpoint source inputs during high-flow periods. Risk calculations revealed that although EOCs posed medium-to-high risk to aquatic organisms, human health risk through fish consumption was low. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many studies have been conducted on the evaluation and monitoring of micropollutants and by-products in wastewater treatment plants. Considering the increase in the production and consumption of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, personal care products, and plasticisers, it is necessary to conduct studies that support the elaboration of laws and regulations that promote the environmentally sustainable use of sludge and effluents. In this work, the biological degradation of amoxicillin was studied under two anaerobic conditions: i) using a 6 L reactor operated under semi-continuous flow; and ii) a batch system with 100 mL sealed glass syringes. According to the statistical analysis, amoxicillin was completely removed from the systems, but biogas production inhibition was observed (p < 0.05). Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis identified amoxicillin penicilloic acid, amoxilloic acid, amoxicillin diketopiperazine and phenol hydroxypyrazine as by-products under anaerobic conditions. Ecotoxicity tests on effluent treated under the batch conditions showed that the addition of higher amounts of amoxicillin inhibited the target species Aliivibrio fischeri and Raphidocelis subcaptata, causing functional decreases of 28.5% and 22.2% when the antibiotic concentration was 2500 mu g L-1. A. fischeri was the most sensitive organism to effluent treated under semi-continuous flow conditions; a continuous reduction in bioluminescence of up to 88.8% was observed after 39 days of feeding, which was associated with by-products accumulation due to unbalanced conditions during anaerobic digestion. Changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the effluent caused the accumulation and removal of AMX-DKP IV and modified the toxicity to Lactuca saliva and R. subcapitata.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are one of the treatment technologies with the potential to remove emerging compounds from wastewater. The present work evaluated the efficiency of an MBR pilot system in removing amoxicillin from synthetic wastewater using a continuous flow pre-denitrification MBR (A/O-MBR) pilot unit. The system operated in three phases: (1) synthetic wastewater and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 40 h; (2) adding amoxicillin 100 mu g L-1 to the influent, and (3) varying flowrate to HRT of 20 h. Liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of five amoxicillin degradation by-products in the effluent. The addition of amoxicillin did not affect chemical oxygen demand (COD) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiencies. Respirometry showed that amoxicillin level did not inhibit heterotrophic bacteria metabolism. The change in HRT reduced the DOC removal (from 84% to 66%) but did not influence COD ( > 94%) or total nitrogen (> 72%). The amoxicillin and by-products removal decreased from 80% to 54% with HRT change. Adsorption and biodegradation represented the largest removed fraction of the antibiotic in the A/O-MBR system (68%). Ecotoxicity assays showed P. fluorescens was more resistant and E. coli less resistant to amoxicillin residues at effluent sample matrix.

AB Literature frequently reports that colloids in aqueous matrices sorb a large fraction of pharmaceuticals. Since coagulation/flocculation removes colloids, it is expected that coagulation/flocculation in principle should be useful in concentrating pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment, which would facilitate the treatment of these refractory compounds. In our present work, we researched the potential of coagulation/flocculation for removing pharmaceuticals from raw sewage. Results from jar tests showed that pharmaceuticals are hardly removed from sewage with coagulation/flocculation. To investigate the discrepancy between reported colloidal sorption and the lack of removal when removing colloids, we tested a commonly applied experimental setup, which makes use of ultra-filtration (UF), for determining the colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals. The UF method under research was compared with an assessment making use of flocculation. Both methods, UF and flocculation, showed similar removal of colloids. However, during UF, the retention of pharmaceuticals reached values up to 93 +/- 4 %. In contrast, when removing the colloids with flocculation, no pharmaceutical removal was observed. These results confirm that it is very likely to introduce an analysis bias in using UF membranes in the determination of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals. In fact, results predict an over-estimation caused by a direct retention of pharmaceuticals without any binding to colloidal matter. Overall results of the current work show that pharmaceuticals hardly sorb to colloids and herewith the absence of removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation/flocculation is explained.

AB The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater effluents is recognized as the main factor limiting the adsorption of organic micropollutants (OMPs) onto activated carbon. The degree of the negative effect that DOM, depending on its quality, exerts on OMPs adsorption is still unclear. The influence of the interactions between DOM and OMPs on their removal is also not fully understood. Adsorption isotherms and conventional batch tests were performed in ultra-pure water and in wastewater effluent to study the influence of DOM on the adsorption of 12 OMPs onto powdered activated carbon. Best fit of adsorption pseudo-isotherms was obtained with the Freundlich equation and showed, as expected, that OMPs adsorption was higher in ultra-pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of DOM leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites. LC-OCD analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the most adsorbed fractions while humic acids were not removed after a contact time of either 30 min or 72 h. The presence of DOM had a negative impact on the removal of all OMPs after 30 min of adsorption, but similar removals to ultra-pure water were obtained for 6 OMPs after 72 h of adsorption. This demonstrated that competition between DOM and OMPs for adsorption sites was not a major mechanism as compared to pore blockage, which only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it. The charge of OMPs had a clear impact: the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was reduced in the presence of wastewater effluent due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed DOM and the PAC surface. On the other hand, the removal of positively charged compounds was improved. A 24 h pre-equilibrium between OMPs and DOM improved their removal onto PAC, which suggest that OMPs and DOM interacted in solution which decreased the negative effects caused by the presence of DOM, e.g. through co-adsorption of an OMP-DOM complex.

AB Urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be an emission source of aerosol particles to the air and this process has the potential to spread emerging pollutants into the air, where the particles can be widely transported over long distances to areas where this pollution is unexpected. This study demonstrates aeration tanks in WWTPs as a potential source of ketamine, methamphetamine and other emerging contaminant emissions into the air. Ketamine and methamphetamine are frequently detected in high concentrations (maximum of 151.8-162.8 pg/m(3)) in gaseous and aerosol samples along with 24 other emerging contaminants. Through correlation analysis, the common occurrence of emerging contaminants in air is attributable to their high aqueous concentrations as well as their physicochemical properties. Two simple regression models are developed to provide a practical and convenient way to estimate the steady-state concentrations in air. The gas-phase emission model illustrates the relationship between the solubility, the pK(a) and the aqueous concentration of compounds in the aeration basin and their gaseous concentrations in air (statistical strength of 74.1%; p value < 0.05), while the partition model establishes the ratio of a compound in the gas and particulate phases in air (statistical strength of 82.6%; p value < 0.05). The results provide a basis for assessing the risk of the inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants; however, in-depth research addressing the impact of aerosols containing persistent pharmaceuticals on human health is still needed.

AB Phenol is a toxic organic compound that detectable in the pharmaceutical wastewater, and therefore it should be eliminated. This study aims to degrade phenol in the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) include the photocatalytic process applying Titanium Oxide (TiO2) that immobilized on pumice stone (PS), as well as ozone process with O-3 and O-3/granulated activated carbon (GAC). Degradation system used two configuration reactors that worked alternately at pH 3 and 9. Photocatalysis was conducted for 4 hours in the photoreactor that equipped with mercury lamp as a photon source, while ozonation was performed for 1 hour in the cylinder glass reactor contained an ozone generator. Phenol degradations were done by photocatalysis, ozonation, photocatalysis followed by ozonation and vice versa. The FESEM-EDS and XRD results depicted that TiO2 has impregnated on pumice stone and FESEM characterization also indicated that the photocatalyst spread across the surface of the pumice stone. BET analysis results in an increased surface area of the PS-TiO2 by 3.7 times, whereas bandgap energy down to 3 eV. It can be concluded that ozone process (with O-3/GAC) that followed by photocatalysis at pH 9 could treat the liquid waste with phenol concentration 11.2 down to 1.2 ppm that nearly according to the discharge standards quality (1 ppm).

AB Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is an advanced technology in treating pharmaceutical wastewater, but the membrane fouling limits its development. In this study, the biochar with adsorption capacity of biopolymers was added in AnMBR to investigate its potential in treating pharmaceutical wastewater and alleviating membrane fouling. In the biochar-amended AnMBR, adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) was removed effectively, and more COD was biotransformed into CH4. Membrane fouling mitigation was achieved in the third stage with a 56% decrease of average transmembrane pressure difference (TMP) rising rate. The predominant culprit, proteins of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS-proteins) in sludge mixture and cake layer, was reduced significantly. Particularly, the proportion of micromolecular (0.1-0.15 kDa) EPS-proteins in cake layer was 1.5-folds that of the control group. The important bio-foulant genus Arcobacter aggregating on the membrane had less and almost half the relative abundance (16.5%) than that of the control group (30.7%).

AB The removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and cell-free antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and the microbial community of ARB were investigated in detail to understand their fate and provide valuable information on the feasibility of full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The potential risks of cell-free ARGs to the receiving environment were discovered. High influent antibiotic concentration could inhibit the microbial activity of MBR sludge, whereas good antibiotic removal could be maintained because of relatively long solid retention time and high biomass retention. Approximately 61.8%-77.5% of the total antibiotics were degraded, and 22.5%-38.2% of the total antibiotics were adsorbed by MBR sludge on average. The individual antibiotic removal presented intense discrepancy because of the chemical construction and distribution coefficient of antibiotics. Aeromonas exhibited specific antibiotic resistance to ampicillin and erythromycin, Escherichia became the predominant genera in kanamycin-ARB and tetracycline-ARB, and Klebsiella and Bacteroides were the particular genera that exhibited distinct antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin. A significant correlation was found between cell-free ARG abundance and ARB content, and relatively high effluent cell-free ARG abundance facilitated the proliferation and transmission of ARB. The impacts of the receiving environment to eliminate the ecological risks and severe threats to human health should be investigated because of the low decay ratio and long-term persistence of cell-free ARGs.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is an effective technology for micropollutants retention for production of high quality reclaimed water. However, limited information is available about the effects of temperature on the performance of NF on micropollutants rejections. In this paper, the behaviors and mechanisms of micropollutants rejections by two commercial NF membranes (VNF1 and VNF2) were studied under different temperatures. Based on the Donnan Steric Pore Model with Dielectric Exclusion (DSPM-DE) model, the mathematical functions were firstly established to describe the relationship between pore size (r(p)) and temperature (T) as well as the relationship of water permeability (A) with temperature (T). The DSPM-DE model incorporated with temperature functions were used to predict micropollutants rejections by NF membranes at given temperature values. The results showed that the increase of temperature could lead to the increase of NF membranes' pore sizes, water fluxes as well as the micropollutants' diffusivities. The rejection rates of positively and neutrally charged micropollutants decreased with temperature increased, which was mainly due to the attenuation of steric hindrance effect. For the negatively charged micropollutants, temperature had negligible effect on them, which was possibly facilitated by the co-function of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance effect. Our study also showed that the predicted rejection values of neutrally and positively charged micropollutants decreased with temperature increased, in agreement with those of the experimental data. Compared with the real experimental rejections, the average relative errors of predicted values were 6.20% and 9.03% for VNF1 and VNF2, respectively. But for benzotriazole, the average relative error was as higher as 20.44%, possibly due to its adsorption onto VNF membranes. This work provides valuable insights for NF engineering applications and designs at different temperatures.

AB In this work, twenty-three endocrine disrupting compounds have been monitored in sludge from different stages of four sludge stabilization treatments (anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, composting and anaerobic stabilization ponds). Their occurrence and fate in sludge stabilization plants and their potential environmental risk in treated sludge and in treated sludge-amended soils have been evaluated. Monitored compounds were six perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFC), four anionic surfactants (sodium alkylsulfates), a plasticiser (bisphenol A (BPA)), four preservatives (parabens), six UV-filters (benzophenones) and two biocides (triclosan and triclocarban). Only two of the UV-filters were not detected in any of the 141 analysed samples. Anionic surfactants (mean concentrations up to 1673 ng/g dry matter (dm) for the sum of surfactants) were the compounds at the highest concentration levels followed by biocides (up to 512 ng/g dm) and UV-filters (up to 662 ng/g dm). The concentrations of anionic surfactants, preservatives and UV-filters decreased 78, 25 and 80%, respectively, after anaerobic digestion. The concentration of perfluorinated carboxylic acids only decreased after composting (80% reduction) whereas biocides and BPA were not affected by any of the studied treatments. Environmental risks (risk quotients > 1) were obtained for all compounds, except for triclocarban and sodium octadecylsulfate, in treated sludge. In treated sludge-amended soils, risk quotients were lower than 1 for all compounds except for triclosan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, two new composite membranes with antifouling and anti-biofouling properties were prepared through the modification of commercial polyamide (PA) discs using combination of in-situ polymerization of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and grafting of two synthesized bi-plasmonic Au-Ag and Ag-Au photocatalysts. The synthesis and characterization of the photocatalysts in batch mode were discussed in details as primary studies. Two intense 405-nm and 532-nm lasers for Ag-Au and Au-Ag photocatalysts, respectively and a solar-simulated xenon lamp for both photocatalysts were applied for photodegradation studies and the results were compared. In addition, the effect of other parameters such as type and amount of photocatalysts, and initial concentration of pollutants on the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin (OFX) and methylene blue (MB) as the model pollutant drug and dye were comprehensively investigated and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption model was used for evaluation of kinetics, degradation rate and half-life time of the reactions. After selection of xenon lamp as the optimum light source, the photodegradation of OFX and MB was evaluated in a dead-end membrane reactor (MR) and flux performance, antifouling property and pollutant removal of the membranes were evaluated using pharmaceutical and textile wastewater samples. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated using Gram-negative E. coli bacteria as the model microorganism using thin film assay and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion methods to examine the anti-biofouling potential of the constructed reactors. It was demonstrated that the prepared MR is able to produce cleaner water with more stable flux performance and good membrane fouling/biofouling properties in energy saving manner with respect to the unmodified ones.

AB The release of toxic contaminant of emerging concern from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) into the environment calls for more effective (tertiary) treatment methods. In this manuscript, homogeneous solar-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), namely H2O2/sunlight, solar photo-Fenton (Fe+2/H2O2/sunlight) and solar photo-Fenton with ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) complex (Fe+2/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight) were compared to a new heterogeneous process (supported nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2)/sunlight), with the aim of contributing to fill the gap between lab scale tests and full scale applications as well as to provide a sustainable solution for tertiary treatment in small UWTPs. Process efficiency was evaluated in terms of effluent toxicity and degradation of a mixture of three pharmaceuticals (namely carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac and trimethoprim), at initial concentration of 200 mu g/L each, in deionized water (DW) and real wastewater (WW). Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight was found to be the most effective process (98% removal of CBZ from WW in 60 min, 5.6 kJ/L as cumulative solar energy per unit of volume). Conventional solar photo Fenton was drastically and negatively affected by water matrix, due to the spontaneous neutral pH and iron precipitation in real WW. Although N-TiO2/sunlight process was not so affected by water matrix, it was found to be less efficient (30% removal of CBZ in 180 min, 13.3 kJ/L) than Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight process. Toxicity values were found to be lower in WW compared to DW matrix. Class weight scores for WW samples showed a toxicity reduction up to the no acute toxicity level for N-TiO2/sunlight and Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight treatments, while H2O2/sunlight and Fe2+/H2O2/sunlight increased the final effluent toxicity up to slightly acute levels.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials show great potential in wastewater separation applications. In this study, zirconium-based MOFs (UiO-66) were prepared and constructed universal, high-performance, and flexible nanofiltration (NF) membrane for various dyes and antibiotics separation. The substrate was constructed by two-steps, a) doping graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the membrane casting solution containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and forming 2D-3D connecting pores by phase immersion conversion method (defined as GO@PAN), b) immersing the GO@PAN substrate into dopamine solution to self-polymerize into chain macromolecules, which obtaining good compatible and flexible substrate (defined as PGP). Moreover, the UiO-66 was synthesized via solvothermal method and subsequently coated onto the PGP substrate by vacuum-assisted filtration. Benefiting from the water stability, porous structure, and negative charge of UiO-66, the outstanding filtration performance of the UiO-66/PGP thin-film composite (TFC) membrane was achieved. The pure water permeability of the UiO66/PGP TFC membrane was 31.33 +/- 0.75 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), and the rejection rates for dye (Congo red, Methyl orange, Rhodamine B, and Methylene blue) and antibiotic (Tetracycline hydrochloride, Oxytetracycline, and Ciprofloxacin) were above 94%. Therefore, we further explored the retention mechanism of the UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane for dye and antibiotic separation (size exclusion and electrostatic interaction). More importantly, antifouling properties and long-time stability of the UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane were also evaluated. These results indicated that the prepared UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane is promising for wastewater treatment, separation, and purification in many industrial and pharmaceutical fields.

AB Some uses of biochar/H2O2 in the removal of organic pollutants from sewage have made the advanced oxidation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products by modified biochar possible. However, little is known about the performance of modified biochar and the mechanism of this process. Herein, the activation of H2O2 by Fe-impregnated biochar (FBC, produced from maize straw, wheat straw and peanut shell) was studied, and the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was specifically investigated. The results show that Fe-impregnated biochar had the ability to activate H2O2 and degrade SMX and its performance was better than that of the original biochar. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 350 degrees C to 700 degrees C, Fe-impregnated maize straw (1 g/L) enhanced the decomposition of H2O2 (3 mM) from 66% to 99% within 2 h. The degradation of SMX (10 mu M) by FM700/H2O2 within 2 h reached 100%, which was approximately 3 times of that of the original biochar. The mechanism of activation-degradation was elucidated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results show that the interaction of H2O2 with C-OH promoted the generation of HO center dot and that HO center dot and non-radical sites jointly attacked SMX to degrade it. Impregnation with Fe not only increased the specific surface area of the biochar but also provided more active sites to activate H2O2 and degrade SMX.

AB Due to the increasing freshwater deterioration and demand for irrigation, there is pressing need to reclaim and reuse wastewater for agricultural operations. While this practice is gaining significant traction in developed world, it is quite rare in most developing countries with inadequate or no functional sewerage facilities and treatment systems at both municipal and industrial levels occasioned by high investment and operational costs. Consequently, wastewaters generated are in complex heterogenous mix of industrial, domestic, municipal and agricultural runoff wastewater. Biological technologies which utilize the expertise of microorganisms are considered robust, efficient and economically attractive for treatment of wide range of wastewaters and they have high suitability in developing countries. This work therefore assessed the potential of suspended growth biological process (SGBP) for reclamation and reuse of mixed wastewater composed a mixture of domestic effluent, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum discharges and agricultural runoff for irrigation of edible crops (lettuce and beets) with plants phenological parameters as measuring indicators. The germination and phenological characteristics of crops were studied in a hydroponic unit under four irrigation regimes: tap water as control, mixed wastewater, SGBP treated wastewater, and tap water mixed with nutrient solution as upper control, for a duration of 45-d. The results proved that the SGBP treated wastewater had no negative impact on germination responses of the seed crops. However, residual recalcitrant compounds caused early stunted growth in plant root systems with resultant limited access to nutrients. Consequently, plant vegetative growth and phenological development as well as chlorophyll production were reduced. In comparison to nutrients supplemented solution, nutrients deficiency and imbalance in treated wastewater contributed to the poor development in irrigated plants. The outcomes of seed germination and plant growth experiments show a positive indication for reuse of mixed wastewater in agriculture. However, there is need for further research to explore the long-term benefits and limitations of reusing such treated wastewater.

AB Tramadol (TRA) is a widely used human pharmaceutical and a well-established emerging pollutant and its potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on humans as well as its fate in aqueous systems demand full investigation. The present study is a multidisciplinary approach and provides important insights on the potential risks of Tramadol on humans accompanied by its photolytic transformation under simulated solar irradiation. The present study revealed that Tramadol can induce genotoxic and cytotoxic effects under the specific experimental conditions, significantly depended on the tested concentration. In addition, the photolytic transformation of Tramadol was investigated in detail under simulated solar irradiation in two different water matrices: ultrapure water (UW) and treated wastewater (WW). Differences in the degradation rates were observed between UW and WW, being slower in WW. The results showed that more than 70% of Tramadol was removed after 240 min in UW ([TRA] = 10 mg L-1, I = 500 W m(-2)). After this period, TOC removal was found to be about 40%. Transformation of N atoms into NO3 and NH4+ followed a similar trend reaching up to 38% release. Tramadol degraded mainly by HO center dot radicals and O-1(2) through a self-sensitizing process while direct photolysis was also significant. Hydroxylation, demethylation and N-oxidation of the parent compound were found to be the main degradation pathways confirming the important role of HO and O-1(2) in the photolytic process. Toxicity measurements showed a noticeable increase of the inhibition for Vibrio fischeri at the first stages which coincide with the formation of the major TPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and removal in wastewater and water bodies in Nakivubo wetland area and Inner Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria, of common prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutically-active substances (PhACs) sold in Kampala city, Uganda. A questionnaire was sent to 20 pharmacies in Kampala, to identify the most commonly sold PhACs in the city. During two sampling campaigns, samples were collected from Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent and surface water samples from Nakivubo channel, Nakivubo wetland and Inner Murchison Bay. The concentrations of 28 PhACs, organic matter, solids and nutrients in water samples were analysed. Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic), cetirizine (anti-allergy), metformin (anti-diabetes), metronidazole (antibiotic) and omeprazole (gastric therapy) were reported by pharmacies to be the PhACs most commonly sold in the study area. Chemical analysis of water samples revealed that trimethoprim (antibiotic) and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) were the dominant PhACs in water from all sites except Lake Victoria. Other PhACs such as atenolol (anti-hypertensive), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic) and diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) were also found at all study sites except Lake Victoria. Sigma PhACs in effluent from Bugolobi WWTP (13000-37,600 ng L-1) was higher than in the corresponding influent (4000-28,000 ng L-1), indicating poor removal of PhACs within the WWTP. Sigma PhACs decreased by a factor of 2-6 between Bugolobi WWTP effluent and Nakivubo channel (5700 ng L-1), due to dilution and sorption to channel sediment, and by a factor of 1-3 between the Nakivubo channel and Nakivubo wetland (3900-5400 ng L-1), clue to sorption to sediment and uptake by plants in the wetland. No detectable levels of PhACs were found in water from Lake Victoria. Overall, this investigation demonstrated that PhACs in wastewater enter Nakivubo water system. Thus, Bugolobi WWTP needs to be upgraded to improve PhACs removal from wastewater. Considering the high occurrence of antibiotics in the water system in Kampala, development and spread of antimiaobial resistance within the area should also be investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Elevated concentrations and potential toxicities of antibiotics in swine wastewater prompt the exploration of effective treatment methods to minimize the amount of antibiotics released to the environment. This study examined the technical and economic feasibility of using combined biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes for swine wastewater treatment. The up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was mainly responsible for conventional organic pollutant removal (i.e., a COD removal rate of 75%). The subsequent sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under a short sludge retention time (SRT) of 3 days removed the biodegradable antibiotics by >95%, and hindered the nitrification process which retained NW; -N and reduced operational cost (since the treated wastewater was intended to be used as a farm fertilizer). The subsequent Fenton-like oxidation (with the aid of citric add) achieved an average antibiotic removal efficiency of 74% under optimal reaction conditions: H2O2 dosage of 2.9 mM, [Fe2+]: [H2O2] = 1:3, [CA]: [Fe2+] = 1:1, pH 6.0, reaction time of 120 min. The superior treatment efficiency of Fenton-like compared to the conventional Fenton (74% vs 5%) under nearly neutral conditions was attributed to the chelating role of citric acid with Fe2+/Fe3+, leading to the enhanced Fe2+/Fe3+ solubility and therefore the promotion of center dot OH formation. This hybrid process of anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation and Fenton-like oxidation should be suitable and cost-effective for the treatment of wastewater with abundant conventional pollutants and persistent emerging trace contaminants.

AB Emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals that cannot be completely removed by traditional biological treatments are ubiquitously present in water bodies with detected concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to mg L-1. Advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are promising, efficient, and environmentally friendly for the removal of these pharmaceuticals. In this study, we investigated the degradation kinetics of a model pharmaceutical, clonidine (CLD), via hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) in UV/H2O2 and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) in UV/peroxydisulfate (PS) systems for the first time. The second-order rate constants (k) of protonated cationic CID with center dot OH and SO4 center dot- were measured to be (2.15 +/- 0.07) x 10(9) M-1 s(-l) and (1.12 +/- 0.03) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. We also calculated the plc value of CLD and thermodynamic behaviors for reactions of CLD/HOLD - with center dot OH and SO4 center dot- at M05-2X/6-311++G**//M05-2X/6-31+G** level with SMD solvation model. The pK(a) value was calculated to be 8.14, confirming the literature value. H atom abstraction pathway was the most favorable pathway for both center dot OH and SO4 center dot-, while single electron transfer pathway was thermodynamically feasible only for SO4 center dot- for CLD but not for HCLD+. In addition, the reactivities of both tautomeric forms of CLD (i.e., amino and imino CLD) with both radicals were also investigated. This study contributed to a better understanding on the degradation mechanisms of CID and proposed the possibilities of the elimination of pharmaceuticals by applying AOTs during wastewater treatment processes.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an increasingly popular method for analysing drugs or metabolites excreted by populations. The in-sewer transformation of biomarkers is important but often receives little consideration in published studies. Many studies publish stability under biofilm-free conditions only, which do not represent actual sewer conditions. This study aims to fill a gap in the field by comparing the wastewater stability of 33 licit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in biofilm-free (BFF) conditions to stability in sewer biofilm reactors. All but one biomarker was stable under BFF conditions, whereas most transformed in sewer biofilm reactors. Sewer reactor results tended to overestimate the degradation in pilot and actual sewers, whereas BFF stability had no clear relationship to stability in pilot and actual sewers. Our results provide additional basis for more informed interpretation of biofilm-free and sewer reactor stability results for past and future WBE studies. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) were frequently detected in various environmentalwater bodies because of their incomplete removal duringwastewater treatment process, and this may lead to a negative effect on aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated six SAs and three of their acetylated metabolites in the influents, effluents, and the receiving river waters from four typical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, China. The results indicated that sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine and sulfamethoxazole had the highest detection frequency. Moreover, sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole had its maximum concentrations (216 ng/L and 200 ng/L, respectively) in the influent during dry season. To evaluate the compound degradability, the removal efficiency of each individual sulfonamide was calculated, and a modified method to assess it was recommended considering the widespread inter-conversion between SAs and their metabolites. Finally, regarding the effluent and river water, potential environmental risk based on the Hazard quotients (HQs) was estimated towards three diverse non-targeted organisms. Sulfamethoxazole was assessed with the highest HQ (>3.6), being the sole sulfonamide that would pose a risk to algae in the effluents and river waters. Thus, SAs emission needs to be further reduced fromWWTPs into the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were transplanted to 18 locations representing a range of potential exposures throughout Puget Sound, WA. Tissues were analyzed for over 200 organic contaminants. Results indicated the widespread exposure of marine organisms to trace levels of organic contaminants including the synthetic opioid oxycodone, present at three urban sites, and the chemotherapy drug melphalan, present at nine locations, at levels that may be of biological concern.
   Land-use and wastewater outfalls were evaluated as potential sources of CECs to the nearshore. Exposure to alkylphenol ethoxylates was associated with increased impervious surfaces in upland watersheds. A hydrodynamic simulation was performed using the Salish Sea Model to integrate inputs from 99 wastewater sources to Puget Sound. Predictions were consistent with concentrations of several wastewater-associated contaminants and delta N-15 enrichment. These results support the notion that Puget Sound nearshore biota suffer chronic exposures to a suite of contaminants from multiple sources and provide critical to focus future monitoring and management.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is nowadays a well-established issue that has become a matter of both scientific and public concern. Tons of different classes of pharmaceuticals find their way to the environment at variable degrees, after their use and excretion through wastewater and sewage treatment systems. The main goal of this study was to correlate the dynamics and the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals with different temporal and hydrological patterns, at the Guadiana Basin (South of Portugal). Water samples were collected bimonthly during 2017 (classified as a drought year) and 2018 (post-drought year) in: Zebro, Alamos and Amieira (intermittent hydrological streams), and Lucefecit (perennial hydrological stream). The pharmaceuticals quantified in higher concentrations, out of 27 investigated, were diclofenac (up to 4806 ng L-1), ibuprofen (3161 ng L-1), hydrochlorothiazide (2726 ng L-1) and carbamazepine (3223 ng L-1). Zebro and Alamos presented the highest contamination by this group of environmental hazardous substances, which may be correlated with the presence of wastewater treatment plants upstream the sampling point of each stream. Furthermore, the highest concentrations occurred mainly during the dry period (2017), when the flow was nearly inexistent in Zebro, and in Alamos after the first heavy rainfalls. In specific periods, the high concentrations of pharmaceuticals detectedmay induce risk for the organisms of lowest trophic levels, damaging the balance of the ecosystems at these streams. The risk quotient optimised approach (RQf) integrating exposure, toxicity and persistence factors, ranks the pharmaceuticals investigated in terms of risk for the aquatic ecosystems as follows: diclofenac, ibuprofen and carbamazepine (high risk), clarithromycin (moderate risk), acetaminophen, ofloxacin and bezafibrate (endurable risk), and hydrochlorothiazide (negligible risk).

AB In aquatic systems, some substances considered as endocrine disruptors have been detected, which can be due to their incomplete elimination in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and inadequate disposal of pharmaceuticals. Among these contaminants are 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and caffeine (CAF). Moreover, it has been reported that this kind of contaminants may provoke different adverse effects in many aquatic organisms. Because of that, in the present study, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) coupled with the Fenton process was evaluated for EE2 and CAF removal spiked in wastewater samples. First, the best reaction conditions were established in each process. For UASB reactor, two hydraulic retention times (HRT 8 and 24 h) were evaluated, achieving the highest chemical organic demand (COD) removal (70 %) and drug elimination (84 %-86 %) with HRT 24 h. Subsequently, Fenton process was conducted at pH 3 with different levels of Fe2+ (0.05-0.5 mmol/L) and molar ratios Fe2+:H2O2 (1:1-1:10). Better results were obtained with 0.5 mmol Fe2+/L, and 1:10 ratio molar Fe2+:H2O2. Finally, UASB-Fenton coupled system allowed 80 % of COD decrease, almost complete removal of drugs and the toxicity of samples on Vibrio fischeri was reduced from 73 % to 30 %, demonstrating that this coupled system is a promising and efficient system for pharmaceutical compounds removal from wastewater.

AB Diclofenac is an acidic pharmaceutically active compound and one of the most frequently detected ones in wastewater. This review discusses the research progress and innovations made in recent years on the mitigation of diclofenac from aqueous media by adsorption. It was observed that activated carbon by intense physical activation, metal organic frameworks, and chitosan-cellulose polymeric adsorbents were the best adsorbents for diclofenac removal. Diclofenac sorption follows mainly pseudo-second order kinetics and was best fit to either Freundlich or Langmuir isotherms. Recent research trends involved the investigation of column and continuous experiments, competitive adsorption, and adsorption with photo-catalytic degradation. Whilst numerous types of adsorbents have been explored, there is still need for mechanistic studies.

AB Chloramination of drinking water and wastewater can generate carcinogenic nitrosamines, among which, nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA) with large molecular weight and weak polarity has been commonly found. However, knowledge on the formation of NDPA remains highly limited. Laboratory tests were conducted to quantify NDPA formation during chloramination of nitrogenous precursors, including dipropylamine and methyldipropylamine, and pesticides such as trifluralin, oryzalin, and vernolat. Results showed that all precursors exhibited > 10.0% NDPA yields after 24 h. Oryzalin and trifluralin accomplished the highest (13.63%) and lowest (11.31%) yield, respectively. Maximal yields of all precursors were observed at pH 9.0 and temperature 288 K. Maximums of NDPA yield from oryzalin (18.27%) and vernolat (19.54%) were formed at Cl:N of 0.7:1.0, but maximal yields of dipropylamine (18.44%), methyldipropylamine (22.98%), and trifluralin (33.06%) were achieved at Cl:N of 1.2:1.0. Maximal NDPA yields of dipropylamine (37.14%), methyldipropylamine (32.84%), and vernolat (49.02%) were observed at [NH2Cl](0):[precursor](0) = 500, but highest yields of trifluralin (30.24%) and oryzalin (25.53%) were accomplished at [NH2Cl](0):[precursor](0) = 50. Bromide and organic contents in tap and raw water reduced NDPA due to competition for NH2Cl. Chloramination of water impacted by amines and pesticides should be careful of NDPA formation.

AB Macroporous cryogels for capturing cisplatin were synthesized by cryogelation polymerization of methacrylic acid and 2-hydroxyethyl metacrylate. The cryogel materials exhibited good mechanical property, high swelling ratio and high affinity for cisplatin, with an adsorption capacity of up to 150 mg cisplatin per gram of cryogel. The correlation between the capacity of the cryogel and the monomer composition in the material was investigated in this study. The physical and chemical properties of the cryogels were studied in detail using scanning electron microscopy, textural analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The optimal cryogel can be reused for at least 14 cycles of adsorption/desorption to remove cisplatin from water without noticeable reduction of capacity. The experimental results suggest that the cryogel may be used as affinity adsorbents to remove cisplatin from wastewater discharged from pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals.

AB In this work, lanthanum vanadate (LaVO4) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized to develop stable nanocomposites of CNTs/LaVO4 with mass ratios of 0.1% and 0.3%. The nanocomposites were employed to investigate the photocatalytic degradation of a sulphonamide antibiotic namely sulfamethazine (SMZ) in both suspension and dip coating modes. The characterization by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectrometry revealed successful synthesis of the composites. Operating parameters (such as solution pH, catalyst dose and light intensity) were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. Radical scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radicals, holes and superoxide radicals contributed to the degradation of SMZ. In order to examine the treatment performance in the dip coating mode, CNTs/LaVO4 was immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane. The reusability of immobilized CNTs/LaVO4 was evaluated in five consecutive runs revealing high stability of the composite after long periods of photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, a possible degradation pathway was suggested based on a rigorous identification of the transformation products by mass spectrometry.

AB The silver nanoparticles were prepared in the membrane by employing graphene oxide as a carrier. The structure and properties of GO-Ag/PVDF/F127 modified membrane were regulated by using isopropanol (IPA) as the coagulation bath based on the principle of non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The modified membrane prepared by the 50% IPA coagulation bath owned a well-distributed spongy-like pore morphology. Meanwhile, the modified membrane showed excellent hydrophilicity, permeability and optimum mechanical properties. In summary, the membrane MPGOAg-50% possessed the better performance with pure water flux of 87.10 L.m-2.h(-1), the BSA rejection rate of 94.7% and the contact angle of 70. 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) was a typical contaminant in the wastewater, its reduction product 4-aminophenol (4-AP) played a vital role in the preparation of some antipyretic and analgesic drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the performance of modified membranes controlled by coagulation bath was investigated by filtration reduction of 4-nitrophenol. The calculated reaction rate constant was higher than that reported under the same conditions. The modified membrane controlled by the IPA coagulation bath hold a reduction efficiency of 85% and remained stable for at least 1 h.

AB Wastewater generated from industries contains numerous contaminants, among which heavy metals (HMs) are non-degradable. This research work highlights the use of commonly used ornamental plants, Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L., with compost (C) and peat moss (M), and rhizospheric bacterial augmentation using Pseudomonas japonica, for the phytostabilization of HMs from synthetic wastewater. After plant-soil acclimatization, plants were exposed for 6 weeks to synthetic wastewater, containing cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc concentrations (based on the HMs level of wastewaters collected from textile and pharmaceutical industry). Physiological response, biochemical status, and enzymatic fluctuations of plants and the distribution of HMs in plant parts and soil, were quantified. With the combined use (5% each v/v conditioner/soil) of C and M, in bio-augmented soil, physiological response and enzymatic status of both plants improved, with decreased stress injury due to HMs. Further, the plant HMs uptake was reduced, with better stabilization of HM in soil. For better phytostabilization of HMs in wastewater, the use of compost, peat moss, and bacterial augmentation is recommended with Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L.

AB The increasing levels of diclofenac sodium (DS) detection in aquatic environments have been causing great concern, thus the efficient removal of DS is of urgent importance. In this study, for the first time a composite with MgAl/layered double hydroxide supported on Syagrus coronata biochar was fabricated, characterized and used for diclofenac sodium adsorption. The physicochemical characterizations, including X-ray, FT-IR, N-2 adsorption and microscopy, confirmed the composite was successfully synthesized. Adsorption batch experiments demonstrated a high DS removal efficiency (higher of 82% for 200 mg.L-1 of DS). Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicated the limiting adsorption mechanism was chemisorption providing maximumadsorption capacity of 138.83 and 168.04 mg.g(-1) at 30 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Thermo dynamics suggested DS adsorption was spontaneous, exothermic and created modification in the adsorbent structure. All these findings suggested that the composite is an efficient and promising material for DS-contaminated water treatment, achieving superior adsorption capacity compared with other adsorbents (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although several studies confirmed a wide distribution of pharmaceuticals in rivers and streams, a limited knowledge is available about the partitioning of pharmaceuticals between the water phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM). To close this gap of knowledge, we developed and validated a sensitive and high throughput analytical method for the analysis of 57 pharmaceuticals, 42 metabolites and transformation products (TP) as well as the artificial sweetener acesulfame sorbed to SPM. The method was based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by a clean-up via solvent exchange and detection via direct injection-reversed phase LC-MS/MS and freeze-drying-HILIC-MS/MS. Freundlich isotherms were determined for 90 analytes. All showed a linear sorption behavior. Distribution coefficients (K-d) ranged from 0.64 L/kg to 9300 L/kg. For 18 pharmaceuticals, K-d values were found to be above 100 L/kg. SPM of annual composite samples were analyzed to determine the pharmaceutical concentrations between 2005 and 2015 at four sites of the river Rhine: Weil, Iffezheim, Koblenz and Bimmen as well as between 2006 and 2015 at one site of the river Saar, at Rehlingen. In these SPM samples, up to 61 of the 100 analytes were detected with concentrations up to 190 ng/g d.w. (dry weight) for guanylurea, a transformation product of the antidiabetic metformin. For most analytes, increasing concentrations were found along the length of the Rhine and higher concentrations were measured in Rehlingen/Saar. Normalization of the data with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine as an intrinsic tracer for municipal wastewater indicated possible industrial discharges for four analytes. For most pharmaceuticals, the annual concentrations exhibited a good correlation with the consumption volumes in Germany. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Endoxifen is an effective metabolite of a common chemotherapy agent, tamoxifen. Endoxifen, which is toxic to aquatic animals, has been detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This research investigates ultraviolet (UV) radiation (253.7 nm) application to degrade (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water and wastewater and phototransformation by-products (PBPs) and their toxicity. The effects of light intensity, pH and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen on the photodegradation rate were examined. Endoxifen in water was eliminated >= 99.1% after 35 s of irradiation (light dose of 598.5 mJ cm(-2)). Light intensity and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen exhibited positive trends with the photodegradation rates while pH had no effect. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water resulted in three PBPs. Toxicity assessments through modeling of the identified PBPs suggest higher toxicity than the parent compounds. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in wastewater at light doses used for disinfection in WWTPs (16, 30 and 97 mJ cm(-2)) resulted in reductions of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen from 30 to 71%. Two of the three PBPs observed in the experiments with water were detected in the wastewater experiments. Therefore, toxic compounds are potentially generated at WWTPs by UV disinfection if (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen are present in treated wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water scarcity is a natural condition in the Mediterranean rim countries. In this region, reuse of reclaimed water (RW) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is becoming a potential source for highly water-demanding activities such as agriculture. However, the removal capacity of contaminants in regular WWTPs has been found to be limited. Considering a Mediterranean scenario, this research investigated the plant uptake and translocation of three representative pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) typically present in RW samples from a WWTP located in an urban area in Spain, and assessed the potential risk to humans from plant consumption. The RW samples were collected and analyzed for three representative PPCPs (atenolol -ATN-, carbamazepine -CBZ- and triclosan -TCS-). The target contaminants were also spiked at two levels in the RW samples to consider two worst-case scenarios. Three plant models (lettuce, maize and radish) were grown outdoors and irrigated with four treatments: tap water; RW samples, and the two spiked RW samples. Generally speaking, results revealed an efficient root uptake for the three PPCPs regardless of plant species and fortification level, and suggested an interaction effect of treatment and plant organ. Different bioaccumulation and translocation potentials of the three PPCPs were seen into the aerial organs of the plants. Overall, these observations support the idea that factors including the physico-chemical properties of the PPCPs and physiological plant variables, could be responsible for the differential accumulation and translocation potentials observed. These variables could be critical for crops irrigated with RW in regions with extended dry seasons, high solar incidence and low annual rainfall such as those in the Mediterranean rim where plants are subjected to high transpiration rates. However, the results obtained from this experimental approach suggested a negligible risk to humans from consumption of edible plants irrigated with RW samples with presence of PPCPs, despite the fact that the three representative PPCPs under study accumulated efficiently in the plants.

AB This research was performed to assess the production of reclaimed water from urban wastewater in membrane bioreactor - advanced oxidation process (MBR-AOP) and moving bed biofilm reactor - membrane bioreactor - advanced oxidation process (MBBR-MBR-AOP) combined treatments to study the effect of biofilm incorporation. Both combined treatments were operated at the same conditions (10 h of hydraulic retention time, 6500 mg/L of mixed liquor suspended solids and 25 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide dosage over 15 min). Additionally, the removal capacity of some pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen) and their impact on the kinetic behaviour of the biomass in both systems were evaluated. From the results, it was found a membrane-based bioreactor can achieve both wastewater secondary treatment and pre-treatment for advanced oxidation process, so both MBR-AOP and MBBR-MBR-AOP treatments have a great potential to produce high quality reclaimed water (biological oxygen demand <0.5 mgO(2)/L, suspended solids <1 mg/L, turbidity <1 NTU and no presence of E. coli), according to European Commission proposal 2018/0169/COD. The addition of carriers improved the biodegradation of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in the biological treatment (from 69.20 +/- 1.54% to 75.14 +/- 2.71% for carbamazepine and from 60.41 +/- 2.16 to 63.14 +/- 2.70% for ciprofloxacin). It had, as a consequence, the MBBR-MBR-AOP system showing a complete degradation of pharmaceuticals after 5 min AOP treatment compared to the MBR-AOP system. The loss of biomass in the MBR-AOP (from 5233.45 to 4451.92 mg/L) and the increase of the substrate degradation rate for organic matter in both treatments (from 37.27 to 41.42 and from 30.25 to 33.19 mgO(2)/(L.h) in MBR-AOP and MBBR-MBR-AOP, respectively) are some of the consequences of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater.

AB Attenuation of organic compounds in sewage treatment plants (STPs) is affected by a complex interplay between chemical (e.g. ionization, hydrolysis), physical (e.g. sorption, volatilization), and biological (e.g. biodegradation, microbial acclimation) processes. These effects should be accounted for individually, in order to develop predictive cheminformatics tools for STPs. Using measured data from 70 STPs in the Netherlands for 69 chemicals (pharmaceuticals, herbicides, etc.), we highlighted the influences of 1) chemical ionization, 2) sorption to sludge, and 3) acclimation of the microbial consortia on the primary removal of chemicals. We used semi-empirical corrections for each of these influences to deduce biodegradation rate constants upon which quantitative structure-biodegradation relationships (QSBRs) were developed. As shown by a global QSBR, biodegradation in STPs generally relates to structural complexity, size, energetics, and charge distribution. Statistics of the global QSBR were reasonable, being R-training(2) = 0.69 (training set of 51 compounds) and R-validation(2) = 0.50 (validation set of 18 compounds). Class-specific QSBRs utilized electronic properties potentially relating to rate-limiting enzymatic steps. For class-specific QSBRs, values of R-2 of in between 0.7 and 0.8 were obtained. With caution, environmental risk assessment methodologies may apply these models to estimate biodegradation rates for 'data-poor' compounds. The approach also highlights 'meta data' on STP operational parameters needed to develop QSBRs of better predictability in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective removal of organic contaminants in wastewater effluent poses a challenge to small communities worldwide, particularly in the Arctic due to infrastructure challenges and harsh climates. To understand better the efficacy of current treatment options and risks posed by pharmaceuticals and pesticides on receiving waters in the Arctic, four representative human communities in Nunavut, Canada were evaluated. Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) were also investigated in one community. These communities have treatment ranging from primary lagoons, engineered wetlands, and natural lakes. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides were measured using the organic diffusive gradients in thin film (o-DGT) passive sampler in summer 2018. Of the 34 compounds studied, seven pharmaceuticals were found at least once: atenolol, carbamazepine, metoprolol, naproxen, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. With the exception of 5210 ng naproxen/L in lqaluit, most receiving waters showed negligible amounts of contamination. lqaluit had the poorest overall system performance while Baker Lake had the best. Measured pharmaceutical concentrations do not appear to pose a significant acute hazard to receiving waters at this time, based on known toxicological endpoints. PFAS concentrations were found to be over 100-fold greater in Cambridge Bay wastewater than previously reported Arctic seawater. Results suggest that wastewater may be an important point source of PFASs in Arctic communities. The o-DGT passive samplers performed well in marine Arctic settings. We recommend further testing of wastewater efficiencies in Arctic communities along with evaluations of seasonal variations. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The production and usage of antibiotics have been increasing rapidly with the improving quality of life and the rapid development of aquaculture, thus inducing the introduction of these antibiotics residues into the environment, increasing water pollution levels. Due to bioaccumulation, bacteriostatic activity, many of these threaten aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Here we prepared double-shelled ZnSnO3 hollow cubes for efficient photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic wastewater. The ZnSnO3, synthesized via co-precipitation, shows superior performance and stability compared to that prepared by hydrothermal and template-assisted methods. The prepared ZnSnO3 effectively photocatalyzed the degradation of not only ciprofloxacin and sulfamonomethoxine pharmaceutical wastewater, but also methylene blue, rhodamine B and methyl orange dye wastewater. The hollow structure facilitates the adsorption of dye molecules and provides a better platform for direct interaction between dye molecules and photocatalysts. Moreover, the antibacterial activity test for photocatalytic degradation effluent indicated that the biotoxicity of CIP toward Escherichia coli DH5a was eliminated after the ZnSnO3 photocatalysis under simulated irradiation. This study not only demonstrates an efficient photocatalyst, but also further indicates the effectiveness of photocatalytic technology in the treatment of antibiotic wastewater.

AB Despite their impressive plasmonic photocatalytic activity, nanosized silver and silver halides always suffer from serious agglomeration and photocorrosion, thus are severely restricted in the practical wastewater restoration applications. The design and realization of plasmonic heterojunction nanostructures is an effective way to solve this stability problem, yet the ideal plasmonic catalyst dispersion and immobilization remains a great challenge. In this work, a highly immobilized Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4 plasmonic photocatalyst was developed through a rational in-situ implanting approach, in which the Ag can be homodispersely distributed and strongly coupled with prefixed Cl sites on g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and element mapping images clearly proved the homodispersely distribution of nanosized Ag@AgCl on the CNNS. The optimal Ag@AgCl-3/CNNS plasmonic photocatalyst with a narrow band gap of 2.45 eV and large specific surface area of 52.9 m(2)/g performs well in model pharmaceutical wastewater bleaching reactions under visible light. More importantly, the Ag@AgCl-3/CNNS show good stability compared with the conventional inhomogeneously coupled AgCl/g-C3N4 control as verified by their ultralow silver leakage rate in water (0.00152 mg/gd, accounts 6.9% that of the control) and a much lower corrosion current density (Icorr = 1.63 vs. 3.45 mu A), recorded by Tafel slopes. The synergetic effect of surface plasmon resonance effect of nanosized Ag@AgCl with strong visible light harvesting ability and strong coupling between Ag@AgCl and exfoliated porous g-C3N4 nanosheets can support the fast separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency in the bleaching of antibiotic pollutants and bacteria. This work affords the great potential of the rational in-situ implanting design for high-performance and stable plasmonic photocatalysts.

AB Parabens, triclosan, and lipid regulators are frequently used in pharmaceuticals, personal care, hygiene, food, and other products. The final destination of these compounds frequently is domestic sewage. In many cases, collection and treatment systems are not completely efficient, and these compounds reach the environment. However, many of these substances are toxic, and their presence poses risks to several organisms. This study has the goal to determine the occurrence of five personal care products and two lipid regulators in three rivers in southern Brazil. Four sampling campaigns were conducted in December, March, June, and October in three rivers. Risk assessment was performed, and the general index of human contamination (GIHC) was used to evaluate water pollution in the area. Compounds were analyzed using an Agilent GC-MS/MS 7890A chromatograph. The monitoring and reaction mode (MRM) was employed for the detection and quantification of the compounds. Gemfibrozil was detected in concentrations up to 2590 ng L-1 and personal care products up to 788 ng L-1. Fenofibrate was not detected in any sample, while gemfibrozil, methylparaben, propylparaben, and triclosan were detected in all samples. Risk assessment indicated that triclosan, propylparaben, and gemfibrozil should be designated as priority compounds in the area. GIHC is a simple and efficient tool to assess pollution in urban areas and can be employed in future studies. The results indicated that areas upstream of the WWTPs had higher contamination levels than downstream, indicating that diffuse pollution and illegal effluent discharges may have a strong influence on the water quality in the area.

AB In this study, a hydrophilic resin named GCHM was fabricated based on poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-co-divinylbenzene), characterized, and applied as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) material. Up to 44 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to 10 classes were recovered in environmental water samples. Different variables affecting extraction, such as adsorbent amount, sample pH, and loading speed, were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the average absolute recovery of 44 PPCPs was 75.6% using GCHM, indicating a better performance than the commercial Oasis(R) HLB. SPE with home-made hydrophilic polymeric sorbent followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was validated, and the method achieved good linearity (r(2) >0.991, for all analytes). In addition, the method detection limits of target compounds ranged from 0.03 to 0.6 ng/L. The developed method was applied to determine PPCPs in 10 environmental water samples taken from the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Taihu Lake, 1 groundwater sample from Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, 1 wastewater sample from Xiamen and 2 seawater samples from the Jiulong River in Fujian Province, China. In these samples, 22 compounds were determined at levels ranging from 0.5 to 1590 ng/L.

AB A method for the simultaneous determination of 18 home and personal care chemicals (HPCCs) in river water and wastewater was developed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (SPE and UPLC/MS/MS). A series of tests were designed to find the potential background interference and loss of HPCCs during the sample preservation and pretreatment process. Our results suggested that a considerable amount of some target compounds were lost with increasing days of storage even at 4 degrees C. Accordingly, the samples were stored acidified and refrigerated, including during transportation, to reduce the losses. Experiments on filtration of water samples suggested that recoveries of many HPCCs were significantly affected by the filtration. It is therefore recommended to avoid filtration of water samples where possible. The internal standard corrected recoveries for the HPCCs ranged from 64.2 to 107.0%, except for benzisothiazolone which did not have an appropriate internal standard, in river water which was considered to be the most difficult matrix. The method detection limits for river water, influent and effluent samples were in the ranges of 0.17 to 42 ng/L, 13 to 5100 ng/L, and 0.50 to 200 ng/L, respectively. The validated method was applied for the determination of HPCCs in sewage water collected from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a typical urban city in Northeast China and from river water upstream and downstream of the WWTP. Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, caffeine, methyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride, triclocarban, and triclosan were the major compounds detected in the river water and wastewater samples. Sampling variability for the WWTP (intra-day and inter-day) and cross-river was also determined with the purpose of designing future monitoring requirements. Small variations in these samples confirmed that composite samples and a single sampling event would be representative for future use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biofilters, similar to those already used for, e.g., removing particles from stormwater and combined sewer overflow can remove organic micropollutants from polluted waters. This study investigated the effects on removal of pharmaceuticals with pulse loadings of increased amounts of pre-settled raw wastewater to four individual biofilters containing different materials (sand, filtralite, stonewool, and sand amended with 1% peat). The effect of increasing BOD concentration to the removal rate constants could be divided into two groups; 1) compounds influenced by increasing loading of BOD: atenolol, propranolol, venlafaxine, citalopram, metoprolol, iohexol, and diclofenac 2) compounds only little or not influenced by increasing concentration of BOD: sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, trimethoprim, iomeprol, and carbamazepine. Though BOD clearly had effects on the degradation, no indications towards a complete stop of the degradation were observed under any circumstances. The different biofilter materials influenced (indirectly) the removal of micropollutants: While the overall best performance was seen in the filtralite biofilter, the stonewool biofilter generally had the lowest removal rate constants. Furthermore, we observed different metabolic pathways of metoprolol in the four different biofilters under formation (and removal) of metoprolol acid, a-hydroxymetoprolol, and O-desmethylmetoprolol.

AB Wastewater may contain a diverse group of unregulated pollutants known as emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Triclosan (TCS) is a personal care product widely used as an antiseptic or preservative in cosmetics, hand wash, toothpaste and deodorant soaps. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been used as effective and alternative treatments for complex wastewater. However, an important criterion for the assessment of AOPs and their operation conditions could be the potential formation of new toxic secondary products, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Is), especially when emerging pollutants are present in the media. If these are omitted from environmental management studies, the real environmental impacts of a WWIPs (wastewater treatment plants) may be underestimated. Consequently, the current study aims to evaluate the environmental impacts derived from electrooxidation (EOX), one of the most effective oxidation technologies, of emerging pollutants using Life Cycle Assessment. The analyses were performed for the treatment of effluents containing TCS, firstly without considering the formation of PCDD/Fs and, thereafter, considering the effects of these compounds. Total toxicity, calculated through different methods and corresponding impact factors, were evaluated for each stage of the process when different electrolytes are used, including PCDD/Fs formation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to study i) the effect of the TCS initial concentration on the environmental impacts associated to ecotoxicity for the different life cycle methods and ii) the influence of changing the organic pollutant on PCDD/Fs formation employing 2-chlorophenol (2-CP). As a result, LCIA methods demonstrate that they are not fully adapted to the computation of PCDD/Fs in the water compartment, since only 2,3,7,8-tetraclorodibenzo-p-dioxina (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is present as a substance in the impact categories assessed, ignoring the remaining list of PCDD/Fs.

AB The consumption of methylphenidate, a nootropic drug used to improve mental performance, is becoming increasingly serious. Methylphenidate is metabolized in human liver to ritalinic acid, which has been commonly detected in sewage and surface waters. Additionally, ritalinic acid serves as a biomarker in sewage epidemiology studies. Thus knowledge of the stability and microbial degradation pathways of ritalinic acid is essential for proper estimation of methylphenidate consumption. In the study reported here, we describe the fast formation of a previously unknown, dead-end metabolite of ritalinic acid by Nocardioides sp. strain MW5. HRMS and 2D NMR analyses allowed precisely identification of the compound as an imidazole-based alkaloid cation with chemical formula 11-[3-(formylamino)propyl]-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octahydrodipyrido [1,2-a:1',2'-dimidazole-5-ium. In experiments, Nocardioides sp. strain MW5 transformed 34% of ritalinic acid into this metabolite, while 52% was mineralized into CO2. Alkaloid was not biodegraded during the OECD 301 F test. This study provides new insight into the environmental fate of methylphenidate and its metabolites. The data collected are essential for assessing nootropic drug consumption by sewage epidemiology and should lead to a better understanding of microbial degradation of ritalinic acid.

AB Water quality and safety of tailwater is crucial to achieve sustainability of water resources. However, the traditional monitoring method based on chemical and physical indicators cannot reflect the actual biological effects. The objective of this study was to provide effective biological indicators in water quality monitoring and the safe discharge of sewage. The influent, secondary effluent, and tailwater were sampled from three sewage treatment plants with different advanced-treatment processes (wetland, ozone + ultraviolet, and filter + ultraviolet), and the removal efficiencies of the tail water on acute toxicity and genotoxicity were assessed by Vicia faba micronucleus test, acute comprehensive evaluation (TU), and genotoxicity test. The results showed that physical and chemical indicators could meet the national standards of pollutant discharge in urban sewage treatment plants, and the biological toxicity of the tail water after each treatment process significantly reduced. According to TU method, the biological acute toxicity of the treated effluent had obvious decrease by 25.49%, 30.43%, and 30.85% in the deep treatment process of wetland, ozone + ultraviolet, and filter + ultraviolet respectively, and Selenastrum capricornutum was not suitable for the comprehensive acute toxicity evaluation. The treated effluents by ozone + ultraviolet had the highest degree of genetic toxicity reduction (35.9%) compared to undercurrent wetland (33.63%), and filter + ultraviolet (11.19%). Correlation analysis demonstrated that TP concentration was significantly negative correlation with the toxicity of Selenastrum capricornutum and the growth inhibition of Selenastrum capricornutum, which can act as indicator species represented by TP concentrations.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant medication with highly persistent properties in the aquatic environment, where it has the potential to affect nontarget biota. Because CBZ and many other pharmaceuticals are not readily removed in conventional sewage treatment plants (STP), additional STP effluent treatment technologies are being evaluated and implemented. Whole effluent ozonation is a prospective method to remove pharmaceuticals such as CBZ, yet knowledge on the toxicity of CBZ ozonation byproducts (OBPs) is lacking. This study presents, for the first time, in vivo individual and mixture toxicity of four putative OBPs, that is, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide, 10,11-Dihydrocarbamazepine, 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM), and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. BQM and BQD were isolated from the ozonated solution as they were not commercially available. The study confirmed that the OBP mixture caused embryotoxic responses comparable to that of ozonated CBZ. Individual compound embryotoxicity assessment further revealed that BQM and BQD were the drivers of embryotoxicity. OBP chemical stability in ozonated CBZ water solution during 2 week dark storage at 22 degrees C was also assessed. The OBP concentrations remained over time, except for BQD which decreased by 94%. Meanwhile, ozonated CBZ persistently induced embryotoxicity over 2 week storage, potentially illustrating environmental concern.

AB The capability of ozone to reduce the hazardous impact of environmentally persistent antibiotic tiamulin in term of toxicity reduction and enhancement of biodegradability was investigated. Different ozone doses were applied but ozonation was not effective enough to increase the biodegradability of tiamulin in the aqueous phase. The opposite effect was observed in anaerobic digestion experiments, where ozonation as a pretreatment step of antibiotic-contaminated sludge detoxify tiamulin and improves biogas production for 75%. As confirmed by H-1 NMR and HPLC-HRMS analyses, the tiamulin molecule completely reacts with ozone at low ozone/COD molar ratio of 0.03, primarily attacking the vinyl double bond with further oxidation of sulfur and nitrogen atom, and gradual decomposition of tiamulin skeleton.

AB In this study, a screening of 26 selected antimicrobials using liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry method in two Polish wastewater treatment plants and their receiving surface waters was provided. The highest average concentrations of metronidazole (7400 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (4300 ng/L), vancomycin (3200 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (3000 ng/L) were observed in influent of WWTP2. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were the most dominant antimicrobials in influent and effluent of both WWTPs. In the sludge samples the highest mean concentrations were found for ciprofloxacin (up to 28 mu g/g) and norfloxacin (up to 5.3 mu g/g). The removal efficiency of tested antimicrobials was found to be more than 50% for both WWTPs. However, the presence of antimicrobials influenced their concentrations in the receiving waters. The highest antimicrobial resistance risk was estimated in influent of WWTPs for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and trimethoprim and in the sludge samples for the following antimicrobials: azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, and tetracycline. The high environmental risk for exposure to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole to both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic species in effluents and/or receiving water was noted. Following the obtained results, we suggest extending the watch list of the Water Framework Directive for Union-wide monitoring with sulfamethoxazole.

AB Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds employed as medicinal drugs. They have severe physic-chemical properties which make them destructive for non-target species. Consequently, their continuous addition in the environment may pose hazardous effects. Among these, diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is extensively used in Pakistan which may lead to its accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic environment. Present study aims to assess the presence and concentration of pharmaceutically active drug (DCF) in surface water and wastewater of twin cities of Pakistan (Rawalpindi and Islamabad). For this purpose, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was adopted involving solid-phase extraction procedure. Wastewater samples were collected from various sites of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Results of HPLC analysis revealed that DCF was extant with considerably high concentration, not only in wastewater but also in surface water samples. Concentrations as high as 216 mu g L-1 was detected in Rawat industrial area and low as 8 mu g L-1 was detected in dairy farm wastewater samples collected from Taramri. However, maximum DCF levels in residential wastewater and hospital wastewater were detected to be 105 mu g L-1 and 34 mu g L-1, respectively. Moreover, the highest detected level (116 mu g L-1) was found in surface water of Sawan River. Further, results of ecological risk assessment revealed its possible toxic effects of DCF on various aquatic organisms.

AB The present research work involved the effectiveness of seven different sorbents (three inorganics, three organic, and one biopolymer) in eliminating sixteen micropollutants (dyes, metals, organophosphates, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food additives, surfactants, and cosmetics), nitrogen and phosphorus was investigated in batch mode study using wastewater. Three inorganic sorbents were silica gel/rice flour decorated biochar, Ca/rice flour decorated biochar and bentonite clay whereas organic materials comprised of organic charcoal, fruit peel (kiwi) and Aloe vera and one biopolymer was magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads. The maximum nitrogen (93%) and phosphorus (73%) were removed by inorganic sorbents efficiently as compared to other sorbents. Maximum dyes removal was occurred by magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads (96%), whereas the highest metals (93%) and pesticides (94%) removal were investigated by using inorganic sorbents. The surfactants and pharmaceuticals showed promising removal y using organic sorbents. Magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads showed the highest removal efficiency (93%-97%) for food additives. Whereas cosmetics and organophosphates were moderately eliminated by all sorbents. Analysis of variance was applied to data to calculate the difference in removal capacity. The results showed that both Langmuir and Freundlich's isotherms were best fitted to experimental data.

AB In the presented study, the feasibility of using activated carbon and graphene oxide embedded chitosan-poly (vinyl alcohol) (AC/CS-PVA and GO/CS-PVA) biocomposites as adsorbents for removal of ibuprofen from wastewater. The point of zero charge values, effect of AC and GO content in the biocomposites, optimum amount of biocomposites, optimum pH and ibuprofen concentration were considered. When AC and GO were embedded into CS-PVA polymer network, the ibuprofen removal performance increased from 11% to 83% and 94%, respectively. Adsorption isotherms were described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R), Temkin, Halsey, Jovanovic, Elovich, and Harkins-Jura isotherm models. Freundlich, Temkin, Halsey, Elovich, and Harkins-Jura models were fitted to the adsorption better than Langmuir, D-R, and Jovanovic models. Adsorption kinetics was investigated by pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, Weber-Morris, and Bangham models and ibuprofen adsorption onto biocomposites represented by pseudo-second order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameter, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees, and Delta G degrees, values were determined and the enthalpy of ibuprofen adsorption was found positive supporting the endothermic nature of pharmaceutical pollutant adsorption. The influence of various operating variables and optimum process conditions for the ibuprofen adsorption was investigated using central composite design.

AB A BiOCl-Bi12O17Cl2 nanocomposite with a high visible-light response and a low photoinduced electron-hole pair recombination rate was successfully synthesized using an ultrasonic-hydrothermal method. The texture, structure, optical, and photocatalytic properties of the composite were characterized. The results showed that the composite had a sheet flower-like structure with a large specific surface area. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra and photoluminescence spectra showed that the composite had an excellent visible-light response and a low recombination rate of photoinduced electron hole pairs. The photocatalytic property of the composite was evaluated by the removal efficiency of rhodamine B and ciprofloxacin under visible-light illumination. The composite's reaction rate constant of removing rhodamine B (/ciprofloxacin) was approximately 8.14 (/4.94), 42.63 (/11.91) and 64.66 (/36.07) times that of Bi12O17Cl2, P25, and BiOCl, respectively. Furthermore, the composite showed a wide applicable pH range and excellent reusability. Mechanism analysis showed that photogenerated holes played a dominant role and center dot O-2- also contributed to photocatalytic degradation. In summary, this study presents a high-efficiency photocatalyst for wastewater treatment. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In urban, industrial, and agricultural areas, a vast array of contaminants may be found because they are introduced into the aquifers by different recharge sources. The emerging contaminants (ECs) correspond to unregulated contaminants, which may be candidates for future regulation depending on the results of research into their potential effects on health and on monitoring data regarding their occurrence. ECs frequently found in wastewater, such as acetaminophen, carbamazepine, primidone, and sulfamethoxazole, may be good indicators of the introduction of the reclaimed water to the aquifers. The resistance of the ECs to removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) causes them to be appropriate sewage markers. Plana de Castellon (Spain) is a coastal area that has been characterized by intensive citrus agriculture since the 1970s. Traditionally, in the southern sector of Plana de Castellon, 100% of irrigation water comes from groundwater. In recent years, local farmers have been using a mixture of groundwater and reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to irrigate the citrus. The aims of the present study were: (i) to assess the occurrences, spatial distributions, and concentrations of selected ECs, including 32 antibiotics, 8 UV filters, and 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in groundwater in a common agricultural context; (ii) to identify the recharge (pollution) sources acting as the origin of the ECs, and (iii) to suggest ECs as indicators of reclaimed water arrival in detrital heterogeneous aquifers. The obtained data provided relevant information for the management of water resources and elucidated the fate and behavior of emerging contaminants in similar contexts.

AB There is a growing concern about pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic environment. Many of these compounds cannot be removed completely in sewage treatment plants. To remove these unwanted medicines from water, oxidative degradation techniques may complement the current purification steps. In this paper we studied the effect of advanced oxidation on the cytostatic drug cyclophosphamide (CP) by comparing thermal plasma activation with UV/H2O2 treatment. Plasma activated water (PAW) contains highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as a result of electric gas discharges in air over water. CP solutions in tap water were oxidized over a period of 120 min and subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS to measure the compound degradation. Plasma activation was applied at 50, 100, or 150 W electric power input and UV/H2O2 treatment was carried out by the addition of H(2)O(2 )and placing an UV-C source above the test solution for immediate irradiation. The oxidative degradation of CP in PAW resulted in a complete degradation within 80 min at 150 W. CP was also completely degraded within 60 min applying UV/H2O2 oxidation. Both treatment techniques do induce different structural changes, demonstrating that CP is completely degraded in tap water.

AB Antibiotics are resistant to biodegradation, and their removal by biological processes is difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the removal of azithromycin from water using ultraviolet radiation (UV), Fe (VI) oxidation process and ZnO nanoparticles. The effect of different parameters such as pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), the concentration of Fe (VI) and ZnO nanoparticles and UV intensity on the removal of azithromycin from water was investigated. The optimal conditions for the removal of azithromycin were a pH of 2, a temperature of 25 degrees C, a HRT of 15 min, and a ratio of ZnO nanoparticles to the initial concentration of azithromycin (A/P) of 0.00009 which was fitted by Langmuir isotherm. In addition, the optimal conditions for the removal of azithromycin using UV radiation were a pH of 7, a temperature of 65 degrees C, a HRT of 60 min, and UV radiation power of 163 mW/cm(2). For the Fe (VI) oxidation process, the optimal conditions were a pH of 2, a temperature of 50 degrees C and a HRT of 20 min. Also, the optimal ratio of Fe (VI) to the initial concentration of antibiotic was between 0.011 and 0.012. The results of this study showed that the Fe (VI) oxidation process, UV radiation, and ZnO nanoparticles were efficient methods for the removal of azithromycin from water.

AB This research aims to compare the disinfection and degradation effectiveness in water of a commercial suspension of nano-TiO2 (TiO(2)Levenger) with the standard TiO(2)Degussa P25. Photo-inactivation and photo-degradation experiments were conducted with UVA-vis light. Concerning the disinfection, the effects of TiO2 dose (0-2 g/l), water matrix, bacterium type (Gram-positive or Gram-negative), and bacterial regrowth after the photo-treatments were studied for each catalyst. The experimental results show that Enterococcus sp. (Gram-positive) was more resistant to the photo-treatments than Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) for both catalyst; however, postirradiation trends showed similar behavior for both bacteria, favoring regrowth for short-treated cells and decay for longer-treated ones. Caffeine was selected as a model substance of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. In terms of caffeine removal, the effects of TiO2 dose (0-2 g/l) and water matrix were analyzed. Besides, the comparison between mechanical coagulation-flocculation-decantation and simple decantation of TiO2 was carried out. The results show that simple decantation allowed the recovery of 97.5% of TiO2 Degussa P25 and TiO2 Levenger within 1 day of simple decantation, while applying the proposed mechanical coagulation-flocculation decantation 99.7% of recovery of both catalysts was achieved in 2 hours. Finally, the subsequent reuse of both catalysts was proved with little loss of efficiency in terms of photo-disinfection during the four cycles. Nevertheless, the standard TiO2 Degussa P25 photo-degradation efficiency of caffeine decreases considerably as compared to commercial suspension of TiO2 Levenger concerning the reutilization.

AB Benzophenone-3, benzophenone-8, and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor are used in sunscreens because they can protect the skin from UV radiation. The widespread use of organic UV filters may mean that they directly or indirectly enter seawater during recreational activities or through sewage discharge. In this study, a simple and efficient method using 1-octanol:isooctane (2:8, v/v) as an extraction solvent and liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed to measure trace levels of organic UV filters in seawater samples. This proposed method proved to be a highly sensitive, low-cost, and green analytical tool that requires minimal sample preparation. The method was validated and it exhibited favorable performance as well as acceptable accuracy (67 to 115%), precision (2.1 to 7.3%), coefficients of determination (0.9952 < R-2 < 0.9987), sensitivity (limits of quantification [3.3 to 5.7 ng L-1]), and an acceptable matrix effect (87 to 99%). This methodology was successfully applied to analyze seawater taken from Kenting National Park located in the Hengchun Peninsula of southern Taiwan. Benzophenone-3 was detected at all sampling sites and at a higher concentration than the other organic UV filters. The highest concentration of benzophenone-3 was 514.6 ng L-1 in a sample collected from Baisha Beach.

AB The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals also produces wastes, mainly wastewaters (WWs). These WWs must be responsibly managed. Sometimes, the organic contents of these WWs are not easily removable in standard WW treatment, hence technical options must be investigated to pretreat such WWs in order to remove or destroy the recalcitrant compounds, mostly the active pharmaceutical ingredients themselves. This contribution from a pharmaceuticals company describes WW assessment and management principles, the search for pretreatment options and several case studies on WW (pre)treatment at some pharma production sites of the Roche Group.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) has attracted increasing attention for seawater and brackish water desalination, wastewater treatment, and concentration of juices and pharmaceutical solutions due to its feasibility of using low-grade energy and achieving high solute rejection. However, the successful implementation of MD technology is still impeded by membrane wetting resulted from membrane scaling by inorganic crystals and membrane fouling by organic matters in the feed solutions, especially when dealing with challenging wastewaters. Herein, this study describes a novel strategy to develop a robust and superhydrophobic membrane via electrospinning followed by electrospray to enhance membrane anti-wetting properties caused by scaling and fouling. The robust superhydmphobic membrane PDMS-3 comprised a superhydrophobic surface layer fabricated by electrospraying a PVDF/PDMS/silica fume blended solution and an electrospun nanofibrous PVDF support. The newly developed membrane PDMS-3 not only exhibited an outstanding superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 170 degrees +/- 1 degrees, but also showed a unique anti-abrasive feature, which still possessed a slippery superhydmphobic property after 40 abrasion cycles. Moreover, the DCMD tests revealed that this rigid superhydrophobic surface rendered PDMS-3 with the best anti-scaling and anti-fouling properties compared to the nanofibmus and commercial PVDF membranes. It could achieve a superior MD flux of 28 kg M-2 h(-1) and a stable salt rejection above 99.99% during a continuous 160-h DCMD operation when the feed and permeation solutions were 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at 333K and distillate water at 293 K, respectively. These results underline the importance of anti-abrasive superhydmphobic membrane development to deal with wastewaters containing diverse inorganic and organic matters via MD.

AB Ny-Alesund, one of four permanent settlements on Spitsbergen in Svalbard, is a research town that includes scientific institutes from many countries. Because of daily-used chemicals (e.g., pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)) used by residents in the area, generated sewage is considered as a point source in the Kongsfjorden. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify organic pollutants in the effluent and along the shoreline and offshore via target, suspect, and non-target screening using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. We tentatively identified 30 compounds using the suspect and non-target screening methods in effluent samples from our first visit to the settlement in 2016. Among these, 3 were false positive, 24 were confirmed, and the 3 remaining compounds were not confirmed because of a lack of reference standards. Of the confirmed, 21 were quantifiable and considered target compounds for the 2nd year study. The quantified compounds in the effluent samples in 2017 totaled 17, including PPCP5, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and their metabolites. Some of the compounds, such as caffeine, paraxanthine/theophylline, acetaminophen, cetirizine, diethyl toluamide (DEET), and icaridin, were also detected in the receiving seawater. The concentration range was from 4 to 280,000 ng/L in the effluent and 2-98 ng/L in the seawater. Other 24 compounds were tentatively identified in the second-year effluent samples. Five were further confirmed using reference standards. Prioritization was performed on the 47 substances screened in Ny-Alesund using the exposure and toxicity index. As the result, the top seven substances of concern present were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), irbesartan, DEET, acetaminophen, caffeine, and paraxanthine/theophylline. As the effluent was identified as a source of the concerned organic pollutants, an emission reduction strategy should take place for protection of Arctic Fjorden environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of antibiotics has attracted much attention due to their extremely high adverse impacts on the environment. However, the potential risks of degradation intermediates are seldom reported. In this work, the influence of different factors on the electro-catalytic degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) by the prepared carbon nanotubes/agarose/indium tin oxide (CNTs/AG/ITO) electrode was investigated. Under optimal conditions (10 wt% CNTs dosage, pH = 7), the maximum degradation efficiency for TCH (10 mg L-1) reached up to 96% within 30 min treatment with 4 V potential. Superoxide anions (center dot O-2(-)) played an important role in the electro-catalytic degradation. Totally 10 degradation intermediates were identified using HPLC-MS/MS, and the degradation pathway was proposed. Toxicities of the parent antibiotic and the identified intermediates were calculated using the ECOSAR (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship) program in EPISuite, and results showed that more toxic intermediates were generated. The maximal chronic toxicity for green algae of the intermediate increased 1439.92 times. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity was further verified by disk agar biocidal tests with Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and higher biotoxicity intermediates compared with parent compounds were confirmed to be formed. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the potential risk of degradation intermediates in the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One emerging problem that recently has become a vastly acknowledged topic of concern is the environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most common pharmaceuticals found, due to its high utilization and low removal rate in wastewater treatment processes. In this work, Solanum the internal mechanisms triggered by this exposure. For this purpose, plants were exposed to two different DCF concentrations (0.5 mg L-1 and 5 mg L-1). Results obtained here point towards a loss of shoot performance when plants were exposed to very high concentrations of DCF, but no delay or loss of yield in the flowering and fruit stages were ascribed to DCF contamination. Our data shows that a state of oxidative stress due to high reactive oxygen species accumulation was associated with this contamination, with very high DCF levels leading to a rise of lipid peroxidation, possibly accentuated by the inhibition of ROS-scavenging enzymes and unable to be counteracted by the visible upregulation of proline and the thiol-based redox network. Overall, these results allow to infer that in the current environmental context, no noticeable negative effects should be associated with the presence of DCF in soils where this crop is cultivated. However, the oxidative stress and lower biomass associated with the highest concentration are alarming, since DCF levels in the environment are continuously increasing and further measures are necessary to assess this problematic.

In this study, for the first time, we report green route-synthesized plasmonic nanostructures (P-M-CQDs (where M: Au and Ag)) decorated onto TiO2 nanofibers for the treatment of toxic dye- and pharmaceutical drug-based wastewater. P-M-CQDs are efficaciously synthesized using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as the sole reducing and capping agent, wherein CQDs are derived via a green synthesis approach from Citrus limetta waste. The characteristic electron-donating property of CQDs played a key role in the reduction of Au3+ to Au-0 and Ag+ to Ag-0 under visible light irradiation to obtain P-Au-CQDs and P-Ag-CQDs, respectively. Thus, the obtained CQDs, P-Au-CQDs, and P-Ag-CQDs are loaded onto TiO2 nanofibers to obtain a P-M-CQD/TiO2 nanocomposite (NC), and are further probed via transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and UV-visible spectrophotometry. The degradation of organic pollutants and pharmaceutical drugs using methylene blue and erythromycin as model pollutants is mapped with UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate the complete MB dye degradation in 20 minutes with 1 mg mL(-1) of P-Au-CQD/TiO2 NC, which otherwise is 30 minutes for P-Ag@CQD/TiO2 dose under visible light irradiation. Similarly, the pharmaceutical drug was found to degrade in 150 minutes with P-Au-CQD/TiO2 photocatalysts. These findings reveal the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the green-synthesized Au decorated with TiO2 nanofibers and are attributed to the boosted SPR effect and aqueous-phase stability of Au nanostructures. This study opens a new domain of utilizing waste-derived and green-synthesized plasmonic nanostructures for the degradation of toxic/hazardous dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants in water.

AB Antibiotics have been regarded as new emerging micro-pollutants due to their relatively stable structure and resistance to biodegradation. Rice straw, as a natural environmentally friendly biological carrier and available solid carbon source, was effective in improving the performance of membrane bioreactor (MBR). Parallel experiments of conventional MBR and two composite MBRs with addition of rice straw (unmodified or modified) were conducted to investigate the removal and biodegradation mechanisms of antibiotics. The results showed that the removal efficiency of COD and NH4+-N was both high irrespective of adding rice straw or not, while TN removal increased from 24.55% in conventional MBR to 44.48% in unmodified straw-added MBR and upto 54.47% in modified straw-added MBR. The addition of rice straw also significantly improved the removal of trirhethoprim, with the removal of 40.82% in conventional MBR while 82.10% in unmodified straw-added MBR and 87.50% in modified straw-added MBR. However, the removal of sulfamethoxazole in three MBRs was so high that there were no obvious differences among the removal of 91.92%, 95.79% and 95.77%. Trimethoprim removal was achieved by both the nitrification co-metabolism and denitrification co-metabolism, while sulfamethoxazole was mainly biodegraded by nitrification co-metabolism.

AB Treated water from wastewater treatment plants that is increasingly used for irrigation may contain pharmaceuticals and, thus, contaminate soils. Therefore, this study focused on the impact of soil conditions on the root uptake of selected pharmaceuticals and their transformation in a chosen soil-plant system. Green pea plants were planted in 3 soils. Plants were initially irrigated with tap water. Next, they were irrigated for 20 days with a solution of either atenolol (ATE), sulfamethoxazole (SUL), carbamazepine (CAR), or all of these three compounds. The concentrations of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites [atenolol acid (AAC), N1-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (N1AS), N4-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (N4AS), carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (EPC), 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), trans-10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine (RTC), and oxcarbazepine (OXC)] in soils and plant tissues were evaluated after harvest. The study confirmed high (CAR), moderate (ATE, AAC, SUL), and minor (N4AC) root uptake of the studied compounds by the green pea plants, nonrestricted transfer of the CAR species into the different plant tissues, and a very high efficiency in metabolizing CAR in the stems and leaves. The results showed neither a synergic nor competitive influence of the application of all compounds in the solution on their uptake by plants. The statistical analysis proved the negative relationships between the CAR sorption coefficients and the concentrations of CAR, EPC, and OXC in the roots (R = -0.916, -0.932, and -0.925, respectively) and stems (R = -0.837, -0.844, and -0.847, respectively).

AB In this work, the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 composite was synthesized and was combined with persulfate (PS) for the efficient photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) under visible light. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to characterize the structural and optical properties of the as-prepared catalysts. Active species trapping experiments demonstrated that additional sulfate radicals (center dot SO4-) formed upon the addition of PS which could cooperate with superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), holes (h(+)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) to decompose NOR. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was also formed during the reaction and acted as an important active species. The degradation products of NOR were also identified and analyzed by using LC-MS technology, and the possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed and discussed. This work indicated that the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 coupled with PS displayed promising applications in the field of pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Reclaimed wastewater (RW) is increasingly used to irrigate agricultural land and to alleviate agricultural water shortages worldwide. This usage has resulted in concerns about soil contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the human health risks associated with dietary crop intake. In this study, we systematically analysed the occurrence and accumulation of 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite in soils and various crops (cucumber, eggplant, long bean and wheat) from realistic RW irrigation fields with different irrigation histories (20, 30 and 40 years) in Beijing and evaluated the human health risks associated with the consumption of these crops. The 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.67 to 22.92 ng L-1 in RW, 0.029-28.13 mu g kg(-1) in irrigated soil, and < 0.01-28.01 mu g kg(-1) in crops. The concentrations of N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and triclosan were higher than those of other PPCPs, with respective concentrations of 14.39-31.44 ng L-1 and 15.93-26.23 ng L-1 in RW, 10.92-23.29 mu g kg(-1) and 20.22-28.13 mu g kg(-1) in irrigated soil and 17.92-28.01 mu g kg(-1) and 8.92-14.91 mu g kg(-1) in crops. However, the estimated threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) and hazard quotient (HQ) values revealed that the concentrations of N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in crops irrigated with RW should be considered a de minimis risk to human health. The concentrations of 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite in soils and crops and the calculated fruit bioconcentration factors (BCFs) did not display obvious increases associated with the duration of RW irrigation in real agricultural systems (P > 0.05). The concentrations of the studied PPCPs in the RW used for irrigation followed different patterns from the concentrations detected in the irrigated soils and crops. Although the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethazine and trimethoprim in RW were higher than those of many other studied PPCPs, their respective values in the irrigated soils and crops did not display a similar tendency. The uptake and accumulation of PPCPs varied among the crop species (P < 0.05). Although PPCPs were detected in eggplant, long bean and wheat (BCFs: not applicable-1.67, 0.03-1.35 and 0.01-5.01, respectively), PPCPs accumulated at increased levels in cucumber (BCFs 0.03-18.98). The estimated TTC and HQ values showed that the consumption of crops irrigated long-term with RW presents a de minimis risk to human health. However, further studies with more PPCPs and additional crop species need to be conducted, the synergistic effects of chemical mixtures of multiple PPCPs and the toxic effects of PPCP metabolites should be elucidated to obtain more reliable information on the safety of wastewater reuse for irrigation.

AB Interest in the risks posed by trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters is increasing, particularly with regard to potential effects of long-term, low-dose exposures of aquatic organisms. In most cases, the actual studies on PPCPs were risk assessments at screening-level, and accurate estimates were scarce. In this study, exposure and ecotoxicity data of 50 PPCPs were collected based on our previous studies, and a multiple-level environmental risk assessment was performed. The 50 selected PPCPs are likely to be frequently detected in surface waters of China, with concentrations ranging from the ng L-1 to the low-g L-1, and the risk quotients based on median concentrations ranged from 2046 for nonylphenol to 0 for phantolide. A semi-probabilistic approach screened 33 PPCPs that posed potential risks to aquatic organisms, among which 15 chemicals (nonylphenol, sulfamethoxazole, di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 17 beta-ethynyl estradiol, caffeine, tetracycline, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, dibutyl phthalate, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, tonalide, galaxolide, triclosan, and bisphenol A) were categorized as priority compounds according to an optimized risk assessment, and then the refined probabilistic risk assessment indicated 12 of them posed low to high risk to aquatic ecosystem, with the maximum risk products ranged from 1.54% to 17.38%. Based on these results, we propose that the optimized risk assessment was appropriate for screening priority contaminants at national scale, and when a more accurate estimation is required, the refined probability risk assessment is useful. The methodology and process might provide reference for other research of chemical evaluation and management for rivers, lakes, and sea waters.

AB White rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade. However, several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full-scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates, the partial re-inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times. This work proposes the immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors at bench scale (flowrates of 10 L/d and reactor capacity of 10 L) for the treatment of different urban wastewater. This type of bioreactor achieved remarkable reductions of the total organic carbon loading of the wastewater (70-75%) in a wide range of C:N and C:P ratios with limited addition of supplementary substrates, non-refreshment of the fungal biomass and only 1-day of hydraulic retention. The addition of gallic acid as quinone-like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes increased the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants mediated by the so-called advanced bio-oxidation process. The immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors also showed a remarkable stabilization of the fungi during the continuous treatment of different urban wastewater under non-sterile conditions. Thus, this system is a sound alternative for biological urban wastewater treatment with pharmaceutical removal because overcome all the problems usually associated with the water treatment technologies based on white rot fungi that makes difficult the scaling-up of the process and its implementation in full scale wastewater treatment plants.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU), a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is widely used by humans for controlling fever and pain, and is frequently detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants and different aquatic environments. In this study, the biotransformation of IBU in activated sludge (AS), anaerobic methanogenic sludge (AnMS) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)-enriched sludge systems was investigated at three different concentrations of 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/L via a series of batch and continuous studies. IBU at concentration of 100 mu g/L was effectively biodegraded by AS whereas AnMS and SRB-enriched sludge were less effective in IBU biodegradation at all concentrations tested. However, at higher IBU concentrations of 500 and 1000 mu g/L, AS showed poor IBU biodegradation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal due to inhibition of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (i.e., Candidatus Competibacter) by IBU and/or IBU biotransformation products. The microbial analyses showed that IBU addition shifted the microbial community structure in AS, AnMS and SRB-enriched sludge systems, however, the removals of COD, nitrogen and sulfur in both anaerobic sludge systems were not affected significantly (p> 0.05). The findings of this study provided a new insight into biotransformation of IBU in three important biological sludge systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most studies dedicated to organic micropollutants (OMPs) removal from wastewater effluents by adsorption onto activated carbon (AC) only consider a few conventional AC properties. The link between OMPs removal and these properties is often missing, which limits the understanding of the adsorption process and the interpretation of the results. The chemical, physical and textural properties of seven newly commercialized micro-grain activated carbons (mu GACs) were determined to assess their influence on the removal of 28 OMPs. Conventional batch tests with wastewater effluent showed that a high percentage of microporous volume (>65%) was detrimental for the removal of 10 OMPs, probably due to a higher blockage of micropores by dissolved organic matter (DOM). The removal of 5 OMPs was correlated with mu GACs surface chemistry properties (i.e. charge) which were potentially modified by DOM adsorption or inorganic species, thus favoring the adsorption of positively-charged compounds. A combination of OMPs properties including their charge, hydrophobicity and minimal projection area could explain their removal. Correlations were found between the removal of several OMPs and UV254, suggesting that DOM and OMPs interacted with each other or followed similar adsorption mechanisms. A decrease in mu GACs particle size had a positive impact on UV254 removal under continuous-flow conditions in columns representative of a large-scale pilot due to better expansion.

AB This study investigated chlorinated transformation products (TPs) and their parent micropollutants, aromatic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the urban water bodies of two metropolitan cities. Nine PPCPs and 16 TPs were quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determined using isotope dilution techniques and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. TPs and most PPCPs were effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatments in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Chlorinated parabens and all PPCPs (at concentrations below 1000 ng/L) were present in the waters receiving treated wastewater. By contrast, the waters receiving untreated wastewater contained higher levels of PPCPs (up to 9400 ng/L) and more species of chlorinated TPs including chlorinated parabens, triclosan, diclofenac, and bisphenol A. The very different chemical profiles between the water bodies of the two cities of similar geographical and climatic properties may be attributed to their respective uses of chemicals and policies of wastewater management. No apparent increase in the number of species or abundances of TPs was observed in either the chlorinated wastewater or the seawater rich in halogens. This is the first study to elucidate and compare the profiles of multiple TPs and their parent PPCPs in the water bodies of coastal cities from tropical islands. Our findings suggest that chlorinated derivatives of bisphenol A, diclofenac, triclosan, and parabens in the surface water originate from sources other than wastewater disinfection or marine chlorination. Although further studies are needed to identify the origins, conventional wastewater treatments may protect natural water bodies against contamination by those chlorinated substances.

AB Direct reuse of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) in agriculture has recently received increasing attention as a possible solution to water scarcity. The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in RWW can be critical, as these chemicals can be uptaken in irrigated crops and eventually ingested during food consumption.
   In the present study, an integrated model was developed to predict the fate of CECs in water reuse systems where RWW is used for edible crops irrigation. The model was applied to a case study where RWW (originating from a municipal wastewater treatment plant) is discharged into a water channel, with subsequent irrigation of silage maize, rice, wheat and ryegrass. Environmental and human health risks were assessed for 13 CECs, selected based on their chemical and hazard characteristics. Predicted CEC concentrations in the channel showed good agreement with available measurements, indicating potential ecotoxicity of some CECs (estrogens and biocides) due to their limited attenuation. Plant uptake predictions were in good agreement with existing literature data, indicating higher uptake in leaves and roots than fruits. Notably, high uncertainties were shown for weakly acidic CECs, possibly due to degradation in soil and pH variations inside plants. The human health risk due to the ingestion of wheat and rice was assessed using the threshold of toxicological concern and the hazard quotient. Both approaches predicted negligible risk for most CECs, while sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol exhibited the highest risk for consumers. Alternative scenarios were evaluated to identify possible risk minimization strategies (e.g., adoption of a more efficient irrigation system). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organoclays have been applied as efficient adsorbents for pharmaceutical pollutants from aqueous solution. In this work, dodecylpyridinium chloride (C(12)pyCl) and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (C(16)pyCl) cationic surfactants were used for the preparation of organobentonites destined for diclofenac sodium (DFNa) adsorption, an anionic drug widely detected in wastewater. The organofunctionalization of the clay samples was performed under microwave irradiation at 50 degrees C for 5 min with surfactant amounts of 100% and 200% in relation to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the pristine bentonite. The amount of incorporated ammonium salts based on CHN elemental analysis was higher for all samples prepared with 200% of the CEC. The basal spacings of the organoclays ranged from 1.54 to 2.13 nm, indicating the entrance of organic cations into the interlayer spacing of the clay samples, and the spacing depended on the size of the alkyl organic chain. The hydrophobic character of the organobentonites was verified by thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption isotherms showed that the drug capacity adsorption was influenced by the amount of surfactant incorporated into the bentonite, the packing density and the arrangement of the surfactants in the interlayer spacing. Zeta potential measurements of the organobentonites and FTIR analysis after drug adsorption suggested that electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions contributed to the mechanism of adsorption.

AB The efficacy of biofilm based anaerobic-aerobic treatment to reduce caffeine, carbamazepine, and three estrogens (Estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)), as well as E. coli (CN-13) and F+ specific coliphage (MS2), from synthetic wastewater was investigated. Results showed no observable reduction of carbamazepine by either anaerobic or aerobic biofilms over a dosing period of 51-days followed by an additional 23 days of observation. Caffeine, by contrast, was reduced by 11.09% in the upflow anaerobic packed bed biofilm reactor (UAnPBBR) and by 91.90% in the aerobic trickling filter biofilm reactor (TF). Estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) showed minimal reduction in the UAnPBBR but 99.67% reduction in the TF, while EE2 was reduced 1.62% in the AnPBBR and 20.36% in the TF. On average, a 3-log reduction of E. coli (CN-13) and a 1-log reduction of F+ specific coliphage (MS2) concentration was observed across the overall reactor system.

AB Better understanding of the fate and persistence of trace organic contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in agricultural soils is critical for assessing the risks associated with using treated wastewater effluent to irrigate crops and land application of wastewater biosolids. This study reports on the influence of prevailing terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs, i.e., aerobic, nitrate-reducing, iron(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing conditions) and exposure to a mixture of nine trace CEC (90 ng/g each) on both the microbial community structure and CEC degradation in agricultural soil. DNA analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community composition following establishment of different TEAPs, but no significant change upon exposure to the mixture of CEC. The largest community shift was observed after establishing nitrate-reducing conditions and the smallest shift for sulfate-reducing conditions. Two of the CEC (atrazine and sulfamethoxazole) showed significant degradation in both bioactive and abiotic (i.e., sterilized) conditions, with half-lives ranging from 1 to 64 days for different TEAPs, while six of the CEC (amitriptyline, atenolol, trimethoprim, and three organophosphate flame retardants) only degraded in bioactive samples, with half-lives ranging from 27 to 90 days; carbamazepine did not degrade appreciably within 90 days in any of the incubations. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Firmicutes Hydrogenispora, Gemmatimonadetes Gemmatimonadaceae, and Verrucomicrobia OPB34 soil group were identified as potentially responsible for the biodegradation of organophosphate flame retardants, and ASVs from other taxa groups were suspected to be involved in biodegrading the other target CEC. These results demonstrate that CEC fate and persistence in agricultural soils is influenced by the prevailing TEAPs and their influence on the microbial community, suggesting the need to incorporate these factors into contaminant fate models to improve risk assessment predictions.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), such as the commonly prescribed antibiotic ciprofloxacin, are present and persistent in freshwaters, yet their effects on aquatic ecosystem functions at environmentally-relevant concentrations are rarely explored. Stream biofilms provide multiple functions in stream ecosystems, but their functional response to PPCP contaminants such as ciprofloxacin is unclear. To establish the effect of ciprofloxacin on aquatic biofilms, we colonized biofilms in situ on tiles (n = 80) at four sites along an urban stream in Gainesville, Florida, including two sites above and two sites below a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We then incubated the tiles and associated biofilms in the laboratory for 6 d exposing biofilms to either 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mu g/L (target concentrations) of ciprofloxacin. At the end of the 6 d laboratory exposure, we quantified gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and biomass (as chlorophyll a) of biofilms, and calculated response ratios for each response. All response metrics were significantly differed across sites (p < 0.01). Ciprofloxacin significantly decreased GPP (p < 0.05) regardless of treatment concentration, most notably at the site immediately below the WWTP, where there was no measurable GPP on any ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms. In contrast, respiration (R) was not significantly affected by ciprofloxacin, despite an apparent increase in R at the WWTP site. However, the WWTP site R was significantly different from the most upstream and downstream sites (p < (moo but was not significantly different from a nearby site upstream of the WWTP (p > 0.05). These results indicate that chronic exposure to ciprofloxacin through WWTP effluent can alter ecosystem functions performed by biofilms, which can have consequences for higher trophic levels and stream processes. By quantifying biofilm metabolic responses to ciprofloxacin exposure, this study supports the concept that pharmaceuticals and personal care products can induce sub-lethal effects on ecological processes at environmentally-relevant concentrations.

AB We investigated the occurrence and distribution of 24 selected corticosteroids (CSs) in the surface water of the Zhujiang River (ZR) system in Guangzhou, a highly urbanized river system receiving both treated and untreated municipal wastewater effluents. Twenty-two and sixteen CSs were detected in the tributaries and the main stream of the ZR system, and their concentrations ranged from less than the method quantification limit (fluticasone propionate) to 94 ng/L (clobetasone butyrate) and from 024 ng/L (cortisol) to 72 ng/L (clobetasone butyrate), respectively. We observed higher total CSs (Sigma CSs) concentrations in the tributaries (11-396 ng/L) relative to the main stream (5.5-33 ng/L) due to their proximity to densely populated residential areas. Sigma CSs concentrations in the dry season were generally higher than those in the wet season due to low dilution from decreased river discharge. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis identified untreated domestic sewage to be the dominant source of CSs (t(2), contribution rate: 42.7%) in the urban rivers. Additional source contributions were from naturally attenuated treated and/or raw sewage (t(1), 21.5%) and effluents from wastewater treatment plants (t(3), 26.7%). CSs contribution was dominated by t(2) in the dry season, and the contributions from t(1), t(2), and t(3) showed no significant difference in the wet season. Risk assessment inferred that the ZR system is at medium to high ecological risk from CSs and is therefore a potential threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems. To prevent CSs pollution, our results demonstrate the need to develop effective control strategies to minimize the discharge of untreated waste to nearby rivers and to improve the capacity of wastewater treatment plants in Guangzhou. Further, we demonstrate that the concentrations of cortisone and fludrocortisone acetate are effective chemical indicators to estimate the level of natural and synthetic CSs contamination in urban rivers.

AB Industrial wastewater is characterised by a complex composition of trace organic compounds (TrOC) in a difficult matrix. The identification of unknown pollutants is of high interest. On the one hand to ensure protection of the environment by elucidating contaminations and on the other hand to protect the biological treatment step in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Due to the high variability of the matrix, the identification of compounds of interest is very time consuming and often unsuccessful. To overcome this limitation, a prioritisation method was developed to identify so called 'known unknowns', i.e. compounds frequently detected but not identified, as prioritised compounds in industrial wastewater. The method based on an offline two-dimensional (offline 2D) liquid chromatography (LC) approach with ultra violet (UV) detection in the first and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in the second dimension. As a proof of concept, an identification process of one 'known unknown' is described. The compound was identified as a dichlorodinitrophenol isomer by retention time in two dimensions, UV spectrum, exact mass, mass fragmentation and H-1-NMR. As prioritisation method, the offline 2D LC in combination with non-target analysis provides a powerful workflow to determine tentative structures of unknown organic compounds in industrial wastewater.

AB Bioremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewater using microalgae has attracted increasing attention. Cyanobacteria, which are important prokaryotic microalgae, are widely distributed in different water environments, and have the advantages of simple culture and a fast growth rate. However, studies on either the toxicity of pharmaceutical contaminants (PhCs) to cyanobacteria or the removal of PhCs by cyanobacteria are scarce. In this study, carbamazepine (CBZ) and Spirulina platensis were selected as model PhCs and cyanobacteria, respectively. CBZ (>1 mg/L) had toxicity effects on S. platensis, showing maximal growth inhibition (34.0%) at 100 mg/L after 10 days of cultivation. At CBZ 25 mg/L S. platensis showed a trend similar to that of eukaryotic microalgae in increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and content of chlorophylls, carotenoids, carbohydrates, and lipids. These results indicated that S. platensis had a similar protective mechanism to CBZ toxicity as that of the eukaryotic microalgae. Increasing CBZ concentration (50-100 mg/L) significanctly decreased these biochemical characteristics and photosynthetic activity owing to the serious damage of the structure and function of S. platensis. However, with increasing cultivation lime, the growth and photosynthetic activity of S. platensis recovered from the toxicity of CBZ. S. platensis showed a maximum of 30.97 +/- 1.30% removal of CBZ (1 mg/L), mainly through biodegradation. Addition of 0.3 mg/L glucose enhanced this removal efficiency to 50.13 +/- 2.51% via co-metabolism. These findings indicated that S. platensis can be used for the removal of CBZ or other PhCs from wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The ozone-reactive electrochemical membrane (O-3-REM) coupled process for tetracycline (TC) removal was developed by coupling ozonation and electrochemical oxidation in a substoichiometric titanium dioxide (Ti4O7) REM reactor. To achieve concurrent and efficient degradation-mineralization, TC was treated by ozonation and electrochemical oxidation over the Ti4O7 REM anode in a sequent manner. TC was nearly completely removed within 20 min, while the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency attained 9.1% in 20 min, and then reached 77.1% in 80 min under optimal conditions of 2 mg/min ozone dosage and 2 mA/cm(2) current density. TC was suspected to be oxidized into some four- and three-ring intermediates within 20 min, some two- and one-ring intermediates within 80 min, and eventually carboxylic acids, CO2 and H2O. The concentrations of NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ increased slightly in the first 20 min and then elevated significantly from 20 to 80 min, indicating an enhanced denitrification rate via electrochemical oxidation. Besides, the bioluminescence inhibition ratio exhibited a slight decrease from 54.5% to 50.6% in the first 20 min and then significantly decreased to 14.5% in 80 min, suggesting an augmented toxicity reduction simultaneously by the coupled technology. Overall, the O-3-REM coupled process demonstrated higher TC degradation and TOC removal efficiencies, enhanced toxicity-reduction capability, and lower energy consumption for TC removal compared to individual O-3 or Ti4O7 REM processes. By comprehensively analyzing the performance, mechanism and energy consumption of TC removal by the O-3-REM coupled process, our research provides insights into the application potential of the coupled process to efficiently eliminate the amount and toxicity of various pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Background As a class of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), illicit drugs should be taken into account in the water management because of their social and public health risks. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are usually considered as the source and sink of contaminants, and drug residues are observed in their effluents due to the inefficient removal of CECs. In this study, wastewater samples were collected from eight WWTPs in Changzhou City for assessment of the abuse of 12 illicit drugs in the city by wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) method. Results Drug concentrations ranged from < LOD-51.62 ng/L to < LOD-22.44 ng/L in influent and effluent samples, respectively. The highest removal rate of drugs was 79.0% in the WWTP which used sequencing batch reactor activated sludge (SBR) process method, while the lowest was found in the WWTP using anoxic oxic (A/O) process (47.0%), indicating that the drug removal rates were closely related to the treatment techniques. WBE method was applied to estimate the population normalized illicit drugs consumption. It demonstrated that methamphetamine (METH) was the most abused drug in Changzhou City, ranging from 0.16 to 20.65 mg/d/1000 inh, while other target drugs ranged from < LOD-1.52 mg/d/1000 inh. Consumption of cocaine (COC) and ecstasy was very low among the samples. Conclusion Overall, this research suggests that drug removal rates varied in different WWTPs and the SBR process is the best for removing illicit drugs. All target drugs were incompletely removed in wastewater treatment plants. WBE can be readily used to monitor the abuse of drugs in those regions, compared with traditional monitoring models.

AB The use of surface water impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents for crop irrigation is a form of unplanned water reuse. Natural attenuation processes can buffer contamination spreading. However, this practice can promote the exposure of crops to contaminants of emerging concern, such as pharmaceuticals, trace metals (TMs) and metalloids, posing a risk to health. This research aimed to evaluate the presence of 50 pharmaceuticals, some transformation products, 7 TMs and a metalloid in the water-sediment-soil-plant system, and their potential to be bioaccumulated into edible parts of plants, as a result of the unplanned water reuse. The study site consists of an extensive agricultural land downstream Madrid city (Spain) where surface water, strongly impacted by WWTP effluents, is applied through gravity-based systems to cultivate mainly maize. Sampling campaigns were conducted to collect WWTP effluent, surface and irrigation water, river sediments, agricultural soils and maize fruits. Results demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of several pharmaceuticals. The concentration pattern in irrigation water did not resemble the pattern of contents in soils and plants. The pharmaceuticals included in the EU surface water watch lists were quantified in the lowest concentration range (macrolide antibiotics, ciprofloxacin) or were not detected (most of the hormones). Therefore, hormones do not represent an emerging risk in our scenario. The TMs and the metalloid in water and agricultural soils should not arise any concern. Whereas, their presence in the river sediments may have an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems. Only acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, nicotine, Zn, Cu and Ni were quantified in corn grains. Calculated parameters to assess bioaccumulation and health risk indicate that neither pharmaceuticals nor TMs pose a threat to human health due to consumption of maize cultivated in the area. Results highlight the need to include different environmental matrices when assessing contaminant fate under real field-scale conditions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study presents an estimation of the urine volume in the wastewater from a real, private clinic in Crete, Greece, during a seven-month period (01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018). Separate estimates were obtained for the volume of urine belonging to patients receiving antibiotics. It was found that the clinic disposed into the local municipal sewage network on the average 3,263 L/month of urine, from which 1,331 L/month (40.8%) belonged to patients receiving antibiotics. According to the pharmacy department of the private clinic, during the period of the study, the most frequently administered groups of antibiotics were on the average 779 g/month cephalosporins (68.1%), 108 g/month fluoroquinolones (9.5%) and others (11.2%), with various active substances including cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and doxycycline. These active substances act like pollutants when disposed via the municipal sewer network into the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background In this study, the biodegradation of N-acetyl-para-aminophenol also known as acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol) was studied by bacterial strain Bacillus drentensis strain S1 (accession no. KY623719) isolated from sewage sample. Results The Bacillus drentensis strain S1 was isolated from the sewage sample using the enrichment culture method. As per our knowledge this is the first Bacillus drentensis strain reported for the degradation of APAP. In this study a 20-L batch reactor was employed for degradation of APAP. The maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) was observed at 400 mg/L concentration of APAP. The pilot-scale anaerobic batch reactor of was stable and self-buffered. The degradation in pilot-scale reactor was slow as compared to batch experiments due to fluctuation in pH and exhaustion of nutrients. Design-Expert(R) software was used for optimization of conditions for APAP degradation; such as temperature (40 degrees C), pH (7.0), concentration of APAP (300 g/L) and agitation speed (165 rpm). The FTIR and GC-MS were used to identify the degradation metabolites. The intermediates of degradation like 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone and phenothiazine were observed, based on these results the metabolic pathway has been predicted. Conclusions The optimization, kinetic, batch study and pilot study indicates the potential of Bacillus drentensis strain S1 for degradation of acetaminophen. The experimental design, optimization and statistical analysis were performed by Design Expert(R) software. The optimal growth condition for Bacillus drentensis strain S1 was found to be at temperature 40 degrees C, pH 7, acetaminophen at concentration of 300 (mg/L) and agitation speed 165 rpm. The GC-MS and FTIR was used for identification of metabolites produced during acetaminophen degradation and the partial metabolic pathway for degradation of acetaminophen was also proposed .

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) are considered to reduce the amount of pollutants that enter water reservoirs as a result of wastewater disposal. An assessment of the occurrence and removal of pharmaceutical compounds, mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in wastewater from the Kavoor MWWTP (southwest monsoon region), India, is presented in this paper. The performance of the MWWTP was monitored in the summer (May) and monsoon (September) periods. The highest inlet concentrations of diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid in the wastewater were observed in May and were 721.37, 2132.48, 2109.875, 2747.29, and 2213.36 mu g/L, respectively. The ketoprofen content was found to be higher than that of other NSAIDs in the influent in both seasons, whereas the diclofenac content was found to be the lowest. The removal efficiency (RE) of the target NSAIDs in the Kavoor secondary treatment plant varied from 81.82-98.92% during the summer season. During the monsoon season, the influent NSAID concentration level dropped, probably because of infiltration in old sewer pipes. In addition, a 100% RE was achieved for all the target NSAIDs in the wastewater of the MWWTP. The results showed that secondary treatment plants have the potential to remove NSAID compounds from municipal sewage with consistent performance. The environmental hazards caused by the accumulation of such compounds in water reservoirs are due to open discharge. The environmental risk levels of these compounds were also studied by the environmental risk assessment (ERA) using the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicines approach.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely detected in aquatic environments, and their potential risks to aquatic species are of concern because they are designed to be biologically active. Here, we used an in vitro assay, called the transforming growth factor alpha shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-acting pharmaceuticals present in river water and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan from 2014 to 2016. Antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (beta 1), acetylcholine (M1) and histamine (H1) receptors were detected in river water, and were stronger downstream than upstream owing to effluent from WWTPs along the river. Ozonation at one WWTP reduced these activities. Concentrations of sulpiride (D2 antagonist) could explain 73% of antagonistic activities against the D2 receptor; those of metoprolol, atenolol and propranolol (beta 1 antagonists) could explain 16% of activities against the beta 1 receptor; and those of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) could explain 15% of activities against the M1 receptor. Therefore, other receptor antagonists also occur. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be given more attention in environmental monitoring and toxicity testing.

AB Globally, protected areas offer refugia for a broad range of taxa including threatened and endangered species. In the United States (US), the National Park Service (NPS) manages public lands to preserve biodiversity, but increasing park visitation and development of surrounding landscapes increase exposure to and effects from bioactive contaminants. The risk (exposure and hazard) to NPS protected-stream ecosystems within the highly urbanized southeast region (SER) from bioactive contaminants was assessed in five systems based on 334 pesticide and pharmaceutical analytes in water and 119 pesticides in sediment. Contaminant mixtures were common across all sampled systems, with approximately 24% of the unique analytes (80/334) detected at least once and 15% (49/334) detected in half of the surface-water samples. Pharmaceuticals were observed more frequently than pesticides, consistent with riparian buffers and concomitant spatial separation from non-point pesticide sources in four of the systems. To extrapolate exposure data to biological effects space, site-specific cumulative exposure-activity ratios (Sigma(EAR)) were calculated for detected surface-water contaminants with available ToxCast data; common exceedances of a 0.001 Sigma(EAR) effects-screening threshold raise concerns for molecular toxicity and possible, sub-lethal effects to non-target, aquatic vertebrates. The results illustrate the need for continued management of protected resources to reduce contaminant exposure and preserve habitat quality, including prioritization of conservation practices (riparian buffers) near stream corridors and increased engagement with upstream/up-gradient property owners and municipal wastewater facilities.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WEE), the per capita normalised measurement of drugs, chemicals or metabolites in wastewater influent, relies on sampling and quantitative analysis to evaluate temporal and spatial trends of chemical consumption. Continuous, high-resolution, flow proportional composite sampling is optimal for accurate representations of chemical mass loads, but is rarely implemented, with conventional autosamplers providing relatively low frequency time or volume proportional samples. However, due to equipment or resource constraints at many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), even this may not be feasible. Passive sampling may provide an alternative sampling strategy. To investigate this, samplers comprising hollow, cylindrical Microporous Polyethylene Tubes (MPTs) containing polymeric sorbent phases of Strata-X and Strata-X in agarose were simultaneously deployed in a municipal WWTP influent stream. Samplers were extracted, analysed and evaluated for a range of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) after 4, 7, 15, 21, and 29 day deployments. The MPT samplers were calibrated against 24-hour time proportional composite grab samples that were collected in parallel. Diffusion through the MPT governed uptake, reducing or eliminating the influence of external flow rates that may fluctuate unpredictably in a WWTP environment. Calibration data for six illicit drugs and fourteen PPCPs, including methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, MDMA, codeine and carbamazepine, demonstrated linear accumulation in the samplers (R-2 >= 0.84). Derived sampling rates for these analytes ranged from 025 to 17 mL d(-1) for ibuprofen and verapamil, respectively. A validation study using this sampling rate data showed the MPT could effectively quantify concentrations (>= 0.1 ng mL(-1)) of a range of amphetamine- type stimulants, opioids and metabolites as well as nicotine, accounting for 95% of the variance in parallel composite grab sample concentrations of these compounds. The MPT sampler shows promise for providing essential monitoring data for WBE, informing future intervention and research strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current knowledge on bioaccumulation of emerging contaminants (ECs) in aquatic invertebrates exposed to the realistic environmental concentrations is limited. Even less is known about the effects of chemical pollution exposure on the metabolome of aquatic invertebrates. We conducted an in situ translocation experiment with passive filter-feeding caddisfly larvae (Hydropsyche sp.) in an effluent-influenced river in order to i) unravel the bioaccumulation (and recovery) dynamics of ECs in aquatic invertebrates, and ii) test whether exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of ECs will translate into metabolic profile changes in the insects. The experiment was carried out at two sites, upstream and downstream of the discharge of an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent. The translocated animals were collected at 2-week intervals for 46 days. Both pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) were detected in water (62 and 7 compounds, respectively), whereas in Hydropsyche tissues 5 EDCs accumulated. Overall, specimens from the upstream site translocated to the impacted site reached higher ECs concentrations in their tissues, as a reflection of the contaminants' water concentrations. However, bioaccumulation was a temporary process susceptible to change under lower contaminant concentrations. Non-targeted metabolite profiling detected fine metabolic changes in translocated Hydropsyche larvae. Both translocations equally induced stress, but it was higher in animals translocated to the impacted site. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, a simplistic redox polymerization strategy was utilized for the fabrication of a poly(methacrylic acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel nanocomposite (PMA/nMMT) and probed as a sorbent for sequestration of two pharmaceutical contaminants, viz., amoxicillin (AMX) and diclofenac (DF), from wastewater. The synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite was characterized by the Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques to analyze structural characteristics and sorption interactions. The efficacy of PMA/nMMT was thoroughly investigated for the sequestration of AMX and DF from the aquatic phase with a variation in operative variables like agitation time, sorbent dosage, pH, and initial sorbate concentration. The reaction kinetics was essentially consistent with the pseudo-second-order model with rate dominated by the intraparticle diffusion model as well as the film diffusion mechanism. The Freundlich isotherm appropriated the equilibrium data over the entire range of concentration. Thermodynamic investigation explored the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process. The most possible mechanism has been explained, which includes electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, cationic exchange, and partition mechanism. Economic feasibility, better sorption capacity (152.65 for AMX and 152.86 mg/g for DF), and efficient regeneration and reusability even after four consecutive sorption-desorption cycles ascertained PMA/nMMT as a potential sorbent for AMX and DF uptake from the aqueous phase.

AB Potable reuse of wastewater is expanding, and ozonation for water reuse is becoming more common, either as a preoxidant before membranes or as part of ozone/biological activated carbon (O-3/BAC) systems. However, previous research has demonstrated that ozone drastically increases the formation potential of genotoxic halonitromethanes (HNMs), including during O-3/BAC. Chloropicrin, the most common HNM, is synthesized by chlorinating nitromethane, suggesting that nitromethane may be the immediate precursor of chloropicrin, although nitromethane is unlikely to occur naturally in wastewater. We hypothesized that wastewater ozonation forms nitromethane, which would be the key intermediate toward HNMs. Ozonation of wastewater effluent was shown to form abundant nitromethane, which explained the majority (in one case, all) of subsequent chloropicrin formation. Next, we investigated a suspected category of nitromethane precursor: stimulant drugs, such as ephedrine and methamphetamine, and certain antidepressants. These drugs all feature N-methylamine functional groups, and certain N-alkylamines have been shown to produce primary nitroalkanes upon ozonation. Ozonation of N-methylamine drugs ubiquitously formed nitromethane, typically at >50% yield. Subsequent chlorination converted nitromethane to chloropicrin. The reaction mechanism was investigated to understand the variation in nitromethane yield between different precursors. These results suggest that nitromethane fate during reuse and nitromethane control should be investigated.

AB Drug residues in water represent one of the most serious environmental problems because of their high toxicity to the biological system. Thus, this study reports a low-cost strategy for fast and precise analysis of beta- blocker timolol maleate (TM) using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DP ASV) at a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE). At the optimised solution pH 7.2 and other analytical parameters (accumulation time, deposition potential, scan rate, and pulse amplitude), a well-defined oxidation peak was observed at 0.85 V vs Ag/AgCl electrode. The linear calibration range for TM at 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode was found to be 5.0 x 10(-7) - 1.3 x 10(-4) mol L-1 (0.21-56.2 mu g mL(-1)) (R-2 = 0.9947) with lower limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of 2.7 x 10(-7) (0.12) and 8.99 x 10(-7) mol L-1 (0.39 mu g mL(-1)), respectively. The developed assay was satisfactorily applied for trace determination of TM residues in biological fluids (urine), environmental water samples and eye drop with good recoveries (90.5 +/- 0.66-106 +/- 0.66%), demonstrating good accuracy and applicability of the proposed method as an effective and reliable electrochemical sensor for analysis of TM in complex matrices. Common organic and inorganic compounds did not interfere with TM in its determination. The established strategy was validated using the official HPLC method. Analysis results obtained by the present method were comparable to those obtained using the official method; indicating that the proposed method could be used as an alternative method for the routine quality control of the drug in complex matrices. Chromatographic methods are still more precise, while electrochemical sensors are promising for the analyte determination as they have reduced analytical time, low cost and reproducible. The proposed sensor also demonstrated excellent precision, selectivity, and reproducibility for TM determination.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are not specially designed to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), since these substances are toxic and bio-refractory. This paper aims to investigate and optimize the performance of the Trisep TS80 nanofiltration (NF) membrane for the removal of a mixture of two of the most detected PhACs in municipal wastewaters worldwide, sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac. Several NF tests were carried out to study the rejections of these contaminants both spiked in demineralized water, filtrated water taken from Mondego River and secondary effluent coming from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Among the several studied operating variables, pH was the one that most affected the contaminant rejection and membrane permeability. In the case of synthetic effluent, an applied pressure of 10 bar and pH 7 were determined as the best operating conditions, which allowed almost total chemical oxygen demand retention and a global contaminant rejection of 96.3% to be achieved. The application of different water matrices (river water and secondary municipal effluent) had no relevant impact on process efficiency. Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition tests revealed that treatment by nanofiltration reduced acute toxicity of all studied effluents.

AB A cost-effective alternative approach capable of determining the prevalence of substance use in communities can complement the existing efforts of combating drug abuse and addiction. In this study, the prevalence of 10 illicit and 19 prescribed psychoactive drugs of potential abuse was determined utilizing wastewater-based epidemiology, and compared in two adjoined urban communities and a rural community. This is the first application of the Monte Carlo simulation method to account multiple uncertainties and propagation of errors associated with the individual parameter of wastewater based epidemiological estimations in the U.S. A significantly higher prevalence of cocaine [3830 (mean difference, MD: 2960) mg/d/1000 people] was found in the central business district while the per-capita consumption rates of amphetamine [738 (MD: 338) mg/d/1000 people] and methamphetamine [1660 (MD: 629) mg/d/1000 people] were higher in a rural community. Among narcotics, the per-capita consumption rate of fentanyl and morphine was significantly higher in urban communities while codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and buprenorphine were dominant in a rural community. The significantly higher prevalence of buprenorphine ("20-30 folds), oxycodone ((similar to)2-3 folds), and alprazolam ((similar to)2-3 folds) determined in these communities compared to the conventional estimates based on the electronically reported prescriptions and drug-related inpatient hospitalizations suggest the abuse of these drugs.

AB Hydrophobic aerogels were used to remove three types of persistent organic pollutants: pharmaceutical drugs (i.e. doxorubicin [DOX], paclitaxel [TAX]), phthalates (diethyl phthalate [DEP]), and hydrophilic rhodamine dye (RhB) from synthetic and real wastewaters, using Lumira granular aerogel from Cabot activated with EtOH (ET-GAG). The hydrophobic silica aerogel was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The pollutants were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV and HPLC-mass spectrometry. The adsorption process was governed by hydrophobic- hydrophobic interactions between the ET-GAG and micropollutants. The adsorption capacity of ET-GAG, examined by batch experiments, for DOX, TAX and DEP were 13.80, 14.28 and 17.54 mg/g respectively. The rate of adsorption to ET-GAG is high in the initial 40 min followed by no change in the rate due to saturation of adsorption sites. ET-GAG was able to completely remove micropollutants from real leachate and hospital wastewater, implying practical applications. Regeneration of the aerogel was studied by solvent extraction. Et-GAG adsorbent demonstrated better removal of toxic chemotherapeutic drugs and phthalates than GAC.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are not usually effective in the remediation of specific landfill leachates due to their high content in toxic and recalcitrant compounds. Advanced and intensive treatments are needed for the decontamination and possible recycling of these effluents. Here, the combination of advanced oxidation processes (solar photo-Fenton) and an aerobic biological reactor have been applied to treat urban landfill leachates. The effectiveness of the proposed treatment line was also evaluated considering the removal of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) identified in the different phases, which is an innovative practice. The analytical strategy included: (i) a target approach (115 analyzes) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); and two suspect approaches using (ii) LC-high-resolution MS (database with > 1300 compounds) and (iii) gas-chromatography-MS (database with > 900 compounds). OMCs on the treated landfill leachate was reduced up to 94% of the initial concentration. 8 target compounds (mainly pharmaceuticals) out of 115 target analyzes represented 85% of the OMC concentration in the raw leachate: cotinine, diclofenac, gabapentin, ketoprofen, lidocaine, mecoprop, nicotine and trigonelline. 3 non-previously reported OMCs were confirmed: di-n-nonyl phthalate, o-phenylphenol and tonalide. Leachate partially oxidized by solar photo-Fenton process can be successfully incorporated to biological systems to complete the treatment by means of specifically adapted biomass.

AB Iopromide (IOP) has been identified as one of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment processes, however, kinetic and intrinsic factors constraining its fast removal in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are yet to be resolved. Here oxidation of IOP by heat-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Rates of IOP degradation were enhanced by elevating solution temperature and acidity. An apparent kinetic rate equation was developed, based on the pseudo-first-order reaction model and assumption of steady state of SO4 center dot-. The common water constituents showed inhibitory effects on IOP decomposition to various extent. An insufficient supply of SO4 center dot- was considered as the major kinetic constraint. Eight byproducts were identified and most of which had intact triiodinated benzene ring. O-demethylation, oxidation of amino moiety and oxidation/elimination of alcohol groups are proposed as the primary degradation pathways, in accordance with the incomplete mineralization and non-detectable release of inorganic iodine. Quantum chemical calculations predict that oxidation of alkyl chains of IOP preferentially occurs and IOP byproducts with shorter side chains and intact triiodinated ring are more reactive than IOP. By virtue of the identified kinetic and intrinsic constraints, strategies to maximize degradation efficiency of IOP are proposed.

AB Sewage sludge application to soil is of great interest, due to required organic matter and the wide spectra of nutrients it provides. However, the presence of unpredictable content of emerging contaminants may turn this valuable raw material into a hazardous substance. In this study, three selected sewage sludges derived micro pollutants from different origins; that is, one each under persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were considered. The effect of each micropollutant on the feeding activity of free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was analysed. The analysis was performed in model soil solution using a larval feeding inhibition assay. The results showed no significant effects from selected POP-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl either and pharmaceutical-chlortetracycline on the feeding activity of tested nematodes. On the contrary, feeding activity was inhibited by PPCP-galaxolide (HHCB) with an effective concentration of 12.2 +/- 2.2 mg.l-1. The calculated risk quotient for galaxolide (RQ = 0.14) demonstrated a medium ecological risk to the nematodes. Based on our findings, concentrations of micropollutants in sewage sludge treated soil pose negligible risk to feeding activity of soil nematode. However, the potential impact of musk compounds on free-living soil biota requires detailed evaluation in further research.

AB In this work we evaluated the contamination of the water cycle in Como Bay by measuring 38 selected pharmaceuticals in two main wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland and in Italy, two influents (River Breggia and Cosia), lake water (epilimnion and hypolimnion), as well as potable water. The collection of comparative information on the presence and environmental fate of these substances contributes to set specific environmental quality standard (EQS). The results presented show that the contamination of the lake reflects national health policies, which deeply influence the usage of chemicals. The outcomes of this study give an overall picture of contamination in the area, showing that concentrations of the measured compounds are generally low and under the commonly adopted ecotoxicological and toxicological thresholds. Only in a few cases did the contamination appear to be noteworthy, for some of the most persistent compounds (antibiotic macrolides, diclofenac, irbesartan, carbamazepine and dihydrocarbamazepine, bezafibrate, furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide). Some concern can be also be raised for the presence of antibiotics (clarithromycin) in drinking water, although at very low levels, due to the problem of antibiotic resistance.

AB In this research, degradation of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was studied using electrochemical reduction and oxidation in single pass, flow-through mode using porous titanium suboxide (Ti4O7) reactive electrochemical membranes (REMs) and Pd-Cu doped Ti4O7 REMs (Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REMs). Electrochemical reduction of SMX increased from 3.8 +/- 0.3% for the Ti4O7 REM to 96.1 +/- 3.9% for the Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REM at -1.14 V/SHE and at a permeate flux of 300 L m(-2) h(-1) (LMH) (liquid residence time:similar to 1.8 s). By contrast, electrochemical oxidation using Ti4O7 REMs achieved 95.7 +/- 1.0% removal of SMX at 2.03 V/SHE and a permeate flux of 300 LMH (liquid residence time:similar to 9.0 s) without the catalyst addition. We developed a reactive transport mathematical model and calibrated it to the SMX experimental data. The calibrated model predicted SMX permeate concentrations at fixed potentials and as a function of permeate flux. Based on products from SMX reduction, we proposed that SMX was reduced by a hydrogen atom transfer reaction that was mediated by the Pd-Cu/Ti4O7 REM. Toxicity tests indicated that electrochemical oxidation/reduction lowered solution toxicity. The results of this work indicate that a tandem electrochemical reduction/oxidation approach using the REM based technology is a potential treatment strategy for sulfonamide-contaminated pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Losartan potassium (LOS) is a most globally consumed antihypertensive and emerging pharmaceutical contaminant of concern due to increasingly ubiquity in water and wastewater. For its effective environmental remediation, we propose the catalytic oxidation of losartan via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation using a metal-free N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (N-PC). We found out that N-PC exhibits both excellent adsorption capacity and catalytic oxidation efficiency with 100% LOS uptake within 240 min at 0.026 g/L of the N-PC. Fresh and used N-PC were scrutinized for textural properties and surface chemistry. The effects of PMS dose, temperature, pH, organic matter and coexisting anions on losartan decomposition were examined. Moreover, total organic removal was obtained and the catalyst was tested in three consecutive runs. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching assays revealed that the nonradical oxidation pathway plays a major role in LOS degradation by N-PC/PMS.

AB A lab-scale system consisting of a methanogenic and an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was operated for seven months to investigate major pollutants' and polar organic micropollutants' removal from domestic wastewater under three different organic loading rates (OLRs). For all OLR values tested, the system achieved efficient COD (> 84%) and NH4-N removal (> 96%); both reactors contributed to the decrease of organic loading, while the aerobic bioreactor was exclusively responsible for the removal of ammonium nitrogen. The increase of OLR from 0.20 +/- 0.10 to 2.10 +/- 0.20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) resulted to increase of the detected volatile fatty acids in the anaerobic reactor and increase of the produced biogas to 172.7 +/- 25.3 mL L reactor(-1)d(-1). All target micropollutants were partially removed during different experimental phases; their removal ranged between 31% (5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 5TTR) and 97% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole, OH-BTH). Except benzotriazole (BTR) and OH-BTH, both reactors contributed significantly to the removal of target micropollutants, while the addition of extra aerobic MBBR as a final polishing step enhanced only OH-BTH removal. Use of experimental and literature data showed that the increase of organic loading enhanced the removal of three out of five target micropollutants, while the key factor responsible for this effect was COD concentration in influent wastewater. The modelling of micropollutants' removal efficiency using biodegradation kinetics calculated in batch experiments showed satisfactory correlation between predicted and measured values for most target compounds.

AB Amlodipine (AML), an antihypertensive drug, has raised great environmental concerns due to the widespread occurrence in wastewater for its extensive use. In this study, we introduced an effective approach for AML removal via an oxidation reaction with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by magnetic cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), and highlighted the governing role of PMS concentration in the degradation process. Nearly complete removal of 10 mu M AML (92.5%) was achieved in 30 min with 25 mu M PMS and 40 mg/L CoFe2O4 at neutral condition (pH 7.0), while the mineralization was negligible. To enhance the mineralization of AML, PMS concentration was further increased to 10 mM with the mineralization of 70.2%. A total of eight intermediates were identified using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analysis in combination with frontier electron densities calculations, and two major transformation pathways including hydroxylation and dehydrogenation were proposed. Temporal evolution of the intermediates was monitored, of which the differences were tracked as PMS concentration increased from 25 mu M to 1.2 mM. Toxicity changes throughout the degradation process were assessed on ECOSAR program, indicating that higher PMS concentration of 1.2 mM led to further reduction of potential threats, although the toxicity of some intermediates with pyridine structure needs to be further validated. Based on the findings in this study, CoFe2O4/PMS appears to be a promising alternative to remove AML from aquatic environment when appropriate PMS concentration is selected for more pronounced performance.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attractive adsorbents for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. However, in their powder form, the adsorbents suffer from the disadvantage of poor recyclability and complex operational process. Herein, we incorporated typical MOFs (ZIF-8, ZIF-67, HKUST-1, and Fe-BTC) into low-cost chitosan matrix for the tetracycline removal. Metal hydroxide(or metal oxide)/chitosan composite beads from the metal salt/chitosan solution were used as MOF precursor, which lead to the uniform and stable MOF loading into chitosan. This composition could not only shape MOFs into beads but also improve the adsorption capacity of the chitosan. As a result, ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads exhibited good adsorption performance toward antibiotic tetracycline. The adsorption processes followed pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity could reach 495.04 mg/g, which is higher than most of the MOF-based or natural polymer-based tetracycline adsorbents. Moreover, the removal efficiency of ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads toward tetracycline was still above 90% after ten adsorption-desorption cycles. In the fixed-bed experiment, ZIF-8-chitosan column could treat similar to 887 bed volumes (BV) of tetracycline solution in real water sample. Both experimental characterizations and DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption mechanism involves in the electrostatic interaction, pi-pi stacking interaction and hydrogen-bonding interaction. This study provides a promising strategy for uniform MOF loading into the matrix and potential adsorbents for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The largely uncontrolled release of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) within untreated wastewater discharged to waterbodies, associated with many rapidly urbanising centres is of growing concern owing to potential antimicrobial resistance, endocrine disruption and potential toxicity. A sampling campaign has been undertaken to assess the source, occurrence, magnitude and risk associated with APIs and other chemicals within the Nairobi/Athi river basin, in Kenya, East Africa. The catchment showed an extensive downstream impact zone estimated to extend 75 km, mostly, but not exclusively, derived from the direct discharge of untreated wastewater from the urban centre of Nairobi city. The exact extent of the downstream boundary of the Nairobi city impact zone was unclear owing to the inputs of untreated wastewater sources from the continuous urbanized areas along the river, which counteracted the natural attenuation caused by dilution and degradation. The most frequently detected APIs and chemicals were caffeine, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, nicotine, and sulfamethoxazole. Paracetamol, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim alone contributed 86% of the total amount of APIs determined along the Nairobi/Athi catchment. In addition to direct discharge of untreated domestic wastewater attributed to the informal settlements within the conurbation, other sources were linked to the industrial area in Nairobi City where drug formulation is known to occur, the Dandora landfill and veterinary medicines from upstream agriculture. It was shown that there was a possible environmental risk of API ecotoxicological effects beyond the end of the traditional impact zone defined by elevated biochemical oxygen demand concentrations; with metronidazole and sulfamethoxazole exhibiting the highest risk.

AB This study investigated, for the first time, the occurrence and fate of 29 multiple-class pharmaceuticals (PhACs) in two source separated sanitation systems based on: (i) batch experiments for the anaerobic digestion (AD) of fecal sludge under mesophilic (37 `C) and thermophilic (52 "C) conditions, and (ii) a full-scale blackwater treatment plant using wet composting and sanitation with urea addition. Results revealed high concentrations of PhACs in raw fecal sludge and blackwater samples, with concentrations up to hundreds of pg L-1 and fig kg-1 dry weight (dw) in liquid and solid fractions, respectively. For mesophilic and thermophilic treatments in the batch experiments, average PhACs removal rates of 31% and 45%, respectively, were observed. The average removal efficiency was slightly better for the full-scale blackwater treatment, with 49% average removal, and few compounds, such as atenolol, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, showed almost complete degradation. In the AD treatments, no significant differences were observed between mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. For the full-scale blackwater treatment, the aerobic wet composting step proved to be the most efficient in PhACs reduction, while urea addition had an almost negligible effect for most PhACs, except for citalopram, venlafaxine, oxazepam, valsartan and atorvastatin, for which minor reductions (on average 25%) were observed. Even though both treatment systems reduced initial PhACs loads considerably, significant PhAC concentrations remained in the treated effluents, indicating that fecal sludge and blackwater fertilizations could be a relevant vector for dissemination of PhACs into agricultural fields and thus the environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) constitute a group of chemicals of concern because of their potential toxicity when reaching aquatic environments. Wastewaters are one of the main pathways of introduction into the environment of the chemical compounds used in PPCPs because, in most cases, wastewater treatment facilities are not 100% efficient in their removal. This problem is accentuated in rural zones and isolated communities where conventional treatment systems are too expensive to build and operate. Waste-stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands (CWs) are natural wastewater treatment systems which are used to improve the quality of sewage from small communities because of their low cost and easy maintenance. There is growing interest in combining the two technologies to make a more robust system, taking into account their respective strengths and weaknesses.
   In this work, a combined macrophyte pond-CW system was evaluated for the presence at three sampling points (influent, pond effluent and CW effluent) of fifteen steroid hormones and six benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers (BUVSs). None of the targeted BUVS compounds were detected in either the influent or effluent, probably because of the particular characteristics of the population served by the wastewater system. In contrast, eight different steroid hormone compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from 17.3 to 247.7 ng.L-1 in influent samples and from 8.1 to 22.1 ng.L-1 in final effluent samples. The pond-CW system showed high elimination rates of steroid hormone residues with average removal efficiencies of over 77%. This efficacy was confirmed in the ecological risk assessment evaluation that was performed. Final effluents showed a low ecological risk associated with steroid hormones in contrast to the medium-high ecological risks found in the influent samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical industry produces large volumes of low C/N ratio wastewater that is difficult to treat. In this study, we isolated Achromobacter sp. JL9 with high efficiency for sulfamethoxazole degradation and nitrogen conversion in low C/N ratio pharmaceutical wastewater. The SMX biodegradation and nitrogen removal ratio were 92.4% (nitrate-N), 86.7% (ammonia-N), 89.4% (total nitrogen), and 90.4% (SMX). The reaction kinetics and reaction rate constant were C/N ratio-, SMX concentration-, and dissolved oxygen concentration-dependent, and the highest reaction rate constant for SMX biodegradation was 0.0384 min(-1). Gaseous compounds analysis and Nap gene amplification analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, showed N-2 as an end product during nitrogen conversion. Moreover, toxicity assays were conducted by the inhibition percentage (PI) and agar well diffusion methods. The toxicity of the medium gradually decreased, falling within the nontoxic range after 96 h. The present study showed that biological technologies could be an effective, economical, and environmentally friendly remediation against pharmaceutical pollutants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is becoming increasingly recognized as an important micropollutant to be monitored in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), since it has been detected in effluents at the mu g L-1 level. The IBU metabolites from biological degradation are not completely understood and can represent a threat to natural aquatic systems. P. medicamentivorans was previously isolated from WWTP sludge and found to be capable of IBU degradation. The aerobic biodegradation of ibuprofen by this organism was investigated in a batch lab-scale reactor for the identification of the metabolites formed. The metabolites were analysed and putatively identified by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and GC-MS and biodegradation pathways were proposed. The toxicity and the biodegradability potential of the metabolites were also investigated. The results showed that IBU biotransformation was achieved by hydroxylation followed by the formation of a carboxylic acid in the IBU molecule and by the formation of a catechol, allowing the aromatic ring cleavage. Two biodegradation pathways were proposed: in one, the metabolites generated from the enzymatic action correspond to a less biodegradable chemical structure of the intermediate products (isobutylbenzene and 3-isobutylphenol), with comparatively higher toxicity; in the other mechanism, more oxidable chemical structures were formed with less toxicity and higher biodegradability. This suggests that the biodegradation of IBU by P. medicamentivorans can take place by more than one mechanism regarding the enzymes formed by this Gram-positive bacterium, with subsequent oxidation of the parent compound to overall more soluble and less toxic compounds to fish, daphnia and green algae.

AB The presence of the antibiotics in wastewater and drinking water is of growing concern worldwide, thereby an advanced sustainable technology needs to be developed to decontaminate the antibiotics from water resources. Herein, a series of novel boron nitrile/cadmium aluminate (BN/CdAl2O4) composites photocatalysts were synthesized by using hydrothermal methodology. Thus synthesized BN/CdAl2O4 composites were tested for the photocatalytic degradation of cefoxitin sodium (CFT) antibiotic in aqueous solution. The spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the morphology, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and optical properties of the composites changes as the amount of the BN varies in BN/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite. The resulting BN/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite with a fraction of 0.2 g BN showed most efficient photocatalytic properties than the pure BN, CdAl2O4 and other BN/CdAl2O4 composites owing to its better light-harvesting properties, higher surface area, and better charge separation properties. The results revealed that the solution pH, irradiation times, and initial CFT concentration in solution controls the photocatalytic process and almost 100% CFT degradation was observed at 15 mg/L concentration within 240 min at pH 7. The results of free radicals scavenging experiments demonstrated that both positive hole and (OH)-O-center dot free radical play dominant roles in CFT degradation. The kinetic modeling of CFT photocatalysis process showed better fitting with the first-order kinetic model as compared to the zero-order and second-order kinetic models. This study revealed that BN-0.2/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite has better CFT degradation efficiency and excellent recyclability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals remain in treated wastewater used to irrigate agricultural crops. Their effect on terrestrial plants is practically unknown. Here we tested whether these compounds can be considered as plant stress inducers. Several features characterize the general stress response in plants: production of reactive oxygen species acting as stress-response signals, MAPKs signaling cascade inducing expression of defense genes, heat shock proteins preventing protein denaturation and degradation, and amino acids playing signaling roles and involved in osmoregulation. Tomato seedlings bathing in a cocktail of pharmaceuticals (Carbamazepine, Valporic acid, Phenytoin, Diazepam, Lamotrigine) or in Carbamazepine alone, at different concentrations and during different time-periods, were used to study the patterns of stress-related markers. The accumulation of the stress-related biomarkers in leaf and root tissues pointed to a cumulative stress response, mobilizing the cell protection machinery to avoid metabolic modifications and to restore homeostasis. The described approach is suitable for the investigation of stress response of different crop plants to various contaminants present in treated wastewater.

AB Within this study, we were interested in the effects of wastewater on the development of antimicrobial resistance. Microorganisms can relatively promptly adapt to evolutionary pressures of the environment, including antibiotics. Therefore, we tested how the adaptability of the model microorganism Salmonella enterica is affected by wastewater full of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, and other micropollutants. Wastewater samples had been taken from effluent of hospitals and from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Petrzalka influent and effluent. In these samples, presence of 38 substances was monitored. The highest concentration was observed in case of tramadol, citalopram, venlafaxine, cotinine, atenolol, valsartan, carbamazepine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. According to this data, we focused also on individual pharmaceutical compounds presented in wastewater samples in elevated concentrations. Effect on resistance development of two pain relief medications (carbamazepine, tramadol), hypotensive medications (atenolol, valsartan), and the nicotine metabolite (cotinine) was also investigated. For this study, we employed concentrations presented in wastewater as well as in urine of patients and/or users. To determine the frequency of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance, we applied the modified Ames test employing the strain Salmonella Typhimurium. Resistance index increased in the case of all wastewater samples from conventional hospitals where we observed a 1.22-1.69-fold increase of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance. Tested compounds caused rise of resistance index in lower concentrations found in wastewater. The most significant increase of resistance index was detected after carbamazepine treatment.

AB N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and formaldehyde (FAH) are probable carcinogenic disinfection by-products and have been found to occur in areas of the Yodo River basin that are influenced by treated wastewater. The diurnal patterns of them were examined with water samples collected over 4 years in different seasons at five outlets of four sewage treatment plants (STPs), seven main stream sites, and five tributary sites in the basin. Based on mass flux calculations, STPs were shown to be the main sources of the downstream for NDMA and FAH loads in the study area. Moreover, results revealed that photo degradable NDMA and non-photo degradable FAH showed different fates during the river transportation. For NDMA, in addition to direct photolysis, water temperature was identified as an important factor in NDMA attenuation in surface waters. NDMA attenuated significantly in the daytime and even during summer nights but persisted during winter nights, while attenuation of FAH was found to mainly be influenced by water temperature, and persisted during winter. Their behaviors were compared in an artificial river channel and whole study area, clearly demonstrating the importance of monitoring them in the water environment during periods of low UV intensity and water temperature, especially winter nights.

TI Coupling River Concentration Simulations with a Toxicokinetic Model
   Effectively Predicts the Internal Concentrations of Wastewater-Derived
   Micropollutants in Field Gammarids

AB Although the exposure assessment of wastewater- derived micropollutants via chemical, bioanalytical, and modeling methods in environmental compartments is becoming more frequent, the whole-body burden (i.e., internal concentrations) in nontarget organisms is rarely assessed. An understanding of the internal concentration fluctuation is especially important when exploring the mechanistic linkage between exposure and effects. In this study, we coupled a simple river model with a first-order toxicokinetic (TK) model to predict the concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants in freshwater invertebrates (Gammarus spp.). We applied Monte Carlo simulations and conducted laboratory experiments to account for the uncertain input data and the lack of uptake/depuration rate constants required for the TK model. The internal concentrations in field gammarids were predicted well, and the estimates varied only by a factor of 0.1-1.9. Fast equilibrium may also be assumed such that bioconcentration factors (BCFs) are used together with the daily river dilution patterns to predict internal concentrations. While this assumption is suitable for compounds observed in our experiment to reach the steady state within 48 h in gammarids, the model overpredicted the concentrations of substances that reach this condition after longer periods. Nevertheless, this approach provides conservative estimates and simplifies the coupling of models as BCFs are slightly more accessible than the rate constants. However, if one is interested in a more detailed exposure information (e.g., peak concentration and the whole-body burden recovery after a spill), then the nonsteady-state formulation should be employed.

AB Pharmaceuticals raise concerns for aquatic species owing to their biological activities. It is estimated that nearly 40% of marketed pharmaceuticals target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using an in vitro transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) shedding assay, we previously detected antagonistic activities of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), acetylcholine (Ml), adrenergic family members (beta 1), and histamine (H1) receptors at up to mu g-antagonistequivalent quantities/L in wastewater in England and Japan. However, which pharmaceuticals were responsible for biological activities in wastewater remained unclear. Here, we used (1) the consumption of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals, particularly antagonists, as calculated from prescriptions, (2) their urinary excretion, and (3) their potency measured by the TGF alpha shedding assay to prioritize them for analysis in wastewater in England and Japan. We calculated predicted activities of 48 GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals in influents in England and Japan and identified which were mainly responsible for antagonistic activities in wastewater against each GPCR Mixtures of pharmaceuticals tested in this study were confirmed to behave additively. The combination of consumption and potency is useful in prioritizing pharmaceuticals for environmental monitoring and toxicity testing.

AB Photochemical transformation driven by sunlight is one of the most important natural processes for organic contaminant attenuation. In the current study, statistical analysis-assisted high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to investigate the phototransformation of nontarget features in wastewater effluents under various radical quenching/enhancing conditions. A total of 9694 nontarget features were extracted from the effluents, including photoresistant features, photolabile features, and transformation products. 65% of the wastewater effluent features were photoresistant, and the photolabile features could be classified into five groups: direct photolysis group (group I), HO center dot-originated species-dominated group (group II), 3OM*-dominated group (group III), photochemically produced reactive intermediates combination-dominated group (group IV), and non-first-order degradation group (group V). The direct photolyzed features were observed to degrade significantly faster than the indirect photolyzed features. Moreover, group II dominated by HO center dot-originated species contributed 34% to the photolabile features. The reaction types that occurred in the phototransformation process were analyzed by linkage analysis. The results suggested that oxygen addition and dealkyl group reactions were the most common reaction types identified in the phototransformation process. Overall, high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with statistical analysis was applied here to understand the photochemical behavior of the unknown features in wastewater effluents.

AB The decolorization of Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) from aqueous solutions using the Fenton oxidation process was researched. The effects of different operating parameters, e.g., H2O2, Fe(II), initial dye concentration, pH, and solution temperature, on the decolorization of RB19 were investigated. Increasing, the H2O2 concentration and temperature increased the rate of the decolorization; however, increasing initial RB19 concentration reduced the decolorization. Additionally, modeling of the decolorization obtained by the Fenton oxidation process was researched based on deep neural networks (DNN) architecture providing the best performance in terms of optimum hidden layers and neuron numbers in addition to ideal activation and optimization function pairs. The performances of the models were analyzed on the training, validation, and test data. According to the experimental results, the seven hidden layers DNN model with "relu" activation function and "RMSProp" optimization function provided the best performance with root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.39 and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.99.

AB Antibiotic contamination attracts growing concerns because of their deleterious effects on the ecosystem and human health. In this study, 43 antibiotics in wastewater from a variety of sources and water of the Yangtze River in Chongqing City in western China were measured. Thirty compounds were detected, and their concentrations were highest in leachates from the municipal solid waste treatment facilities (landfills and incineration plants) with total concentrations of 3584-57,106 ng/L. The total concentrations in influents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were comparable (401-7994 ng/L versus 640-8945 ng/L). The concentrations in raw sewage from swine farms (with a total of 10,219-39,195 ng/L) and poultry farms (1419-36,027 ng/L) were noticeably higher than those from other farms (54.0-5516 ng/L). Fluoroquinolones were the dominant antibiotics contributing over 50% in all the sources, and sulfonamides and imidazole fungicides contributed 3.2-34%, whereas tetracyclines and macrolides had minor contributions. The overall antibiotic removal rates were highest in solid waste treatment facilities (88% on average), comparable between municipal and industrial WWTPs (61%), and lowest in animal farms (39%). The mass loads to the investigated municipal WWTPs via influent wastewater ranged from 7.80 to 1531 kg/year (53.2-2482 mu g/day per capital). The influent mass loads to the industrial WWTPs and farms were 3.7-50 kg/year and 0.9-5437 g/year, respectively. We estimated that the mass inventories of antibiotics from these sources to the environment via effluent discharges were approximately 2044 kg for municipal WWTPs, 61 kg for industrial WWTPs, and 34 kg for animal farms in the whole city. Antibiotic concentrations in the Yangtze River water were substantially low (< 492 ng/L, with a mean of 57.8 ng/L) suggesting dissipation during the movement.

AB Cement is the most widely used construction material in the world. However, its manufacture is high energy consumption and high carbon emission owing to the high temperature calcination process. Geopolymer is an ideal alternative material for cement because it has a similar structure and performance to cement. In addition, it can be synthesized at room temperature and thus has the advantages of energy saving and carbon emission reduction. Sewage sludge (SS) can be used as raw material for geopolymer synthesis. However, the high organic matter content in SS lowers the mechanical strength of geopolymer. Although the organic matter in SS can be removed by incineration at high temperature, this consumes energy and emits carbon dioxide, which diminishes the advantages of geopolymer. In this study, the Fenton method was applied for the removal of organic matter in SS at room temperature. The parameters of the Fenton method, including the dosages of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Fe2+ reagent (FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), reaction time, and initial pH value, were investigated. The results indicated that 83.7% of the organic matter in SS could be removed at room temperature by using 5.15 M H2O2 and 5.15 mM FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O at pH 7, which suggested the possibility of sewage sludge reclamation through geopolymer synthesis as an alternative material for cement toward sustainability.

AB Phenolic compounds are mixtures of phenol derivatives which are produced from several industries including biocides, pharmaceuticals and coal production. Phenolics are considered the major contaminants in industrialized wastewater. Therefore, treatment of wastewater polluted by phenolics is mandatory previously to discharge in order to protect the environment. Among the numerous procedures reported for remediation of industrial wastewater from phenolics; adsorption technology was the best method from the effectiveness and economical point of view. In this study, three agricultural wastes produced in huge amounts were evaluated in remediation of wastewater contaminated by 2-chlorophenol. The studied agricultural wastes were water hyacinth, palm leaf, and banana peel. The adsorption process parameters were determined including temperature, pH, amount of adsorbents, concentration of pollutant, and treatment time. The process followed Freundlich adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Boyd model showed that the adsorption mechanism of chlorophenol on the surface of the different adsorbents was occurred via film diffusion mechanism. The obtained adsorption capacities at the equilibrium conditions were 288.1, 290.3, and 388.9 mg/g for water hyacinth, palm leaf, and banana peel, respectively. The spectroscopic evaluation showed the physical interaction between the chlorophenol molecules and the different functional groups on the studied adsorbents. Banana peel showed the highest adsorption efficiency, which was related to the abundance and types of the bioactive compounds in its chemical structure.

AB A quantitative assessment of pharmaceuticals in surface water in Jordan was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to evaluate the occurrence, source and distribution of 18 pharmaceutical compounds. Grab samples were collected in the summer from the effluent of two dams in Jordan. Among all of the pharmaceuticals analyzed, the results showed that 10 pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the effluent of King Talal Dam including 1,7-dimethylxanthine, acetaminophen, amphetamine, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, phenazone, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim. However, four pharmaceutical compounds detected in the effluent of Mujib Dam include 1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, cotinine, phenazone. Moreover, eight pharmaceutical compounds were not detected in both dams (<0.005 mu g/L) including cimetidine, diphenhydramine, MDA, MDMA, methamphetamine, morphine, sulfachloropyridazine and thiabendazole. The results also indicated that the compound detected at the highest concentration levels in King Talal Dam was carbamazepine at concentration of 0.358 mu g/L. It is very clear that the occurrence of pharmaceuticals at King Talal Dam is higher than in Mujib Dam. This is mainly due to the fact that King Talal Dam is receiving runoff water and treated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), while the Mujib Dam is only receiving surface runoff water. This is consistent with many studies reported in the literature that municipal WWTPs are considered a primary source for the discharge of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into surface waters.

AB A study was carried out to assess the removal efficiency of odorous compounds from the wastewater of hospitals in Kuwait using aeration with activated sludge technique. Samples were collected from the outlet of wastewater from Maternity Hospital. The collected samples were transferred to the laboratory of Sulaibiya Research Plant (SRP) of KISR. Each sample was divided into three parts: the first part of the sample was analyzed to obtain characteristic of hospital wastewater, while the second and third samples were mixed with activated sludge from Kabd wastewater treatment plant and underwent aerobic treatment for 12 and 24 h periods in two bioreactors using a different intensity of aeration. In the first bioreactor, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was kept on the level of 2 mg/L, while in the second 4 mg/L. Wastewater and effluents samples were analyzed for the examination of the following parameters: temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, organic nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN) and sulfides. Based on obtained results of analyses, the removal efficiency of wastewater parameters were calculated mainly for COD, NH4-N, sulfides and TN. The laboratory results indicated that after a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h, the mean values of sulfide removal efficiency increased from 82.54% to 93.85%, when DO increased from 2 to 4 mg/L, respectively. Under the same previous operating conditions, the mean value of ammonium removal efficiency was increased from 85.96% to 97.44%. To obtain the best effluents the biological process should be extended aeration type with HRT 24 h at DO 4 mg/L. The obtained results will be recommended as the base for treating wastewater from hospitals in package units before discharging to sewage network.

AB This study compared the removal of fifteen trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors, denoted as AeMBR and AnMBR, respectively. Results show that the removal of TrOCs by either AeMBR or AnMBR was determined largely by their hydrophobicity. Almost all hydrophobic TrOCs were effectively removed (>60%) while the removal of hydrophilic compounds varied (3.6%-98.7%). AeMBR was more effective than AnMBR for the removal of all TrOCs investigated with a few exceptions. Compared to AeMBR, the removal of compounds containing nitrogen in their molecular structures (e.g. amitriptyline, carbamazepine, and atrazine) was higher by AnMBR. Of all TrOCs investigated, considerable accumulation in biosolids only occurred to amitriptyline, 4-tert-octyphenol and triclosan, particularly during AnMBR treatment. Nevertheless, biodegradation and/or biotransformation was the main mechanism for TrOC removal by both AeMBR and AnMBR. Moreover, removal of bulk organic matter indicated by total organic carbon and nitrogen was comparable for these two systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the treatment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) wastewaters are a serious concern because of the use of these materials as a solvent in various industries such as pharmaceutical, electronic and acrylic fiber manufacturing process. In this research, employing of Fenton process for treatment of DMSO and DMAC wastewaters by considering the effect of operating parameters such as different initial DMSO and DMAC concentration, reaction time, initial pH, and different concentrations of Fenton's reagent were investigated. Experimental results illustrated that the maximum degradation efficiency for the treatment of synthetic DMSO wastewater was equal to 89.9 %, 89.7 %, 94.5 %, and 97.6 %, for initial concentration of DMSO equal to 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg.L-1, respectively. The maximum degradation efficiency of 81.9 %, 92.9 %, 94.8 %, and 95.8 % was reached at best operational conditions of the Fenton process for 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg.L-1 initial concentration of synthetic DMAC wastewater respectively. Kinetics study results presented that the kinetic reaction of DMSO and DMAC degradation by the Fenton process at all initial concentrations were well fitted with the BMG model.

AB Limited reviews have investigated sources, behaviour and health risks of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the wastewater-human pathway. The current review seeks to: (1) determine hotspot sources of ARGs, and their behaviour and fate in wastewaters; (2) discuss ARG health risks, and risk factors; and (3) highlight future research directions. Diverse ARGs conferring single and multi-drug resistance to common and last-resort antimicrobials are widely reported. Hotspot sources of ARGs include medical facilities, pharmaceutical industries, aquaculture and animal systems. Non-engineered landfills, on-site sanitation, funeral parlours and gravesites constitute under-studied potential hotspot sources. Hydrological processes, wind and vectors mobilize ARGs from sources into aquatic systems. Wastewater treatment processes, the nature of ARGs and environmental conditions control the behaviour and fate of ARGs. Consumption of contaminated food and water, vectors, inhalation and dermal contact transfer ARGs from wastewaters to humans. Health risks include development of antimicrobial resistance, although evidence directly linking ARGs in wastewater to resistance remains weak. Ecological risks include shifts in physiological behaviour, community structure and ecosystem functions, including expression of shock-responses and virulence, biofilm formation and mutations. These shifts could increase colonization ability and survival of pathogenic microbes, thereby posing significant ecological, human and animal health risks. Overall, the behaviour and risks of ARGs are controlled by complex human-environmental interactions, and have far-reaching policy implications, hence ARGs can be considered as a 'super-wicked' problem. To minimize the risks, a conceptual framework entailing a ten-point strategy is highlighted. Under-studied hotspot sources, behaviour and fate, human ecotoxicology and risk assessments warrant further research.

AB This study evaluated, through a central composite experimental design, the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) deposition, synthesized at different pH and silver concentration [Ag+], on the photocatalytic efficiency of self-assembled thin films (SATFs) of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and TiO2 over bezafibrate (BZF) drug. The SATFs were produced by dip coating on glass substrates using the layer-bylayer technique and were characterized by ultraviolet and visible absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with a field emission gun and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results revealed that the SATF that represents the optimum point of the central composite design (pH = 7.0 and [Ag+] = 0.46 mmol L-1) reduced the initial concentration of BZF by 81.4 %. The presence of AgNPs on the polyelectrolytes/TiO2 thin film was responsible for an increase of 64 % in its photocatalytic efficiency when compared to the film containing only polyelectrolytes and TiO2. Silver is present mostly in the form of nanoparticle agglomerates with sizes under 90 nm. Moreover, the optimized SATF showed no reduction in its photocatalytic efficiency after four reuse cycles. Finally, the data set showed that the SATFs of this work possess a high potential for photo-oxidation, which makes them attractive for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.

AB The removal of pharmaceuticals from contaminated water has remained a major challenge in recent times. This present work reports the solar photoelectrocatalytic removal of ciprofloxacin using n-n heterojunction BiVO4/MnO2 prepared by electrodeposition on a FTO glass as anode. The semiconductor photoanodes were characterised with XRD, SEM, EDS, diffusive reflectance UV-vis, voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The calculated charge carrier density of BiVO4/MnO2 from Mott-Schottky plot as well as its photocurrent response were greater than those of pristine BiVO4 and MnO2 revealing that the band alignment between the two semiconductors resulted in inhibition of rapid recombination of electron - hole pairs. A degradation efficiency of 76 % was achieved in the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of ciprofloxacin using a bias potential of 1.5 V within 2 h with holes and hydroxyl radicals playing predominant roles. The highest degradation efficiency obtained with photoelectrocatalytic oxidation was due to synergistic effect of both electrochemical and photocatalytic degradation. The degradation of ciprofloxacin on the electrode proceeded through the rapid oxidation of piperazine ring of ciprofloxacin within a short time as indicated by chromatographic analysis of the degradation products. The electrode has excellent stability and reusability suggesting its suitability as photoanode for the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater.

AB Antibiotic resistance (AR) is becoming a worldwide threat due to the increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial strains. There is a general consensus about the potential implications of the use of antibiotics in livestock on the onset of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), mainly through meat consumption. However, the ever-increasing use of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) in agriculture may also contribute significantly to the non-accounted exposure to antibiotics, ARB, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This position paper aims at evaluating the current knowledge concerning the occurrence of antibiotics, ARBs, and ARGs in edible parts of different common crops irrigated with RWW. We will discuss which regulations on the use of RWW may contribute to the minimization of the prevalence of these contaminants in crops, and provide recommendations on how to minimize the impact of these practices.

AB Antibiotics are drugs used on both animals and humans. However, when their residues or metabolites are released into the environment, it can cause microbial resistance in water bodies, including wastewater treatment plants. In this study, extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were monitored in an anaerobic-aerobic combined biological treatment system. The enzymes Oxacillinase (OXA), Cefotaximases (CTX) and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) were added to the treatment and analyzed by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) and plate count using a selective medium. Quantification of the effect of adding these enzymes was performed before, during and after they were added in order to establish the behavior of the treatment system under three different conditions. Anaerobic reactors proved more efficient at treating wastewater containing the beta-lactamases OXA, CTX and NDM-1 than the ASP3 aerobic reactor that was working individually. However, an anaerobic-aerobic treatment train was much more effective at removing organic matter, even in the presence of beta-lactamase.

AB Innovative, nanotechnology-based remedies for the wastewater treatment processes are gaining momentum in recent years. Of particular interest is the containment of the environmental threat due to the contamination of water bodies by antibiotics, which can eventually lead to the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, causing grave concern to humanity. Herein we report a straightforward and simple method for the sunlight-assisted oxidative degradation of the antibiotic cefixime using a nanocomposite of TiO2 and nitrogen-doped holey graphene (TiO2/NHG) as a highly effective photocatalyst. Of the various catalysts tested TiO2/NHG is found to be superior towards the oxidative degradation of cefixime. The effect of various reaction parameters and presence of H2O2 are studied. The present methodology offers good scale-up possibilities.

ID TRAMETES-VERSICOLOR
AB Fungi have been shown to be promising candidates to be used in removal of pharmaceutical compounds during wastewater treatment processes. However, fungal growth, including removal efficiency, can be affected by several factors, such as temperature and the pH. The ability of fungal isolates to grow in the presence of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was tested. Removal efficiency results indicated that a fungal isolate of Aspergillus luchuensis can completely (>99.9%) remove diclofenac from a synthetic wastewater media without a pH correction within 10 days of incubation. Furthermore, the results of the biosorption test for A. luchuensis indicate that this isolate uses the biosorption mechanism as a strategy to remove diclofenac. Finally, the results demonstrate that A. luchuensis can remove >98% of diclofenac in non-sterile wastewater without a pH correction immediately after biomass inoculation on biofilm carriers while Trametes versicolor requires an incubation period of at least 24 h to completely remove diclofenac. Therefore, this isolate is a promising candidate for use in removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater with typical pH 7.8, minimizing a requirement of the pH correction.

AB Emerging contaminants present a challenge for water preservation, threatening humans' health and all ecosystems. They consist of a variety of molecules ranging from pharmaceutical and personal care products to pesticides and endocrine disruptors detectable in wastewater, sewage effluent, surface water, drinking water, and ground waters at trace level concentrations (e.g., ng/L, mu g/L). Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) possess low efficiency to remove them. Therefore, new technologies capable of removing such residues are needed. Lignin recognized as a renewable and abundant biopolymer is transformed through electrospinning into an anionic nanofibrous nonwoven adsorbent to extract those contaminants and dispose them safely. Electrospinning allows the manufacture of fibers at the micro- or nanoscale under the influence of an electric current. In this study, nanofibers of alkali lignin and a co-polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol), were developed and tested on the adsorption of a pharmaceutical contaminant (fluoxetine) in an aqueous solution. Results showed that the lignin nanofibers, of 156 nm in diameter, adsorbed 70% of fluoxetine in solution which corresponds to 32 ppm of contaminants removed in water.

AB This study was aimed at the degradation of sulfonamides (SNs) via oxidation with Fe(VI). The reaction kinetics, identification of degradation byproducts and their toxicity were investigated. The pH solution and Fe(VI) loading had significant effects on the degradation of the sulfonamides. The maximum degradation rate occurred at pH 3.0 with a 6:1 ratio Fe(VI): sulfonamide, obtaining 100% degradation of 15 mg L-1 SN within 5 min. Although Fe (VI) also showed an appreciable reactivity towards SNs (k(app) = 9.85-19.63 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) at pH 7. The influence of solution pH on the values of keep can be explained considering the specific reaction between Fe(VI) and SNs. Degradation rates are also influenced by the presence of inorganic ions in different water matrixes. For this reason, ions present in groundwater enhanced the SNs degradation through a synergistic effect among carbonates, sulfates and Fe(VI).
   Degradation byproducts identified, through UPLC analysis, allowed us to proposed three degradation pathways depending on pH. At acid pH there is a cleavage of C-S and S-N bonds. At neutral pH nitroso and nitro-derivates are formed. At basic pH hydroxylation is the main reaction.
   The cytotoxicity assay of HEK-293 and J774 cell lines exposed to Fe(VI) indicated that transformation byproducts had a lower toxicity than SNs as baseline products. Accordingly, this research suggests that Fe(VI) can act as a chemical oxidant to remove SNs antibiotics and it can be used to treat antibiotic pollution in wastewater.

AB In this study, the efficiencies of selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove selected perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) during wastewater treatment processes were evaluated. For this purpose, Influent samples from Daspoort, Zeekoegat and Phola WWTPs, were initially screened for the presence of sixteen different PFASs of which only seven were detected. These include: perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoro-n-pentanoic acid (PPPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorooctanoic add (PFOA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (L-PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS).
   To determine the concentrations of these PFASs, wastewater samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that L-PFOS was the dominant compound with the highest concentration of 508 +/- 258 ng/L at Daspoort WWTP. Overall, the three WWTPs could not achieve the complete influent-to-effluent removal of the PFASs and the best removals were observed at Zeekoegat WWTP.
   The removal efficiency of the different unit processes varied from one plant to another and also from each type of PFASs. At Daspoort, the removal efficiency of the primary settling tanks was poor and the highest removal reached 39% for PFHxA. The activated sludge (AS) of this WWTP achieved the highest removal of 84% for the L-PFOS. At Zeekoegat, the AS achieved the highest removal of 94% for the L-PFOS. The anaerobic pond at Phola achieved a higher removal of 80% for the L-PFOS. However, no removal was observed downstream of the biological filter for the same compound. Poor removal efficiency was reported downstream of the wetland at Phola except for the PFOA (16%).

AB The emerging pollutants cover a wide range of synthetic chemicals that are indispensable to modern society but with little known effects for aquatic animals and for people who consume pollutedwaters with these products. Gels manipulated with hormones are widely used for hormone replacement, muscle growth, among other purposes. However, only a small part of these hormones are absorbed into the skin, and so these can be transferred to the domestic sewage during the washing of exposed body regions. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity levels for the bioindicator Artemia salina L., and cytotoxicity and mutagenicity for the bioindicator Allium cepa L. of gels handled with 1% testosterone and 0.1% estradiol. Data from immobile/dead A. salina numbers after 24 h of exposure showed that the highest concentrations of testosterone (10 and 25 mu g/mL) and the highest concentration of estradiol (15 mu g/mL) were toxic to this bioindicator. For the bioindicator A. cepa, mitotic indices and chromosomal aberrations did not indicate statistical differences between the groups treated with the testosterone gels (1, 10, 50 mu g/mL) and estradiol (0.03, 0.30, 1.5 mu g/mL) and the control group. However, all concentrations of the testosterone-containing gel decreased the percentage of cell division in relation to the time 0 h of each treatment and to the time 24 h of the negative control. Therefore, it is concluded that rivers or aquatic environments can be polluted if wastewater with the toxic concentrations found of these hormonal gels is discarded without previous treatment, compromising the life of organisms that live there. And, it encourages the development of techniques for treating sewage and water to reduce/eliminate the hormones present in them.

AB Hospitals' effluents contain a considerable amount of chemicals. Considering the significant volume of wastewater discharged by hospitals, the presence of these chemicals represents a real threat to the environment and human health. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro genotoxicities of three wastewater effluents collected from Tunisian hospitals. The liver of Swiss albino male mice, previously treated with different doses of the hospital wastewaters, was used as a model to detect DNA fragmentation. Our results showed all the hospital effluents caused significant qualitative and quantitative hazards in hepatic DNA. The wastewater collected from Sfax hospital exhibited the highest genotoxic effect, which may be explained by the presence in this effluent of some toxic micropolluants. There was a significant increase in genotoxicity, proportionally to the concentration of effluent. However, the vitotox assay did not show any significant genotoxicity on Salmonella typhimurium TA104 in the presence or absence of microsomal fraction S9. The ratio gentox/cytox was lower than the threshold 1.5. This study assessed the toxicological risk issued from Tunisian hospital wastewaters, which is potentially very harmful, and it has been pointed out that wastewater treatment requires special attention.

AB Several studies have been conducted worldwide to develop effective and affordable methods to degrade pharmaceuticals and their metabolites/intermediates/oxidation products found in surface water, wastewater and drinking water. In this work, acetaminophen and its transformation products were successfully degraded in surface water by electrochemical oxidation using stainless steel electrodes. The effect of pH and current density on the oxidation process was assessed and the oxidation kinetics and mechanisms involved were described. Additionally, the results were compared with those obtained in acetaminophen synthetic solutions. It was found that conducting the electrochemical oxidation at 16.3 mA/cm(2) and pH 5, good performance of the process was achieved and not only acetaminophen, but also its transformation products were totally degraded in only 7.5 min; furthermore, small number of transformation products were generated. On the other hand, degradation rates of acetaminophen and its transformation products in surface water were much faster (more than 2.5 times) and the reaction times much shorter (more than 4.0 times) than in synthetic solutions at all current densities and pH values evaluated. At pH 3 and pH 5, greater soluble chlorine formation due to the higher HCl amount used to acidify the surface water solutions could enhance the degradation rates of acetaminophen and its transformation products. However, constituents of surface water (ions and solids) could also have an important role on the oxidation process because at pH 9 (non-acidified solutions) the degradation rates were also much greater and the reaction times were much shorter in surface water than in acetaminophen synthetic solutions.

AB Many industries and industrial processes, such as electroplating, acid mine drainage, the pharmaceutical industry, and industries that use phosphorous, produce large volumes of acidic wastewater that must be treated before discharge. Generally, a large quantity of an alkali, such as lime, caustic soda, or soda ash is used to neutralize the acidic wastewater and it is a costly treatment process. Therefore, new self-releasing alkali materials were studied. This research proposed the synthesis of sustainable porous alkali-activated materials (porous AAMs) by a simple method for acidic wastewater treatment. Industrial wastes, i.e., fly ash and bottom ash from a power plant, were employed to produce porous AAMs using sodium silicate solution as a foaming agent. The test results showed that fly ash and bottom ash AAMs had the potential to be used as pH modifiers. 0.001 M HCl solution (pH of 3) was selected as the representative acidic wastewater, and the pH of the solution fell to within the allowable discharge pH range of 5.5-9.0 according to the effluent discharge standard of Thailand. The retention time was three days for a solid-to-solution ratio of 1:500 w/v (g/ml). Porous AAMs present an attractive way of utilizing waste coal ashes compared to a cost-effective method for acidic wastewater treatment.

AB This study investigates the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), and membrane distillation (MD). The Doce river located in Minas Gerais (Brazil - geographical coordinates 18 degrees 51'50.45 '' S and 41 degrees 56'46.86 '' W), which is used for drinking water catching and raw sewage disposal, was chosen as the background matrix for this study. Betamethasone and fluconazole, among the 28 assessed PhACs, were the most recurrent during monitoring. The results show that the PhACs rejection by NF and RO membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate (RR) increases. The first PhAC occurrence in the permeate happened at 40% and 60% RR for NF and RO, respectively. MD showed a rejection > 99% for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70% RR. NF and RO reject PhACs mainly through size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions, whereas, MD rejects PhACs due to their low volatility. All evaluated processes lead to a toxicological risk reduction. MD did not show any tendency of fouling, while NF and RO show flux decline mainly due to membrane fouling, which was more evident in RO. The membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and/or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low. Opex was estimated at 0.50, 0.43, and 1.96 US$/m3 for NF, RO and MD respectively. Although the MD process is more robust, the practical application is restricted by the high cost. And, NF and RO are feasible alternatives to remove PhACs from drinking water.

AB The removal efficiency of diclofenac and ketoprofen for five fungal strains was examined. The synergistic effect between selected fungal strains using synthetic wastewater media was studied using both individual and mixed strains. The mixed cultures had no additional effect in reducing diclofenac and ketoprofen. In contrary, fungi removed pharmaceutical substances faster when growing individually. The results showed that T. versicolor monoculture removed diclofenac completely (> 99.9 %) in non-sterile municipal wastewater within three hours of incubation and continued to show complete reduction within 14 days using fungal biofilm carriers. The mechanism of removal was proposed based on the laccase enzyme production and biosorption study which revealed that T. versicolor could used in both processes. Additionally, this study demonstrated that T. versicolor could be stable in the biofilm carriers, and thus able to compete with other microorganisms in wastewater to be a promising candidate to remove diclofenac from municipal wastewater during the treatment process.

AB Antibiotic contamination is a relevant environmental problem, since these compounds are discharged in conventionally treated wastewaters, and can favor antibiotic resistance. In this work, the mineralization of solutions containing 50 mg/L of erythromycin, part of the European Union wide watch-list, was studied using electro-oxidation and the UV-based processes direct photolysis, heterogeneous photocatalysis and photo-electrocatalysis. For the UV-based processes, a higher photonic flux favored mineralization and lowered energy consumption, since it increases both molecule absorbance and hydroxyl radical production. For the high photonic flux experiments, direct photolysis presented higher mineralization (42%) than photocatalysis (16%), which might be explained by the reactor configuration, the electronic recombination and the erythromycin concentration. Electro-oxidation presented low overall mineralization (< 10%), but had synergistic effects when combined to photocatalysis, resulting in 38% mineralization for photo-electrocatalysis. Matrix effects on mineralization were evaluated by performing photo-electrocatalysis and direct photolysis experiments with a spiked real wastewater. While direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization due to photochemically active light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions, photo-electrocatalysis with the spiked wastewater did not differ significantly from photo-electrocatalysis with the working solution and would be a more viable alternative. The use of a supporting electrolyte for the photo-electrocatalysis experiments with spiked wastewater resulted in no significant difference in mineralization, but probably led to different reaction pathways, as suggested by chloride and nitrogen species concentration analysis.

AB In this study, photocatalytic degradation of trimethoprim by synthesized S-TiO2 and Ru/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts was investigated. Both photocatalysts have been immobilized on circular aluminum plates by polysiloxane to investigate their reusability performance. The morphology and structure of the catalysts were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The photocatalytic experiments were carried out using suspended and attached catalysts using a metal halide lamp as a light source. The degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100% and 98.2% at catalyst dose of 0.5 g/L, pH of 7.0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended Ru/WO3/ZrO2 and S-TiO2, respectively. After immobilization of the catalysts on the aluminum plates, the removal efficiencies in five repetitive cycles were 98%, 96.9%, 96.8%, 93.2% and 83.4% using Ru/WO3/ZrO2, while they were 88.6%, 86%, 84%, 78% and 75.9% in case of S-TiO2. The irradiation time of each cycle was 240 min, and the initial trimethoprim concentration was 10 mg/L. The degradation rates of trimethoprim were estimated in the case of suspended and immobilized STiO2 and Ru/WO3/ZrO2. The radical trapping experiments using various scavengers revealed that superoxide radicals, holes and hydroxyl radicals all participated in the photo-degradation process. Furthermore, the transformation products generated during the trimethoprim oxidation process were detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy to identify the possible degradation pathways.

AB Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia play a major role in global drug trade and abuse. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants has increased in the past decade in Malaysia. This study aimed to apply wastewater-based epidemiology for the first time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to estimate the consumption of common illicit drugs in urban population. Influent wastewater samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Kuala Lumpur in the summer of 2017. Concentrations of twenty-four drug biomarkers were analyzed for estimating drug consumption. Fourteen drug residues were detected with concentrations of up to 1640 ng/L. Among the monitored illicit drugs, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) or ecstasy had the highest estimated per capita consumptions. Consumption and dose of amphetamine-type stimulants (methamphetamine and MDMA) were both an order of magnitude higher than those of opioids (heroin and codeine, methadone and tramadol). Amphetamine-type stimulants were the most prevalent drugs, replacing opioids in the drug market. The prevalence trend measured by wastewater-based epidemiology data reflected the shift to amphetamine-type stimulants as reported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Narcotics Cooperation Center. Most of the undetected drug residues were new psychoactive substances (NPSs), suggesting a low prevalence of NPSs in the drug market.

AB In this study, we analyzed 27 pharmaceuticals in liquid and solid phase samples collected from the unit processes of four different sewage treatment plants (STPs) to evaluate their distribution and behavior of the pharmaceuticals. The examination of the relative distributions of various categories of pharmaceuticals in the influent showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most dominant. While the relative distribution of antibiotics in the influent was not high (i.e., 3%-5%), it increased to 14%-30% in the effluent. In the four STPs, the mass load of the target pharmaceuticals was reduced by 88%-95% mainly in the biological treatment process, whereas the ratio of pharmaceuticals in waste sludge to those in the influent (w/w) was only 2%. In all the STPs, the removal efficiencies for the stimulant caffeine, NSAIDs (acetaminophen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid), and the antibiotic cefradine were high; they were removed mainly by biological processes. Certain compounds, such as the NSAID ketoprofen, contrast agent iopromide, lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, showed varying removal efficiencies depending on the contribution of biodegradation and sludge sorption. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed to compare the pharmaceutical removal efficiencies of the biological treatment processes in the four STPs, which were a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process, sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process, anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) process, and moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process. Among the biological processes, the removal efficiency was in the order of MBR > SBR > A2O > MBBR. Among the tertiary treatment processes investigated, powdered activated carbon showed the highest removal efficiency of 18%-63% for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, atenolol, cimetidine, and trimethoprim.

AB In this paper, biochar (BC) was prepared from discarded grapefruit peel and modified to prepare magnetic biochar (MBC). Physical and chemical properties of BC and MBC were characterized, and the results showed that the type of iron oxide loaded by MBC was gamma-Fe2O3. Compared with BC, MBC has a larger specific surface area and pore volume, with more oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. BC and MBC were used to adsorb and remove endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) bisphenol A (BPA) from simulated wastewater. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of BPA adsorption by BC and MBC were mainly in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the Langmuir model. This indicates that the adsorption of BPA on BC and MBC is mainly a chemically controlled monolayer adsorption. Adsorption thermodynamics show that BC and MBC adsorption of BPA is a spontaneous exothermic reaction, and lowering the temperature is conducive to the adsorption reaction. The effect of solution pH on the adsorption of BPA by both was significant. The optimum pH for BC and MBC to absorb BPA was 6 and 3, respectively. The concentration of Na+ in the range of 0-0.10 mol.L-1 can promote the adsorption of BPA to MBC. MBC loaded with gamma-Fe2O3 not only has excellent magnetic separation ability, but can also reach about 80% of the initial adsorption capacity after four cycles of adsorption. By analyzing the adsorption mechanism, it was found that the H-bond and the pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) were the main forces for BC and MBC to adsorb BPA.

AB The pharmaceuticals bisoprolol (BIS), sotalol (SOT), and ranitidine (RAN) are among the most consumed pharmaceuticals worldwide and are frequently detected in different aquatic ecosystems. However, very few ecotoxicity data are available in the literature for them. To help fill these data gaps, toxicity tests with the algae Raphidocelis subcapitata, the macrophyte Lemna minor, the cnidarian Hydra attenuata, the crustacean Daphnia similis, and the fish Danio rerio were performed for assessing the ecotoxicity of these pharmaceuticals. Standard, as well as non-standard endpoint, was evaluated, including the locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae. Results obtained for SOT and RAN showed that acute adverse effects are not expected to occur on aquatic organisms at the concentrations at which these pharmaceuticals are usually found in fresh surface waters. On the other hand, BIS was classified as hazardous to the environment in the acute III category. Locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae was not affected by BIS and RAN. A disturbance on the total swimming distance at the dark cycle was observed only for larvae exposed to the highest test concentration of 500 mg L-1 of SOT. D. similis reproduction was affected by BIS with an EC10 of 3.6 (0.1-34.0) mg L-1. A risk quotient (RQ) of 0.04 was calculated for BIS in fresh surface water, considering a worst-case scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first chronic toxicity data with BIS on non-target organisms.

AB The distribution of 14 ARGs, intI1, and 16S rDNA were analysed in 4 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 2 effluent receiving areas (ERAs), and Hangzhou Bay (HZB). The results showed that each integrated WWTP (IWWTP) received higher abundance of ARGs than pharmaceutical WWTPs (PWWTPs), and IWWTPs removed ARGs more efficiently than PWWTPs. The WWTP effluents greatly contributed to the ARGs pollution in the water environments of the ERAs and HZB, and the total abundance of the ARGs displayed a distance decay pattern. In coastal sediments, more ARGs were accumulated in remote sites. The correlation analysis showed that the occurrence of ARGs was more related to 16S rDNA and intI1 in the WWTPs. Three macrolides resistance genes (ermB, mphA, and vatB) had strong correlations with 16S rDNA and intI1 in all the sample groups. Our study clearly reveals the link between land WWTPs discharge and emerging pollution of ARGs in coastal environments.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely detected pharmaceutical in wastewaters, cannot currently be treated by conventional activated sludge technologies, as it is highly resistant to biodegradation. In this study, the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms of CBZ by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were investigated with a combined experimental/theoretical approach. We first measured the UV absorption spectrum of CBZ and compared it to the theoretical spectrum. The agreement of two spectra reveals an extended pi-conjugation system on CBZ molecular structure. The second-order rate constants of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- with CBZ, measured by competition kinetics method, were (4.63 +/- 0.01) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and (8.27 +/- 0.01) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively at pH 3. The energetics of the initial steps of CBZ reaction with (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- were also calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at SMD/M05-2X/6-311++G**//M05-2X/6-31 + G**level. Our results reveal that radical addition is the dominant pathway for both (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-. Further, compared to the positive Delta G(R)(0) value for the single electron transfer (SET) reaction pathway between CBZ and (OH)-O-center dot, the Delta G(R)(0) value for SET reaction between CBZ and SO4 center dot- is negative, showing that this reaction route is thermodynamically favorable. Our results demonstrated the remarkable advantages of AOPs for the removal of refractory organic contaminants during wastewater treatment processes. The elucidation of the pathways for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- with CBZ are beneficial to predict byproducts formation and assess associated ecotoxicity, providing an evaluation mean for the feasibility of AOPs application.

However, this concern is limited by ability to address their occurrence, distribution, fate and eco-toxicological effects. This study focuses on the quantification of the levels of statins, fibrates and their metabolites in the aquatic environments using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The developed UHPLC-QTOF-MS based method was successfully applied to the analysis of statins, fibrates and metabolites in real water samples collected from Daspoort WWWs influent and effluent and Apies River. A series of statin compounds (mevastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin), fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) and the corresponding metabolites (clofibric and fenofibric acids) were detected and quantified in the range of 0.56-19.90 mg/L in both waste and River water samples. In general, the results of the present study are an indication of pollution hazards from wastewater treatment processes and these levels poses a huge risk to the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms. Thus, regulating the limit levels of statins, fibrates and metabolites in any type of water is paramount as it will provide the vital information on the toxic risks associated with organic pollutants of pharmaceutical origin.

AB The ready biodegradability of twenty food additives, belonging to the classes of artificial sweeteners, natural sweeteners, preservatives and colorings, was investigated using activated sludge as inoculum and OECD 301F respirometric test. According to the results, saccharin, aspartame, sodium cyclamate, xylitol, erythritol, maltitol, potassium sorbate, benzoic acid and sodium ascorbate are characterized as readily biodegradable compounds, partial biodegradation (<60% during the test) was noticed for steviol, inulin, alitame, curcumin, ponceau 4R and tartrazine, while no biodegradation was observed for the other five compounds. The duration of lag phase before the start of biodegradation varied between the target compounds, while their ultimate biodegradation half-life values ranged between 0.7 +/- 0.1 days (benzoic acid) and 24.6 +/- 1.0 days (curcumin). The expected removal of target compounds due to ultimate biodegradation mechanism was estimated for a biological wastewater treatment system operated at a retention time of one day and percentages higher than 40% were calculated for sodium cyclamate, potassium sorbate and benzoic acid. Higher removal percentages are expected in full-scale Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) due to the contribution of other mechanisms such as sorption to suspended solids, (bio)transformation and co-metabolic phenomena. Further biodegradation experiments should be conducted under different experimental conditions for the food additives that did not fulfill the requirements of the applied protocol. Future studies should also focus on the occurrence and fate of food colorants and natural sweeteners in full-scale STPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is an environmentally friendly disinfectant and oxidizer used in several water and wastewater treatment applications. In the present study, PAA was utilized for the conditioning of municipal wastewater sludge before thickening and dewatering. It was shown that PAA can effectively prevent odor formation (i.e., H2S and NH3) and provide hygienization (using E. coli. and Salmonella as indicators). Phytotoxicity can be prevented by controlling the amount PAA-conditioned sludge that is mixed in the soil to be fertilized. The required PAA dose for hygienization was relatively high (480 mg 100% PAA per L sludge) but the results indicated that other sludge stabilization processes are not necessarily required. Therefore, the proposed process involving PAA could be feasible in cases where limited land area is available for sludge processing or quick conditioning of sludge is required. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB A novel rotating advanced oxidation contactor (RAOC) equipped with high-silica zeolite/TiO2 composite sheets was applied to remove sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and its transformation byproducts from fresh aquaculture wastewater (FAWW). Adsorption and photocatalysis of SMM was not interfered by coexisting substances in the FAWW. The combination of adsorption and photocatalysis by the RAOC degraded SMM more rapidly than photocatalysis alone, possibly because of the synergetic effect. Moreover, the increase in UV fluence rate (UVFR) enhanced SMM degradation, and the linear relationship between UVFR (0.9-3.6 J/cm(2)/h) and the rate constant for SMM degradation was observed. The removal behavior of the transformation byproducts generated via hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of SMM was investigated, and their degradation was inhibited by the coexisting substances. The RAOC treatment was repeated five times without exchanging the composite sheets to evaluate the reusability of the composite sheet. The RAOC stably and completely eliminated SMM from the FAWW, showing the zeolite was regenerated by the photocatalysis of SMM adsorbed in the composite sheets. The results demonstrated that the RAOC effectively and stably removed SMM and its transformation byproducts from the FAWW. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of the current research was to detect some antibiotics in hospital sewage and compare their removal rates reached using a vermifilter (VF) pilot and a real activated sludge (AS) treatment system. Six target antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline and metronidazole) prescribed in the hospital were detected in the sewage and the removal rates via the two systems were examined. Three sampling points were chosen: the raw effluents from the hospital, VF and AS. Four sampling campaigns were performed over four months. Moreover, the environmental risk assessment was performed for all the antibiotics through estimating risk quotients (RQs). All the antibiotics were quantified in all the samples taken. It was found that ciprofloxacin had the highest concentration (7505.08-14731.88 ng/L). The results revealed that the VF reactor had a better and more stable performance in removal of the antibiotics than the AS system even though all the antibiotics were present in the effluents of both the processes compared. Further, according to the calculated RQs, the hospital effluent had even high risk to algae and, generally, the VF system was capable of reducing the ecotoxicity of the antibiotics. Therefore, it could be confirmed that earthworm-based vermifiltration can be considered as a promising alternative to conventional processes like AS, particularly when it comes to economic situations.

AB Light-driven degradation of organic contaminants by photocatalytic nanoparticles has attracted significant attention for wastewater treatment applications. However, implementation of these approaches has been limited by challenges in reactor design, which often require post-treatment separation of nanoparticles or exhibit low reactivity owing to immobilization of particles at the surface of heterogeneous supports. In this work, we present a material design strategy that circumvents these challenges by encapsulating photocatalytic particles in three-dimensional polymer networks, leading to structurally-stable photocatalytic hydrogels that were used as the walls of a flow reactor. This design leverages the volumetric reactions of commonly-implemented slurry reactors but circumvents the need for downstream separation of photocatalytic particles. A two-step soft lithography technique was used to fabricate a patterned poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) hydrogel composite with embedded titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles that were employed as a photocatalyst. In this configuration, contaminant molecules introduced via a flow channel were absorbed into the hydrogel, and subsequently diffused to the surface of the embedded photocatalyst particles where they were oxidized upon light irradiation. Using reactor configurations with low residence times (15 seconds) and moderate UV irradiation (0.28 mW cm(-2) at 365 nm), we demonstrated removal of up to 33% of model contaminant methylene blue (MB) and 13% of the antibiotic norfloxacin, both of which were introduced at a concentration of 3 mg L-1. The influence of molecular design parameters, such as hydrogel ionic strength, crosslinking density, and photocatalyst loading on transport and reactor performance were investigated and shown to have a strong influence on the transport properties of the hydrogels, providing options for optimizing the material to enhance treatment efficiency.

AB The effect of the UV-C/free chlorine (FC) process on the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from real urban wastewater as well as the effect of UV-C radiation on the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) compared to FC process alone was investigated. Unlike of FC process, UV-C/FC was really effective in the degradation of the target CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and imidacloprid) in real wastewater (87% degradation of total CECs within 60 min, Q(UVC) =1.33 kJ L-1), being CBZ the most refractory one (49.5%, after 60 min). The UV-C radiation significantly affected the formation of THMs. THMs concentration (mainly chloroform) was lower in IJV-C/FC process after 30 min treatment (<1 mu gL(-1) = limit of quantification (LOQ)) than in FC process in dark (23 mu gL(-1)). Noteworthy, while in FC treated wastewater chloroform concentration increased after treatment, UV-C/FC process resulted in a significant decrease (residual concentrations below the LOQ), even after 24 h and 48 h post-treatment incubation. The formation of radicals due to UV-C/FC process can reduce THMs compared to chlorination process, because part of FC reacts with UV-C radiation to form radicals and it is no longer available to form THMs. These results are encouraging in terms of possible use of UV-C/FC process as advanced treatment of urban wastewater even for possible effluent reuse.

AB Municipal wastewater can contain large amounts of organic micropollutants. Some of these substances are harmful to the environment, even at low concentrations, e.g. when being discharged untreated into surface water bodies in case of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during or after heavy rainfall events. Constructed wetlands can be very effective in treating CSOs. To date, there have only been few investigations about the retention of micropollutants using retention soil filters (RSFs), which basically are vertical flow constructed wetlands with an additional retention area. Thus, focus of this study was set on the interaction between dry periods, loading events, filter operation time, and the resulting removal of micropollutants originating from CSOs. The removal of 1-H-benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol A was examined in four test-scale RSFs. Removal efficiencies of approximately 70% were found for metoprolol. 1-H-benzotriazole, diclofenac and bisphenol A were removed moderately between 30 and 40%. For carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, negative retention rates were found. No significant correlations were found between removal efficiencies and the length of the antecedent dry period and/or filter operation time. However, the study showed that removal efficiencies depend strongly on respective inflow concentrations. Thickness of the filter layer seems to have an influence as well; does not lead to uniform results, though. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial sweeteners (ASs) are applied widely as sucrose substitutes in food, pharmaceuticals, and personal-care products, which results in their release into surface water. The occurrence of ASs in aquatic environments in China has rarely been reported. In this study, we determined the concentration of seven ASs in surface water and sediment samples from 16 lakes in Wuhan. The sum of the ASs concentration ranged from 0.89 to 20.6 mu g/L in the surface water, with a mean value of 4.96 +/- 5.16 mu g/L. The most abundant AS was sucralose (SUC), with a concentration from 0.33 to 18.0 mu g/L, followed by acesulfame (ACE) (0.40-2.78 mu g/L), saccharin (SAC) (< MDL to 1.86 mu g/L), and cyclamate (CYC) (< MDL to 2.22 mu g/L). SUC and ACE accounted for 90% +/- 8% of the total ASs in the surface water. The Sigma(4) ASs sediment concentrations ranged from 1.71 to 6.49 ng/g of the dry weight (dw, mean value 3.03 +/- 1.03 ng/g dw). SAC, CYC, and ACE were detected in sediments (< MDL to 4.17 ng/g dw), with SAC as the dominant AS. In surface water, the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations of Hanyang station were higher than those of Hankou, while the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations in sediment samples from different regions showed no significant difference. The ASs concentrations in the surface water and sediment in winter were significantly higher than those in summer. Relatively higher concentrations and detected frequencies of SUC and ACE were found in surface water samples, whereas these two ASs were absent in background samples, which indicates that SUC and ACE can be used as potential indicators of wastewater contamination in Wuhan, China.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING

AB The growing global food security crisis is complicated by the need for increased crop production with less arable land and limited water resources. Reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation is becoming more common, often paired with other conservation measures such as subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). Passively injecting air into SDI systems increases crop yields and overcomes root zone wetting issues. However, when used with treated irrigation water, contaminants in the water might be taken up by the crops. This paper investigates the impact of air-injected water containing caffeine, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil on plant uptake and soil microbial communities in Salanova lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Aerated lettuce yielded higher plant mass and root length. The use of air-injected water reduced the uptake of caffeine and gemfibrozil and increased the uptake of carbamazepine. Gemfibrozil and carbamazepine were primarily detected in leachate, while caffeine was observed in the soil samples. Injected air significantly impacted (p-value < 0.001) the fate and transport of gemfibrozil. Injection of pharmaceutically active compounds and the presence/absence of injected-air created a variation in soil microbial communities. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB BACKGROUND Phenols are compounds found in agricultural by-products, with high antioxidant activity and positive impact on human health. As a result, their isolation and purification is of interest for the production of cosmetics, nutritional and pharmaceutical supplements. A preliminary design for a plant with a treatment capacity of 1.1 m(3) h(-1) of liquid by-products or extracts is presented herein, based on experiments carried out with three materials rich in phenolic compounds. The proposed process for the separation of phenols implements physicochemical methods such as solvent extraction, filtration through membranes, adsorption/desorption on resins and vacuum evaporation. The materials tested were olive mill wastewater (OMW), grape marc and olive leaves. RESULTS The final products of the proposed process were rich in phenolic compounds, with the OMW final concentrate containing 378 g L-1 phenols in gallic acid equivalents, 84.8 g L-1 being hydroxytyrosol (61% of the initial amount of hydroxytyrosol was retrieved in the final concentrate in 0.05% of the initial OMW volume). The final concentrate of olive leaf extract contained 98 g L-1 phenols in gallic acid equivalents, and the final concentrate of grape marc phenols 190 g L-1 in gallic acid equivalents, containing 4.7 g L-1 catechin (25% of the initial amount of catechin was retrieved in the final concentrate in 0.04% of the initial extract volume). CONCLUSIONS The combination of the proposed techniques proved to be effective for the separation and purification of phenols contained in agro-industrial by-products. As a result, a new process was designed for their separation and purification. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are recognized as one emerging group of environmental contaminants, capturing worldwide attention. These chemicals, closely connected to anthropogenic activities, are mainly transported through aquatic environments and reach coastal areas, eventually entering ocean offshore. Thus, this study concentrated on the 30 PPCPs in coastal waters of the Yellow and Bohai seas (77 sites), a fast-growing area with intensive anthropogenic activities. In general, the total concentrations of PPCPs in Chinese coastal waters (0.880-1194 ng L-1) greatly varied and were relatively greater than those (9.91-442 ng L-1) in Korean coastal waters. Sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, oxytetracycline, ofloxacin, roxithromycin, anhydro-erythromycin, and caffeine were the seven predominant PPCPs in the coastal waters of study area. Further, we established the Predicted PPCPs Contamination Indicator (PPCI) to address potential anthropogenic activities being associated with site-specific PPCPs contamination. Three anthropogenic factors to PPCPs contamination were proven as the most influential, including (1) quantity of wastewater discharge, (2) gross product of meat, poultry, eggs and milk, and (3) gross aquatic product. The relatively high PPCI values appeared in Tianjin, Dalian, Tangshan, Yantai, and Qingdao in China and Gyeonggi and Jeonbuk in South Korea, which exhibited fairly good consistency with the corresponding PPCPs concentrations. A mini-review of the global PPCPs distributions revealed that seven priority PPCPs found in this study distributed widely in Asia rather than Europe, North America, and Australia. In general, global PPCPs contamination also reflected site-and region-specific distributions, suggesting varying usages and sources cross the region and/or country. Finally, the risk assessment suggested that ofloxacin and anhydro-erythromycin, with 36.4% and 23.4% sites higher than medium risks respectively, posed relatively high risks to sensitive algal species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Selenastrum capricornutum. Overall, the ecological risks of exposure of PPCPs in the Yellow and Bohai seas were higher compared to other regions of the world, thus the bilateral management of PPCPs between China and South Korea needs an immediate attention.

AB This study investigated the fouling mechanism in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by membrane distillation, with a focus on the interfacial electrokinetic effect between the membrane and foulants as well as the surface hydrophobicity effect, and an advanced in-situ optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology. Three antibiotics with different surface charges were used as feed solutions, consisting of cefotaxime (CTX, negatively charged), tobramycin (TOB, positively charged) and ciprofloxacin (CFX, neutral) for studying the interfacial electrokinetic effect. In order to study the influence of membrane hydrophobicity on the fouling process, two commercial membranes with different hydrophobicity were employed; commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (C-PVDF) and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (C-PTFE). Additionally, we also fabricated a fouling resistant polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane coated with perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (FTES)-TiO2 nanoparticles to engineer the surface charge and energy, and to achieve a superhydrophobic surface. After the MD operation, OCT scans detected no visible foulant layer on the three negatively charged membranes when treating negatively charged CTX. On the other hand, in the case of positively charged TOB, the rejection efficiency was only 78% due to its accumulation behavior on the C-PVDF membrane surface, with a thick foulant layer (326-408 mu m) and blockage of pores, while the TiO2-PVDF membrane exhibited a stable performance.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are largely consumed worldwide. As a result, NSAIDs were already found in a variety of environmental aqueous samples, in concentrations ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. This is due to the inability of the currently used technologies in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to completely remove such pollutants/contaminants, thus leading to serious environmental and public health concerns. This work addresses the preparation and application of materials based on silica chemically modified with ionic liquids (SILs) as alternative adsorbents to remove NSAIDs from aqueous media. Modified silica-based materials comprising the 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium cation combined with six anions were prepared, and chemically and morphologically characterized. Adsorption kinetics, diffusion models and isotherms of sodium diclofenac-as one of the most worldwide consumed NSAIDs-were determined at 298 K. The Boyd's film diffusion and Webber's pore diffusion models were used to disclose the rate controlling step affecting the adsorption process. A maximum equilibrium concentration of sodium diclofenac of 0.74 mmol (0.235 g) per g of adsorbent was obtained. Several solvents were tested to remove diclofenac and to regenerate SILs, being the mixture composed of 1-butanol and water (85:15, v:v) identified as the most promising and ecofriendly. After 3 regeneration steps, the material is able to keep up to 75% of its initial adsorption efficiency. Considering the maximum values reported for sodium diclofenac in effluents from WWTPs/STPs, 1 g of the most efficient material is "ideally" able to treat ca. 50,000 L of water. These materials can thus be envisioned as efficient filters to be implemented at domestic environment in countries where the levels of pharmaceuticals are particularly high in drinking water.

AB Heterogeneous hybrid systems have emerged as effective approaches for decontamination of aqueous solutions containing non-biodegradable compounds. This is the first study employed hexagonal magnesium oxide (MgO) anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as heterogeneous catalyst, in coupling with UV and ultrasound (US) waves (marked as MCs/UV/US) for degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ). MgO/CNT nanocomposites (MCs) were synthesized through an ultrasound-assisted hydrothermal method, and their properties were characterized via BET, FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, EIS, TGA, UV-vis DRS, EDAX, and EDS techniques. The FESEM and TEM results indicated that CNTs were well-incorporated into the hexagonal MgO. The ability of MCs/UV/US system for SDZ decontamination was evaluated as a function of solution pH, catalyst loading, US power, UV intensity, initial SDZ concentration, scavenging agents and co-existing chemicals. As-prepared catalyst showed a significant synergistic effect in the presence of both UV and US irradiation for SDZ mineralization. During sono-photocatalytic process, the complete degradation of SDZ (45 mg/L) was achieved at pH: 11.0; MCs: 0.9 g/L; US power: 200 W; and UV intensity: 150 W within 80 min reaction. MCs exhibited high chemical stability and reusability after six consecutive cycles. However, the addition of co-existing anions, especially Cl-, gradually reduced the efficiency of SDZ degradation over MCs/UV/US system. Trapping studies indicated that hydroxyl radicals and holes were responsible for oxidation of organic chemicals during the reaction period. The plausible pathway and mechanism of sono-photocatalytic decomposition of SDZ were determined in details. Kinetic data confirmed that degradation process was fitted to a pseudo first-order kinetic model with a regression coefficient of 0.98. MCs/UV/US process effectively quenched 89% and 96% of TOC and COD in the pharmaceutical wastewater, respectively. The biodegradability and toxicity of the produced organic chemicals were considerably enhanced after the treatment.

AB For detoxification and improving the biodegradability of pharmaceutical wastewater, fenton process is an attractive method for detoxification of pharmaceutical wastewater, especially when the reaction can be conducted at neutral pH values. In this study, activated alumina supported CoMnAl composite metal oxides (CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3) were prepared and employed in Fenton-like reaction for detoxification of pharmaceutical wastewater, and the catalysts were characterized by N-2-BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results of catalyst activity experiment indicated that Co and Mn on the surface of CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3 present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of HO%, and CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3/H2O2 Fenton-like system was very effective for pharmaceutical wastewater detoxification at a wide pH range. Typically, pharmaceutical wastewater was disposed under the coexistence of 30 g L-1 of catalyst and 9 g L-1 of H2O2 within 3 h at 25 degrees C, about 35% total organic carbon (TOC) was removed and the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (B/C) increased from 0.173 to 0.464.

AB In this study, it was demonstrated that the Fe ion was an effective promoter of bulk MoS2 for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade acetaminophen (ACT). ACT removal rate constant in the presence of 5 mg/ L FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O (0.1099 min(-1)) was approximately 20 times as that in the absence (0.0045 min(-1)) with 0.1 g/L MoS2 of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O at pH(0) 3. Both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization and quenching experiment suggested the key role of singlet oxygen (1O2), acting as dominant reactive species responsible for ACT degradation in the Fe2+/MoS2/PMS system. Besides, the chemical state and composition of MoS2, the ion (Fe and Mo) concentrations and the speciation of Mo(VI) were investigated. Results suggested that the promoting effect of Fe(II) ion originated from the regeneration of Fe2+ mediated by MoS2, and the formation of molybdenum(VI) peroxo complex species in Fe2+/MoS2/PMS system. The present study not only provides an insight into PMS activation by MoS2 accelerated by Fe(II) ion, but also suggests an high-efficiency, easy-to-handle and environmentally friendly method to treat refractory wastewater.

AB The reuse of treated municipal wastewater (herein referred to as reclaimed water) in agricultural irrigation (RWAI) as a means to alleviate water scarcity is gaining increasing policy attention, particularly in areas where water demand mitigation measures have proved insufficient. However, reclaimed water reuse in practice is lagging behind policy ambition, with <2.5% of it reused in a European context. A key barrier identified as limiting its full valorisation is concern over its impact on human and environmental health. To address this concern, and to meet further objectives including achieving parity between current reclaimed water reuse guidelines operational in various Member States, the European Commission has proposed a regulation which identifies minimum quality requirements (MQR) for a range of microbiological and physico-chemical parameters but the inclusion of compounds of emerging concern (CECs) in terms of the determination of quality standards (QS) is missing. This paper reviews the existing pertinent EU legislation in terms of identifying the need for CEC QS for RWAI, considering the scope and remit of on-going pan-European chemicals prioritisation schemes. It also evaluates opportunities to link in with the existing EQS derivation methodology under the EU WFD to address all protection targets in the environmental compartments exposed via potential pathways of RWAI. Finally, it identifies the main data gaps and research needs for terrestrial ecosystems, the removal efficiency of CECs by WWTPs and transformation products generated during the wastewater reuse cycle.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a unique group of emerging and nonpersistent contaminants. In this study, 27 PPCPs in various water samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE), and determined by isotope dilution method using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem triple quadruple mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). A total of 27 isotopically labeled standards (ILSs) were applied to correct the concentration of PPCPs in spiked ultrapure water, drinking water, river, effluent and influent sewage. The corrected recoveries were 73%-122% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) < 16%, except for acetaminophen. The matrix effect for all kinds of water samples was < 22% and the method quantitation limits (MQLs) were 0.45-8.6 ng/L. The developed method was successfully applied on environmental water samples. The SPE extracts of spiked ultrapure water, drinking water, river and wastewater effluent were stored for 70 days, and the ILSs-corrected recoveries of 27 PPCPs were obtained to evaluate the correction ability of ILSs in the presence of variety interferences. The recoveries of 27 PPCPs over 70 days were within the scope of 72%-140% with the recovery variation < 37% in all cases. The isotope dilution method seems to be of benefit when the extract has to be stored for long time before the instrument analysis.

AB Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller headwater streams. In 2014-2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111 pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites sampled 3-5 times, 47 putative lowimpact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32 low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75% of sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates) space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination.

AB The presence of endocrine disrupting compounds in water receptor bodies, such as drugs, currently has in scientific field a great focus of studies focused on advanced water treatment techniques that enable the decontamination of water sources and public supply. In this context, this study focused on the characterization and evaluation of photocatalytic activity of catalysts calcined and uncalcined synthesized TiO2 and the commercial sol-gel route from caffeine degradation. The photocatalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), photoacoustic spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). They seek to evaluate the main textural, structural, chemical, and morphological differences that the method of synthesis can promote in obtaining a titanium oxide-based catalyst. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that the synthesis method significantly influences the activity of the materials and that calcined TiO2 catalyst prepared using the sol-gel method has promising photocatalytic capabilities for the elimination of drugs such as caffeine when present in wastewater.

AB An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) with six subsystems has been operated for six years (60,000 Ton day(-1)) and exhibited strong stability and high efficiency for removing conventional pollutants in tail water. This study was aimed to characterize the removal efficiency of antibiotics in relation to bacterial community structure and composition in this integrated constructed wetland. Water samples were taken from different ICW sites in two distinct seasons (i.e. winter and summer). The results showed that concentrations of antibiotics in ICW decreased from influent to effluent with varying removal rates among the different antibiotics (quinolones, ulfonamides and macrolides). The pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA revealed that the composition of dominant phyla could be grouped into four bacterial clusters and the key discriminant phyla, family or genera from each cluster was strongly associated with the specific physicochemical parameters of water or type of antibiotics. Members of the key phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Parcubacteria, and Actinobacteria) appeared to play an important role in antibiotics removal. In general, both the concentration of antibiotics and physicochemical parameters of water shaped the bacterial communities. These results improve our understanding of the interactions between antibiotics or water physiochemical parameters and bacterial communities in the integrated constructed wetland.

AB Pharmaceuticals are detected at trace levels in water. Their adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems required novel pharmaceutical remediation methods for treating wastewater effluents. Layer double hydroxide (LDH) is abundantly available by simple preparation methods and with low costs. The extensive use of antibiotics nowadays leads to increasing the appearance of antibiotic resistance between bacteria and decreasing the effectiveness of antibiotics. In this work, the removal of one of these antibiotics named "oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC)" by Zn/Fe LDH was investigated. The Zn/Fe LDH before and after adsorption was characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR analysis, zeta potential, particle size, BET surface area, HRTEM, FESEM, and XPS. The effects of different factors on the OTC adsorption performance were investigated. The removal percentage of OTC was 77.23% by Zn/Fe LDH. The isothermal and kinetic study of OTC adsorption was carried out at pH 6 at 25 degrees C using different models. The adsorption mechanism was investigated by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT), applied after activated sludge treatment (AST), has been widely used for wastewater reclamation. AST and SAT show potential for removing micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, the role of sequential combination of AST and SAT on the biodegradation of PPCPs was not clear in previous studies. In this study, the removal characteristics of PPCPs in AST and SAT were evaluated to assess the legitimacy of sequential combination of AST and SAT. SAT showed effective removals of antibiotics (> 80%), including fluoroquinolones and macrolides by sorption, but poor removals of amide pharmaceuticals (i.e. carbamazepine and crotamiton) were observed in both AST and SAT. Additionally, biodegradation contributed to the effective removal of carboxylic PPCPs (i.e. ketoprofen and gemfibrozil) in both ASTs and SAT, but effective biodegradation of halogenated acid and polycyclic aromatic compounds (i.e. clofibric acid and naproxen) was observed only in SAT (82.1% and 81.8%, respectively). Furthermore, the microbial substrate metabolic patterns showed that amino acids, amines, and polymers were biodegradable in SAT, which was fit for the biodegradation characteristics of PPCPs in SAT. For microbial communities, Proteobacteria were dominant in AST and SAT, but Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were more abundant in SAT than AST, which could contribute to the effective removals of halogenated acid in SAT. Considering PPCP biodegradation and substrate metabolism, SAT displays a wider range on the biodegradation than AST. Therefore, we conclude that these two processes can complement each other when used for controlling PPCPs.

AB The present paper reports the adsorption performance of iron oxide nanoparticles (IOPs) for the removal of oxcarbazepine drug from wastewater. Kinetics and adsorption isotherms for the adsorption of oxcarbazepine drug on IOPs have been evaluated. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out to describe the adsorption of oxcarbazepine onto developed iron oxide nanoparticle adsorbent. Thermodynamic studies of the adsorption of oxcarbazepine onto IOPs showed negative increment G(0) and positive increment H-0, suggesting that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process, associated with mainly physical adsorption. Oxcarbazepine adsorption and intra-particle diffusion rates, adsorption capacities, equilibrium constants and enthalpy parameters were calculated.

AB Background Unregulated use of veterinary pharmaceuticals has caused environmental concerns such as ecotoxicity and development of genetic resistance in the microbial biosphere. Photocatalytic treatments, e.g. photo-Fenton reaction, have been considered for their removal. In this work, substitution of the use of a chemical oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide (Fenton reaction) by organic molecules from sonicated microalgae biomass Chlorella sp, combined with Fe2+ and UV light, was used to evaluate the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) and hormone 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in synthetic wastewater. Results Removal of CIP was improved using only UV (71%), by adding Fe2+ at 0.54 mmol L-1 (90.17%) and combining these with sonicated microalgae biomass (0.4 g L-1), achieving >99% CIP removal and 75% E2 removal after 120 min of treatment. When the conditions were optimized, aiming to decrease the Fe2+ concentration and improve the removal of CIP, the optimal conditions were pH 7, sonicated microalgae biomass concentration 0.5 g L-1 and 0.39 mmol L-1 Fe2+, reaching 97 and 70% removal efficiency for CIP and E2 respectively; when microalgae biomass was not added, removal decreased to 90 and 57% respectively. Conclusion Photodegradation with sonicated microalgae biomass has demonstrated to be an effective option to improve the removal of selected antibiotics and hormones from wastewater, considering that no acidification or costly reagents are needed for its optimization.

Bacterial communities in plant roots and rhizomes were identified in treated and control samples by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Moreover, bacterial endophytes were isolated in R2A and 1/10 869 media and screened for their ability to metabolize SMX and DCF in liquid medium by HPLC. Our results show significant changes in the abundance of main genera, namely Sphingobium and Streptomyces between control and treated plants. Around 70% of the strains isolated from exposed plants belonged to the phylum Actinobacteria and were classified as Streptomyces, Microbacterium, and Glycomyces. In non-exposed plants, Proteobacteria represented 43.5% to 63.6% of the total. We identified 17 strains able to remove SMX and DCF in vitro. From those, 76% were isolated from exposed plants. Classified mainly as Streptomyces, they showed the highest SMX (33%) and DCF (41%) removal efficiency. These isolates, alone or in combination, might be used as bio-inoculants in constructed wetlands to enhance the phytoremediation of SMX and DCF during wastewater treatment.

AB BACKGROUND The performance of a biological aerated filter (BAF) with activated sludge and nut shell activated carbon was evaluated for the advanced treatment of intractable refinery wastewater. Bioaugmenting the BAF with Pseudomonas sp. FS-01 and Bacillus sp. FS-02 and the microbial community structure between the upgrade system and the original system were also studied. RESULTS During the steady state of the BAF, the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was in the range 80-128 mg L-1, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) was in the range 15-20 mg L-1. The BAF with activated carbon from nut shells as a supporting material can remove over 32% of influent COD and 95% of NH4+-N. On bioaugmentation, the average effluent COD and NH4+-N concentrations were 31.8 and 0.4 mg L-1, respectively. The predominant genera in BAF1 were Nitrospira, an unranked member of the Anaerolineaceae and an unclassified member of the Rhizobiales, while the dominant genera in BAF2 were Pseudomonas, Bacillus and an unranked member of the Anaerolineaceae. CONCLUSIONS The coconut shell activated carbon has outstanding properties for removing COD and NH4+-N, along with high shock loading resistance. Bioaugmentation can improve the COD remove efficiency by 35% in relation to only adding sludge. Microbial diversity analysis indicated that bioaugmentation accelerated the transformation of the bacterial community structure, quickly becoming dominant strains. This bioaugmented process may be a promising alternative technology for the treatment of refractory wastewater. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pesticides, personal care products, industrial chemicals often pollute surface- and groundwater sources. With trace concentrations and low molecular weights, these micropollutants (MPs) easily penetrate through treatment systems and impose a real health threat on drinking water consumers. The absence of a dedicated MP-retaining treatment technology at water treatment plants results in a constant consumption of MP-contaminated water. Advanced oxidation processes, and in particular the Fenton reaction, can successfully degrade MPs if other, larger, fractions of organics are retained. Here, we suggest a novel combined two-stage retention-degradation approach. Ceramic membranes retain large organics such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fenton processes disintegrate nonretained MPs such as methylene blue (MB) and bisphenol A (BPA) that penetrate through the membrane. The efficiency of the suggested approach is high. Single-layered ultrafiltration membrane retains more than 96% BSA and degrades 40-50% of MB and BPA. The degree of degradation depends on both the impregnated metal oxide and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Vanadium-based catalysts retain more than 90% MPs but leach into permeate. Ferric oxides were the only stable catalysts that performed better in membranes than when impregnated on alpha-Al2O3 pellets. A combined retention-degradation can be optimized to result in superior degree of retention. Catalytic ceramic membranes can retain large organic molecules and decompose MPs simultaneously. Three parameters affect the process efficiency: the dynamics of the influent fluid, the catalyst dose and the contact time.

AB Traces of antibiotics within domestic and industrial effluents have toxic impact on human health as well as surrounding flora and fauna. Potential increase in antibiotic resistance of microorganisms is likely to rise due to the incomplete removal of antibiotics by traditional wastewater processing, methods such as membrane filtration and biological treatment. In this study, we investigated a novel class of material termed Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM) that is based on amorphous microporous organic materials for the application of antibiotic removal form aqueous environments. The adsorption of four commonly used antibiotics (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, and amoxicillin) was evaluated and found that at least 80% of the initial concentrations was eliminated under the optimized conditions. Langmuir and Freundlich models were then employed to correlate the equilibria data; the Freundlich model fit well the data in all cases. For kinetic data, pseudo-first and second order models were examined. Pseudo-second order model fit well the kinetic data and allowed the calculation of the adsorption rate constants. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained by conducting the adsorption studies at varied reaction temperatures. Surface potential, adsorption at various solution pHs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), and surface area experiments were conducted to draw possible adsorption mechanisms. The removal of antibiotics from water by PIM-1 is likely to be governed by both surface and pore-filling adsorption and could be facilitated by electrostatic interactions between the aromatic rings and charged functional groups as well as hydrogen bond formation between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Our work shows that the application of such novel microporous material could contribute to the removal of such challenging and persistent contaminants from wastewater with further optimizations of large-scale adsorption processes.

AB This study used suspect and nontarget screening with high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the occurrence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the nearshore marine environment of Puget Sound (WA). In total, 87 non-polymeric CECs were identified; those confirmed with reference standards (45) included pharmaceuticals, herbicides, vehicle-related compounds, plasticizers, and flame retardants. Eight polyfluoroalkyl substances were detected; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) concentrations were as high as 72-140 ng/L at one location. Low levels of methamphetamine were detected in 41% of the samples. Transformation products of pesticides were tentatively identified, including two novel transformation products of tebuthiuron. While a hydrodynamic simulation, analytical results, and dilution calculations demonstrated the prevalence of wastewater effluent to nearshore marine environments, the identity and abundance of selected CECs revealed the additional contributions from stormwater and localized urban and industrial sources. For the confirmed CECs, risk quotients were calculated based on concentrations and predicted toxicities, and eight CECs had risk quotients >1. Dilution in the marine estuarine environment lowered the risks of most wastewater-derived CECs, but dilution alone is insufficient to mitigate risks of localized inputs. These findings highlighted the necessity of suspect and nontarget screening and revealed the importance of localized contamination sources in urban marine environments.

AB In recent years, more and more countries see irrigation using reclaimed water as an opportunity to secure and enhance agricultural production. Despite the benefits of water reuse, the scientific community raised several concerns and challenges for human health and the environment. This includes chemical risks. Effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants usually contain a wide range of organic chemicals. Such chemicals remaining in the water after the treatment process may cause hazards for human health, contaminate surrounding soil and water resources, and even compromise drinking water sources. Once crops on irrigated sites are exposed to chemicals, the potential transport to and accumulation in the edible parts of fruits and vegetables need to be controlled to rule out their introduction into the food chain. Finally, problems concerning the release of wastewater-borne antibiotics into the environment are starting to gain attention. For these reasons, agricultural irrigation should face more stringent quality requirements in order to minimize chemical risks. Combinations of measures reducing chemicals at the source, technical and natural water treatment processes especially to remove chemicals with persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), or persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) properties, good agricultural practices, and supplementary preventive measures (e.g. knowledge transfer to the stakeholders involved) will be necessary to bring about and ensure safe irrigation in the future. While internationally many regulations and guidelines for water reuse have successfully been implemented, questions remain whether the current knowledge regarding chemical risks is sufficiently considered in the regulatory context. The introduction of a new regulation for water reuse, as attempted in the European Union, poses a good opportunity to better take chemicals risks into account.

AB Fenton oxidation is one of the promising advanced oxidation processes for the efficient elimination of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. The strong oxidation ability of this process is attributed to the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) in the solution. In the present study, heterogeneous micro-sized zeolite catalysts that contain iron have been used in the Fenton-like process. This process enables operation in a wide pH range and facilitates the reuse of catalysts. Indeed, the coupling of the heterogeneous Fenton reaction with membrane filtration will ensure catalyst retention in the effluent compartment during the continuous water treatment. This study then investigated the fouling control strategies and membrane long-term stability in the heterogeneous Fenton reactor. During the filtration of the zeolite catalyst suspension, the critical flux for irreversible fouling was determined. One of the strategies to control membrane fouling can then be to choose an operating flux below this critical flux. In the case where a flux value above the critical flux is chosen, the results demonstrated total efficiency of hydrodynamic backwashing to eliminate hydraulically reversible fouling. Concerning the question of polymeric membrane long-term stability, it has been demonstrated that due to contact with the Fenton medium, membrane material undergoes oxidation and polymeric chain scissions. This latter is strongly linked to the decline in the mechanical resistance of membranes. In the tested conditions, despite the degradation to membrane material, the critical flux for irreversible fouling remained unchanged on aged membranes.

AB BiOBr-based composite photocatalysts had attracted extensive attention for efficient photocatalytic degradation aqueous organic pollutants in the past decade. However, the catalysis ability of photocatalyst is greatly limited by their intrinsic high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers. Herein, we solve this problem by constructing a novel 2D/3D Bi5O7Br/BiOBr heterojunction photocatalyst that was prepared via one-step facile hydrolysis process. The pure Bi5O7Br and pure BiOBr photocatalysts were also obtained by only adjusting the pH value of the mixed solution. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical and electric property analysis and etc. The results suggested that 2D Bi5O7Br nanosheets tightly attached to the surface of BiOBr 3D structure with nanoflakes self-assembled microsphere, which could increase the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated charges. Furthermore, the 2D/3D Bi5O7Br/BiOBr heterojunction exhibited superior visible light photocatalytic performance for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation than pure BiOBr and pure Bi5O7Br, which owing to the enhanced separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. At last, the underlying photocatalytic mechanism is elucidated based on the band structure and radical scavenging experiments. This work provided a feasible design idea to one-step construct 2D/3D nanocomposite for pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

ID PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; PHARMACEUTICALS
AB Concentration polarization is a phenomenon inherent to membrane separation operations and as a precursor of membrane fouling is frequently related to the decrease in the performance of these operations. In the present work, a case-specific mass transfer correlation was developed to assess the concentration polarization when nanofiltration, in different operating conditions, was applied to treat a pharmaceutical wastewater containing atenolol. NF runs with two membranes, two atenolol concentrations and three feed circulating velocities were conducted, and the corresponding experimental mass transfer coefficients were determined using film theory to describe the concentration polarization phenomenon. Higher velocities led to higher mass transfer coefficients and, consequently, lower concentration polarization. These mass transfer coefficients were correlated with the circulating velocity (Re), the solute diffusivity (Sc) and the membrane permeability (L-P(+)) (the membrane is a permeable interface with effect on the concentration profiles developed from the interface towards the bulk feed), yielding the following correlation Sh = 1.98 x 10(4)Re(0.5)Sc(0.33)L(P)(+0.32). The good agreement between the calculated and the experimental results makes this correlation a valuable tool for water practitioners to predict and control the concentration polarization during atenolol-rich wastewater treatment by nanofiltration, thereby increasing its productivity and selectivity.

Water quality assessment targets general parameters, which often misleads to underestimation of their implication in the environment. Acute and genotoxicity assays using Daphnia magna is a reliable tool for testing deleterious effects of wastewater exposure. This paper aimed at evaluating acute ecotoxicity as well as genotoxicity of a biological treatment system composed by an anaerobic bioreactor (AR), algal turf scrubber (ATS), followed by two downflow constructed wetlands (CW). The university's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) composed by an equalization tank (ET), an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), followed by an aerobic bioreactor (AB) was also assessed for acute and genotoxicity. Our results showed the acute ecotoxicity ranged from moderately to extremely toxic, and from nontoxic to moderately toxic for ET and AB. For AR, most samples were moderately toxic. The outflow from ATS and CW's tanks completely eliminated acute toxicity and genotoxicity evidencing that the proposed system combining ATS and vertical CWs is suitable for treating sanitary wastewater.

AB In the present study, the potential of Azolla filiculoides (A. filiculoides) was first investigated for degradation of Phenazopyridine (PhP), an analgesic drug. The effects of main variables such as initial pharmaceutical concentration, amount of plant, and pH were studied on the efficiency of the biological process. It was observed that A. filiculoides was able to remove pharmaceuticals from contaminated water up to 85.90% during 48 h. Then, the electro-Fenton (EF) method was applied for further removal of PhP yielding a removal rate of about 98.72% under optimum conditions during 2 h. The effects of variables including the current, amount of catalyst, and pH were also studied in this phase. Also, the probability of adsorption was investigated during this step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed for the used magnetite nanoparticles, total organic carbon (TOC) were performed to investigate PhP removal efficiency during the reaction time and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were performed to analyze degradation byproducts of PhP. Based on the results, it was found that a combination of these bioremediation and electrochemical removal steps were capable of PhP removal from contaminated water. Therefore, this approach may be effective for phytoremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated aquatic ecosystems.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a subset of micropollutants, present in the environment in trace concentrations. Because of their persistent nature, these chemicals are of particular concern. Little is known about how mixtures of pharmaceutical residues, found in WWTP effluents, affect the environment or public health. Yet, numerous studies show negative outcomes for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms, suggesting that they are given both to bioaccumulation and uptake in plants. Israel leads the world in effluent reuse (86%), almost exclusively utilized for purposes of agricultural irrigation. Pharmaceuticals, however, are not included in Israel's water regulatory oversight or management, essentially creating an epidemiological experiment among its citizens and environment. Globally, these compounds also are not commonly subject to monitoring or regulation. This study reviews and analyzes water policies and regulation worldwide that address the presence of pharmaceuticals in water resources, with a particular focus on Australia, Singapore, Switzerland, and the USA. Furthermore, the study investigates the reasons why these chemicals are not yet regulated in Israel. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the data and analysis of the regulatory rationale in other countries, a list of recommended pharmaceutical standards that should be measured and monitored in Israel's wastewater treatment system is proposed. The suggested prioritization criteria should be at the heart of a new regulatory agenda for controlling pharmaceutical contamination in wastewater.

AB This work describes a simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous isolation, enrichment, identification and quantitation of selected antiretroviral drugs; emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz in aqueous samples and plants. The analytical method was based on microwave extraction and hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction technique coupled with ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. A multivariate approach via a half-fractional factorial design was used focusing on six factors; donor phase pH, acceptor phase HCI concentration, extraction time, stirring rate, supported liquid membrane carrier composition and salt content. The optimal enrichment factors for emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz from aqueous phase were 78, 111 and 24, respectively. The analytical method yielded recoveries in the range of 86 to 111%, and quantitation limits for emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz in wastewater were 0.033, 0.10 and 0.53 mu g L-1, respectively. The drugs were detected in most samples with concentrations up to 37.6 mu g L-1 recorded for efavirenz in wastewater effluent Roots of the water hyacinth plant had higher concentrations of the investigated drugs ranging from 7.4 to 29.6 mu g kg(-1). Overall, hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction proved to be an ideal tool for isolating and preconcentrating the selected antiretroviral drugs from environmental samples.

AB The occurrence of azole antifungals in the environment presents one of the emerging concerns due to their ecotoxicological threat as well as their potential contribution to the evolution of drug resistant fungi in the environment. In this study, the occurrence of eight commonly prescribed azole antifungal drugs was seasonally determined in influent and effluent water samples from three wastewater treatment plants and a drinking water treatment plant in South Africa. In addition, the risk quotient (RQ) method was employed to investigate the potential ecological and human health risks associated with their presence in the wastewater and/or drinking water. Clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and miconazole were detected at least once in the water samples, while posaconazole and voriconazole were not detected in any of the samples for all seasons at which the samples were collected. Fluconazole was detected at higher frequency (about 96%) with a concentration up to 9959.0 ng L-1. Clotrimazole had the second highest frequency of detection (about 33%) with a concentration up to 143.3 ng L-1. Statistically significant temporal variation in clotrimazole (p < 0.05) and spatial variation in fluconazole (p < 0.05) were observed. In general, the preliminary ecological risk assessment based on risk quotient (RQ) calculation indicated that there is currently no high risk against aquatic organisms (Algae, Daphnia and Fish) related to the azole antifungals. Meanwhile, human health risk assessment demonstrated that fluconazole represented high risk in drinking water. Furthermore, risk estimates showed a potential for the detected concentrations of fluconazole and itraconazole in water samples to pose moderate to high risk for development of antifungal drug resistance. Some of the azole antifungal drugs are ubiquitous in the wastewater and future monitoring and validation studies should be conducted for those drugs that seem to pose human health and ecological risks.

AB The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as antibiotics, antimicrobial disinfectants, nonprescription drugs, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and steroids, in water resources can impact aquatic and human health. A large portion of the CECs entering regional wastewater treatment plants originate from hospitals. The purposes of this study were to conduct exploratory analytical work to characterize two hospital wastewaters and to evaluate treatment of CECs at hospitals before dilution with domestic wastewater. A 24-h batch reaction with biogenic manganese oxides coated onto coir fiber was used to treat the wastewaters. Organic contaminants in the wastewaters were concentrated by both liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE). LLE extracts were analyzed by Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) while SPE extracts were analyzedby UltraHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography/Time-ofFlight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-TOFMS). Fifty-two organic micropollutants were detected (26 by GC x GC-TOFMS, 25 by UHPLC-TOFMS, 1 by both) in the wastewaters, while 29 were removed by >90% and six were degraded by <50% after treatment. Control experiments revealed that sorption to coir fiber and oxidation by manganese oxides were the primary contaminant removal mechanisms. Both the LLE and SPE extracts were used to evaluate potential human toxicity of the hospital wastewaters before and after treatment. Twenty-eight human cell-based bioreceptor assays were used to screen the wastewaters, and secondary tests were run to quantify toxicity equivalents to activated receptors. The wastewaters initially contained organic micropollutants that strongly activated the Androgen Receptor, Estrogen Receptor p, and the Mineralocorticoid Receptor but no bioactive compounds were detected after treatment. Point-of-entry treatment of hospital wastewater should reduce bioactive compounds from entering the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidative degradation of emerging waterborne contaminants, particularly pharmaceuticals, is currently an extensively studied field of research. In this study, a UV-254 nm activated persulfate (PS) system (UV254/PS) was used to eliminate Theophylline (TP) from simulated and real industrial effluents. Results showed that TP is strongly resistant to degradation through direct photolysis under UV-254 nm irradiation. UV254/PS system showed efficient degradation, in which [PS](0) = 0.25 mM achieved total degradation of [TP](0) = 10 mg L-1 in a period of 20 min and followed a pseudo-first order reaction kinetics (k(obs) = 0.173 (+/- 0.004) min(-1)). Effect of several matrix parameters were tested to study the robustness of TP degradation in real-life cases such as pH, chlorides, bicarbonates, and dissolved oxygen, in which neutral pH gave the highest degradation rate (k(obs) = 0.40 (+/- 0.03) min(-1)), chlorides and bicarbonates showed minimal impact, and anoxic conditions inhibited TP degradation with a significant decrease in k(obs) e.g. 0.817 (+/- 0.41) x 10(-1) min(-1). Additionally, TP was spiked into natural spring, sea and wastewater, where the three tested matrices showed a decrease in the degradation rate, with the latter being the most significant (k(obs) = 6.9 (+/- 0.9) x 10(-3) min(-1)). Radical scavenging experiments showed that sulfate radicals were the main contributors in TP degradation. Furthermore, wastewater effluent obtained from a local pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and containing [TP](0) = 160 mg L-1 was also tested and showed successful full degradation over 3 h in 25 mM PS-spiked medium with an average reaction stoichiometric efficiency of about 3.7% and at an estimated cost of 17.2 $ m(-3).

AB In this study, the performance and removal mechanisms of a novel lab-scale multiple draft tubes airlift loop membrane bioreactor (Mt-ALMBR) for treating high-strength ampicillin pharmaceutical wastewater under different temperatures (7 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 48 degrees C) were investigated. During 150 days operation, the optimal average chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ampicillin removal rates were 98.2 +/- 0.2% (36 degrees C) and 63.2 +/- 5.6% (7 degrees C), respectively. The main mechanisms of pollutants removal were membrane removal (7 similar to 16 degrees C) and bioreactor removal (16 - 48 degrees C). Adsorption and membrane rejection were main pathways at low temperature, as temperature increased, hydrolysis and biodegradation gradually occupied a dominant position. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature ranges for activated sludge microorganisms were 16 degrees C similar to 36 degrees C, the corresponding beta-lactamase at 36 degrees C was the highest activity value among all the set temperature values. Experimental results showed that temperature had a significant impact on the removal rate, the optimum temperature range was proposed to be at 24 similar to 36 degrees C. The half-life (t(1/2)) of ampicillin drastically decreased from 330.0 d to 2.1 d when the temperature was increased from 7 degrees C to 48 degrees C. And the maximum adsorption capacity K-f at the adsorption temperatures of 7, 16, 24, 36 and 48 degrees C was 0.1284, 0.2169, 0.0645, 0.1502 and 0.1524 mg/g, respectively. The values of Delta G degrees were all negative, proving that the adsorption process of the ampicillin belonged to a spontaneous physical adsorption. In addition, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and mathematical fitting models were developed and well simulated the performance of Mt-ALMBR to treat the ampicillin wastewater. These results suggest that Mt-ALMBR holds great potential for application in ampicillin pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB When using municipal wastewater as a potable water source, advanced treatment is mandatory for the removal of trace organic contaminants, including pharmaceuticals. UV-radiation (254 nm) is frequently used in combination with hydrogen peroxide at the end of the advanced treatment train for simultaneous disinfection and degradation of trace organic contaminants. In this work, a comprehensive study on the direct UV photolysis of eleven organic compounds (including ten pharmaceuticals and N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)) was conducted at varying pH of 5-8 using a collimated beam apparatus. Molar extinction coefficient (epsilon) and quantum yield (QY) values of different ionic forms (cationic, neutral and anionic) for eleven organic compounds were estimated in the tested pH range. Furthermore, direct UV photolysis at a full-scale UV photoreactor with 30 low-pressure UV lamps was performed at pH 6.2 and 7.8 by varying water flow rates (375-2700 L min(-1)) and UV fluences (400-4000 mJ cm(-2)). A process model was developed to determine the log reduction of the test compounds. The model combines a Lagrangian fluence model in the photoreactor with a pH-dependent photochemical kinetic model that ulilized the measured molar extinction coefficient and quantum yield values. The observed log reductions matched well with the model predictions for most of the tested compounds.

AB Organosilicon wastewater, generally contains plentiful silicone polymers, high salinity and high chemical oxygen demand (COD), and therefore, has great impact on the environment. This study explored the degradation of organosilicon wastewater by UV-based advanced oxidation processes: UV/H2O2, UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) and UV/peroxymonosulfate (PMS). At natural pH of wastewater and 100 mM of oxidant concentration, UV/PDS achieved a higher COD removal (90.6%) than UV/PMS (80.8%) after a 240 min reaction time, whereas only half time was required for UV/H2O2 to reach nearly the same COD removal (89.7%) as UV/PDS. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis indicated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were the main reactive species for COD removal. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to monitor the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in the organosilicon wastewater. The results illustrated that the tyrosine-, tryptophan- and humic-like substances were three components of DOM and all of them were significantly degraded into smaller molecular weight fractions.

AB Naproxen is an organic micropollutant widely distributed in municipal wastewaters and water bodies, it is not eliminated by wastewater treatment plants, and it accumulates in soil. In this research, the capability of the non-viable Rhizopus oryzae biomass (wet and dry) to sorb naproxen at environmentally relevant concentrations was assessed in batch experiments. Naproxen sorption was carried out as a function of pH and modeled by kinetic and equilibrium equations. Naproxen sorption increased with increasing pH values using wet biomass, but it also increased at acidic pH values with dried biomass. Dried biomass was more efficient and faster in removing naproxen and the maximum sorption was 1027.45 mu g naproxen per gram of dried biomass at pH 4.7. Wet biomass sorption capacity was low and slow, and the equilibrium was achieved at 7 days, whereas with dried biomass at 26 h. Freundlich isotherm describes naproxen sorption by dried biomass.

AB Persistence of antibiotics in soil and aquatic ecosystem is the primary reason for the emergence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. After consumption, antibiotics are poorly retained in our body, and a major fraction is excreted out. These bioactive compounds end up in wastewater. The routine treatment practiced by the conventional wastewater treatment plants does not remove the entire load of antibiotics. Cost-effective and environment-friendly treatment technologies need to be developed to address this issue. Vetiver system is being adapted throughout the world due to its removal capacity and high tolerance toward several toxic organic and inorganic pollutants. In this study, we investigated the potential of vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides), a fast-growing, perennial grass capable of growing in a hydroponic setup, to remove two widely prescribed antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TTC) from secondary wastewater effluent. Significant (p < 0.05) removal of antibiotics and nutrients (N & P) by vetiver grass from secondary wastewater effluent was observed within 30 days. Vetiver grass removed more than 90% antibiotics from secondary wastewater matrix. In addition to antibiotics, vetiver grass also removed nitrate (>40%), phosphate (>60%), total organic carbon (>50%), and chemical oxygen demand (>40%) from secondary wastewater effluent.

AB In this study an impedimetric immunosensor was developed in order to determine ciprofloxacin (CIP) in wastewater samples, an emergent contaminant widely found in wastewater. To achieve this, an anti-ciprofloxacin antibody was immobilized on the surface of a printed carbon electrode. Then, the developed immunosensor was applied in wastewater samples from Universite Laval residences (Quebec, Canada) through the load transfer resistance (R-ct) using [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as a redox probe, and the average CIP concentration was found to be 2.90 x 10(-4) mu g mL(-1). The observed R-ct changes presented a linear relationship from CIP concentrations of 10(-5) to 1.0 mu g mL(-1), with detection and quantification limits of 2.50 x 10(-6) and 7.90 x 10(-6) mu g mL(-1), respectively. The immunosensor presented high selectivity and repeatability, as well as a good recovery rate in wastewater samples (97%). Significant interference with other compounds was not observed. The proposed method requires only 30 mu L of sample without the use of organic solvents or preceding sample preparation and/or extraction techniques. Moreover, the method is fast: only 20 min of incubation followed by 2 min of analysis time was sufficient to obtain the CIP concentration. The method's estimated cost is U$ 2.00 per sample.

AB This paper has endeavoured to produce a technical note on the hazards that humans and the environment face with the burden of wastewater irrigation on crops and the soil. Reports based on past and present issues related to wastewater used in irrigation of crops and the health implications when it is applied in the arable field for irrigating crops have been considered broadly. It is conclusive that wastewater has polluted and contaminated crops and soil when not properly treated before being applied for irrigation purposes. The crop effects and advantages of wastewater reuse in agriculture are of extensive application because of a lack of water in numerous parts of the world. Besides, the impacts of wastewater systems should be assessed not only from the perspective of social, monetary and natural viewpoints, but in addition from the sustainable improvement point of view; thus this paper surveyed the sustainability, benefits, impediments, developments and innovations of using the wastewater in water systems for agriculture. Wastewater treatment must be further advanced to address developing concerns such as amount and quality. More effective decentralized wastewater administration frameworks must be set up to provide the approach to abridge the cost of wastewater treatment. Finally, we require suitable strategies to catch and convey water, secure soil, reuse wastewater and streamline its administration. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This work evaluates the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, with special emphasis on their metabolites, in raw hospital wastewater (HWW) using wide-scope screening based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. The applied strategy uses an extended purpose-built database, containing >1000 pharmaceuticals and 250 metabolites. Raw HWW samples from a hospital located in south Brazil were collected over six months, with a monthly sampling frequency. Accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by quadrupole-time of flight MS allowed the identification of 43 pharmaceuticals and up to 31 metabolites in the samples under study. Additionally, other four metabolites not included in the initial database could be identified using a complementary strategy based on the common fragmentation pathway between the parent compound and its metabolites. Nine metabolites derived from four pharmaceuticals were identified in the raw HWW samples, whereas their parent compounds were not found in these samples. The results of this work illustrate the importance of including not only parent pharmaceuticals but also their main metabolites in screening analysis. Besides, the inclusion of in silico QSAR predictions allowed assessing the environmental fate and effect of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in terms of biodegradability, as possible Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) compounds, and their potential hazard to the aquatic environment.

AB Retention soil filters (RSFs) are vertical flow constructed wetlands. They are mainly used for the treatment of combined sewer overflow or stormwater, and not operated during dry weather conditions. However, RSFs have been successfully tested as continuous post treatment for sewage treatment plant effluents. In this paper we present a new approach, namely dual usage of the retention soil filter. During dry weather the RSF is used for the polishing treatment of sewage treatment plant effluent and during overflow events, the retention soil filter treats the combined sewer overflow. This study was conducted at two pilot RSFs that were fed with sewage treatment effluent for four years. Removal of TOC, DOC, nutrients and 21 organic micropollutants was determined during six months at different sequences of regular effluent and overflow treatment conditions. TOC, DOC and nutrients, appearing in high concentration in combined sewer overflow, were effectively removed, and metformin and caffeine micropollutants showed >99% removal. Residues from this combined sewer treatment that were sorbed on filter material or stored in pore water were washed out directly after treatment when STP effluent infiltration was initiated. This effect declined within 20 h after combined sewer overflow treatment. Dry periods of 18 h between combined sewer and sewage treatment plant effluent feeding counteracted the wash out effects. The highest removal efficiency was found in the beginning of the feeding time of 28 h, indicating that shorter feeding cycles enhance the overall efficiency of the RSF. Finally, the results show that a single RSF system can successfully reduce emissions of TOC, DOC, nutrients and micropollutants to surface waters from two different emission pathways, i.e. from regular treated effluents and storm related sewer overflows. In conclusion, the dual usage of RSF is a promising approach and ready for upscaling and implementation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are major contaminants of aquatic environments. The effects on aquatic organisms have been assessed mostly through eco-toxicological tests performed using static exposure systems or flow through systems with constant concentrations. Yet, constant concentration exposures ignore the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemicals in flowing environments. In dynamic systems, a chemical's effect on an organism will vary due to fluctuations in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of the chemical concentration within the plume, which develops due to turbulence interacting with the geomorphology of habitat. The aim of this study was to analyze how different exposure dynamics to the antidepressant fluoxetine might alter the agonistic behavior of aquatic organisms. Male crayfishes, Faxonius virilis, were subjected to 23 h exposures at different concentrations of fluoxetine (control, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/l) in both static and dynamic mesocosm systems. After exposure, sizematched crayfishes, from the same exposure system and fluoxetine concentration, underwent a fifteen minute fight trial. The aggressive intensities and duration of agonistic interactions were quantified. The time spent performing a tailflip was significantly longer for fluoxetine concentrations of 1, 10, 100 mu g/l in the static exposure than in the dynamic exposure. On other hand, the time spent at higher intensities and the time to escalate to the highest intensity of interactions in control treatments were significantly lower in the dynamic exposure than in the static exposure. Whereas, in elevated fluoxetine concentrations, these times were significantly higher in the dynamic than in static treatments. Therefore, we could conclude that the fight dynamics and duration of agonistic behavior in crayfish were affected by static and dynamic exposure paradigms differently. Despite these behavioral changes, serotonin levels in fluoxetine-exposed crayfish did not differ significantly between exposure paradigms. Future research should incorporate different exposure methods that more accurately represent chemical exposure in natural habitats. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to determine accurately the fate of APIs in soil is essential for rigorous risk assessment associated with wastewater reuse or biosolid recycling to land, particularly in lower income countries where water and fertiliser is scarce. Four APIs (naproxen, ofloxacin, propranolol and nevirapine) with wide ranging functionality were used as examples in the development of the OECD 106 soil partitioning and/or degradation study, with naproxen used to illustrate applying the full methodology. The data showed key methodological criteria require careful consideration and testing to generate accurate and consistent results. Only glass fibre membranes were suitable for all APIs, without unduly adsorbing APIs to their surface, thus effectively restricting the minimum practical pore size to 0.7 mu m. Polypropylene plastic centrifuge tubes were shown to be suitable, with careful determination of recoveries. Direct injection liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry could reliably resolve all 4 APIs down to less than mu g L-1 in soil solutions, although allowance for matrix effects via standard additions was required in some cases. Greatest analytical challenges were found for the highest molecular weight API with the greatest affinity for sorption to surfaces (ofloxacin). Key variables that can impact on partitioning such as solution pH and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were shown to vary within tests over time and should be accounted for.

AB While the use of transition metal oxides in catalyzing advanced oxidation reactions has been widely investigated, very few reports have focused on how the preliminary contact of oxides with target compounds may affect the succession of reaction. In this study, we examined the adsorption and electron transfer reactions of two fluoroquinolones, flumequine (FLU), and norfloxacin (NOR), with goethite (alpha-FeOOH) or manganese (Mn) oxide, and their impact on the subsequent mineralization of target compounds using H2O2 or S2O82- under UVA irradiation. Intriguingly, higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal was achieved when antibiotics and metal oxides were allowed for preequilibration before starting the oxidation reaction. The rate and extent of TOC removal are strongly dependent on the molecule structure and the redox-active mineral used, and much less on the preequilibration time. This high efficiency can be ascribed to the presence of reduced metal ions, chemically or photochemically generated during the first stage, onto oxide minerals. Oxide-bound Mn-II plays a crucial role in catalyzing oxidant decomposition and then producing greater amounts of radical species through a photoassisted redox cycle, regardless of the underlying surface, (MnO2)-O-IV or (MnOOH)-O-III. This finding will be of fundamental and practical significance to Mn-based oxidation reactions and wastewater treatment processes.

AB Fenton processes are promising wastewater treatment alternatives for bio-recalcitrant compounds. Three different methods (i.e., reverse microemulsion, sol-gel, and combustion) were designed to synthesize environmentally friendly ferrites as magnetically recoverable catalysts to be applied for the decomposition of two pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and carbamazepine) that are frequently detected in water bodies. The catalysts were used in a heterogeneous solar photo-Fenton treatment to save the cost of applying high-energy UV radiation sources, and was performed under a slightly basic pH to avoid metal leaching and adding salts for pH adjustment. All the developed catalysts resulted in the effective treatment of ciprofloxacin and carbamazepine in both synthetic and real domestic wastewater. In particular, the sol-gel synthesized ferrite was more magnetic and more suitable for reuse. The degradation pathways of both compounds were elucidated for this treatment. The degradation of ciprofloxacin involved attacks to the quinolone and piperazine rings. The degradation pathway of carbamazepine involved the formation of hydroxyl carbamazepine and dihydroxy carbamazepine before yielding acridine by hydrogen abstraction, decarboxylation, and amine cleavage, which would be further oxidized.

AB Different carbon xerogels (CXs) were synthesized by the polymerization of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) catalyzed by cesium carbonate (Cs), and by varying the molar ratio R/Cs. The CXs were labeled as XCs-100, XCs-500, XCs-1000, and XCS-2000, corresponding to the R/Cs ratio of 100, 500, 1000, and 2000, respectively. The surface chemistry of the CXs varied very slightly with the R/Cs ratio because the point of zero charge (pH(PZC)) and the concentrations of basic and acid sites were almost independent on the R/Cs ratio. The surface areas of the four CXs decreased slightly by increasing the R/Cs ratio; however, XCs-500 presented the highest volume of pores and mesopores and mesopore surface area. At a concentration of diclofenac (DCF) at equilibrium of 800 mg/L, the adsorption capacities of XCs-100, XCs-500, XCs-1000, and XCs-2000 towards DCF in aqueous solution were 132.0, 184.6, 126.5, and 126.4 mg/g, respectively. Hence, the adsorption capacity of XCs-500 was about 1.4 times larger than those of the other CXs. The adsorption capacity of XCs-500 was reduced by increasing the solution pH due to electrostatic interactions, whereas the adsorption capacity was increased by raising the temperature, confirming that the adsorption was endothermic. The bacteria Escherichia coli adhered to the surface of XCs-500 forming a biofilm, and the presence of bacteria enhanced 1.3 times the adsorption capacity of XCs-500 towards DCF from water solutions.

AB This work presents a case study of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in Biscay (Spain), in which the removal of high-occurrence contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) was studied. The existing biological treatment in the WWTP was complemented with a continuous ultrafiltration (c-UF) pilot plant, as a tertiary treatment. Thus, the effect on CEC removal of both treatments could be analyzed globally and after each operation. A total of 39 CEC were monitored, including pharmaceutical products, industrial additives, food additives, herbicides and personal care products. For evaluation of the efficiencies, the removal rates of the biological and of the c-UF treatments, including their variability over a day and a week in relation to the ammonium content, were examined in the influent of the WWTP. In the biological treatment, a wide range of different removal rates was obtained due to the different CEC's biodegradability and concentration. In UF, lower, but more constant removal rates, were achieved. In addition, the reduction of the general toxicity by the UF treatment in terms of the Microtox((R)) toxicity assay was also evaluated. After UF, all of the samples yielded values of TU50 lower than 1, confirming this result the UF effectiveness for toxicity removal.

AB Purpose Pharmaceutical residues in the environment can pose significant risks to ecosystems and human beings due to adverse pharma-specific effects. Existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies do not usually consider the use and end-of-life (EoL) phase of pharmaceuticals and thus exclude relevant potentially toxic emissions of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Therefore, a simplified inventory model for the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals is provided by estimating API flows and emissions to the environment. Methods Both the qualitative description of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals and the quantification of the flows within each life cycle phase are based on literature and expert knowledge. Existing approaches to determine the API emissions are adjusted to make them applicable in LCA. In addition, different uses and EoL scenarios (e.g. depending on the patients' disposal behaviour) are specified, and assumptions are highlighted. Finally, the model is exemplarily applied to the oral intake of ibuprofen to test its applicability. Results and discussion Eleven potential flows and emissions of an API are identified and quantified for different application forms (pulmonary, oral, cutaneous). The model is applied to ibuprofen where potential API emissions result from administered and unused products. Referred to the administered amount of ibuprofen (reference flow), the product is mainly metabolized (73.1%). The unmetabolized (parental) compound enters the sewage treatment plant where it is degraded (13.94%), or emitted to surface water (8.35%), air (0%) and sewage sludge (0.36%). The remainder cannot be clearly assigned to one of the flows (4.25%). The results of this example are hardly comparable to existing measured data because they are related to the functional unit. The effect of assumptions, limitations due to data availability and the geographic scope reveal the need for further research. Conclusions To facilitate the consideration of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals in future pharma-LCAs, a simplified inventory model specified for German conditions, is provided which allows to calculate inventory results with easily and publically accessible data. However, remaining challenges such as the lack of data to model the behaviour of metabolites in the sewage treatment plant, missing approaches to include specific pharmaceuticals (e.g. hormones, anticancer drugs), the consideration of other sewage treatment technologies such as ozonization, the integration of API emissions from sewage sludge (e.g. due to the use as fertilizer) or the scope expansion with regard to the geographic validity of the model shall be further examined.

AB This research investigated the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin by titanium dioxide nanoparticles immobilized on a glass plate in an aqueous solution. The important point about this process is immobilization on glass plate, which resolves difficulties related to separation of catalysts from the solution in the application of sole nanoparticles as well as reusability of nanoparticles. Application of nanoparticles without immobilization on a support medium causes toxic effects in aqueous solutions, which was fixed through immobilization on a glass plate in this study. In this research, 1 gL(?1) of TiO2 was immobilized on a glass plate. XRD and SEM indicated that the TiO2 immobilized on the glass plate was highly pure and uniform in size (39.2?74.9?nm). The maximum ciprofloxacin removal efficiency from the synthetic aqueous solution was obtained at the optimal pH of 5, contact time of 105?min, and ciprofloxacin initial concentration of 3 mgL(?1). The extent of ciprofloxacin removed under optimal conditions was obtained as 92.81% and 86.57% from the synthetic and real samples, respectively. Evaluation of linear models of kinetics and adsorption isotherms indicated that the data followed pseudo-first-order kinetics as well as Langmuir?Hinshelwood and Freundlich isotherms. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin on TiO2 nanoparticles immobilized on glass plate is an endothermic and physical process. Considering the high efficiency of this process under real conditions, it can be used for the removal of resistant pollutants from industrial wastewater.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR) is a typical kind of Fluoroquinolone antibiotics which is extensively used around the world. Residues of NOR have been found continuously increasing in the water systems thus posing detrimental effects to the aquatic ecosystem and human health. In this study, the degradation effect and mechanism on NOR in aqueous solution are investigated by gas-liquid phase dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma combined with different catalysts (H2O2 or Fe2+). The concentrations of three representative plasma-generated long-lived reactive species (H2O2 , O-3 and NO3(-))were measured in dH(2)O and found enhancing with the lengthening discharge period. Variations on the treatment parameters were carried out in discharge power, initial solution pH and the concentration of catalysts. A discharge power at 60 W provided optimal balance on the degradation effect and energy efficiency would be beneficial, while there is not much impact from the initial solution pH on NOR degradation. Both H2O2 and Fe2+ at low concentration (0.5-10 mg/L of Fe2+, 0.1-1.0 mmol/L of H2O2) were observed contributing to the improvement on the NOR degradation rate, while inhibition would occur at high concentration (10-20 mg/L of Fe2+, 1.0-2.0 mmol/L of H2O2). The DBD/H2O2 (0.5 mmol/L)/Fe2+ (10 mg/L) system was found the optimal condition to achieve a high NOR degradation rate of more than 98% after plasma treatment for only 0.5 min at discharge power of 60 W. Moreover, 72.3 +/- 1.7% of the total organic carbon (TOC) in NOR solution have been removed in the DBD/Fe2+ (10 mg/L) system at 15 min which signifies a high mineralization efficiency. The cleavage of piperazine ring and quinolone ring, defluorination and hydroxylation are considered the major pathways for NOR degradation. The biological toxicity of the plasma/Fe2+-induced degradation intermediates has been detected and it fluctuated with the treatment time and finally declined. Therefore, the DBD/catalyst system could be an effective and promising method on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in the future.

AB The feasibility of using titanium dioxide (TiO2) and ultraviolet-light-emitting diode in a batch reactor to remove metformin from synthetic wastewater was studied. The primary tests were using TiO2 and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, and complimentary steps continued using modified (m-TiO2, FeFNS-TiO2). Variation of different factors such as pH, the concentration of TiO2, radiation intensity, the concentration of metformin in a solution and duration of experiments were tested. Results indicated that in the normal pH range, removal of metformin by m-TiO2 increased up to 60% in comparison with using an unmodified catalyst. Although the highest efficiency was represented in basic (alkaline) pH range, contaminated waters usually are in a range of neutral pH. Therefore, changing pH before or after the process is not justified economically. The concentration of catalyst was another factor that was studied in the range of 0.1 to 1 g L-1. Results indicated that the increasing catalyst concentration up to 0.8 leads in augmentation of removal efficiency of metformin and in higher concentrations, the efficiency, reduced, which may be as a result of preventing crossing radioactive radiation due to solution turbidity. Furthermore, an increase in metformin concentration, reduced efficiency. Removal of metformin in the concentration of 2mg L-1 was equal to 98% and in a concentration of 10 mg L-1 was equal to 72% using modified TiO2. Also, the increase of reaction process time increased the removal efficiency, but the optimum process time was selected 30 min according to the results and economic interests. Adding anions and scavengers to the synthetic wastewater in the batch reactor also reduced the efficiency. The reason for this reduction may be decreasing free active spaces on the catalyst surface by sulfate, ultraviolet ray absorption by nitrate and using hydroxyl radicals by carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, methanol and salicylic acid scavengers. Similar results were also observed while using tap water instead of distilled water in producing synthetic wastewater and the efficiency of metformin removal decreased in comparison with using distilled water. Evaluation of the results similarly indicated conformity of the results to a Lagergren's first-order model semi first-order kinetics.

AB Design of ship sewage treatment systems that not only satisfy the use of small space on board but also meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) latest emission standards is still a challenging problem for ship industry. This study provides a comparative disquisition between two different MBR reactors i.e, air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR) and anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic membrane reactor (AOA-MBR) for domestic sewage treatment. The influence of pollutants volume loading rate (VLR) and C/N on effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and TN for marine domestic sewage was analyzed. The results revealed that AMCMBR showed better removal efficiencies for COD and TN than AOA-MBR. The volume of AMCMBR was only half of the AOA-MBR. In addition, high average value of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) (i.e. 0.75) of AMCMBR indicated high biomass and good pollutants removal achieved by this reactor. An interesting phenomenon was found in the study regarding Urease activity for the two reactors. Urease activity for AMCMBR in different working conditions all exceeded AOA-MBR and there exist no clear difference of NR activities between AMCMBR and AOA-MBR except for low C/N ratio (i.e. 6 and 4). This phenomenon proved that AMCMBR has a greater performance for treating ship domestic wastewater.

AB The study is motivated by the industrial problem from pharmaceutical industry, which is ethanol and methanol removal from process wastewater. To complete this goal hybrid method is investigated and optimized. Two distillation columns are sufficient for separation of alcohol-water mixture. Suitable water can be purified as bottom product of first column. Ethanol and methanol purification is achieved with combination of second distillation column and pervaporation. The target of this research is to rigorously model and optimize the separation of water-ethanol-methanol ternary mixture in professional flowsheet simulator environment. The minimal sufficient membrane transfers area and number of minimal theoretical stages of the columns are determined. Cost estimation is also investigated according to Douglas methodology. Considering the simulation and economic results it can be determined that, the hybrid configuration is suitable for separation of ternary mixture in 99.5 weight percent purity.

AB Endocrine disruptors (ED) are exogenous agents capable of deregulating the normal functioning of the endocrine system in humans and animals. The ED entry routes in the environment highlight the launch of domestic and agricultural wastewater in water bodies. This work aims to evaluate the occurrence, mobility and biosorption attenuation of hormones and antibiotics in soil columns in the application of agricultural and domestic waste and rain simulation. Soil columns, which were filled with soil from an agricultural area, were installed under the conditions of a swine wastewater application (ARS) at a dose of 50 m(3)/ha with and without the biosorbent effect and human urine at a rate equivalent to nitrogen compared with ARS. The estrogen concentrations were observed by High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and the mass balance was developed to evaluate the estrogen removal in the soil profile. The occurrence of hormones in all analyses was approximately 20%. Pine bark adsorbent was found to be considerably efficient in removing hormones from liquid matrices. The mass balance of the soil columns with adsorbent exhibited an estrogen recovery in the matrix applied to less than a 1% rate. For comparison, the soil columns without adsorbent obtained a mass transit about 20% of the total applied.

AB Prazosin (PRZ), a drug used to treat hypertensive patients, is an emergent contaminant in water systems. PRZ is an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker used to treat anxiety, and is believed to reach the environment through human excretion, irresponsible disposal of unused medicine, and waste products from manufacturing plants. The purpose of this research was to isolate and characterize potential microbes for PRZ biodegradation and to identify the degradation pathway. After screening, isolated strain STP3 showed a capability for PRZ degradation and was chosen for further analysis. Resting cell assays with PRZ were conducted to identify the intermediate metabolites formed from biodegradation by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) analysis. Two metabolites degraded from PRZ by STP3 were successfully found, and as these metabolites are derived from the main structure of PRZ, their presence proved PRZ degradation. Draft genome sequencing analysis of STP3 was performed to identify potential enzymes for PRZ biodegradation based on the metabolites found.

AB A new approach based on ferrocyanide for iron removal in kinetic studies on Fenton treatments was developed and proposed. The influence of iron precipitation using the ferrocyanide treatment on the measured concentration of two model molecules (phthalic acid and meropenem) was studied. For this purpose, different solutions of phthalic acid and meropenem were prepared. Ferrous sulfate was added to the solutions after the adjustment of the pH value. Then, iron was removed by alkalization (traditional) and ferrocyanide treatments, this for phthalic acid. In the case of meropenem, the removal of iron was performed using only the ferrocyanide treatment due to a chemical modification of the molecule at (highly) alkaline conditions. It was found that the precipitation of iron with ferrocyanide can take place at initial pH values below 5.5 and 4.5, for phthalic acid and meropenem, respectively. The pH value of the supernatant solutions after precipitation, in both cases, was 7.0. The results show that the application of ferrocyanide treatment did not affect the measurement of the concentration of phthalic acid and meropenem after the removal of iron. In addition, some considerations are provided to apply this method to other molecules.

AB There is significant interest in increasing the microalgal efficiency for producing high-quality products that are commonly used as food additives in nutraceuticals. Some natural substances that can be extracted from algae include lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, carotenoids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamins. Generally, microalgal photoautotrophic growth can be maximised by optimising CO2 biofixation, and by adding sodium bicarbonate and specific bacteria to the microalgal culture. Recently, to enhance CO2 biofixation, a thermostable carbonic anhydrase (SspCA) encoded by the genome of the bacterium Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense has been heterologously expressed and immobilised on the surfaces of bacteria. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes, which catalyse the physiologically reversible reaction of carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons: CO2 + H2O reversible arrow HCO3- + H+. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that the fragments of bacterial membranes containing immobilised SspCA (M-SspCA) on their surfaces can be doped into the microalgal culture of the green unicellular alga, Chlorella sorokiniana, to significantly enhance the biomass, photosynthetic activity, carotenoids production, and CA activity by this alga. These results are of biotechnological interest because C. sorokiniana is widely used in many different areas, including photosynthesis research, human pharmaceutical production, aquaculture-based food production, and wastewater treatment.

AB Treated wastewater effluents are a source of emerging contaminants, including microplastics and pharmaceuticals, that impact rivers and streams. As microplastics are transported from wastewater treatment into the environment, pharmaceuticals can sorb to the surface and also be colonized by microorganisms. To investigate the microbial communities that are important in pharmaceutical transformation on microplastic surfaces, we used a culture-based approach with naproxen as the model pharmaceutical. Microplastic beads served as a solid substrate for delivering naproxen to anaerobic cultures inoculated with either anaerobic digester sludge or sediment from a wastewater-impacted river. After demonstrating naproxen transformation activity within the cultures, we separated the bulk liquid culture from the colonized microplastic beads and transferred them into separate bottles of sterile media amended with naproxen. Naproxen transformation occurred in cultures that contained microbially-colonized microplastics. Results from DNA analyses of the microbial community from each treatment demonstrated a different microbial community structure on the colonized plastic compared to that of the planktonic cells, thus illustrating a selection of the microbial community by the microplastics. These findings demonstrate that the microbial community attached to microplastic beads can continue pharmaceutical transformation activity when the microplastics are transferred to new media, thus serving as a model for the potential transport of pharmaceutical-transforming microbes from wastewater treatment to freshwater environments.

AB This work reports the development of an analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of three fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin ( CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL) in soil matrix. The proposed method was performed by using microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE), solid-phase extraction (SPE) for samples purification, and finally the pre-concentrated samples were analyzed by HPLC detector. In this study, various organic solvents were tested to extract the test compounds, and the extraction performance was evaluated by testing various parameters including extraction solvent, solvent volume, extraction time, temperature and number of the extraction cycles. The current method showed a good linearity over the concentration ranging from 1 - 300ng g(-1) with correlation coefficients (r(2) > 0.998) for all test compounds. Good recoveries were also obtained for the test compounds ranged from 89 - 99 %. The relative standard deviation (RSD) from intra-day and inter-day precision was lower than 7%, and the detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits ranged from 0.9 - 2.7ng g(-1). Finally, the proposed method was applied to determine the target compounds in real soil samples irrigated with wastewater. The results confirm the presence of the test compounds in soils with values ranging from 1.9 - 4.6ng g(-1), as well as the suitability of the proposed method to determine the test compounds in real soil matrix as well as the ability of the test compounds to accumulate in soils irrigated with sewage.

AB Pharmaceuticals are an integral part of modern medicine. We can hardly imagine the functioning of modern society without them. Thanks to medicines we can eradicate serious pandemic illnesses, help people overcome serious psychological or psychiatric problems, prolong life by lowering high levels of cholesterol and the occurrence of diabetes, offer comforting benefits like pain relief, and provide hormonal drugs to prevent unwanted conception. Pharmacology underwent a boom in the second half of the nineteenth century. Drugs continued to be developed in the twentieth century. It was only in 1965 that scientists noticed substances were finding their way into the environment, with a number of studies identifying pharmaceuticals in surface water. It was only in the 1990s that scientists began to draw attention to the impact of pharmaceuticals on fish and biota in watercourses. At the turn of the millennium, drug concentrations were found in drinking water and groundwater. Currently, we know that most persistent drugs are already distributed throughout the water cycle. We know they affect the environment but we are not clear as to what extent this impacts us as a human beings-we can only speculate about such impacts and hope that rising numbers of cancers and increasing infertility are not the consequences of this. This chapter aims to summarize the existing knowledge about entry pathways, occurrence, degradation, and behavior of drugs in the water cycle.

Oxidation of pharmaceutical wastewater was studied in a high pressure reactor, operated at temperatures between 450 and 600 degrees C. The parameters used were the temperature, pharmaceutical wastewater concentration, oxidant concentration and residence time. The results demonstrated that the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) process decreases the TOC up to more than 80% in very short reaction times (at a residence time of 3-12 min). This investigation will provide fundamental method for developing a pretreatment method of pharmaceutical industry wastewater with flexibility, simplicity and high activity.

AB Although hospital wastewaters (HWWs) are usually discharged in urban sewage systems, their separate treatment has several benefits, such as the specific treatment of potential toxics as well as avoidance of further dilutions. In this work, an integrated industrial pilot plant (2200 L) corresponding to the technology SeMPAC(R) is proposed and validated for such purpose. The process consists of a sequential batch reactor (SBR) connected to an external submerged microfiltration membrane, in which powdered activated carbon (PAC) is directly added into the biological reactor to enhance the removal of the organic micropollutants (OMPs). The combination of different redox conditions in the SBR, as well as the operation at long sludge retention times (SRTs) and high biomass concentrations favored OMP biotransformation in the SBR, being their final removal efficiencies enhanced clearly after PAC addition, especially for the recalcitrant compounds. A periodical renewal of the adsorbent is necessary to overcome its gradual saturation. The main operational conditions were influenced by (i) the recalcitrant OMP carbamazepine, which defines the PAC dosage; (ii) the easily degradable OMP ibuprofen, which can be used to optimize the duration of the aerobic cycle; and (iii) the denitrification efficiency, which defines the correct time length of the anoxic period.

AB Fluoroquinolones are extensively used in medicine due to their antimicrobial activity. Their presence in water inhibits microorganism activity in conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study aims to evaluate the technical feasibility of applying heterogeneous catalytic ozonation to eliminate ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a representative of fluoroquinolone antibiotics normally present in municipal wastewater discharges. Experiments were conducted in a semi-batch stirred slurry reactor, using 0.7 L of 100 mg L-1 CIP aqueous solution, at pH 3 and 30 degrees C. Experimental results show that single ozonation can easily oxidise CIP molecules (68%) within the first 5 min, leading to the generation of refractory oxidation by-products. However, when heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is applied using iron oxide supported on MFI synthetic zeolite, total degradation of CIP is observed at 5 min and a higher mineralisation rate is obtained. A novel sequential process is developed for CIP mineralisation. In a first step, a flash single ozonation is applied and CIP molecules are broken down. Then, a catalytic ozonation step is conducted by adding the Fe/MFI catalyst into the reactor. As a result of catalyst addition, 44% of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is eliminated within the first 15 min, compared to single ozonation where only 13% of TOC removal is reached in the same time. The application of this sequential process to a real wastewater effluent spiked with CIP leads to 52% of TOC removal.

AB In the present study, the occurrence of 40 pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutic groups was investigated for the first time in hospital effluent, wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent, and seawater in Mahdia, Tunisia. Forty-six samples were collected within a 6-month sampling period. Pharmaceuticals were analyzed using solid-phase extraction followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Thirty-three out of the forty target compounds were detected over a wide concentration of ranges, from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter, depending on the type of sample. Maximum values were detected for caffeine at 902 mu gL(-1) in hospital wastewater. This compound, as well as salicylic acid, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethizole, were detected in all samples. The average concentration of total pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater (340 mu gL(-1)) was higher than those detected in influent and effluent wastewater and seawater (275.11 and 0.2 mu gL(-1), respectively). Risk quotients (RQs) were also estimated to provide a preliminary environmental risk assessment and results revealed that sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine could pose medium/high risk to the tested aquatic organisms for maximum measured concentrations in wastewater (including hospital and WWTP samples). Although the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) detected in seawater samples might not pose a toxic effect to the aquatic organisms (except for salicylic acid, sulfamethoxazole and fluoxetine), further researches are needed due to the continuous release of wastewater in the environment and the limited efficiency of wastewater treatment processes.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) exists extensively in sewage treatment plant effluent, and it is one of the most reported environmental pharmaceutical contaminants. In this work, the photocatalytic degradation of DCF by titanium dioxide (TiO2) in pure water under visible light and the influence of humic acids (HA) (as a kind of dissolved organic matter (DOM), phosphate and ferrous ion (Fe2+)) were investigated. The results showed that the lower the pH was, the better the degradation effect of DCF under acidic conditions was. Different concentrations of DOM, phosphate ion, and Fe2+ could inhibit the degradation of DCF, and the higher the concentration was, the stronger the inhibition was. Different concentrations of chloride ions had little effect on the degradation. A slight elimination (8-12.9%) of total organic carbon (TOC) was observed during the mineralization of DCF with and without DOM and inorganic ions, indicating poor mineralization during the process of photocatalytic degradation, and DOM, phosphate, and Fe2+ had little effect on DCF mineralization. Furthermore, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and singlet oxygen radicals were present during the photocatalytic degradation of DCF. DOM and inorganic ions could inhibit the intensity of hydroxyl radical and promote superoxide radicals (O-2(-)) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) to varying degrees. Finally, the degradation mechanism and main products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and nine possible intermediates were detected. Hydroxylation, dechlorination, cyclization, and oxidation were the main degradation mechanisms. However, DOM, phosphate, and Fe2+ did not affect the type of intermediate products in terms of the mass-to-charge ratio. This paper mainly studied the mechanisms of different influencing factors in simulated environments to provide a theoretical basis for the degradation of DCF in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Organic contaminants (OCs), such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, flame retardants, and plasticisers, are societally ubiquitous, environmentally hazardous, and structurally diverse chemical compounds whose recalcitrance to conventional wastewater treatment necessitates the development of more effective remedial alternatives. The engineered application of ligninolytic oxidoreductase fungal enzymes, principally white-rot laccase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase, has been identified as a particularly promising approach for OC remediation due to their strong oxidative power, broad substrate specificity, low energy consumption, environmental benignity, and cultivability from lignocellulosic waste. By applying an understanding of the mechanisms by which substrate properties influence enzyme activity, a set of semi-quantitative physicochemical criteria (redox potential, hydrophobicity, steric bulk and pKa) was formulated, against which the oxidoreductase degradation susceptibility of twenty-five representative OCs was assessed. Ionisable, compact, and electron donating group (EDG) rich pharmaceuticals and antibiotics were judged the most susceptible, whilst hydrophilic, bulky, and electron withdrawing group (EWG) rich polyhalogenated compounds were judged the least susceptible. OC susceptibility scores were in general agreement with the removal rates reported for experimental oxidoreductase treatments (R-2 = 0.60). Based on this fundamental knowledge, and recent developments in enzyme immobilisation techniques, microbiological enzymic treatment strategies are proposed to formulate a new generation of biological wastewater treatment processes for the biodegradation of environmentally challenging OC compounds.

Different pharmaceutical products (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormones, and triclosan) were selected as target analytes, covering a range of hydrophobicity (LogP) of 3.1 to 5.2. The optimized procedure was used for the determination of the target pharmaceutical analytes in wastewater samples as model analytical problem. Absolute extraction recoveries were in the range of 51% to 103%. The presented method permits the determination of the target analytes at the low ng mL(-1) level, ranging from 0.8 to 5.9 (except for Triclosan, 106 ng mL(-1)) with good precision (relative standard deviation lower than 6%) using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with ultraviolet (DAD) and fluorescence (FLR) detection. The microextraction alternative resulted in a fast, simple, and green method for a wide variety of analytes in environmental water sample. The results suggest that this type of solvent turns out to be a great alternative for the determination of different analytes in relatively complex water samples.

AB The problem of the presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment is closely related to municipal wastewater and in consequence to municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) because wastewater is the main way in which these compounds are transferred to the ecosystem. For this reason, the development of cheap, simple but very effective techniques for the removal of such residues from wastewater is very important. In this study, the analysis of the potential of using three new plants: Cyperus papyrus (Papyrus), Lysimachia nemorum (Yellow pimpernel), and Euonymus europaeus (European spindle) by hydroponic cultivation for the removal of 15 selected pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in an MWWTP is presented. In order to obtain the most reliable data, this study was performed using real WWTP conditions and with the determination of the selected analytes in untreated sewage, treated sewage, and in plant materials. For determining the target compounds in plant materials, an Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE)-Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)-GC-MS(SIM) method was developed and validated. The obtained data proved that the elimination efficiency of the investigated substances from wastewater was in the range of 35.8% for diflunisal to above 99.9% for paracetamol, terbutaline, and flurbiprofen. Lysimachia nemorum was the most effective for the uptake of target compounds among the tested plant species. Thus, the application of constructed wetlands for supporting conventional MWWTPs allowed a significant increase in their removal from the wastewater stream.

   Abstract In this study, we present an innovative new bio-treatment approach for 17 alpha-ethynyestradiol (EE2). Our solution for EE2 decontamination was accomplished by using the SBP (Small Bioreactor Platform) macro-encapsulation method for the encapsulation of two bacterial cultures, Rhodococcus zopfii (R. zopfii ) and Pseudomonas putida F1 (P. putida). Our results show that the encapsulated R. zopffi presented better biodegradation capabilities than P. putida F1. After 24 h of incubation on minimal medium supplemented with EE2 as a sole carbon source, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was 73.8% and 86.5% in the presence of encapsulated P. putida and R. zopfii, respectively. In the presence of additional carbon sources, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was 75% and 56.1% by R. zopfii and P. putida, respectively, indicating that the presence of other viable carbon sources might slightly reduce the EE2 biodegradation efficiency. Nevertheless, in domestic secondary effluents, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was similar to the minimal medium, indicating good adaptation of the encapsulated cultures to sanitary effluents and lack of a significant effect of the presence of other viable carbon sources on the EE2 biodegradation by the two encapsulated cultures. Our findings demonstrate that SBP-encapsulated R. zopfii and P. putida might present a practical treatment for steroidal hormones removal in wastewater treatment processes.

AB Background: Water is a scarce resource and is considered a fundamental pillar of sustainable development. The modern development of society requires more and more drinking water. For this cleaner wastewater, treatments are key factors. Among those that exist, advanced oxidation processes are being researched as one of the sustainable solutions. The main objective of this manuscript is to show the scientific advances in this field. Methods: In this paper, a systematic analysis of all the existing scientific works was carried out to verify the evolution of this line of research. Results: It was observed that the three main countries researching this field are China, Spain, and the USA. Regarding the scientific collaboration between countries, three clusters were detected-one of Spain, one of China and the USA, and one of Italy and France. The publications are grouped around three types of water: industrial, urban, and drinking. Regarding the research, 15 clusters identified from the keywords analyzed the advanced oxidation process (alone or combined with biological oxidation) with the type of wastewater and the target pollutant, removal of which is intended. Finally, the most important scientific communities or clusters detected in terms of the number of published articles were those related to the elimination of pollutants of biological origin, such as bacteria, and of industrial nature, such as pesticides or pharmaceutical products.

AB Onsite wastewater disposal systems (OWDS) can introduce bacterial and chemical contaminants, via groundwater, into aquifers and adjacent waterways. We evaluated the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the shallow groundwater of Eastern Long Island, New York, down-gradient of OWDS using cultivation approaches and analysis of 16S rRNA genes. While FIB and ARB were detected in 80% and 67% of groundwater samples, respectively, concentrations were low, suggesting that, at least at the time of sampling, groundwater was not a large-scale source of fecal bacterial contamination to adjacent embayments. ARB isolates did not include common fecal associated genera and the concentration of FIB and ARB did not correlate well with the concentration of pharmaceutical contaminants, suggesting that bacterial contaminants were poorly linked to OWDS discharge. Concentrations of FIB in the studied embayments were significantly greater in nearshore compared to mid-channel environments, suggesting that land-based sources are likely to be the major contributors of bacterial contamination.

AB There are conflicting findings on the toxicity of effluent from wastewater treatment plants, and only limited possibilities for assessing the effect-based removal efficiency (EBRE) of different treatment techniques. We describe a metabolomics approach to detect perturbations in fatty acid catabolic pathways as a proxy for biological effects. Metabolites in three fatty acid pathways were analysed in a common damselfly larva (Coenagrion hastulatum) by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The larvae were exposed for one week to either conventionally treated effluent (activated sludge treatment), effluent additionally treated with ozone, or effluent additionally treated with biochar filtration, and results were compared with those from tap water control exposure. Five lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins (9,10,13-TriHOME, 9,12,13-TriHOME, 9-HODE, 9-HOTrE, and 13-HOTrE) decreased in response to conventionally treated effluent exposure. By using an additional treatment step, oxylipin levels were restored with exception of 9,10,13-TriHOME (ozonated effluent), and 9-HOTrE and 13-HOTrE (effluent filtered with biochar). Thus, exposure to wastewater effluent affected fatty acid metabolite levels in damselfly larvae, and a subset of the analysed metabolites may serve as indicators for biological effects in biota in response to effluent exposure. To that effect, our findings suggest a new metabolomics protocol for assessing EBRE.

AB A simple and rapid liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for the determination of 47 different antibiotics in water samples was developed. A straightforward sample preparation of aqueous samples could be established using a simple dilution step with a mixture of water and acetonitrile (+ 0.8 g L-1 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), subsequent filtration through a hydrophilised polytetrafluoroethylene (H-PTFE) syringe filter and a subsequent direct injection. The multi-analyte method presented includes substances from eleven classes of antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, macrolide antibiotics, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, glycopeptid antibiotics, oxazolidinones and nitroimidazoles). The method is characterised by a typical dynamic range from 0.01 mu g L-1 to a maximum of 5 mu g L-1, with good linearity regression coefficients (r(2) > 0.99) and suitable recovery rates (generally from 65 +/- 13 % to 117 +/- 5 %) in spiked drinking water, surface water, groundwater and simulated treated wastewater. Suitable limits of quantification between 3.3 ng L-1 and 190 ng L-1 could be obtained, which are sufficient to determine low levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment. The efficiency of the developed method was tested by analysing the residual concentrations of antibiotics in a small creek in Germany ('Swistbach'). Sulfamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim could be detected frequently, with calculated detection frequencies of 94-100 % and 29-47 %, as well as macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin (50-60 %), clarithromycin (82-94 %), clindamycin (88-100 %) and erythromycin (41-53 %). The determined concentrations were in a range between 0.01 mu g L-1 and 0.43 mu g L-1 downstream of the municipal wastewater treatment plants, whereas no antibiotics could be detected upstream.

AB The occurrence of 17 antibiotics belonging to sulfonamides, beta-lactams, macrolides and aminoglycosides classes, and trimethoprim in raw hospital wastewater, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and surface water was determined. Residual antibiotics were quantified by LC/MS/MS. Residues of antibiotics in hospital wastewater were 3-10 times higher than that detected in WWTP and surface water. Trimethoprim, spectinomycin, ampicillin, and oxacillin were detected in all the sampled water. Sulfamethoxazole was detected at the highest concentration of 20.6, 7.8, and 6.8 mu g L-1 in hospital wastewater, WWTP and in surface water, respectively. Other detected sulfonamides were sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, and sulfanilamide at a concentration range of 0.4-15.7 mu g L-1. Detected trimethoprim ranged from 0.4-6.6 mu g L-1, the rest of the detected antibiotics were up to 1.0 mu g L-1. The speciation of the sulfonamides at pH values relevant to sampled water was evaluated by use of pKa values. These compounds existed largely as anionic and neutral species indicating high mobility as these speciation forms are less sorbed in environmental matrices. Continuous monitoring of antibiotics residues in wastewater, surface water, and other environmental matrices is very important due to their adverse health and environmental effects. The information is useful in designing strategies for antibiotics pollution control and also in policy formulation.

AB Background: Amidases are ubiquitous enzymes and biological functions of these enzymes vary widely. They are considered to be synergistically involved in the synthesis of a wide variety of carboxylic acids, hydroxamic acids and hydrazides, which find applications in commodity chemicals synthesis, pharmaceuticals agrochemicals and wastewater treatments.
   Methods: They hydrolyse a wide variety of amides (short-chain aliphatic amides, mid-chain amides, arylamides, a-aminoamides and a-hydroxyamides) and can be grouped on the basis of their catalytic site and preferred substrate. Despite their economic importance, we lack knowledge as to how these amidases withstand elevated pH and temperature whereas others cannot.
   Results: The present study focuses on the statistical comparison between the acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic organisms. In silico analysis of amidases of acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic organisms revealed some striking trends as to how amino acid composition varies significantly. Statistical analysis of primary and secondary structure revealed amino acid trends in amidases of these three groups of bacteria. The abundance of isoleucine (Ile, I) in acid-tolerant and leucine (Leu, L) in alkali tolerant showed the aliphatic amino acid dominance in extreme conditions of pH in acidtolerant and alkali tolerant amidases.
   Conclusion: The present investigation insights physiochemical properties and dominance of some crucial amino acid residues in the primary and secondary structure of some amidases from acid-tolerant, alkali tolerant and neutrophilic microorganisms.

AB The aim of this study was to produce optimal wastewater treatment solutions to calculate the removal of different contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) found in developing countries. A new methodology was developed for a decision support tool (WaStewater Decision support OptiMiser, WiSDOM), which focuses on producing treatment solutions suited to treating water for reuse to Indian Water Quality Standards. WiSDOM-CEC analyses the removal of CECs through different treatment solutions and was also used to evaluate the performance of each treatment train solution in terms of the removal of conventional pollutants using multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision analysis. Information was collected on different CECs across different regions of India, and the removal of 18 different CECs through 42 wastewater treatment unit processes for five different regions of India was analysed. Comparisons between similar categories of CECs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, showed that emerging contaminants all react differently with individual treatment options. For example, the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX) varied from >80% and 0%, respectively, for a solution in Karnataka involving sedimentation, submerged aerated filter, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. In Tamil Nadu, results ranged from 36.8% to 72% for diclofenac, 10.7% to 66.5% for IBP, and 0% for NPX.

AB With increasing attention toward novel sterilization methods, plasma sterilization has gained more and more interest. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. In this paper, we investigated the inactivation of Escherichia coli using dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in saline water. There were three processes shown in the survival curve, namely, during the preparation period, the reaction period, and the saturation period. Observations under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and detection by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) supplied adequate details regarding these processes. Based on these results, we infer that during the preparation period, the main process is the accumulation of chemical substances. During the reaction period, adequate amounts of chemicals decompose and denature cell membranes and macromolecules to kill bacteria in large quantities. During the saturation period, the killing effect decreases because of the protection by clustered cells and the saturation of pH. This study of sterilizing processes systematically reveals the mechanisms of plasma sterilization.
   IMPORTANCE Compared with traditional methods, plasma sterilization has advantages of high efficiency, easy operation, and environmental protection. This may be more suitable for air and sewage sterilization in specific spaces, such as hospitals, laboratories, and pharmaceutical factories. However, the mechanisms of sterilization are still relatively unknown, especially for bactericidal activities. Knowledge of sterilization processes provides guidance for practical applications. For example, the bactericidal action mainly occurs during the reaction period, and the treatment time can be set based on the reaction period, which could save a lot of energy. The results of this study will help to improve the efficiency of plasma sterilization devices.

AB Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a water-soluble anticancer drug widely used to treat several types of cancer.
   Even if the metabolites of CPT-11 are well-known and investigated, only limited information is available in the literature about the formation of photo-degradation products that can naturally originate from sunlight irradiation when the drug is released in aqueous systems.
   CTP-11 solutions at 10.0 mg L-1 were irradiated by simulated sunlight. The intensity of the drug decreased by 90% after 7.5 days of irradiation and no significant reduction of absorbance values was observed after 13 days.
   A sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed employing a hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer, that is able to work in data-dependent acquisition mode and to obtain information about the compounds formed during the photoirradiation. Moreover, a selected reaction monitoring method was built using the MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the compounds previously investigated. The method was validated considering LOD, LOQ, linearity, precision, selectivity, recovery and matrix effect. LOD and LOQ values were 0.02 and 0.05 ng mL(-1), respectively, whereas MDL and MQL values in real water samples (river water, groundwater, well water, and wastewater) were lower than 0.05 and 0.2 ng mL(-1), respectively.
   Eight photodegradation products were identified, among which five for the first time. Based on the MS and MS/MS fragmentation, the chemical structures of the degradation products were proposed. Hydrolysis experiments were carried out on the same solutions preserved in the dark, but no formation of other species was highlighted.
   The method was applied to several real samples: CPT-11 was detected and quantified only in a hospital effluent sample at the concentration of 0.41 +/- 0.2 ng mL(-1) together with the occurrence of PDP3.
   The outcomes of this study may be useful for updating the pollutant screening in water samples. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Caffeine is one of the most consumed substances, and it has been largely detected in aquatic ecosystems. We investigated the trends in caffeine consumption over three decades and its relationships with gross domestic product (GDP) and human development index (HDI) to understand global patterns and to identify potential hotspots of contamination. The total caffeine consumption is increasing mainly due to population growth. Moreover, caffeine consumption per capita is also increasing in some countries, such as Brazil, Italy, and Ethiopia. A high positive correlation between caffeine consumption per capita with HDI and GDP was found for coffee-importing countries in Europe, while a high negative correlation was found for coffee-exporting countries in Africa. The literature review showed that the highest caffeine concentrations coincide with countries that present an increasing caffeine consumption per capita. Also, approximately 35% of the caffeine concentrations reported in the literature were above the predicted no-effect concentration in the environment and, again, overlaps with countries with increasing per capita consumption. Despite the high degradation rate, caffeine consumption tends to increase in a near future, which may also increase the overall amount of caffeine that comes into the environment, possibly exceeding the thresholds of several species described as tolerant to the current environmental concentrations. Therefore, it is essential to prevent caffeine from reaching aquatic ecosystems, implementing sewage treatment systems, and improving their efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Considered the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, caffeine became a widespread environmental pollutant, contaminating both the hydrosphere as well as the pedosphere, by thus leading to an unclear effect on the surrounding biosphere. Unsuccessfully treated by regular wastewater-treatment plants, caffeine concentrations in discharged effluents and natural reservoirs are constantly rising. New water-treatment technologies are being developed to reduce the concentrations of such emerging contaminants. Photodegradation is recently drawing much attention due to its potential to oxidize such contaminating compounds and its large-scale deployment is still being evaluated. In order to optimize these processes, quantifying and developing new kinetics models are an essential step. In this work, the photodegradation kinetics of caffeine was evaluated under different UV-C doses (1.9-15.2 mJ cm(-2) s(-1) and lambda = 254 nm) and in the presence of two degradation agents, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and commercial titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanopowder. For an initial concentration of 19,600 mu g L-1 caffeine, the removal rate was higher than 95% for both agents separately, yielding half-life times of 40-5 min for 16.3-163 mu mol L-1 H2O2 and 96-9 min for 1-100 mu g L-1 TiO2 suspension, respectively. The degradation rates were governed by pseudo-zero-order reaction kinetics at high caffeine-to-agents ratios (>0.6 for H2O2 and >400 for TiO2), whereas pseudo-first-order kinetics were seen at lower ratios in experiments with TiO2. Empirical and theoretical rate laws describing the degradation kinetics and their possible mechanism are presented.

AB In this study, nickel sulfide-reduced graphene oxide-titanium dioxide (NiS/RGO/TiO2) nanocomposite was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Different tools such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the prepared nanocomposite. The application of NiS/RGO/TiO2 nanocomposite was investigated for the degradation of trichlorophenol (TCP) under solar light irradiation. Results showed that the coupling of nickel sulfide and reduced graphene oxide with titanium dioxide has significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity where the degradation of TCP reached 95% after 6 h under sunlight radiations. The total organic carbon was reduced to 4 mg L-1 from its initial concentration (11 mg L-1), which showed that up to 55% of organic carbon mineralization was successfully achieved. In general, the study revealed an efficient photocatalytic capability of NiS/RGO/TiO2 nanocomposite under visible light.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) belongs to the fluoroquinolones group and is widely applied in therapeutics. The presence of fluorine in CIP increases its stability in the environment. Advanced oxidation processes are among the most effective methods used to remove hazardous and resistant pollutants in the environment. This study aimed to determine the efficiency of the ozonation process with calcium peroxide for the removal of CIP from aqueous solutions. The removal efficiency of CIP and chemical oxygen demand under optimal conditions, that is, pH = 3, CIP concentration = 5 mg/L, concentration of CaO2 = 0.025 mg/L, temperature = 25 degrees C, ozonation rate = 1 g/min and contact time = 50 min, was obtained 95.6% and 80.1% as well as 85.4% and 73.6%, in synthetic and simulated wastewater samples (municipal wastewater + CIP), respectively. Thermodynamic studies have shown that CIP decomposition with ozonation and CaO2 is an endothermic process. The kinetics of CIP decomposition followed the pseudo-first-order equation. The use of the ozonation process with calcium peroxide is an efficient method for CIP removal.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been considered as hotspots for pharmaceutical residues, such as antidepressants, antimicrobials and active ingredients of over-the-counter drugs. Despite evidence of ecotoxicological effects of these microcontaminants on exposed fish in the aquatic systems, there is currently no regulation in terms of the levels of pharmaceutical residues allowable for release into the environment. Depending on the extent of treatment employed in WWTPs removal of pharmaceutical residues are highly variable. This study compares the removal efficiencies for several antimicrobials, antidepressants, and other pharmaceuticals at different stages of the wastewater treatment process of seven WWTPs that employ varying treatment technologies including biological, physical, advanced chemical oxidation, and a combination of two or more of these technologies. The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry at multiple points during the course of treatment. Additionally, the ecotoxicological effects of the WWTP effluents were also evaluated based on the behavioral effects in larval zebrafish. It was found that biological treatment process provided negative to low removal (<50%), while activated carbon and ozonation provided high removal (>95% overall removal) for 14 out of 15, and 9 out of 11 compounds detected in WWTP influents, respectively. Notably, the final effluents of the seven WWTPs in this study did not show any significant behavioral alterations in zebrafish, indicating that despite differences in removal efficiencies all the treatment processes investigated are sufficient in preventing short-term biological effects.

AB To ameliorate adsorbent recovery by an external magnetic field, naturally occurring diatomaceous earth (DE) was modified with iron-oxide, characterized and applied for adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ) from synthetic wastewater using batch equilibration method. The fabricated adsorbent was characterized using XRF, XRD, SEM-EDX, FT-IR, BET surface area analysis, VSM and pH of point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) determination. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo-first-order (PFO) model suggesting a physisorption controlled rate determining step. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to linear and nonlinear isotherm models, viz Langmuir and Freundlich models, and were best described by Freundlich nonlinear equations implying heterogeneous multilayer adsorption. The best-fitting kinetic and isotherm model was determined using four mathematical error functions. The thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy (Delta H = -26.4 kJ mol(-1)), Gibbs free energy (Delta G = -2.22 kJ mol(-1) at 298 K), entropy (Delta S = -34.0 kJ mol(-1)), indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous, exothermic, and physical process. The adsorption mechanism is postulated to involve cation-pi interactions. Modified diatomaceous earth is a potentially excellent, low-cost, and novel sorbent for CBZ adsorption with 88% removal in 180 min and provides a possible alternative adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB There has been a substantial research focus on the presence of pesticides in flowers and the subsequent exposure to honeybees. Here we demonstrate for the first time that honeybees can also be exposed to pharmaceuticals, commonly present in wastewater. Residues of carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic drug) up to 371 ng/mL and 30 mu g/g were detected in nectar and pollen sampled from zucchini flowers (Cucurbita pepo) grown in carbamazepine spiked soil (0.5-20 mu g/g). Under realistic exposure conditions from the use of recycled wastewater, carbamazepine concentrations were estimated to be 0.37 ng/L and 30 ng/kg in nectar and pollen, respectively. Incorporation of environmentally relevant carbamazepine residues in nectar and pollen into a modelling framework able to simulate beehive dynamics including the honeybee foraging activity at the landscape scale (BEEHAVE and BEESCOUT) enabled the simulation of carbamazepine translocation from zucchini fields into honeybee hives. Carbamazepine accumulation was modelled in 11 beehives across a 25 km(2) landscape over three years chosen to represent distinct climatic conditions. During a single flowering period, carbamazepine concentrations were simulated to range between 0 and 2478 ng per beehive. The amount of carbamazepine gathered not only varied across the simulated years but there were also differences in accumulation of carbamazepine between beehives within the same year. This work illustrates a fundamental first step in assessing the risk of pharmaceuticals to bees through realistic scenarios by demonstrating a method to quantify potential exposure of honeybees at the landscape scale. Pharmaceuticals are being inadvertently but increasingly applied to agricultural lands globally via the use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation in response to water scarcity problems. We have demonstrated a route of pharmaceutical exposure to honeybees via contaminated nectar and pollen. Given the biological potency of pharmaceuticals, accumulation of these chemicals in nectar and pollen suggest potential implications for honeybee health, with unknown ecosystem consequences.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is widely used as an antibacterial disinfectant in personal care products, especially in rapidly-urbanizing countries, such as China. Almost all TCS enters wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), but the fate of the TCS in the WWTPs is unclear. TCS may be present in sewage sludge or in effluent, and the discharge of TCS into an ecosystem can pose environmental risks. In the present study, influent, effluent, and sewage sludge were collected from four typical urban WWTPs, and the fate of TCS in the plants was investigated. The study was conducted in Zhengzhou, a city in the middle reaches of the Yellow River in China. The sewage sludge was used for aerobic composting to study the influences of different ventilation treatments on the biodegradation effects of TCS and the changes in the microbial community during the composting process. The results showed that the mean concentration of TCS in the influent of the four typical WWTPs was 397.1 ng/L. The mean level of TCS in the effluent was 8.0 ng/L. The mean concentration of TCS in the sewage sludge was 814.4 ng/g. For the four WWTPs, the percentages of TCS removal were 97.6% (Nansanhuan), 97.6% (Xinzheng), 98.8% (Wulongkou), and 97.9% (Chenyu), respectively. The sewage sludge enrichment rates for TCS ranged between 36.4% and 49%. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the environmental risks from sewage sludge. During aerobic composting, the TCS was effectively degraded under three ventilation strategies. Thus, improved ventilation could enhance the degradation rate of TCS. Moreover, TCS degradation occurred in the mesophilic period and in the early stage of the thermophilic phase period. Finally, the degradation rates of TCS in sewage sludge samples composted with low-, medium-, and high-ventilation treatments were 48.1%, 59.0%, and 59.5%, respectively. Thus, high ventilation could provide enough oxygen for the pile and enhanced microorganism activity, benefiting the degradation of TCS. In addition, the microbial communities change during the composting process, and a diversity index of the changes can help explain the composting process.
