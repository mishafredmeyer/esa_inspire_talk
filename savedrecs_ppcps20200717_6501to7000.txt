AB A submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used to treat two types of petrochemical wastewater: olefin process wastewater and total petrochemical wastewater. Various operational MBR conditions, such as influent pH and hydraulic retention time (HRT), were tested while these wastewaters were treated. The MBR treatment of olefin process wastewater reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) by around 90% in both cases, and more than 90% of the suspended solids (SS) were removed. When MBR was used, the reduction in COD and TOC was also high for the total petrochemical wastewater, and was compared with the reduction obtained when the conventional activated sludge treatment plant was used (CASP). However, MBR effluent wastewaters showed high conductivity so for some reuse purposes subsequent reverse osmosis (RO) treatment would be needed. We characterized the MBR influent and MBR effluent wastewaters using a sequential solid phase extraction (SSPE) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. The main compounds that were tentatively identified were hydrocarbons, alkyl benzenes, phenols, acidic acids and esters, almost all of which could be partially or completely removed by MBR treatment.

AB A 5-month monitoring program was undertaken in South Wales in the UK to determine the fate of SS pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) in two contrasting wastewater plants utilising two different wastewater treatment technologies: activated sludge and trickling filter beds. The impact of treated wastewater effluent on the quality of receiving waters was also assessed.
   PPCPs were found to be present at high loads reaching 10 kg day(-1) in the raw sewage. Concentrations of PPCPs in raw sewage were found to correlate with their usage/consumption patterns in Wales and their metabolism. The efficiency of the removal of PPCPs was found to be strongly dependent on the technology implemented in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In general, the WWTP utilising trickling filter beds resulted in, on average, less than 70% removal of all 55 PPCPs studied, while the WWTP utilising activated sludge treatment gave a much higher removal efficiency of over 85%. The monitoring programme revealed that treated wastewater effluents were the main contributors to PPCPs concentrations (up to 3 kg of PPCPs day(-1)) in the rivers studied. Bearing in mind that in the cases examined here the WWTP effluents were also major contributors to rivers' flows (dilution factor for the studied rivers did not exceed 23 times) the effect of WWTP effluent on the quality of river water is significant and cannot be underestimated.

AB Characterization and treatment of a real pharmaceutical wastewater containing 775 mg dissolved organic carbon per liter by a solar photo-Fenton/biotreatment were studied. There were also many inorganic compounds present in the matrix. The most important chemical in this wastewater was nalidixic acid (45 mg/L), an antibiotic pertaining to the quinolone group. A Zahn-Wellens test demonstrated that the real bulk organic content of the wastewater was biodegradable, but only after long biomass adaptation; however, the nalidixic acid concentration remained constant, showing that it cannot be biodegraded. An alternative is chemical oxidation (photo-Fenton process) first to enhance biodegradability, followed by a biological treatment (Immobilized Biomass Reactor - IBR). in this case, two studies of photo-Fenton treatment of the real wastewater were performed, one with an excess of H2O2 (kinetic study) and another with controlled H2O2 dosing (biodegradability and toxicity studies). In the kinetic study, nalidixic acid completely disappeared after 190 min. In the other experiment with controlled H2O2, nalidixic acid degradation was complete at 66 mM of H2O2 consumed. Biodegradability and toxicity bioassays showed that photo-Fenton should be performed until total degradation of nalidixic acid before coupling a biological treatment. Analysis of the average oxidation state (AOS) demonstrated the formation of more oxidized intermediates. With this information, the photo-Fenton treatment time (190 min) and H2O2 dose (66 ram) necessary for adequate biodegradability of the wastewater could be determined. An IBR operated in batch mode was able to reduce the remaining DOC to less than 35 mg/L. Ammonium consumption and NO3 generation demonstrated that nitrification was also attained in the IBR. Overall DOC degradation efficiency of the combined photo-Fenton and biological treatment was over 95%, of which 33% correspond to the solar photochemical process and 62% to the biological treatment.

AB In this paper we report on the performances of full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment and two pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in eliminating various pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) belonging to different therapeutic groups and with diverse physico- chemical properties. Both aqueous and solid phases were analysed for the presence of 31 pharmaceuticals included in the analytical method. The most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water were analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (14.6-31.3 mu g/L) and acetaminophen (7.1-11.4 mu g/L), antibiotic ofloxacin (0.89-31.7 mu g/l.), lipid regulators gemfibrozil (2.0-5.9 mu g/L) and bezafibrate (1.9-29.8 mu g/L), beta-blocker atenolol (0.84-2.8 mu g/L), hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide (0.12-15.9 mu g/L) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (2.3-4.8 mu g/L). Also, several pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, ofloxacin and azithromycin were detected in sewage sludge at concentrations up to 741.1, 336.3, 380.7, 454.7 and 299.6 ng/g dry weight. Two pilot-scale MBRs exhibited enhanced elimination of several pharmaceutical residues poorly removed by the CAS treatment (e.g., mefenamic acid, indomethacin, diclofenac, propyphenazone, pravastatin, gemfibrozil), whereas in some cases more stable operation of one of the MBR reactors at prolonged SRT proved to be detrimental for the elimination of some compounds (e.g., beta-blockers, ranitidine, famotidine, erythromycin). Moreover, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and diuretic hydrochlorothiazide by-passed all three treatments investigated.
   Furthermore, sorption to sewage sludge in the MBRs as well as in the entire treatment line of a full-scale WWTP is discussed for the encountered analytes. Among the pharmaceuticals encountered in sewage sludge, sorption to sludge could be a relevant removal pathway only for several compounds (i.e., mefenamic acid, propranolol, and loratidine). Especially in the case of loratidine the experimentally determined sorption coefficients (KdS) were in the range 2214-3321 L/kg (mean). The results obtained for the solid phase indicated that MBR wastewater treatment yielding higher biodegradation rate could reduce the load of pollutants in the sludge. Also, the overall output load in the aqueous and solid phase of the investigated WWTP was calculated, indicating that none of the residual pharmaceuticals initially detected in the sewage sludge were degraded during the anaerobic digestion. Out of the 26 pharmaceutical residues passing through the WWTP, 20 were ultimately detected in the treated sludge that is further applied on farmland. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clotrimazole is a pharmaceutical used for treatment of fungal infections. It has been found in surface waters outside municipal wastewater treatment plants but data are scarce regarding its effects on aquatic organisms. It is known that clotrimazole and other imidazole fungicides are inhibitors of the enzyme aromatase (CYP 19). Aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and is suggested to be involved in the sex differentiation in amphibians. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of larval exposure to clotrimazole on aromatase activity in brain and gonads, and on gonadal differentiation in Xenopus tropicalis frogs. Another purpose was to determine if larval exposure to ethynylestradiol (EE2), at a concentration known to cause male-to-female sex reversal, affects aromatase activity in brain and gonads during gonadal differentiation. Tadpoles were exposed from shortly after hatching (Nieuwkoop and Faber developmental stages 47-48) until complete metamorphosis (NF stage 66) to 6, 41, and 375 nM clotrimazole or 100 nM (nominal) EE2. Aromatase activity was measured in the brain and gonad/kidney complex of tadpoles during gonadal differentiation (NF stage 56) and, in the clotrimazole experiment, also at metamorphosis. In clotrimazole-exposed tadpoles gonadal aromatase activity increased over exposure time in the 41 and 375 nM groups but did not differ significantly from the control group. Gonadal aromatase activity was increased in both sexes exposed to 41 and 375 nM clotrimazole at metamorphosis. Brain aromatase activity was decreased in tadpoles (NF stage 56) exposed to 375 nM clotrimazole. but at metamorphosis no differences were seen between groups or between sexes. No effects of clotrimazole on sex ratio or gonadal histology were noted at completed metamorphosis. EE2-exposed tadpoles had a slightly decreased gonadal aromatase activity, though not significantly different from control group, and there was no effect of EE2 on brain aromatase activity. All EE2-exposed tadpoles developed ovaries. These findings indicate that estrogen-induced ovarian differentiation is not paralleled by increased gonadal aromatase activity in X. tropicalis. Further studies are needed, especially on developmental reproductive toxicity, to assess the risk for endocrine disruption in wild amphibians posed by clotrimazole and other imidazole fungicides.

AB Experimental studies were conducted to examine the oxidation of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug widely detected in surface waters and sewage treatment effluent, by potassium salts of permanganate (Mn(VII); KMnO4) and ferrate (Fe(VI); K2FeO4). Results show that both Mn(VII) and Fe(VI) rapidly oxidize carbamazepine by electrophilic attack at an olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring, leading to ring-opening and a series of organic oxidation products. Reaction kinetics follow a generalized second-order rate law, with apparent rate constants at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C of 3.0(+/- 0.3) x 10(2) M-1 s(-1) for Mn(VII) and 70(+/- 3) M-1 s(-1) for Fe(VI). Mn(VII) reaction rates exhibit no pH dependence, whereas Fe(VI) reaction rates increase dramatically with decreasing pH, due to changing acid-base speciation of Fe(VI). Further studies with Mn(VII) show that most common nontarget water constituents, including natural organic matter, have no significant effect on rates of carbamazepine oxidation; reduced metals and (bi)sulfide exert a stoichiometric Mn(VII) demand that can be incorporated into the kinetic model. The removal of carbamazepine in two utility source waters treated with KMnO4 agrees closely with predictions from the kinetic model that was parametrized using experiments conducted in deionized water at much higher reagent concentrations.

AB Pharmaceuticals have recently emerged as novel pollutants of potential concern in the aquatic environment where they are commonly introduced as complex mixtures via municipal effluent. In the present experiment, the freshwater cnidarian Hydra attenuata was exposed to a mixture of 11 phannaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and caffeine) up to 10000 times (x) the concentration found in municipal effluent. Hydra regeneration and teratogenicity was measured, having an IC(50) of 781x and was found to be non teratogenic with an A/D value of similar to 1. Toxicity was investigated using both lethal (based an morphology) and sublethal (based on morphology, feeding behaviour, hydranth number and attachment) endpoints. The pharmaceutical mixture incurred a significant decrease in morphology at 0.1, 10 and 100x but a significant increase at 1000x. All parameters were significantly reduced at 10000x. An EC(50) of 425x and 65x based on morphology and feeding respectively and a toxicity threshold (TT) of 3.2x were calculated. When compared to the toxicity of each pharmaceutical exposed individually as previously reported [Quinn B, Gagne F, Blaise C. An investigation into the acute and chronic toxicity of eleven pharmaceuticals found in wastewater effluent on the cnidarian, H. attenuata. Sci Total Environ 2008a; 389: 306-314], the compounds in the mixture were present at concentrations 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower for the equivalent toxicity (EC(50) and TT). These results indicate that pharmaceuticals act additively in a mixture, having sub-lethal effects at environmentally relevant (mu g/L-ng/L) concentrations and that their combined concentrations could potentially prove significantly ecotoxic to Hydra and possibly to other aquatic taxa.

AB Every year millions of tons of chemical products are disposed to the environment as a result of human activities, with deleterious consequences to biodiversity. In Europe the biodiversity policy basis for action is provided by the Birds and the Habitats Directives. According to these directives a network of protected areas is being built across EU countries encompassing the Natura 2000 Network. But the management plans of these protected areas do not require an ecotoxicological assessment of chemicals used within its limits. As for risk assessment protocols described in EC pieces of legislation and technical guidance documents, they are generic guidelines that not take into consideration regional particularities, e.g. the Mediterranean ecoregion specificities, and its local ecological values. Herewith we present a conceptual model for the assessment of risks posed by agriculture to bird species of conservationist concern from Natura 2000 Network sites; an example is set in a cereal steppe of the Iberian Peninsula. Hazards identified are related to the utilization of herbicides, disposal of sewage sludge to be used as fertilizer, and the input of veterinary pharmaceuticals that can be found in livestock dung and urine. This innovative model, to be used in high tier risk assessment, takes into account the biotic parameters of the protected bird species: great bustard (Otis tarda), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), and montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus). The transfer of chemicals is considered to occur mainly through a realistic trophic chain scenario according to the different feeding behaviour among different species and even within the same species when having different feeding habits (e.g. adults and juveniles). Moreover, the probabilistic approach is proposed in order to perform a transparent risk assessment and clearer risk communication. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many of the drugs used are not completely metabolized in the human body and with urine and faces are introduced into the sewage system. Finally, due to their incomplete removal during the conventional waste-water treatment process (CWTP), they call be released into the receiving water. One of the medicaments frequently detected in surface water is diclofenac. The present Study addresses the problem) of diclofenac removal in various aquatic samples using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The experiments were performed in distilled water and in biologically treated wastewater. The following AOPs were applied: Fenton's reagent, UV-and UV/H(2)O(2)-processes. The concentration of diclofenac in distilled water corresponded to the concentration of this drug in human urine (ca. 20 mg-dm(-3)). The real wastewater samples contained diclofenac concentrations ranging from 630 to 790 ng.dm(-3). The photodegradation of diclofenac was carried Out ill the photoreactor with a medium pressure Hg-vapor lamp (400 W). In the Fenton's reaction different( molar ratios-of H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) were used. The diclofenac; mineralization (TOC removal) strictly depended on the amount of H(2)O(2) applied in the Fenton's reaction. Diclofenac was rapidly degraded by direct photolysis (UV) and in UVA-H(2)O(2) process both in distilled water and in wastewater samples. The results proved that the advanced oxidation processes are effective in diclofenac removal from aquatic samples. The Pseudo first order rate constants for diclofenac photodegradation were determined.

AB Sewage effluent application to land is a treatment technology that requires appropriate consideration of various design factors. Soil type, level of sewage pre-treatment and irrigation rate were assessed for their influence on the success of soil treatment in removing pharmaceuticals remaining after conventional sewage treatment. A large scale experimental site was built to assess treatment performance in a realistic environment. Of the factors investigated, soil type had the biggest impact on treatment performance. In particular, carbamazepine was very efficiently removed (>99%) when irrigated onto a volcanic sandy loam soil. This was in contrast to irrigation onto a sandy soil where no carbamazepine removal occurred after irrigation. Differences were likely caused by the presence of allophane in the volcanic soil which is able to accumulate a high level of organic matter. Carbamazepine apparent adsorption distribution coefficients (K-d) for both soils when irrigated with treated sewage effluent were determined as 25 L kg(-1) for the volcanic soil and 0.08 L kg(-1) for the sandy soil. Overall, a volcanic soil was reasonably efficient in removing carbamazepine while soil type was not a major factor for caffeine removal. Removal of caffeine, however, was more efficient when a partially treated rather than fully treated effluent was applied. Based on the investigated pharmaceuticals and given an appropriate design, effluent irrigation onto land, in conjunction with conventional sewage treatment may be considered a beneficial treatment for pharmaceutical removal.

AB An empirical model is presented allowing for the prediction of concentrations of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) prone to accumulate and persist in digested sludge (biosolids) generated during conventional municipal wastewater treatment. The sole input requirements of the model are the concentrations of the individual HOCs entering the wastewater treatment plant in raw sewage, the compound's respective pH-dependent octanol-water partitioning coefficient (D-OW), and an empirically determined fitting parameter (p(fit)) that reflects persistence of compounds in biosolids after accounting for all potential removal mechanisms during wastewater treatment. The accuracy of the model was successfully confirmed at the 99% confidence level in a paired t test that compared predicted concentrations in biosolids to empirical measurements reported in the literature. After successful validation, the resultant model was applied to predict levels of various HOCs for which occurrence data in biosolids thus far are lacking.

AB The viability of treating high-concentration antibiotic wastewater by an anaerobic membrane bioreactor was studied using submerged flat sheet membrane. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time on the removal of cephalosporin derivative, viz. cephalexin, and the intermediates 7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and acyl group (phenyl acetic acid) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor with enhanced biodegradation using the bioaugmentation technique. The pharmaceutical industry is looking for alternatives to either direct disposal of 7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid and phenyl acetic acid, or further degradation and disposal, which will essentially require additional costs and maintenance. The present regulatory standard, implemented at a global level, does not allow for such disposal alternatives and hence the present study was aimed at the complete removal of the intermediates 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid prior to discharge.

DE pharmaceutical wastewater; internal micro-electrolysis; coagulation;

AB Treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by the combined process of internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation, biological treatment and activated carbon adsorption was studied. Internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation served as the pretreatment for the wastewater before biological treatment to reduce the contaminants' toxicity to microbes and improve the biodegradability of wastewater to guarantee the smooth operation of the biological process. Biological treatment was the main body of the whole process which took an unparalleled role in removing COD (chemical oxygen demand). Activated carbon adsorption was adopted as the post-treatment process to further remove the remaining non-biodegradable particles. Results showed that the removal rates of COD and S2- (sulphide ion) by pretreatment were 66.9% and 98.9%, respectively, and the biodegradability, as measured by the ratio of biodegradable COD to initial COD, of the wastewater was greatly improved from 0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.02. The overall removal rate of COD in the wastewater achieved by this combined treatment process was up to 96%, and the effluent COD met the Chinese tertiary discharge standard (GB 8978-1996).

AB Recent evidence indicates that a variety of antibiotic residues may affect the integrity of streams located downstream from wastewater treatment plants. Aquatic communities comprising bacterial and fungal decomposers and invertebrate detritivores (shredders) play an important role in the decomposition of allochthonous leaf litter, which acts as a primary energy source for small running waters. The aim of the present study was to assess whether an antibiotic mixture consisting of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H(2)O, roxithromycin, and clarithromycin has an effect on such a decomposer-detritivore system. Leaf discs were exposed to these antibiotics (total concentration of 2 or 200 mu g/L) for approximately 20 d before offering these discs and corresponding control discs to an amphipod shredder, Gammarus fossarum, in a food choice experiment. Gammarus preferred the leaf discs conditioned in the presence of the antibiotic mixture at 200 mu g/L over the control discs (pair-wise t test; p = 0.006). A similar tendency, while not significant, was observed for leaves conditioned with antibiotics at a concentration of 2 mu g/L. The number of bacteria associated with leaves did not differ between treatments at either antibiotic concentration (t test; p = 0.57). In contrast, fungal biomass (measured as ergosterol) was significantly higher in the 200 mu g/L treatment (t test; p = 0.038), suggesting that the preference of Gammarus may be related to a shift in fungal communities. Overall these results indicate that mixtures of antibiotics may disrupt important ecosystem processes such as organic matter flow in stream ecosystems, although effects are likely to be weak at antibiotic concentrations typical of streams receiving wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater from hypo soda production is characterized by high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), chrominance, as well as poor biodegradability and microbial toxicity. Therefore, it is not suitable to be treated directly with biological processes. In this study, internal micro-electrolysis combined with coagulation was used to pretreat the wastewater before the biological processes. Primarily, the optimal operational conditions for iron-carbon internal micro-electrolysis were determined. With these parameters, continuous tests were then developed and polyacrylamide (PAM) was added in a concentration of 5 mg/L wastewater as coagulant to study the efficiency of internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation treating COD, S(2-), chrominance and total nitrogen (TN). The results showed that the best operational parameters of the internal micro-electrolysis to remove COD and chrominance were pHs of 2.0 similar to 3.0, mass ratio of Fe/C = 30/1, reaction time of 120 min, and 0.1 mm diameter of scrap iron. The pretreatment averagely removed up to 66.6% COD, 98.3% S(2-), 85.1% chrominance and 25.6% TN from the wastewater, respectively, and enhanced the biodegradability of wastewater from 0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.02. Moreover, microbial toxicity of contaminants was eradicated, which made sure the stable operation of subsequent biological processes. This pretreatment method was put into effect in a pharmaceutical plant. Long-term monitoring results from the full-scale application supported that iron-carbon internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation was applicable to pretreat pharmaceutical wastewater from hypo-soda production.

AB Exposure to contaminants below lethal concentrations may affect the performance of organisms, resulting in measurable differences in behavior. We measured the response of the benthic invertebrate Gammarus pulex (Crustacea, Amphipoda) to sublethal concentrations of three pharmaceuticals, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Responses in behavior during exposure were analyzed using the multivariate method of Principal Response Curves (PRC). The PRC results show that exposure to low pharmaceutical concentrations (range 1-100 ng/l) resulted in increased ventilation, whereas exposure to control or to high concentrations (1 mu g/l-1 mg/L) resulted in increased locomotion. Exposure to CTAB resulted in decreased locomotion and increased ventilation at increasing concentrations. The results of our experiments indicate that increased ventilation can be used as a general sign of stress, but not necessarily an early warning signal for mortality.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including estrogen pharmaceuticals, have been an environmental concern for well more than a decade, but no environmental emissions inventory for Canada has yet been published. Endogenous estrogens cannot be distinguished from the equivalent pharmaceutical estrogens in the environment. Therefore, data were compiled to estimate total environmental emissions of endogenous and retail pharmaceutical estrogens by the Canadian population for year 2007. Approximately 1,700 kg of pharmaceutical estrogens were dispensed through retail pharmacies in Canada in 2007. Of this amount, total environmental emissions were estimated to be approximately 730 kg, half to surface water via municipal sewage outfalls (> 90% via sewage treatment plants providing primary, secondary, or tertiary treatment), and half to the soil vadose zone and (potentially) groundwater via in situ sewage treatment systems. Approximately 960 kg of endogenous estrogens were excreted by the Canadian population, with about 420 kg reaching the environment, again approximately half to each of surface water and soil/groundwater. In situ sewage treatment may deliver an equivalent load of estrogens to the environment as do sewage treatment plants, despite servicing only 22% of the Canadian population.

AB A rapidly expanding field of on-line process monitoring and on-line control in biotechnology, food industry, pharmaceutical industry, process chemistry, environmental measuring technology, water treatment and sewage processing requires the development of new micro fabricated reliable chemical and biosensors that are specific for particular species and can attain the analytic information in a faster, simpler and cheaper manner. Using a functionalised hydrogel coating in sensors provides the possibility to detect, transmit and record the information regarding the concentration change or the presence of a specific analyte (a chemical or biological substance that needs to be measured) by producing a signal proportional to the concentration of the target analyte. In this chapter, we describe piezoresistive chemical microsensors for a comprehensive characterization of solutions, which could be embedded inside fluidic systems for real time monitoring of organic and inorganic contaminants.

AB Losing streams that are influenced by wastewater treatment plant effluents and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) can be a source of groundwater contamination. Released micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupters and other ecotoxicologically relevant substances as well as inorganic wastewater constituents can reach the groundwater, where they may deteriorate groundwater quality. This paper presents a method to quantify exfiltration mass flow rates per stream length unit M-ex of wastewater constituents from losing streams by the operation of integral pumping tests (IPTs) up- and downstream of a target section. Due to the large sampled water volume during IPTs the results are more reliable than those from conventional point sampling. We applied the method at a test site in Leipzig (Germany). Wastewater constituents K+ and NO3- showed M-ex values of 1241 to 4315 and 749 to 924 mg m(stream)(-1) d(-1), respectively, while Cl- (16.8 to 47.3 g m(stream)(-1) d(-1)) and SO42- (20.3 to 32.2 g m(stream)(-1) d(-1)) revealed the highest observed M-ex values at the test site. The micropollutants caffeine and technical-nonylphenol were dominated by elimination processes in the groundwater between upstream and downstream wells. Additional concentration measurements in the stream and a connected sewer at the test site were performed to identify relevant processes that influence the concentrations at the IPT wells.

The results suggested that the removal efficiency of H2S was higher than 98% and the corresponding volumetric loading achieved 180 g m(-3) h(-1), and the optimum spray water flow rate was 9.5 L h(-1). The bio-trickling filter can be operated steadily for a long time at lower temperature.

AB A strain of autotrophic micro-organism, Rhodococcus sp.zw11, was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater containing hydrogen sulphide (H2S)The shape, physiological and biochemical characteristics and oxidation capacity of Rhodococcus sp.zw11 were studied, and the effect of inlet concentration and volumetric loading of H2S on the removal efficiency was evaluated by the biotrickling filter inoculated with Rhodococcus sp.zw11. The results suggested that the optimal temperature of Rhodococcus sp.zw11 (aerobic bacilli, short rod and grain-negative) was from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C and the optimal pH was from 5.5 to 6.5. The criteria necessary for a scale-up design of the biotrickling filter were established, and pressure drops at the start and end of the experiment were investigated. The optimal inlet loading could be noted as 180 g/m(3)h, corresponding to H2S removal efficiency close to 100%. Furthermore, the inoculated biotrickling filter had good ability to resist shock loading, which was a potential industrialisation method to control H2S emissions.

AB In this paper high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array UV detection (HPLC/DAD) after SPE sample pretreatment for simultaneous analysis of pharmaceuticals from three different classes: enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim, has been developed, optimised and validated. The chromatographic separation was developed on spiked wellspring water samples and checked on model wastewater samples of veterinary pharmaceuticals before and after RO/NF membrane treatment (feed and permeate streams) and on process wastewaters of industrial origin. Chromatographic separation was performed on Varian ProStar HPLC/DAD with C-18 column (Microsorb-MV 100 C18, 150 x 4.6 mm; 5 mu m, Varian, USA). Detection and quantification was performed at 254 nm. The best separation was achieved with mobile phase 0.5% formic acid and 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 0.05 M ammonium acetate-methanol, 70 + 30, (v/v) after extraction procedure on polystyrenedivinylbenzene Varian Empore extraction disks. The extraction efficiency was checked by recovery experiments.

AB Microcosm constructed wetland systems established with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and Typha spp. or Phragmites australis were used to evaluate their ability to remove atenolol from wastewater. Combined with an efficient SPE concentration step, the use of HPLC-DAD yielded an analytical method for atenolol quantification with very low LOQ (9 ng mL-1) and high reproducibility (RSD 4%). Overall removal efficiencies of 92.5% and 94.5% were achieved after a retention time of only 4 days with the microcosm systems planted with Phragmites australis and Typha spp., respectively. The removal kinetics was characterised by an initial fast step (removal of about 75% after just 24 h) which is mainly attributable to adsorption on the LECA matrix. Atenolol removal in LECA beds continues to increase in a steady pace up to the end of the assay (8 days) being nevertheless about 5-10% lower than those observed in the planted beds after the first 4 days. For the retention time of 4 days most of the atenolol is removed by the LECA matrix but an additional 12-14% of the overall removal efficiency can be attributed to the Typha and Phragmites plants, which is in agreement with other published reports. Despite the fact that further tests using larger-scale flowing systems are required to evaluate fully the atenolol behaviour in constructed wetlands, this study points to the possible application of these low-cost wastewater treatment systems to treat atenolol contaminated wastewater.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) tend to partially remove recalcitrant chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals. Among these, the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is of great environmental concern. In this work a continuously aerated submerged fixed bed bioreactor was used for the biological removal of EE2 at mu g L-1 levels.
   RESULTS: Removal efficiencies higher than 96% were obtained at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4.3 days and a volumetric loading rate (B-v) of 11 mu g EE2 L-1 d(-1). Increasing the B-v up to 40 and 143 mu g EE2 L-1 d(-1) led to slightly lower removal efficiencies, 81 and 74%, respectively. Nitrification was confirmed to be the main biological mechanism involved in EE2 removal. Most interestingly, the elimination of EE2 was not affected by the absence of ammonium in the feed, suggesting that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were able to maintain their population density and their activity, even after several months of starvation.
   CONCLUSION: The concept of an aerated submerged fixed bed bioreactor, capable of removing estrogens in a sustainable and biological way, shows great potential as an effluent polishing step for existing WWTPs. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical industry

AB We developed a rapid method for the monitoring of five selected pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as well as in the effluent-receiving waters. To that end, we optimized and validated an analytical method based on on-line solid-phase extraction (on-line SPE) coupled with reversed-phase liquid chromatography-switching polarity electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+/-)-MS/MS). The target analytes have a variable hydrophobic character and belong to various therapeutic classes including the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the chemotherapy drugs methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril. The method combines positive and negative voltage switching modes, therefore all analytes can be determined using a single injection and without any reduction in sensitivity. In order to detect traces of these compounds, a preconcentration step before detection is performed by loading 1.00 mL of sample in an on-line SPE cartridge and eluting from the cartridge using a reversed-phase liquid chromatography gradient. Analysis of wastewater and surface water samples was greatly affected by co-eluting matrix compounds, to compensate for matrix effects quantitation was therefore performed using standard additions. Method intra-day precision was less than 6.5% and limits of detection in fortified matrix effluent samples ranged from 9 to 20 ng L-1. Four of the target pharmaceuticals were detected in the WWTP effluents, enalapril and bezafibrate being the most abundant compounds with concentrations of 35 and 239 ng L-1, respectively. Concentrations of these same compounds in surface water samples from sites downstream in the St. Lawrence River were 8 and 63 ng L-1, respectively, which was mainly due to dilution.

AB Different immunoassays have been developed to monitor sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antibiotic frequently detected in water. The immunoassays were developed and optimized in two different formats: ELISA in polystyrene 96-well plate and microarray on compact disc (CD) support. Competitive microimmunoassays were performed by direct adsorption of immunoreagents on the polycarbonate surface of a low-reflectivity CD. Results were displayed using nanogold-labeled immunoglobulins and silver staining developer. High sensitivity was achieved with both formats: LD 0.001 ng mL(-1) in the ELISA-plate, and 0.09 ng mL(-1) in the CD format. The novel CD methodology presents advantages such as simplicity, sensitivity, portability, analytical capacity (2560 spots per disc), in addition to reductions in immunoreagents required, costs and time for analysis. Both proposed methods were applied to determine SMX at nanograms per litre level in wastewater samples without previous preconcentration. Finally, the determination of several fortified wastewater samples using the CD format protocol showed a mean recovery of 87%, which confirms that this assay format is a good screening tool to detect sulfamethoxazole in water samples rapidly and reliably.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics including chloramphenciol (CAP), oxytetracycline (OTC) and tetracycline (TC) was studied in municipal sewage, river water and sediment. Temporal and spatial variations of antibiotic concentrations in municipal sewage, river water and sediment were evaluated. In municipal sewage, CAP, OTC and TC concentrations were in the range of 5.8-47.4, 0.16-5.7 and 0.7-65.2 mg L-1, respectively, and showed a temporal variation with high antibiotic concentrations appearing in the cold season. Untreated municipal sewage can seriously influence both river water and sediment. Generally, high antibiotic concentrations in river water appeared in winter owing to the low flow condition as well as the high antibiotic concentration in the sewage. However, high CAP and OTC concentrations in sediment were observed in summer most likely because runoff in high flow season can carry wastes from some origins ( e. g. livestock farms in the countryside) into the river. The partitioning of antibiotics in river water and sediment suggests a lower sorption of TCs to the sediment compared to previous studies, which is believed to be caused by the high Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, ionic strength and pH of the river water in the carbonate area.

AB Occurrence of eight selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs; caffeine, carbamazepine, triclosan, gemfibrozil, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) were investigated in effluents from fifteen sewage treatment plants (STPs) across South Australia. In addition, a detailed investigation into the removal of these compounds was also carried out in four STPs with different technologies (Plant A: conventional activated sludge; plant B: two oxidation ditches; plant C: three bioreactors; and plant D: ten lagoons in series). The concentrations of these compounds in the effluents from the fifteen STPs showed substantial variations among the STPs, with their median concentrations ranging from 26 ng/L for caffeine to 710 ng/L for carbamazepine. Risk assessment based on the "worst case scenario'' of the monitoring data from the present study suggested potential toxic risks to aquatic organisms posed by carbamazepine, triclosan and diclofenac associated with such effluent discharge. With the exception of carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, significant concentration decreases between influent and effluent were observed in the four STPs studied in more detail. Biodegradation was found to be the main mechanism for removing concentrations from the liquid waste stream for the PhACs within the four STPs, while adsorption onto sludge appeared to be a minor process for all target PhACs except for triclosan. Some compounds (e.g. gemfibrozil) exhibited variable removal efficiencies within the four STPs. Plant D (10 lagoons in series) was least efficient in the removal of the target PhACs; significant biodegradation of these compounds only occurred from the sixth or seventh lagoon.

This paper presents first data on the occurrence of metformin in sewage and surface waters in Germany. Analysis of metformin is based on pre-concentration of the analyte onto a polymeric solid-phase material and subsequent determination by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Applying the method to sewage and surface waters, recoveries >90% and limits of detection of 10 ng L-1 could be achieved by pre-concentration of a sample volume of only 10 mL. Measurements in sewage and surface waters showed an almost ubiquitous presence of metformin in the aquatic environment. The measured concentration levels in sewage treatment plant influents correlate nicely to the prescription numbers for metformin in Germany. During sewage treatment a significant reduction of metformin concentrations was observed which seems to be mainly due to microbial degradation. Despite this significant elimination during sewage treatment, metformin was found in all river waters under investigation. Concentration levels depend on the sewage fraction of the receiving waters and for most rivers are in the range of several 100 ng L-1, i.e. in the same order of magnitude or even higher than for other relevant pharmaceutical residues.

AB Tertiary treatment of wastewater with ozone is a promising technique for removing residual micropollutants that remain after secondary biological treatment. We monitored the performance of a full-scale ozonation reactor on a sewage treatment plant in Switzerland with a screening battery of bioassays. Six toxicity endpoints were selected that covered non-specific toxicity, as well as selected receptor-mediated modes of action and reactive toxicity. Non-specific toxicity was assessed with two bioassays, the bioluminescence inhibition of the marine luminescent bacterium Vibrio Fischeri and the growth inhibition of the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Treatment efficiency was around 90% for the secondary treatment, but only 65% and 76% for the ozonation step in the two nonspecific endpoints, respectively. This finding is consistent with this type of oxidation reaction because ozone only modifies the organic molecules but does not mineralize them fully leaving residual toxicity of the transformation products. In contrast, the specific receptor-mediated endpoints of inhibition of photosystem II in algae and estrogenicity were largely reduced by ozonation. While compounds inhibiting photosynthesis proved to be rather recalcitrant toward biological treatment with only 47% removal, an additional 86% removal by ozonation yielded an overall treatment efficiency in the entire treatment chain of 89%. The effect on estrogenicity, quantified with the yeast estrogen screen, was even more significant: A treatment efficiency of 95% in the secondary treatment, 86% during ozonation plus a small effect by biological sand filtration yielded an overall treatment efficiency of 99.5%. Insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase were fairly resistant to degradation, but an overall treatment efficiency of 91% was achieved in two steps: 72% in biological treatment and 60% during ozonation. Finally, no significant genotoxicity was observed with the umuC test after ozonation, while the influent showed a genotoxic response when it was enriched by a factor of 15 to 60. Treatment efficiency increased with the ozone dose and remained virtually unchanged over ozone doses above 500 g ozone per kg dissolved organic carbon. The reduction of toxicity can be rationalized by the chemical oxidation processes likely to occur for each group of chemicals that are typical for a given mode of toxic action. For comparison, tertiary treatment with powdered activated carbon was also evaluated, which poses a viable alternative to ozonation with respect to removal of micropollutants.

AB This study examined the occurrence in wastewater of 11 aromatic biocides, pesticides and degradates, and their fate during passage through US treatment plants, as well as the chemical mass contained in sewage sludge (biosolids) destined for land application. Analyte concentrations in wastewater influent, effluent and sludge from 25 facilities in 18 US states were determined by liquid chromatography electrospray (tandem) mass spectrometry. Dichlorocarbanilide, fipronil, triclocarban, and triclosan were found consistently in all sample types. Dichlorophene, hexachlorophene, and tetrachlorocarbanilide were detected infrequently only, and concentrations of the phenyl urea pesticides diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron, and linuron were below the limit of detection in all matrixes. Median concentrations (+/- 95% confidence interval) of quantifiable compounds in influent ranged from 4.2 +/- 0.8 mu g L-1 for triclocarban to 0.03 +/- 0.01 mu g L-1 for fipronil. Median concentrations in effluent were highest for triclocarban and triclosan (0.23 +/- 0.08 and 0.07 +/- 0.04 mu g L-1, respectively). Median aqueous-phase removal efficiencies (+/- 95% CI) of activated sludge treatment plants decreased in the order of: triclosan (96 +/- 2%) > triclocarban (87 +/- 7%) > dichlorocarbanilide (55 perpendicular to 20%) > fipronil (18 perpendicular to 22%). Median concentrations of organohalogens were typically higher in anaerobically than in aerobically digested sludges, and peaked at 27 600 +/- 9600 and 15 800 +/- 8200 mu g kg(-1) for triclocarban and triclosan, respectively. Mass balances obtained for three primary pesticides in six activated sludge treatment plants employing anaerobic digestion suggested a decreasing overall persistence from fipronil (97 +/- 70%) to triclocarban (87 +/- 29%) to triclosan (28 +/- 30%). Nationwide release of the investigated organohalogens to agricultural land via municipal sludge recycling and into surface waters is estimated to total 258 000 +/- 110 00 kg year(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval), with most of this mass derived from antimicrobial consumer products of daily use. This study addresses some of the data gaps identified by the National Research Council in its 2002 study on standards and practices of biosolids application on land.

AB The detection of pharmaceuticals and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in ground water and surface-water bodies has raised concerns about the possible ecological impacts of these compounds on nontarget organisms. On-site wastewater treatment systems represent a potentially significant route of entry for organic contaminants to the environment. In this study, effluent samples were collected and analyzed from conventional septic systems and from systems using advanced treatment technologies. Six of 13 target compounds were detected in effluent from at least one septic system. Caffeine, paraxanthine, and acetaminophen were the most frequently detected compounds, and estrogenic activity was detected in 14 of 15 systems. The OWC concentrations were significantly lower in effluent after sand filtration (p < 0.01) or aerobic treatment (p < 0.05) as compared with effluent that had not undergone advanced treatment. In general, concentrations in conventional systems were comparable to those measured in previous studies of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent, and concentrations in systems after advanced treatment were comparable to previously measured concentrations in WWTP effluent. These data indicate that septic Systems using advanced treatment can reduce OWCs in treated effluent to similar concentrations as municipal WWTPs.

AB The objective of this study was to compare fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli [EC], and enterococci [ENT]) concentrations with a wide array of typical organic wastewater chemicals and selected bacterial genes as indicators of fecal pollution in water samples collected at or near 18 surface water drinking water intakes. Genes tested included esp (indicating human-pathogenic ENT) and nine genes associated with various animal sources of shiga-toxin-producing EC (STEC). Fecal pollution was indicated by genes and/or chemicals for 14 of the IS tested samples, with little relation to FIB standards. Of 13 samples with <50 EC 100 mL(-1) human pharmaceuticals or chemical indicators of wastewater treatment plant effluent occurred in six, veterinary antibiotics were detected in three, and stx1 or stx2 genes (indicating varying animal sources of STEC) were detected in eight. Only the EC eaeA gene was positively correlated with FIB concentrations. Human-source fecal pollution was indicated by the esp gene and the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine in one of the nine samples that met all FIB recreational water quality standards. Escherichia coli rfb(O157), and stx2c genes, which are typically associated with cattle sources and are of potential human health significance, were detected in one sample in the absence of tested chemicals. Chemical and gene-based indicators of fecal contamination may be present even when FIB standards are met, and some may, unlike FIB, indicate potential sources. Application of multiple water quality indicators with variable environmental persistence and fare may yield greater confidence in fecal pollution assessment and may inform remediation decisions.

AB Many studies have shown the occurrence of antibiotics and degradation products in streams; however, relatively little work has applied a functional perspective to antibiotic transport and uptake. This study examined tier changes in antibiotic concentrations downstream from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharge and estimated net uptake length (S-net), net uptake velocity (v(f-net)), and net areal uptake rate (U-net) of antibiotics over a 3-km stream reach at Mud Creek, northwest Arkansas, USA, during June, September, and December 2006. Ten antibiotics and one degradation product (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, erythromycin-H2O, ofloxacin, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, oxyterracycline, and trimethoprim) were found at least once at Mud Creek downstream from the effluent discharge. All chemicals persisted in measurable concentrations in the water column over the 3-km stream reach, and we observed significant net retention of some antibiotics and one degradation product across the sampling events. Antibiotics that were significantly retained traveled kilometer-scale distances (S-net: 1.8 to 51.5 km) with relatively low uptake velocities (v(f-net): 1.6 to 33.9 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) and rates (U-net: 0.01 to 38.4 x 10(-6) mu g m(-2) s(-1)). This stud), illustrates that some antibiotics do not travel conservatively in streams and that uptake processes occur over the scale of kilometers, linking upstream effluent Sources to downstream processing over large spatial scales.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption and degradation of six antibiotics including Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Tetracycline (TC), Doxycycline (DTC), Sulfamethazine (SMZ), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Clindamycin (CLD) in an aerobically digested biosolid. In the sorption experiment, CIP, TC, and DTC sorbed strongly, followed by CLD, while SMZ and SMX were only weakly sorbed to particles. An adsorption/desorption hysteresis was observed for nearly all the antibiotics to some extent. In the degradation experiment, the elimination of antibiotics, except CIP for which no degradation was observed, was found primarily attributed to biological degradation. For the degradation of TC, DTC, and CLD, a stable phase was achieved after preliminary degradation. We hypothesize that the nondegradable residuals are nondesorbable portions of sorbed antibiotics. From the results, other than SMX, all tested antibiotics can potentially survive biosolids storage periods and can be introduced into the environment following biosolids land application.

AB This paper examines the use of electrooxidation for treatment of wastewater obtained from a pharmaceutical industry. The wastewater primarily contained Gentamicin and Dexamethasone. With NaCl as supporting electrolyte, the effluent was treated in a cylindrical flow reactor in continuous (single pass) mode under various current densities (2-5 A/dm(2)) and flow rates (10-40 L/h). By cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis, the optimum condition for maximum redox reaction was determined. The efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and power consumption were studied for different operating conditions. From the results it was observed that maximum COD reduction of about 85.56% was obtained at a flow rate of 10 L/h with an applied current density of 4 A/dm(2). FT-IR spectra studies showed that during electrooxidation, the intensities of characteristic functional groups such as N-H, O-H were reduced and some new peaks also started to appear. Probable theory, reaction mechanism and modeling were proposed for the oxidation of pharmaceutical effluent. The experimental results demonstrated that electrooxidation treatment was very effective and capable of elevating the quality of treated wastewater to the reuse standard prescribed for pharmaceutical industries.

AB The short half-life of aminopenicillin antibiotics in the aquatic environment put to the challenge the detection of their degradation products among environmental hydro-chemists. In a quest to study the occurrence of a new emerging micro-pollutant in the aquatic environmentwe attempted this by analyzing samples from a wastewater treatment plant for a major degradation product of amoxicillin (i.e., amoxicillin-diketopiperazine-2', 5') using a high-performance liquid chromatography technique coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method. ADP was repeatedly detected in all wastewater and effluent samples (18) from which it was extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evidently proves the occurrence of the chemically stable form of AMX, its Diketopiperazine-2', 5', in wastewater and effluent samples. Furthermore, penicillins are known to cause most allergic drug reactions. There is a risk that residues of hypersensitivity-inducing drugs, such as penicillins and their degradation products, may elicit allergic reactions in human consumers of water and food of animal origin.

AB The two representative polycyclic musks, 1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-2-naphthenyl)-ethanone (AHTN) and 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyrane (HHCB), were measured in aqueous samples and sludge samples of three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Beijing, China using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. The HHCB and AHTN concentration ranges in the influents were 1251.4-3003.8 ng/L and 111.9-286.3 ng/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the ranges of 492.8-1285.3 ng/L for HHCB and 47.3-89.3 ng/L for AHTN were present in the effluents. The musks in the sludges were three to four orders of magnitude higher than those in aqueous sewages. The removal efficiencies of the two musks varied in the ranges of 41.7%-70.1% for HHCB, and 25.50%-68.8% for AHTN. Adsorption onto suspended particulate matter played an important role in removing musks from the sewages. The HHCB/AHTN ratio along the treatment processes showed that the two musks had high similarity of removal from sewage by each reactor in STP. The musks in the effluent sewages may pose a low potential risk to aquatic environment in terms of the predicted-non-effect concentration. Nevertheless, considering the possible additive and synergistic effects with other compounds emitted via STPs, their bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms and so on, it is essential to monitor these compounds in various compartments and to study their environmental fate.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the transcriptional levels of selected genes in liver and head kidney of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua sampled in Store Lungegrdsvann, a seawater recipient situated in the middle of the city of Bergen, Norway, for effects of contaminants released from municipal sewage effluents and former dump sites. Five males and six females were caught with fish traps in Store Lungegrdsvann in 2006. Cod from a location near Jondal in the Hardanger Fjord were used as controls (five males and four females). The following 12 genes were picked as potential markers of contaminant exposure: cytochrome P-450 1A (CYP1A), cytochrome P-450 2C33-like (CYP2C33-like), cytochrome P-450 3C (CYP3C), glutathione S-transcriptase (GST) (detoxification and biotransformation), Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) (oxidative stress), vitellogenin A (VtgA), vitellogenin B (VtgB), zona pellucida 2 (ZP2) (effects of estrogen disruptors), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (radiation). The results showed that two males caught in Store Lungegrdsvann possessed high transcriptional levels of VtgA, VtgB, and ZP2 mRNA in the liver. In addition, CYP1A was 4.9-fold higher expressed in males from Store Lungegrdsvann compared to males from the reference population. CYP2C33-like mRNA expression was significantly higher (1.8-fold) in females from Store Lungegrdsvann than in females from the reference population. CYP1A was significantly lower (4.7-fold) expressed in head kidney of females from Store Lungegrdsvann than in females from Hardanger Fjord. In a follow-up examination with sexually mature cod sampled in Store Lungegrdsvann in 2007, the livers were shown to contain high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxin-like PCB. In conclusion, fish inhabiting Store Lungegrdsvann are exposed not only to endocrine disruptors but also to other contaminants that affect the transcription of phase I biotransformation genes.

AB Fathead minnows were exposed for a life cycle to environmentally relevant concentrations of a mixture of six common pharmaceuticals and one personal care product (nominal concentrations: 1,000, 300, 100, 30, or 10 ng/L). Mean measured concentrations of each chemical in the highest fish exposure aquaria were: naproxen 793 ng/L, gemfibrozil 662 ng/L, diclofenac 331 ng/L, ibuprophen 217 ng/L, triclosan 115 ng/L, salicylic acid 67 ng/L, and acetaminophen (chemical analysis inconclusive, nominal 1000 ng/L). Fish exposed for a life cycle even to the highest concentrations of the six pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) mixture showed no significant changes in growth and development compared to control. Length, weights, condition factors, liver weights, and gonad weights of PPCP-exposed fish were similar to water and solvent controls (0.000005% ethanol v/v). There were no marked effects of PPCP mixture exposure on external sex characteristics of the fish or on egg production. The only parameter that appeared to be affected was percent larval deformities in F1, which showed a significant increase in the 100- and 300-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture. Larvae from control fish had 4.7% (water controls) and 3.4% (solvent controls) deformities, compared to 9.3% in the 100-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture and 9.2% deformities in the 300-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture. Chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of seven PPCP most often detected in Canadian municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE) did not appear to affect fathead minnow survival, growth, or egg production, although it produced quantitative increases in deformities in the F1 generation.

AB The distribution of Triclosan within the Hudson River Estuary can be explained by a balance among the overall effluent inputs from municipal sewage treatment facilities, dilution of Triclosan concentrations in the water column with freshwater and seawater inputs, removal of Triclosan from the water column by adsorption to particles, and loss to photodegradation. This study shows that an average water column concentration of 3 +/- 2 ng/l (in the lower Hudson River Estuary) is consistent with an estimate for dilution of average wastewater concentrations with seawater and calculated rates of adsorption of Triclosan to particles. An average Triclosan sediment concentration of 26 +/- 11 ng/g would be in equilibrium with the overlying water column if Triclosan has a particle-to-water partitioning coefficient of k(d) similar to 10(4), consistent with laboratory estimates.

Some examples of the world's largest commercial plants in the field are presented. For the future, it is possible to foresee a huge increase in the demand for cultured algae, in terms of both quantity and diversity. For example, aquaculture will require new animal species and, consequently, new microalgae to fulfil their nutritional needs will be necessary. The production of algae for high-value markets ( aquaculture, food supplements, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals) will be developed through the search for, isolation and cultivation of new algal strains endowed with the activity of interest. Algal biomass might become an important source of biofuels, especially if its production will be carried out in low-cost photobioreactors and associated with wastewater treatment and greenhouse gas abatement.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has become a subject of concern in recent years. A vast number of these compounds have been detected in sewage treatment plants (STP) effluents, surface waters and, less frequently, in ground and drinking water all over the world. Adverse effects caused by pharmaceuticals include aquatic toxicity, resistance development in pathogenic bacteria, genotoxicity and endocrine disruption. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the main source of pharmaceutical pollution in the aquatic environment are STPs effluents. Therefore, the discharge of pharmaceutical residues with the effluents of STPs should be minimized as far as possible. Degradation of persistent organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater can be achieved using advanced treatment technologies such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in combination with advanced oxidation processes (AOPS). This paper evaluates the treatment of three antibiotics of large consumption rates worldwide (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) by MBR followed by different AOP-steps. The identification and quantification of the precursor compounds and degradation products observable during the different treatment steps applied were performed with liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)

AB In order to improve the understanding of the fate and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the environment there is a need to investigate in-stream depletion mechanisms, e. g. phototransformation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in natural surface waters. In this study, abiotic and biotic degradation of selected beta-blockers was measured simultaneously in non-sterilised and sterilised river waters and deionised water (DIW) under simulated sunlight (lambda: 295-800 nm) and dark conditions, and at environmentally relevant concentrations, i.e. <= ppb levels. Results suggested that the overall degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics under the solar simulation conditions and was between two and ten times faster in river waters than in DIW. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.07) between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and overall first order degradation rate constants for the tested beta-blockers (n = 4-6), suggesting coloured DOC triplet-induced or reactive transient mediated oxidation mechanisms in river waters. Phototransformation was the main depletion mechanism for the beta-blockers tested over a 2 to 7 day period. Slow hydrolysis was observed for metoprolol only. Loss due to biodegradation in river waters was not observed for propranolol but was found for metoprolol and atenolol at a very slow rate within the study period. However, biodegradation of metoprolol was accelerated under the light conditions, implying that photo-induced intermediates could be more easily biodegraded in river waters.

AB An analytical method for phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals and acidic pharmaceuticals in river water was developed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with negative chemical ionization (NCI) technique, and used for the determination of these compounds in the Pearl Rivers (Liuxi, Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers). Derivatization using pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (PFBOCl) and pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) before GC-MS analysis were applied and optimized for phenolic compounds and acidic compounds, respectively. The target compounds were analyzed for river waters from the upstream to downstream of the Pearl Rivers. Phenolic compounds 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol-A (BPA), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and triclosan (TCS) were detected at trace or low levels in the water samples from Liuxi River and Zhujiang River. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was not detected in the Pearl Rivers. The highest concentrations of the phenolic compounds were found in Shijing River, and they were 3150 ng/L for 4-t-OP, 11,300 ng/L for 4-NP, 1040 ng/L for BPA, 79 ng/L for El, 7.7 ng/L for E2 and 355 ng/L for TCS, respectively. only a few acidic pharmaceuticals were detected at low concentrations in water from Liuxi River and Zhujiang River, but the highest concentrations for the acidic pharmaceuticals were also found in Shijing River. The highest concentrations detected for clofibric acid, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, naproxen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac were 17 ng/L, 685 ng/L, 19.8 ng/L, 125 ng/L, 24.6 ng/l and 150 ng/L, respectively. The results suggest Liuxi and Zhujiang Rivers are only slightly contaminated and can be used as drinking water sources, but Shijing River is heavily polluted by the wastewater from nearby towns.

AB During the latest years there has been a growing level of concern related to the adverse effects of chemical compounds on the environment. Pharmaceuticals is one of the categories of pollutants that during the last 20 years have drawn the attention of the scientific community as they are ubiquiteously present in wastewater effluents at trace levels, and several of them may have adverse effects oil aquatic organisms and human health. Their transformation pathways during wastewater treatment are the Subject of a growing current research, while many gaps still exist in the knowledge of the degree into which they are decomposed during wastewater treatment, as well as their degradation products. Analytical techniques for the determination of pharmaceuticals are being optimized and applied in order to provide answers regarding their behaviour during water treatment and their degradation products. Current research and obtained results on this Subject are summarized and discussed in ththis chapter.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as well as BOD5, TSS and NH4+ were evaluated for the first time in thirteen onsite household secondary wastewater treatment systems, including two compact biofilters followed by Filtralite-P filter units, two biological sand filters, five horizontal subsurface flow and four vertical flow constructed wetlands. As expected, all systems removed TSS and BOD5 efficiently (>95% removal). The PPCP removal efficiencies exceeded 80% with the exception of carbamazepine, diclofenac and ketoprofen because of their more recalcitrant characteristics. Despite no statistical differences in the PPCP removal were observed between the different systems evaluated, the vegetated vertical flow constructed wetlands which had unsaturated flow and hence better oxygenation, appeared consistently to perform better in terms of PPCP removal efficiency. The combined effects of vegetation and unsaturated water flow provide a higher tolerance to variations in loading rate and a consistent removal rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical procedure for the determination of 10 drugs belonging to three different therapeutic groups was analysed. Several compounds were investigated which comprise of beta-blockers: sotalol (SOT), metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), carvedilol (CAR); corticosteroids: prednisolone (PRE), dexamethasone (DEX); analgesic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID): paracetamol (PAR), metamizole (MTZ), aspirin (ASP) and ketoprofen (KET). Reversed-phase liquid chromatography with gradient elution, fluorescence (FL) and diode array detectors (DAD) was applied for the selective investigation of the drugs. Three solvents were used as the mobile phase: methanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and acetonitrile. The solid phase extraction (SPE) method using the Oasis HLB column was proposed for the preconcentration step. The recovery level for most of the drugs was above 80%. The low values of limits of detection (LOD) for PAR, SOT, MTZ, MET, SAL, PRO, PRE, CAR, DEX and KET were achieved: 106 ng L(-1), 1,048 ng L (1), 2.48 ng L (1), 2.17 ng L (1), 16.5 ng L (1), 1.10 ng L (1), 160 ng L (1), 6.62 ng L (1), 76.5 ng L (1) and 45.2 ng L (-1), respectively. The suggested method was used for the determination of drugs in spiked surface water.

AB Estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (e-EDCs) are present in treated sewage and there is concern about estrogenicity of potable recycled water. However e-EDCs are also present in other environmental media and intake from water needs to be considered in relation to these other sources. The concentrations of 13 e-EDCs in foodstuffs and drinking water are reviewed, their predicted concentrations in recycled water are estimated, and the daily estrogenic intake as 17 beta-estradiol equivalent (EEq) based on both in vitro and in vivo potencies is calculated as 1.39 and 9.65 mu g EEq/d, respectively. Dietary intake accounts for more than 99.8% of that total, and more than 84.2% is due to phytosterols. Drinking 2 L of recycled water per day is expected to add 0.001 to 0.016 mu g EEq/d based on in vitro and in vivo potencies, respectively. Exposure to e-EDCs in recycled water is therefore likely to be insignificant compared to current dietary intakes.

AB The occurrence of analgesics in the environment can be explained by the fact that they are very popular and in common use, for example: to treat the symptoms of colds, aches and pains or for the treatment of painful diseases of rheumatic and non-rheumatic origin. Analgesic drugs are only partly removed from wastewater using the biological wastewater treatment processes. The photochemical methods are mentioned as a useful tool for the removal of analgesic medicines from the aquatic environment. The elimination of three analgesic drugs: diclofenac, naproxen and ibuprofen from the aquatic environment using UV- and UV/H(2)O(2)-processes was the aim of the study. All experiments were performed in the water with the presence and the absence of the urea as the main urine component. With the presence of urea the values of photo-oxidation rate constants (in the UV/H(2)O(2)-process) varied from 0.22 min(-1) (ibuprofen) to 0.39 min(-1) (diclofenac). The values of the photodegradation rate constants in the solution without urea (in the UV/H(2)O(2)-process) varied from 0.25 min(-1) (ibuprofen) to 0.45 min(-1) (diclofenac). The study showed that naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac may be effectively removed from the aquatic environment (e. g. from the urine) by means of photochemical methods.

AB In recent years greater attention has been paid to the presence of pollutants in wastewater treatment plants, mainly because of strict environmental regulations and the possibility of reusing treated water in industrial processes. Since some organic pollutant compounds are not sufficiently removed in conventional activated sludge treatment (CAST) plants, new treatment processes have been developed, such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs). In this study a submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used to treat mixed industrial wastewaters in parallel with a CAST plant. Two hydraulic retention times (HRT) of wastewater were tested as one of the operational conditions of MBR and the quality of effluents of the two processes were studied and compared. Several general quality parameters were analysed in wastewaters: chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, conductivity, nitrogen, phosphate, suspended solids (SS) and turbidity. The two systems reduced COD by around 90%. SS was reduced by around 81% in the CAST plant and around 90% in the MBR plant. The results for the other general parameters were similar or better in the MBR process, which worked at a lower HRT. We also studied the removal of a group of six phthalates and bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate ester by SPME/GC-MS in the two treatment plants. Most of these compounds were not completely removed in the two treatment plants and were identified at low mu g l(-1) levels. We also tentatively identify some organic compounds in the wastewaters. Most of the compounds we found in the influent, MBR effluent and CAST effluent were benzene derivates, styrene, naphthalene and naphthalene derivates, and phenol derivates.

AB As a metabolite of lipid regulators, clofibric acid (CA) was investigated in this study for its ultraviolet (UV) degradation at monochromatic wavelength of 185 nm using Milli-Q water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. The effects of CA initial concentration, solution pH, humic acid (HA), nitrate and bicarbonate anions on CA degradation performances were evaluated. All CA degradation patterns well fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The results showed that -OH generated from water photolysis by UV185 irradiation was involved, resulting in indirect CA photolysis but contributed less to the whole CA removal when compared to the main direct photolysis process. Acid condition favored slightly to CA degradation and other constituents in solution, such as HA (5.0-100.0 mgL(-1)), nitrate and bicarbonate anions (1.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1 and 0.1 mol L-1), had negative effects on CA degradation. When using real STP effluent CA degradation could reach 97.4% (without filtration) and 99.3% (with filtration) after 1 hr irradiation, showing its potential mean in pharmaceuticals removal in UV disinfection unit. Mineralization tests showed that rapid chloride ion release happened, resulting in no chlorinated intermediates accumulation, and those non-chlorinated intermediate products could further be nearly completely degraded to CO2 and H2O after 6 hrs.

AB The occurrence and elimination of seventeen antibiotics (three macrolides: azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin; five quinolones: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, levofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin; five sulfonamides: sulfadimethoxine, sulfadimizine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamonomethoxine; and others: tetracycline, lincomycin, salinomycin and trimethoprim) were investigated at four full-scale sewage treatment plants in Japan. The highest concentration was recorded for clarithromycin (1,129 to 4,820 ng/L) in influent, followed by azithromycin (160 to 1,347 ng/L), levofloxacin (255 to 587 ng/L) and norfloxacin (155 to 486 ng/L). A vary inconsistence picture was obtained with negative to over 90% removal. Nalidixic acid (53 to 100%) exhibited higher removal efficiency followed by norfloxacin (75 to 95%), levofloxacin (40 to 90%), ciprofloxacin (60 to 83%) and enrofloxacin (38 to 74%). Among macrolides, clarithromycin (50 to 88%) and azithromycin (34 to 86%) showed relatively higher removal efficiency than roxithromycin (-32 to 59%). For most of the antibiotics removal efficiency was higher in A2O and AO based secondary treatment process than CAS process. The effect of the antibiotics on bacterial ammonia oxidation determined by oxygen uptake rate presented that there was no significant effect below 0.05 mg/L of each antibiotics. Even at the same concentration, antibiotics in mixed condition had higher inhibition effects than individuals.

AB The aim of our work was to determine the extent of inhibition of oxygen consumption by activated sludge for carbonaceous and ammonium oxidation (ISO 8192 2007) for various wastewaters. We have selected several types of wastewaters different in their origin and composition: pharmaceutical wastewater, tannery wastewater and municipal landfill leachate. To confirm results of toxicity testing, additional ready biodegradability assessment test with measurement of oxygen consumption was accomplished to indicate the impact of effluents to nitrification process. Pharmaceutical wastewater was toxic to activated sludge, but it inhibited heterotrophic microorganisms much more than nitrifying ones. Biodegradability testing confirmed low impact to nitrification by high, non-suppressed oxygen consumption for nitrification process. Tannery effluent inhibited nitrification significantly (180 min EC50 was 57 vol.%), but it did not affect heterotrophic microorganisms. Landfill leachate was very toxic to heterotrophic microorganisms (180 min EC50 was 3 vol.%), while it inhibited nitrification less (180 min EC50 was 24 vol.%). Presented research confirmed that the investigated experimental method is a reliable one for detection of occurrence of substances inhibiting nitrification in different industrial effluents. With regular monitoring of inhibitory impact biological treatment process upsets could be avoided and treatment optimised.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are among the most important antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicines. A simple and effective analytical method based on reversed-phased liquid chromatography with fluorescence was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of eight FQs in wastewater at trace level. Aqueous samples were extracted using Anpel (TM) MEP cartridges where they were subsequently eluted by formic acid in methanol. The aqueous extracts were analyzed by gradient elution Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (LC-FLD), whose mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and 10mM tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB). The limits of detection (LOD) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were as low as 0.11-1.06 mu g/L and 2-5%, respectively. The presented method was successfully applied to quantify FQs in the influent and effluent of several typical Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in Shanghai. For the extraction of 100mL influent and 500mL effluent sewage water samples, recoveries obtained were between 79-109% and 80%-105%, respectively. 7 FQs were occurred and identified in the STPs with the concentrations varying from 7 ng/L to 1 mu g/L. Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin were the most frequently detected antibiotics occurring in the wastewaters. The analytical procedure developed may be used for more in-depth studies on the occurrences and the fate of these commonly used pharmaceuticals in the sewage treatment plants and in the aquatic environment.

AB The applicability of O-3, UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV treatment processes as technologies for water reuse considering pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) removal was investigated. Electrical energies required for the effective removal of various PPCPs in secondary effluent were 0.09 kWh/m(3), 0.54 kWh/m(3) and 1.09 kWh/m(3) for O-3, UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV treatments, respectively, showing that O-3 treatment is the most cost-effective treatment option for the PPCPs removal. O-3 treatment showed the effective PPCPs removal at O-3 dose of 6 mg/L; however, the formation of bromate is expected for O-3 treatment using O-3 dose of more than 4 mg/L. In particular, bromate formation will be a critical issue when the reclaimed water is used for direct/indirect potable reuses. Therefore, in order to suppress the bromate formation as well as achieve the effective PPCPs removal, O-3/UV treatment will be recommended. UV/H2O2 treatment will be also a profitable treatment method because no bromate will be formed during the process. The evaluation for ecological risk of PPCPs by the applied processes showed that all the processes could decrease the ecological risk caused by parent PPCPs considerably. This means that the investigated treatment processes can play an important role in reducing unpredictable side effects caused by PPCPs in the aquatic environment.

AB The rate constants of the reactions of O(3) with some typical wastewater pollutants (tributyltin, the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin, the beta blocker metoprolol and the analgesic diclofenac) were determined and some mechanistic aspects were elucidated. Except for tributyltin compounds that react only slowly with O(3) (k = 4-7 M(-1) s(-1)), the compounds react fast (k > 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) and can be eliminated at low O(3) doses. Clarithromycin reacts at its dimethylamino group and yields the corresponding N-oxide that is no longer biologically active. The nitrogen is also the major site of O(3) attack in diclofenac and in metoprolol. This gives rise to center dot OH radicals and these are the precursors of hydroxylated products and markedly contribute to chloride release in diclofenac.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical industry has grown tremendously in the last few decades. As such, literature on the treatment of this wastewater is scarce. Water pollution control problems in the developing countries need to be solved through application of cost effective aerobic/anaerobic biological systems. One such system-the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process which is known to be cost effective and where by-product recovery was also feasible was applied for treatment of a high strength wastewater for a period of six months in a pilot scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor with a capacity of 27.44 m(3). Studies were carried out at various organic loading rates varying between 6.26 and 10.33 kg COD/m(3)/day and hydraulic retention time (HRT) fluctuating between 33 and 43 hours. This resulted in chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) removal in the range of 86.2%-91.6%, 90.0%-95.2% and 62.6%-68.0% respectively. The biogas production varied between 0.32-0.47 m(3)/kg COD added. Sludge from different heights of UASB reactor was collected and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated good granulation with efficient UASB reactor performance.

AB A pilot-scale Study of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process ill southern Taiwan is presented in this paper. A 10 m(3)/day capacity MBR plant consisting of all aeration tank and a membrane bioreactor was installed to remove organic matter (measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD)). The performance of the MBR was monitored for a period of 140 days. The removal of COD was oil average over 95%. The effluent did not contain any suspended solids. During the 140 days of operation, manual cleaning was carried Out twice and chemical cleaning was carried out once, A natural logarithmic evolution of the viscosity with TSS concentration was observed. The results of SEM and EDX demonstrated that the fouling on the membrane outer surface was mainly due to microorganisms and/or the sludge physiological properties.

AB Bench-scale, semibatch experiments were performed to examine physical-chemical constraints on ozone (O-3) absorption and micropollutant oxidation during ozonation of source-separated hydrolyzed urine and the concentrate and diluate streams produced via electrodialysis of hydrolyzed urine. O-3 consumption by each matrix was found to occur within a fast pseudo-first-order kinetic regime, Critical constraints on micropollutant oxidation were found through mass transfer modeling to be (i) micropollutant diffusion from the bulk solution into the gas-liquid interfacial film for compounds recalcitrant toward O-3 (i.e., k(03,app)'' <= 10(3) M-1 s(-1)), and (ii) aqueous-phase mixing for compounds highly reactive toward O-3 (i.e., k(03,app)'' > 10(3) M-1 s(-1)), Homogeneous chemical reaction modeling indicated that aqueous reaction chemistry is significantly influenced by the degree to which incidentally produced hydroxyl radicals are consumed by NH3 in each matrix, in terms of (a) micropollutant oxidation efficiencies, and (b) potential yields of oxidation byproducts. On the basis of the experimental data reported here, per capita energy requirements were estimated for treatment of source-separated urine via (1) ozonation, (2) ozonation with postelectrodialysis, and (3) electrodialysis with postozonation. These estimates indicate that scenario (1) would likely be less energy efficient than ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent in achieving equivalent reductions in urine-derived micropollutant loads, whereas scenarios (2 and 3) could be more efficient than equivalent centralized wastewater treatment strategies in achieving equivalent levels of urine-derived nutrient and micropollutant attenuation. Furthermore, experimental and model data suggest that urine ozonation efficiency maybe substantially improved by optimizing aqueous-phase mixing and specific gas-liquid interfacial area.

AB Fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed antidepressant (Prozac), has been detected in sewage effluent. Its active metabolite norfluoxetine is more potent and has been detected in sewage influent and in fish tissues. We tested the effects of norfluoxetine on spawning and parturition in bivalves. Norfluoxetine induced significant spawning in zebra mussels and dark false mussels at concentrations as low as 5 mu M. Norfluoxetine induced significant parturition in fingernail clams at 10 mu M. Fluoxetine also induced spawning in dark false mussels at concentrations as low as 100 nM. Implications for environmental impacts of norfluoxetine and fluoxetine on native and exotic bivalves are discussed.

AB Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), a feature of the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, is used in this work outside the LCA framework. as a means to quantify the potential environmental impacts on ecotoxicity and human toxicity of wastewater containing priority and emerging Pollutants. In order to do this, so-called characterisation factors are obtained for 98 frequently detected pollutants, using two characterisation models, EDIP97 and USES-LCA. The applicability of this methodology is shown in a case Study in which wastewater influent and effluent samples from a Spanish wastewater treatment plant located in the Mediterranean coast were analysed. Characterisation factors were applied to the average concentration of each pollutant, obtaining impact scores for different scenarios: discharging wastewater to aquatic recipient, and using it for crop irrigation. The results show that treated wastewater involves a substantially lower environmental impact when compared to the influent, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are very important contributors to toxicity in this wastewater. Ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and nicotine constitute the main PPCPs of concern in this case study, while 2,3,7,8-TCDD, Nickel, and hexachlorobenzene are the priority pollutants with highest contribution. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the new characterisation factors are based on very limited data, especially with regard to toxicology, and therefore they must be seen as a first screening to be improved in the future when more and higher quality data is available.

AB The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of anti-depressants is among the most widely prescribed groups of pharmaceuticals. Consequently, aquatic ecosystems impacted by municipal wastewater discharges are predicted to receive Substantial annual loadings of these compounds. Although SSRIs have been detected in fish tissues, little is known of their uptake and depuration in freshwater fish species. In this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to fluoxetine at a nominal concentration of 0.64 mu g L(-1) for 7 d and subsequently allowed to depurate in clean water over a 21 d period. Fluoxetine uptake by medaka was observed within the first 5 h of exposure and the biologically active metabolite, norfluoxetine, was also detected in medaka tissues during this timeframe. A maximum fluoxetine concentration was measured in medaka by the third day of the uptake phase, yielding an uptake rate constant (k(1)) of 5.9 +/- 0.5 (d(-1)). During the depuration phase of the experiment, a half life of 9.4 +/- 1.1 d was determined for fluoxetine. Using these data, bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of 74 and 80 were estimated for fluoxetine and a pseudo-BCF (the ratio of the concentration of norfluoxetine in medaka and the aqueous fluoxetine concentration) of 117 was calculated for norfluoxetine. These results indicate longer persistence and greater potential for the bioaccumulation or fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in fish tissues than would be predicted from prior half life estimates derived using mammalian species.

AB This is a comprehensive study of the occurrence of antibiotics, hormones and other pharmaceuticals in water sites that have major potential for downstream environmental contamination. These include residential (hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and regional discharges), industrial (pharmaceutical production facilities), and agricultural (animal husbandries and aquacultures) waste streams. We assayed 23 Taiwanese water sites for 97 targeted compounds, of which a significant number were detected and quantified. The most frequently detected compounds were sulfamethoxazole, caffeine, acetaminophen. and ibuprofen, followed closely by cephalexin, ofloxacin, and diclofenac, which were detected in > 91% of samples and found to have median (maximum) concentrations of 0.2 (5.8), 0.39 (24.0), 0.02 (100.4). 0.41 (14.5), 0.15 (31.4), 0.14 (13.6) and 0.083 (29.8) mu g/L, respectively. Lincomycin and acetaminophen had high measured concentrations (> 100 mu g/L), and 35 other pharmaceuticals occurred at the mu g/L level. These incidence and concentration results correlate well with published data for other worldwide locations, as well as with Taiwanese medication usage data, suggesting a human contamination source. Many pharmaceuticals also occurred at levels exceeding predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC), warranting further investigation of their occurrence and fate in receiving waters, as well as the overall risks they pose for local ecosystems and human residents. The information provided here will also be useful for development of strategies for regulation and remediation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A number of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been detected in the aquatic environment as a result of discharges of municipal wastewater. In the state of Louisiana, USA, many municipalities treat wastewater using natural systems, such as lagoons and wetlands, rather than conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Nearly all research to date has focused on the fate of PhACs in conventional treatment plants, not constructed and natural wetlands. In the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for Mandeville, Louisiana, USA, wastewater flows of 76000 m(3) d(-1) are treated in a series of aeration lagoons (basins), followed by a constructed wetland and UV disinfection, before being discharged into a natural forested wetland (i.e. Bayou Chinchuba) and eventually, Lake Pontchartrain. Thirteen out of the 15PhACs investigated were detected in the wastewater inflow to the treatment plant. Only 9 of the 13 compounds were above the detection limits at the treatment plant effluent. The concentrations of most compounds were reduced by greater than 90% within the plant, while carbamazepine and sotalol were only reduced by 51% and 82%, respectively. The percent reductions observed in the Mandeville system were greater than reduction rates reported for conventional WWTPs; perhaps due to the longer treatment time (similar to 30 days). Most target PhACs were not completely removed before discharge into Lake Pontchartrain, although their collective annual loading was reduced to less than 1 kg and down to ppb with significant potential for dilution in the large lake.

AB Increasing residential development in watershed recharge areas increases the likelihood of groundwater and surface water contamination by wastewater effluent, particularly where on-site sewage treatment is employed. This effluent contains a range of compounds including those that have been demonstrated to mimic or interfere with the function of natural hormones in aquatic organisms and humans. To explore whether groundwater contaminated by discharge from on-site septic systems affects water quality in surface water ecosystems, we measured steroidal hormones, pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) in water collected from six aquifer-fed ponds in areas of higher and lower residential density on Cape Cod ( Massachusetts, USA). We detected both a greater number and higher concentrations of OWCs in samples collected from ponds located in higher residential density areas. Most often detected were the steroidal hormones androstenedione, estrone, and progesterone and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, pentoxifylline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Of particular concern, estrogenic hormones were present at concentrations approaching those that induce physiological responses in fish. While a number of papers have reported on surface water contamination by OWCs from wastewater treatment plants, our results show that surface water ecosystems in unconfined aquifer settings are susceptible to contamination by estrogenic and other biologically active OWCs through recharge from aquifers contaminated by residential septic systems.

AB Sericin protein, although a valuable resource for many industries including cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biomedical, has been discarded as a waste in silk industry, causing environmental pollution. This paper describes determination of a membrane-based process for sericin recovery from cocoon cooking wastewaters (CCW) that will enable value-added utilization of waste sericin. The iso-electric point (pI) of sericin was found as 5-6, whose MW was distributed as 180-200, 70-80, 30-40 and 10-25 kDa. Prior to membrane filtration. sericin was separated from other impurities via centrifugation (CFG) followed by microfiltration (MF) in the pre-treatment stage, which also helped minimize post membrane fouling. Ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) were adopted at a pH equal to pI of sericin. UF achieved partial recovery of sericin polypeptides at 37-60%, which was attributed to increased transmission of uncharged sericin polypeptides at their pI. On the other hand, NF achieved sericin recovery as high as 94-95%, containing all MW fractions. Severe flux decline was the major problem due to protein-membrane interactions and high sericin concentrations, where concentration polarization mainly had a dominant effect. Although flux declines were as high as 58-88% in UF and 70-75% in NF, flux recovery by at least 83% was achieved by chemical cleaning using NaOH and free chlorine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reactions of nitrofuran antibiotics (nitrofurazone (NFZ) and frazolidone (FZD)) with hypochlorite in aqueous Solution were investigated under the conditions that Simulate wastewater disinfection. The chlorination by products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. At the levels of 5 mu M, NFZ reacted rapidly with free chlorine in neutral pH (7.0), while the FZD-hypochlorite reaction was reasonably slow under the same pH. Nevertheless, the strong mutagenic parents disappeared completely after the hypochlorite reactions, and the chlorination by products were observed to exert a weak mutagenic effect oil Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 Without S9-mix. The extent of the reactions depended oil the chlorine dose, solution PH and Compound Structures.

AB Previous studies in extracts of sediments surrounding municipal outfalls off the coast of California, USA and effluents of New York City, NY, USA indicated the UV-filtering agent, oxybenzone (CAS# 131-57-7; benzophenone-3) as a potential estrogen. The effects of oxybenzone on estrogenic activity and reproduction were evaluated using a 14-day juvenile rainbow trout assay for plasma vitellogenin and a subsequent 21-day Japanese medaka reproduction assay. Significant induction of vitellogenin was observed in the rainbow trout at the 1000 mu g/L nominal concentration (749 mu g/L median measured value) of oxybenzone which was approximately 75 times greater than the concentrations observed in previous wastewater effluent. Vitellogenin induction was also observed in the 1000 mu g/L nominal concentration (620 mu g/L median measured) of oxybenzone in male Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) after 21 days of exposure. The number of eggs produced per female per day exposed to the same concentration (620 mu g/L) were significantly lower after 7 days, but returned to control values after 21 days. Fertilized eggs were then monitored for 20 days to assess hatching success. The overall percentage of fertilized eggs collected during the 21-day exposure that hatched was significantly lower in the 620 mu g/L oxybenzone concentration. There was also a temporal effect at this concentration as egg viability (percentage of fertilized eggs that hatched) was diminished 13-15 days after eggs were collected. All three oxybenzone concentrations (16, 132, and 620 mu g/L) and the 50 ng/L estradiol positive control showed reduced hatching of eggs at day 15, and the 132 and 620 mu g/L oxybenzone concentrations diminished the percentage of eggs that hatched on days 13-15. These data indicate that the UV-filter oxybenzone alters endocrine or reproduction endpoints in two fish species, but at concentrations significantly higher than those measured in the environment.

AB The behavior of pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic ecosystems is not well defined. In order to determine spatial and temporal variations in concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the Tennessee River, water samples were collected from multiple points along the river and at the inflow of major tributaries. Sampling structure was designed to investigate trends between surface and subsurface samples, seasonal trends (winter, spring, summer, and fall), the direct influence of sewage treatment plants (upstream versus downstream), and the effect of downstream distance on pharmaceutical concentrations. All samples were quantified via solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This method yielded reproducible quantitation at low parts per trillion (ng L(-1)) levels for all 14 analytes (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, fluoxetine, levofloxacin. lovastatin, norfluoxetine, ranitidine, sertraline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim). Correlation analyses (depth. distance) and repeated-measures ANOVAs (season, sewage treatment plant proximity) were used to determine statistically significant trends for frequently detected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole). Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were found to vary by season in subsurface samples: spring exhibited the highest concentrations. Carbamazepine varied in proximity to sewage treatment plant outfall with subsurface samples yielding greater concentrations downstream than upstream. In addition, individual pharmaceuticals displayed positive correlation between surface and subsurface samples and negative correlation with downstream distance from the headwaters.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Many drugs such as beta-blockers have been shown to occur in aquatic environments. Even if adequate ecotoxicity data are not available, it is of primary importance to get informations about their fate in environmental waters, particularly about their photofate in sewage treatment plant effluents (STP). The main difficulties when studying pharmaceutical photochemical behaviour in environmental waters, are linked to the very low environmentally relevant concentrations (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) which can generate problems in terms of analytical sensitivity. Moreover, the complexity of environmental matrices can modify micropollutants degradation kinetics. The photodegradation of beta-blockers has been compared at two concentration levels (10 mu g L-1 and 10 mg L-1) and in two different matrices (pure water and STP effluent). It has been shown that the concentration does not influence beta-blockers degradation pathways, thus allowing the identification of degradation compounds using the 10 mg L-1 solutions. Although environmental waters speed up the degradation process, the same photoproducts were appeared in both matrices. Using LC-MS/MS, hydroxyl radical additions have been identified as an important degradation pathway for especially pindolol, propranolol and timolol, leading to several positional isomers, corresponding to mono-, di- or tri-hydroxylations. Kinetics of appearance/disappearance of these photoproducts have been studied in STIR effluents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation is an important route for the introduction of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) into the environment. In this study, the mobility and sorption-desorption behavior of carbamazepine, naproxen and diclofenac were studied in soil layers sampled from a plot irrigated with secondary-treated wastewater (STWW). Carbamazepine and diclofenac were significantly retarded in the 0-5 cm soil sample rich in soil organic matter (SOM): carbamazepine was not affected by the water quality (freshwater versus STWW), whereas diclofenac exhibited a higher retardation factor (RF) in the freshwater system. Naproxen exhibited significantly lower RFs than diclofenac but with a similar trend higher retardation in the freshwater versus STWW system. In the 5-15 cm soil sample containing low SOM, naproxen was highly mobile while carbamazepine and diclofenac were still retarded. In the 1525 cm sample, all compounds exhibited their lowest RFs. Sorption data suggested that SOM governs the studied PCs' interactions with the soil samples. However, higher carbon-normalized sorption coefficients were measured for the PCs in the 15-25 cm sample, suggesting that both quantity and the physicochemical nature of SOM affect sorption interactions. While both naproxen and carbamazepine exhibited reversible sorption isotherms, diclofenac exhibited pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis. This study suggests that carbamazepine and diclofenac can be classified as slow-mobile compounds in SOM-rich soil layers. When these compounds pass this layer and/or introduced into SOM-poor soils, their mobility increases significantly. This emphasizes the potential transport of PCs to groundwater in semiarid zones due to intensive irrigation with reclaimed wastewater in SOM-poor soils. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications can enter the environment as trace contaminants, at individual concentrations generally below a part per billion (mu g/L). APIs enter the environment primarily via the discharge of raw and treated sewage. Residues of unmetabolized APIs from parenteral and enteral drugs are excreted in feces and urine, and topically applied medications are washed from skin during bathing. These trace residues may pose risks for aquatic life and cause concern with regard to subsequent human exposure.
   APIs also enter the environment from the disposal of unwanted medications directly to sewers and trash. The relative significance of this route compared with excretion and bathing is poorly understood and has been subject to much speculation. Two major aspects of uncertainty exist: the percentage of any particular API in the environment originating from disposal is unknown, and disposal undoubtedly occurs from a variety of dispersed sources. Sources of disposal, along with the types and quantities of APIs resulting from each source, are important to understand so that effective pollution prevention approaches can be designed and implemented.
   Accumulation of leftover, unwanted drugs poses three major concerns: (i) APIs disposed to sewage or trash compose a diverse source of potential chemical stressors in the environment. (ii) Accumulated drugs represent increased potential for drug diversion, with its attendant risks of unintentional poisonings and abuse. (iii) Leftover drugs represent wasted healthcare resources and lost opportunities for medical treatment.
   This paper has four major purposes: (1) Define the processes, actions, and behaviors that control and drive the consumption, accumulation, and need for disposal of pharmaceuticals. (2) Provide an overview of the diverse locations where drugs are used and accumulate. (3) Present a summary of the first cataloging of APIs disposed by a defined subpopulation. (4) Identify opportunities for pollution prevention and source reduction. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB On 3 October 2007, 40 participants with diverse expertise attended the workshop Tamiflu and the Environment: Implications of Use under Pandemic Conditions to assess the potential human health impact and environmental hazards associated with use of Tamiflu during an influenza pandemic. Based on the identification and risk-ranking of knowledge gaps, the consensus was that oseltamivir ethylester-phosphate (OE-P) and oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) were unlikely to pose an ecotoxicologic hazard to freshwater organisms. OC in river water might hasten the generation of OC-resistance in wildfowl, but this possibility seems less likely than the potential disruption that could be posed by OC and other pharmaceuticals to the operation of sewage treatment plants. The work-group members agreed on the following research priorities: a) available data on the ecotoxicology of OE-P and OC should be published; b) risk should be assessed for OC-contaminated river water generating OC-resistant viruses in wildfowl; c) sewage treatment plant functioning due to microbial inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors and other antimicrobials used during a pandemic should be investigated: and e realistic worst-case exposure scenarios should be developed. Additional modeling would be useful to identify localized areas within river catchments that might be prone to high pharmaceutical concentrations in sewage treatment plant effluent. Ongoing seasonal use of Tamiflu in Japan offers opportunities for researchers to assess how much OC enters and persists in the aquatic environment.

AB Two types of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (pharmaceutical POCIS and pesticide POCIS) were examined for their sampling efficiency of selected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCS). Laboratory-based calibration of POCISs was conducted by exposing them at high and low concentrations of 14 EDCs (4-alkyl-phenols, their ethoxylate oligomers, bisphenol A, selected estrogens and synthetic steroids) for different time periods. The kinetic studies showed an integrative uptake up to 28 days. The sampling rates for the individual compounds were obtained. The use of POCISs could result in an integrative approach to the quality status of the aquatic systems especially in the case of high variation of water concentrations of EDCs. The sampling efficiency of POCISs under various field conditions was assessed after their deployment in different aquatic environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment technologies discussed in this article explore the removal of compounds of emerging concern (CECs). There are no regulations currently restricting CECs, but with the recent media attention and increasing public awareness of the issue, as well as improving technology to detect these substances, regulations may be on the horizon. The future regulatory scenarios to address these CECs will be of most interest utility managers.
   There are several source control alternatives as well as treatment technologies that can help to reduce CEC concentrations in drinking water. This article summarizes the effects, removal, and regulatory responses to CECs and outlines where more research is needed. Water utilities are encouraged to begin planning for long-term upgrades and policies to address CECs. In addition, the authors ecourage cooperation between water and wastewater utilities.-LH

AB Influent and effluent samples originating from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (treating hospital wastewater and domestic wastewater, Belgium) have been analyzed in order to estimate their steroid hormone content. The natural estrogens estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and the synthetic 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) together with other steroid hormones progesterone (P) and testosterone (T) metabolites were detected in these samples. The hormone concentrations in both the hospital and the domestic WWTP samples were not significantly different and ranged from < 0.2 ng EE2/L to 114 ng EE2/L, from < 0.2 ng E1/L to 58 ng E1/L and from < 0.2 ng P/L to >100 ng P/L. E2 was detected once at a concentration of 17 ng/L. In the domestic WWTP which comprises a conventional activated sludge treatment in parallel with a membrane bioreactor, no differences in estrogen removal efficiency could be observed for both treatments. In comparison to chemical analysis data, the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) appears to underestimate the influent estrogen concentrations, probably due to influent toxicity for the YES. Effluent estrogen concentrations, on the other hand, were overestimated by the YES test, probably due to the presence of other estrogenic compounds in the effluent.

AB We collected influent and effluent samples from four sewage treatment plants (STPs) as well as surface water samples in Han River of Seoul, Korea, in three sampling events representing different flow conditions, i.e., April, June, and August, 2005, and analyzed for eleven pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cimetidine, diltiazem, trimethoprim, and five sulfonamide antibiotics, using LC-MS-ESI. Pharmaceuticals of high annual production amount were detected in higher level in STP influents. Levels of pharmaceutical residues in the influents were the highest for acetaminophen (average 27,089 ng/L), followed by caffeine (23,664 ng/L), cimetidine (8045 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (523 ng/L). Levels of acetaminophen and caffeine in STP effluents were very low compared to the influent concentrations. However cimetidine was detected in relatively high levels even in STP effluent samples. in effluent samples, cimetidine showed the highest level (5380 ng/L), followed by caffeine (278 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (193 ng/L), and carbamazepine (111 ng/L). The concentration of cimetidine was also the highest in surface water samples (average 281 ng/L), which is the highest level reported from surface water worldwide to our knowledge. Caffeine (268.7 ng/L), acetaminophen (34.8 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (26.9 ng/L) were also detected in relatively high levels. Levels of pharmaceuticals detected in surface water samples upstream STPs were generally very low compared to the downstream samples, suggesting that the STPs potentially be a major source of the test pharmaceuticals into Han River. The hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated for the test pharmaceuticals based on their occurrences in surface water, and no pharmaceutical resulted in HQ greater than one, suggesting that their potential environmental impact may be low.

AB Synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been found in surface waters throughout the United States, and are known to enter waterways via discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Studies addressing EDCs in wastewater do not examine their specific sources upstream of WWTPs. Presented here are results of a pilot study of potential sources of selected EDCs within an urban wastewater service area. Twenty-one wastewater samples were collected from a range of sites, including 16 residential, commercial, or industrial samples, and five samples from influent and effluent streams at the WWTP. Samples were analyzed for the following known and suspected EDCs: five phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, 4-nonylphenol (NP), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), using well-established methods (EPA 625 and USGS O-1433-01). Twenty of 21 samples contained at least one EDC. Phthalates were widely detected; one or more phthalate compound was identified in 19 of 21 samples. Measurement of two phthalates in a field blank sample suggests that the accuracy of sample detections for these two compounds may be compromised by background contamination. Triclosan was detected in nine samples, BPA in five samples, and TCEP in four samples; NP was not detected. The results of this and future source-specific studies may be used to develop targeted pollution prevention strategies to reduce levels of EDCs in wastewater. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many pharmaceuticals along with their metabolites have been detected in environmental water samples in the recent decades. The analgesic diclofenac is widely used and thus enters the aquatic environment. Already at realistic environmental concentration levels harmful effects to different organisms have been demonstrated. As this could also be expected for its metabolites, their fate was examined. Six wastewater treatment plant effluents collected throughout Germany were analyzed for the drug and two of its hydroxylated metabolites, 4'-hydroxy diclofenac (4'-OHD) and 5-hydroxy diclofenac (5-OHD), together with the lactam of 4'-OHD, 4'-hydroxy diclofenac dehydrate (4'-OHDD). A quantitative analytical method has been developed using solid-phase extraction followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) in sewage effluent were 0.06 mu g/l for diclofenac and its hydroxyl metabolites and 0.07 mu g/l for 4'-OHDD. Recoveries ranged from 62 to 81%. The metabolites were detected in the samples in median concentration ranges of <LOQ to 0.71 mu g/l, <LOQ to 0.45 mu g/l, and <LOQ to 0.42 mu g/l for 4'-OHD, 5-OHD, and 4'-OHDD, respectively, while median diclofenac concentrations ranged from 1.3 to 3.3 mu g/l. The wide occurrence of its metabolites is highly relevant on account of their structural similarity and the toxicological properties of diclofenac and needs further examination of both toxicity and environmental concentrations of the metabolites.

AB Wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) inhabiting UK rivers contaminated with estrogenic effluents from wastewater treatment works show altered sexual development, including intersex, and this can impact negatively on their reproductive capabilities. The molecular events underlying these disruptions in gender assignment, however, are still poorly understood. In this study, two isoforms of aromatase (cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b) were cloned from the roach, and effects of exposure to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) during early life were determined on the expression of both aromatases and on the estrogen receptors (ERs) (subtypes esr1 and esr2b) and analyzed against effects on the progression of gonadal sex differentiation. Exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 during the critical period of sex differentiation resulted in gonadal feminization and all roach exposed to 4 ng EE(2)/l were females. These effects on gonadal development were associated with alterations in the expression of both esr and cyp19a1 genes in bodies and heads of exposed fish with the most marked effects on the expression of esr1 and cyp19a1b. Our findings show that both aromatase isoforms and both ER subtypes are associated with sexual differentiation in roach, and alterations in their expression can signal for disruptions in sexual development.

AB Concern is growing over contamination of the environment with pharmaceuticals because of their widespread use and incomplete removal during wastewater treatment, where microorganisms drive the key processes. The influence of pharmaceuticals on bacterial community structure in activated sludge was assessed in small-scale wastewater treatment bioreactors containing different concentrations (5, 50, 200 and 500 mu gL(-1)) of several commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and clofibric acid). T-RFLP analyses of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes indicated a minor but consistent shift in the bacterial community structure in the bioreactor R50 supplied with pharmaceuticals at a concentration of 50 pg L-1, compared to the control reactor RO, which was operated without addition of pharmaceuticals. In the reactors operated with higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals, a greater structural divergence was observed. Bacterial community composition was further investigated by preparation of two clone libraries of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from reactors RO and R50. Most clones in both libraries belonged to the Betaproteo-bacteria, among which Thauera, Sphaerotilus, Ideonella and Acidovorax-related spp. dominated. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira sp., which are key organisms for the second stage of nitrification in wastewater treatment plants, were found only in the clone library of the reactor without pharmaceuticals. In addition, diversity indices were calculated for the two clone libraries, indicating a reduced diversity of activated sludge bacterial community in the reactor supplied with 50 mu g L-1 of each of selected pharmaceuticals.

AB This work studied the photocatalysed oxidation of the antibiotic oxolinic acid (OA) in an annular reactor operated with immobilized TiO2 on sintered glass cylinders (SGC). Experiments were carried Out in I I solution of OA (18mg 1(-1)) at pH 9 with oxygen bubbling. Irradiation was performed with black light (36 W). The reaction was monitored by COD, TOC and average oxidation state (AOS) calculations. The antibacterial activity of intermediates was followed using the inhibition halo technique on Escherichia coli cultures. The initial antibiotic concentration decreases in one order of magnitude after 60mm irradiation. and was completely eliminated at 100min reaction. The TOC was reduced in 54% and the AOS reach Values around +3 indicating the formation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids. The oxidation reaction fit well with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model indicating the dependence of reaction rate with initial adsorption step. The antibacterial activity of the Solution decreases with antibiotic removal. demonstrating that intermediates do not present antibiotic activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the widely used anaerobic digestion model (ADMI) was used in order to simulate the inhibition of three pharmaceuticals, propranolol hydrochloride, ofloxacin and diclofenac sodium, on two groups of microorganisms, acetogens and acetoclastic methanogens, the most sensitive microorganisms groups involved in the anaerobic digestion process. The specific maximum consumption rate and saturation constant of acetate and propionate degraders were estimated through fitting the model to experimental data taken from continuous and batch experiments. A modified non-competitive inhibition function was used, and the inhibition constants were estimated using data from Batch experiments conducted at various concentrations of pharmaceuticals using enriched cultures with propionate and acetate degraders. It was found that propranolol hydrochloride was the most inhibitory pharmaceutical to both microorganisms groups. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An environmental risk assessment of eleven pharmaceuticals according to the guideline recommended by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) was performed. Cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, cyclophosphamide, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen. metoprolol, paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and trimethoprim were selected for assessment by the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated according to both the EMEA guideline and a conventional model for comparison and ranged from 0.0002 to 45 mu g/L. Available acute and chronic toxicity data were collected from the literature, although no data were available for cyclophosphamide. Toxicity tests showed cyclophosphamide to have relatively low acute toxicity with an EC50 for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata > 100 mg/L and a Daphnia magna reproduction NOEC of 56 mg/L. These and the literature data were used to derive predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were then calculated for all I I pharmaceutical compounds. Risk quotients greater than I were obtained for ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline according to the EMEA guideline. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) confirmed that the release of ciprofloxacin from wastewater treatment works may potentially be of environmental concerti in Norway. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment, as a result of human and veterinary use, and have become a relevant environmental concern. In the present study, the acute toxicity of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate, and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the euryhaline fish Gambusia holbrooki was evaluated. Special attention was devoted to oxidative stress parameters. G. holbrooki males, captured in the estuary of the Minho River (NW Portugal), were exposed for 96 It to the selected compounds. The following oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in gills and liver tissues: reduced and oxidised glutathione. lipid peroxidation, and several antioxidant enzymes, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and (4) glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). In the particular case of diazepam, swimming behaviour was also evaluated. The obtained results indicate an overall diminished oxidative stress response caused by SIDS and diazepam. Oxidative-based alterations were observed after exposure to clofibrate and clofibric acid, with modifications of several enzymatic activities. Diazepam caused evident behavioural changes: animals showed dark pigmentation and also abnormal postures, namely lethargy and anomalous movement. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The mode of action of azole compounds implies a potential to affect endocrine systems of different organisms and is reason for environmental concern. The occurrence and fate of nine agricultural azole fungicides, some of them also used as biocides, and four azole pharmaceuticals were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and lakes in Switzerland. Two pharmaceuticals (fluconazole, clotrimazole, 10-110 ng L-1) and two biocides (propiconazole, tebuconazole, 1-30 ng L-1) were consistently observed in WWTP influents. Loads determined in untreated and treated wastewater indicated that fluconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole were largely unaffected by wastewater treatment, but clotrimazole was effectively eliminated (> 80%). Incubation studies with activated sludge showed no degradation for fluconazole and clotrimazole within 24 h, but strong sorption of clotrimazole to activated sludge. Slow degradation and some sorption were observed for tebuconazole and propiconazole (degradation half-lives, 2-3 d). In lakes, fluconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole were detected at low nanogram-per-liter levels. Concentrations of the pharmaceutical fluconazole correlated with the expected contamination by domestic wastewater, but not those of the biocides. Per capita loads of propiconazole and tebuconazole in lakes suggested additional inputs; for example, from agricultural use or urban runoff rainwater.

AB In water/soil systems, the iodinated contrast medium iopromide was quantitatively biotransformed into several transformation products (TPs). Twelve TPs were identified via HPLC-UV and LC tandem MS. The chemical structures of the TPs were elucidated via fragmentation in MS(2) and MS(3) of LC tandem MS with a linear ion trap and (1)H and (13)C NMR analyses. All TPs exhibited transformations at the side chains containing either carboxylic moieties and/or primary and secondary amide moieties, while the triiodoisophthalic acid structure remained unaltered. A transformation pathway was proposed based on the sequence of TP formation in aerobic batch experiments. Additionally, the occurrence of iopromide TPs was investigated in native water samples. All TPs identified were found in municipal WWTP effluents because of their formation during biological wastewater treatment with maximum concentrations of up to 3.7 +/- 0.9 mu g/L (TP 819). Predominantly, those TPs were present at higher concentrations in WWTP effluents which were formed at the beginning of the transformation pathway. Furthermore, four TPs formed at the end of the transformation pathway (TP 759, 701A/B, and 643) were also found in bank filtrate up to 0.050 mu g/L and in groundwater of an wastewater irrigation area up to 4.6 mu g/L.

AB Naproxen (2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid) is widely used for the treatment of pain and swelling associated with arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory conditions. Naproxen has been detected in municipal sewage outflows and in surface waters and could reach agricultural land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water. The persistence characteristics of naproxen in three agricultural soils were investigated. In laboratory microcosms of moist soil incubated at 30 degrees C, [O-(14)CH(3)] naproxen was rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (14)CO(2) with comparable kinetics in a sandy loam soil, a loam soil, and a silt loam soil. Naproxen mineralization was responsive to soil temperature and soil moisture content, consistent with the primary mechanism of dissipation being biodegradation. Mineralization of naproxen was hastened by the addition of liquid municipal biosolids (LMBs) from a municipal sewage treatment plant that aerated this material. Naproxen was stable in autoclaved soils with or without addition of autoclaved LMBs, whereas naproxen was rapidly mineralized in sterile soil supplemented with nonsterile LMBs. An enrichment culture was obtained from aerobically digested LMBs in a mineral salts medium with naproxen as the sole source of carbon. The culture converted the parent compound to the corresponding naphthol, O-desmethyl naproxen. In summary, naproxen was rapidly removed from soil, with mesophilic aerobic biodegradation being the primary mechanism of dissipation. Microorganisms carried in biosolids enhanced naproxen dissipation in soil, with the initial mechanism of attack likely being O-demethylation. We conclude on this basis that naproxen in soils receiving biosolids would be readily biodegradable and, in the absence of preferential flow or runoff, pose little risk for contamination of adjacent water or crops.

AB BACKGROUND: Furaltadone (FD), a nitrofuran derivative, is a highly effective chemotherapeutic drug. In China the FD wastewater discharged by the pharmaceutical industry is high in organics and biorefractory compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism of FD in aqueous solution by ozone oxidation. Preliminary results on the reaction mechanism were obtained using three different spectral analysis techniques. RESULTS: The ozonation mechanism was significantly affected by the pH value. At low pH values the primary reaction is direct oxidation of ozone, an incomplete oxidisation, which can only destroy the FD molecule's conjugated structure. At high pH values the major reaction changes to hydroxyl radical oxidation. FD can be rapidly oxidised into CO2, H2O, NH3, NO3-, HCHO, oxalic acid and other aliphatic acids of low molecular weight, which can be entirely mineralised by continued ozonation. CONCLUSION: The pH value significantly influences the mode of FD ozonation. The present experiment suggests a potentially useful pretreatment method for conventional biological treatment of wastewater containing FD. (c) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The generation of cyanide ions by the reaction of pharmaceuticals containing nitrogen with sodium hypochlorite was examined using 20 different compounds. The generation of cyanide ions was observed in hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine), losartan potassium, metronidazole, and allopurinol. The largest generation was observed in hexamine. In both hexamine and losartan potassium, the amount of cyanide ion formed increased to a maximum at 45-60 min. The generation of cyanide ions was attributed to the formation of nitroso product by oxidizing action of sodium hypochlorite.

AB Since the European Union banned disposal of sewage sludge (SS) at sea in 1998 the application rate of SS to land has risen significantly. Land application is thus possibly an important transport route for SS-associated organic chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, to soils and perhaps also to plants. The potential for the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Fluoxetine HCl, to undergo uptake into Brassicaceae tissues was therefore investigated in a tissue culture study under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks. From growth medium containing 280 ng Fluoxetine HCl mL(-1), translocation into Brassica oleracea var. botrytis (cauliflower) stems (5% mean uptake of applied burden; 0.49 mu g g wet weight(-1)) and leaves (3% mean uptake; 0.26 mu g g wet weight(-1)) was confirmed, but no evidence of uptake into the curd was found; other possible explanations of the observations are also discussed. Although the data for individual plants were highly variable, as was the recovery of spiked internal standard (deuterated Fluoxetine HCl), the results nonetheless suggest uptake of Fluoxetine may indeed be a potential transport route to plants. A similar study of uptake from soils rather than from an artificial medium should now be undertaken, with greater numbers of replicates and improved analytical methods. Such studies have already demonstrated uptake of some antibiotics from manured soils by a variety of plants including Brassicaceae, suggesting that the uptake mechanisms may be more general.

AB Antibiotics are commonly detected in the environment as contaminants. Exposure to antibiotics may induce antimicrobial-resistance, as well as the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in bacterial populations. We selected the resistance gene marA, mediating resistance to multiple antibiotics, and explored its distribution in sediment and water samples from surface and sewage treatment waters. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (fluoroquinolones), sulphamethoxazole (sulphonamide), erythromycin, clarythromycin, and spiramycin (macrolides), lincomycin (lincosamide), and oxytetracycline (tetracycline) were measured in the same samples to determine antibiotic contamination. Bacterial populations from environmental samples were challenged with antibiotics to identify resistant isolates. The gene marA was found in almost all environmental samples and was confirmed by PCR amplification in antibiotic-resistant colonies. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the majority of resistant isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Bacillus, not previously known to possess the regulator marA. We assayed the incidence of marA in environmental bacterial populations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus by quantitative real-time PCR in correlation with the levels of antibiotics. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the possible lateral acquisition of murA by Bacillus from Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae revealing a novel marA homolog in Bacillus. Quantitative PCR assays indicate that the frequency of this gene in antropised environments seems to be related to bacterial exposure to water-borne antibiotics.(C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Filtration phenomena of the hydrophobic ionogenic compound triclosan by three commercially available nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were investigated in this study. The separation behaviour of triclosan was systematically related to the compound physicochemical properties and the membranes as well as the solution pH. The influence of membrane fouling on the rejection of triclosan by the three selected NF/RO membranes were also examined using three model organic foulants and one model colloidal foulants. Having a unique hydrophobic ionogenic profile, even when triclosan was fully deprotonated at pH 10, considerable adsorption of the compound to the membrane could still be observed. The adsorption of triclosan to the membrane surface was a precursor for the diffusion of this compound through the membrane. In fact, under clean (virgin) membrane condition, considerable diffusive transport of triclosan through the loose nanofiltration NF-270 as well as the tight nanofiltration NF-90 membrane was clearly evident, leading to a lower rejection of triclosan by these membranes than expected based on their molecular weight cut-off or the size exclusion mechanism. This diffusive transport appears to be dependent on the thickness of the active layer and its porosity. As a result, no triclosan was detected in the permeate samples from the reverse osmosis BW-30 membrane which has a thicker and more dense active skin layer. Results reported in this study also indicate that the formation of a hydrophobic fouling layer on the membrane surface could interfere with the solute-membrane interaction, and thus, reduce the diffusive transport of triclosan across the membrane. Consequently, significant enhancement in rejection of triclosan was observed when the membranes were pre-fouled with the three model organic foulants namely bovine serum albumin (BSA), alginate and humic acid used in this study. In contrast, no discernible variation in rejection was observed when the membranes were pre-fouled with hydrophilic silica colloids as compared to the clean membrane condition.

AB This study investigated the photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen (APAP) in TiO2 suspended solution under a 250W metal halide lamp. The influence of some parameters on the degradation of acetaminophen was studied and described in details, such as initial APAP concentration, initial pH value and TiO2 dosage. After 100 min irradiation, about 95% of APAP is decomposed in the 1.0 g L-1 TiO2 aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 100 mu mol L-1. The effect of adsorption at three different pH values has also been analyzed and it has been conducted that pH 3.5, at which APAP was readily adsorbed also degraded at a faster rate. Reaction rate at pH 6.9 and pH 9.5 was 2.84 and 2.96 mu M min(-1), respectively. Direct hole (h(+)) oxidation and ipso-substitution was found to be the main initial step for APAP degradation. Main reaction intermediates and products were identified by GC/MS analysis. The mechanism of acetaminophen photocatalytic degradation in TiO2 suspended solution was studied not only experimentally but also theoretically by calculating the frontier electron density of APAP. The results obtained indicated that TiO2 photocatalytic degradation is a highly effective way to remove APAP from wastewater and drinking water without any generation of more toxic products.

AB Wastewater effluent contains synthetic and natural hormones, often in complex mixtures, that may be associated with reproductive abnormalities in fish and other aquatic biota. We exposed the sentinel invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia to the natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), a synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), and a synthetic progestin, medroxyprogestone in a 7-day test. These compounds had no significant effect on reproduction or survival even at 10(6) times the concentrations at which reproductive effects have been documented in several fish species. C. dubia is routinely used for screening the toxicity of wastewater effluent. However, in the standard chronic 7-day exposure the endpoints of survival and reproduction were insensitive to several synthetic and natural vertebrate hormones. The C. dubia 7-day chronic toxicity test is probably not a useful monitoring tool for vertebrate hormones and their pharmaceutical analogs unless other sensitive endpoints such as maturation rates, molt frequency, and offspring sex ratios are incorporated in a practical manner.

AB The behaviour of residues of antibiotic drugs during bank filtration was studied at a field site in Berlin, Germany, where bank-filtered water is used for the production of drinking water. The neighbouring surface water used for bank filtration is under the influence of treated municipal wastewater. Seven out of 19 investigated antimicrobial residues were found in the surface water with median concentrations between 7 and 151 ng L-1. Out of the seven analytes detected in the surface water only three (anhydroerythromycin, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole) were found with median concentrations above their limits of quantitation in bank filtrate with a travel time of one month or less. With the exception of sulfamethoxazole, none of the 19 analytes were present in bank filtrate with a residence time larger than one month or in the water-supply well itself. Sulfamethoxazole found with a median concentration of 151 ng L-1 in the surface water was the most persistent of all antimicrobial residues. Nevertheless, it was also removed by more than 98% and only found with a median concentration of 2 ng L-1 in the water-supply well. The degradation of clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole appear to be redox-dependent. Clindamycin was eliminated more efficiently under oxic infiltration conditions while sulfamethoxazole was eliminated more rapidly under anoxic infiltration conditions. A slight preference for an improved degradation under oxic (clarithromycin and roxithromycin) or anoxic (anhydroerythromycin) conditions was also observed for the macrolide antibiotics. Nevertheless, all macrolides were readily removable by bank filtration both under oxic and anoxic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sludge generated in waste water treatment process can be a major sink for some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The land application of sewage sludge (in the form of biosolids in the United States) can therefore potentially introduce PPCPs into the environment. After treatment, biosolids are often subjected to a storage period before land application. However, little information is available with regard to the fate of PPCPs in biosolids during the storage. In this work, the persistence of seven pharmaceuticals and one antibacterial was evaluated using ultrasonic extraction and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The impacts of aeration and sunlight exposure were investigated. During the experiment, no elimination was observed for carbamazepine, triclosan, and ciprofloxacin while elimination was found for tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. Using an availability-adjusted kinetic model, the 50% dissipation time was 37 to >77 d for tetracycline, 53 to >77 d for doxycycline, 1.0-1.6 d for clindamycin, 1.1-1.9 d for clarithromycin, and 7.0-17 d for erythromycin. Those compounds were found more persistent under anaerobic conditions than aerobic condition with a longer 50% dissipation time by a factor of 1.5-2. However, minor impact was observed from sunlight irradiation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The discharge of synthetic and natural steroid estrogens from municipal wastewaters to the aquatic environment has received increased attention because of their potential reproductive effects on fish. Using 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a representative steroid estrogen, several oxidants applied in wastewater treatment (chlorine, bromine, ozone, hydroxyl radical, chlorine dioxide, and ferrate) were shown to selectively and rapidly transform EE2. For typically applied oxidant doses, these transformations occur in the time range of seconds to minutes. The resulting initial transformation products of EE2 exhibit a substantially lower in vitro estrogenic activity (< 13% of EE2). For selected structural derivatives of EE2, a quantitative structure-activity relationship was established between substituents changed on the phenolic moiety and the relative in vitro estrogenic activity. In addition,the initial EE2 transformation products that still exhibit residual estrogenic activity are quickly further transformed by most of the tested oxidants. Therefore, oxidative wastewater treatment may serve as a powerful tool to remove estrogenic activity induced by steroid estrogens.

AB We examined the utility of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular markers of sewage contamination in riverine, groundwater, and coastal environments. The PPCPs were crotamiton, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, thymol, triclosan, propyphenazone, carbamazopine, diethyftoluamide, ethenzamide, and caffeine. Measurements in 37 Japanese rivers showed positive correlations of riverine flux of crotamiton (r(2) = 0.85), carbamazepine (r(2) = 0.84), ibuprofen (r(2) = 0.73), and mefenamic acid (r(2) = 0.67) with the population in the catchments. In three surveys in the Tamagawa estuary, crotamiton, carbamazepine, and mefenamic acid behaved conservatively across seasons within a salinity range of 0.4-29 parts per thousand, suggesting their utility as molecular markers in coastal environments. Removal of ketoprofen and naproxen in the estuary was ascribed to photodegradation. lbuprofen and thymol were removed from estuarine waters in summer by microbial degradation. Triclosan was removed by a combination of microbial degradation, photodegradation, and adsorption. These results were consistent with those of river water incubated for 8 d at 25 degrees C in the dark in order to examine the effects of biodegradation and photodegradation. Crotamiton was detected in groundwater from the Tokyo metropolitan area (12 out of 14 samples), suggesting wastewater leakage from decrepit sewers. Carbamazepine, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen (5/14), caffeine (4/14), and diethyltoluamide (3/14) were also detected in the groundwater, whereas the other carboxylic and phenolic PPCPs were not detected and were thought to be removed during their passage through soil. All the data demonstrated the utility of crotamiton and carbamazepine as conservative markers in freshwater and coastal environments. We recommend combining these conservative markers with labile PPCPs to detect inputs of poorly treated sewage.

AB Nicotine is extensively metabolized in the human body to a number of compounds, which may enter natural waters via discharge of domestic wastewater. However, little is known on exposure of and potential effects on the aquatic environment In this study, two major urinary metabolites, cotinine and 3'-hydroxycotinine, as well as a further tobacco alkaloid, N-formylnornicotine, were measured in wastewater and water from Swiss lakes using an analytical procedure based on SPE and LC-MS/MS SRM with cotinine-d(3) as internal standard (LOQs, 1.0-1.5 ng/L. Typical concentrations of cotinine and 3'-hydroxycotinine were similar to 1-1 mu g/L in untreated wastewater, but clearly less in treated wastewater (similar to 0.01-0.6 mu g/L), corresponding to elimination efficiencies of 90-99%. N-Formylnornicotine, however, was found at similar concentrations in untreated and treated wastewater (0.02-0.15 mu g/L). Its apparent persistence during wastewater treatment was further confirmed by incubation experiments with activated sludge. In lakes, cotinine, 3'-hydroxycotinine, and N-formylnornicotine were detected at concentrations up to 15, 80, and 6 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations in lakes correlated with the expected anthropogenic burden by domestic wastewater (ratio population per water throughflow), demonstrating the suitability of these nicotine derivatives as hydrophilic, anthropogenic markers. In small receiving waters with significant wastewater discharges, concentrations of a few hundred ng/L may be expected. Possible ecotoxicological risks associated with such environmental concentrations, can, however, not be assessed at present as data on effects on aquatic organisms are very limited, in particular on long-term effects.

AB An analytical method was developed to analyze eight psychoactive pharmaceuticals-including the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the opiates morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, the opiode tramadol, and the tranquilizers diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam-and the antibiotic sulfa methoxazole as well as three metabolites (10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), 10,11-dihydroxy-10, 11-dihydrocarbamazepine, and N-4-acetylsulfamethoxazole) in river sediments. Relative recoveries of all analytes exceeded 97% using either deuterated or (CN)-C-13-N-15-labeled surrogate standards. Sorption isotherms of all analytes were constructed at pH 6.5-6.6 on two natural river sediments (Burgen and Dausenau) that differed in organic carbon contents and particle size distributions. Affinities of all analytes were up to an order of magnitude higher for the Dausenau sediment in comparison to the Burgen sediment. Isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model. Sorption of all analytes was linear on the Burgen sediment except for structurally similar carbamazepine (n = 0.90) and DHC (n = 0.88). Conversely, most analytes showed pronounced nonlinear sorption to the Dausenau sediment (n = 0.77-0.92) except for positively charged codeine, dihydrocodeine, and tramadol. Linear sorption of the latter was taken to arise from concentration-independent electrostatic interactions of the organocations with negatively charged surfaces on clay minerals or in the sediment organic matter. Desorption gave rise to hysteresis in 13 out of 16 investigated analyte-sorbent systems. Hysteresis was likely due to slow desorption kinetics beyond 24 h used in the experiment.

AB This study assessed volatile organic compound (VOC) emission characteristics from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in five Taiwanese industrial districts engaged in numerous manufacturing processes, including petrochemical, science-based industry (primarily semiconductors, photo-electronics, electronic products and biological technology), as well as multiple manufacturing Processes (primarily pharmaceuticals and paint manufacturing). The most aqueous hydrocarbons dissolved in the wastewater of Taiwanese WWTPs were acetoric, acrylonitrile, methylene chloride, and chloroform for the petrochemical districts: acetone, chloroform. and toluene for the science-based districts;, and chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbons for the multiple industrial districts. The aqueous pollutants in the United WWTPs were closely related to the characteristics of the manufacturing plants ill the districts. To effectively prevent VOC emissions from the primary treatment section of petrochemical WWTPs, the Updated regulations governing VOC emissions were issued by the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration in September 2005, legally mandating a seal cover system incorporating venting and air purification equipment. Cost analysis indicates that incinerators with regenerative heat recovery are optimal for treating high VOC concentrations, exceeding 10,000 ppm as CH4, from the on separation basins. However, the emission concentrations, ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm as CH4 from the Other Primary treatment facilities and bio-treatment stages, should be collected and then injected into the biological oxidation basins via existing or new blowers. The additional capital and operating costs required to treat the VOC emissions of 1000 ppm as CH4 from primary treatment facilities are less than US$0.1 for per m(3) wastewater treatment capacity.

AB Cootes Paradise is a coastal wetland, at the western end of Lake Ontario. The marsh, which is an important spawning ground for fish and a crucial habitat for other species, has been considerably degraded by excessive contaminant inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), marsh tributaries, and Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs). These discharges are not only major sources of nutrients (e.g., phosphorus) to the marsh, but are also the main contributors of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other wastewater contaminants. Studies have shown that many of these compounds are toxic and have estrogenic effects on organisms living in the vicinity of these sources. This study investigates dispersal of contaminants from nearby point sources, as determined from sediment contamination, both spatially and stratigraphically. This was accomplished by establishing the trends and utilizing the relationship's between limiting nutrient phosphorus, estrogenic alkylphenols, and fecal sterols, specifically, coprostanol. High levels of phosphorus (1,655-1,987 mg TP kg(-1)) and alkylphenolics (2.51-4.89 mg kg(-1)) were measured in sediments near the discharge outlets. Statistical analysis revealed a close relationship between investigated pollutants and the molecular marker coprostanol, and provides evidence of significant sediment contamination near the discharge points, suggesting deposition of most contaminants within a short distance from the points of entry and limited dispersal of pollutants within the wetland. The stratigraphic distribution of pollutants, which reflects the historical trends, reveals major spikes in pollutant concentrations near point sources that could be attributed to episodic events of major significance and shows a long persistence of the investigated contaminants in sedimentary environments.

AB Background, aim, and scope The European Union banned disposal of sewage sludge (SS) at sea in Europe in 1998. Since that time, the application rate of SS to land has risen significantly and is set to rise further. Fifty-two percent of SS was disposed to land in the UK in 2000. Land application is, thus, possibly an important transport route for SS-associated organic chemicals into the environment. There are now over 3,000 different pharmaceutical ingredients in use in the EU and many enter sewage systems. Possibly as a result, the last decade has seen an increase in reports of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment (e. g. in watercourses, open ocean and soils). Surprisingly, there is still a significant lack of knowledge of the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment, particularly in soils. The present project, therefore, investigated the susceptibility to microbial degradation of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Prozac(R) (fluoxetine HCl), and the 1,4-benzodiazepine, Valium(R) (Diazepam) and their major human metabolites (norfluoxetine HCl, temazepam and oxazepam) in short-term (60 day) bacterial liquid cultures derived from UK SS-amended soil and of fluoxetine HCl in a longer-term (270 day) SS-amended soil culture.
   Methodology Recently developed extraction techniques, including solid phase extraction, allowed all analytes to be isolated from the biodegradation cultures (aqueous and soil matrices), and subsequently analysed using novel high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-multistage mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MSn) techniques. Ratio calibration using deuterated internal standards allowed the generation of quantitative data. A simple basified tautomerism experiment was also performed to aid in the identification of a bacterial transformation product. Alongside the biodegradation studies, HPLC-APCI-MSn profiling of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs; bacterial membrane marker chemicals) allowed assessment of the microbial community structure in the SS-amended soils.
   Results The pharmaceuticals were found to be resistant to biodegradation in liquid culture studies (60 days), and even after prolonged exposure in SS-amended soil (> 200 days; fluoxetine HCl only). Oxazepam was the only 1,4-benzodiazepine studied which underwent biotic transformation (similar to 40%) in liquid culture studies. Evidence to support the theory that the transformation product was a 1,4-benzodiazepine tautomer, is presented. BHP profiles of eight different SS-amended soils suggested that the restricted bacterial community of the soil used as a culture source in these biodegradation studies was typical of SS-amended soils.
   Discussion The lack of substantial degradation of all target analytes except oxazepam under simulated, but realistic, SS-amended soil conditions indicates their likely persistent nature. Although oxazepam did undergo significant biotic (and abiotic) losses, the metabolite formed under biotic influences was hypothesised to be another bioactive 1,4-benzodiazepine (either 2-enol or 3-enol nordiazepam) which is likely to be resistant to further change. The bacterial communities in SS-amended soils may be unable to degrade such compounds.
   Recommendations and perspectives With such pharmaceuticals as tested here, there is a potential for accumulation within environments such as field soil to which SS is regularly added both as a disposal mechanism and as a fertiliser. When compounds undergo accumulation, the risk of transport to other environmental components becomes more likely. From field soils, these may include potential exposure to flora and fauna and possible bioaccumulation or effects on terrestrial organisms and accumulation in plants, including crops grown on the SS-treated soils. The fate and subsequent impact of many pharmaceuticals within the terrestrial environment is still largely unknown and further research is required before the risks, if any, of SS-associated pharmaceuticals can be fully assessed.

AB The concern over pharmaceuticals and their toxicity in wastewater and drinking water has grown over the past decade. In this study, the common analgesic, acetaminophen, was chlorinated with sodium hypochlorite to determine the effects of pH and chlorine-to-pharmaceutical molar ratios on the degradation of acetaminophen and the formation of the toxic byproduct 1,4-benzoquinone. Reactions were studied for pH 6.0, 7.5 and 9.0 at average molar ratios of 106 +/- 6, 1,417 +/- 285, and 9,789 +/- 1,430 over a period of 100 minutes. The degradation of acetaminophen and the formation of 1,4-benzoquinone were monitored using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Results indicate that acetaminophen is most reactive with free chlorine at pH 9.0 and least reactive at pH 6.0. As pH increased, degradation of acetaminophen also increased. The formation of 1,4-benzoquinone was also affected by pH and its concentration reached a maximum of 68.7% of the initial acetaminophen concentration when the pH was at 6.0, the molar ratio at 1,275, and after a contact time of 30 minutes. At all pH values the rate of degradation of acetaminophen was slowest at a molar ratio of about 100, and highest at a molar ratio of about 10,000.

AB As part of the continuing effort to collect baseline information on the environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in the Nation's water resources, water samples were collected from a network of 47 groundwater sites across 18 states in 2000. All samples collected were analyzed for 65 OWCs representing a wide variety of uses and origins. Site selection focused on areas suspected to be susceptible to contamination from either animal or human wastewaters (i.e. down gradient of a landfill, unsewered residential development, or animal feedlot). Thus, sites sampled were not necessarily used as a source of drinking water but provide a variety of geohydrologic environments with potential sources of OWCs. OWCs were detected in 81% of the sites sampled, with 35 of the 65 OWCs being found at least once. The most frequently detected compounds include N,N-diethyltoluamide (35%, insect repellant), bisphenol A (30%, plasticizer), tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (30%, fire retardant), sulfamethoxazole (23%, veterinary and human antibiotic), and 4-octylphenol monoethoxylate (19%, detergent metabolite). Although sampling procedures were intended to ensure that all groundwater samples analyzed were indicative of aquifer conditions it is possible that detections of some OWCs could have resulted from leaching of well-construction materials and/or other site-specific conditions related to well construction and materials. Future research will be needed to identify those factors that are most important in determining the occurrence and concentrations of OWCs in groundwater. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Numerous studies have shown that a variety of manufactured and natural organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals, steroids, surfactants, flame retardants, fragrances, plasticizers and other chemicals often associated with wastewaters have been detected in the vicinity of municipal wastewater discharges and livestock agricultural facilities. To provide new data and insights about the environmental presence of some of these chemicals in untreated sources of drinking water in the United States targeted sites were sampled and analyzed for 100 analytes with sub-parts per billion detection capabilities. The sites included 25 ground- and 49 surface-water sources of drinking water serving populations ranging from one family to over 8 million people. Sixty-three of the 100 targeted chemicals were detected in at least one water sample. Interestingly, in spite of the low detection levels 60% of the 36 pharmaceuticals (including prescription drugs and antibiotics) analyzed were not detected in any water sample. The five most frequently detected chemicals targeted in surface water were: cholesterol (59%, natural sterol), metolachlor (53%, herbicide), cotinine (51%, nicotine metabolite), beta-sitosterol (37%, natural plant sterol), and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (27%, caffeine metabolite); and in groundwater: tetrachloroethylene (24%, solvent), carbamazepine (20%, pharmaceutical), bisphenol-A (20%, plasticizer), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (16%, caffeine metabolite), and tri (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (12%, fire retardant). A median of 4 compounds were detected per site indicating that the targeted chemicals generally occur in mixtures (commonly near detection levels) in the environment and likely originate from a variety of animal and human uses and waste Sources. These data will help prioritize and determine the need, if any, for future occurrence, fate and transport, and health-effects research for subsets of these chemicals and their degradates most likely to be found in water resources used for drinking water in the United States.

AB This work investigated the presence of 21 emerging contaminants of various chemical groups (7 estrogens, 3 progestogens, 6 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and 5 acidic pesticides) in the Llobregat river basin (NE Spain). Waters from the outlet of various sewage treatment plants (STP) and waterworks located along the river basin, as well as water samples from the river or its tributaries upstream and downstream of these plants were analysed in two pilot monitoring studies. Chemical analyses were performed by means of on-line or off-line solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. Methods detection limits (in ng/L) were <= 0.85 for estrogens, <= 3.94 for progestogens, <= 30 for PPCPs, and <= 0.99 for pesticides. Of the estrogens and progestogens analysed, only estrone-3-sulfate, estrone, estriol and progesterone were found to be present in the low nanogram per liter range in some of the samples investigated. Except for atenolol, all PPCPs studied (ibuprofen, diclofenac, clofibric acid, salicylic acid, and triclosan) could be identified at levels usually tower than 250 ng/L and up to 1200 ng/l (diclofenac). Of the various pesticides investigated (2,4-D, bentazone; MCPA, mecoprop and propanil) MCPA and 2,4-D were the most ubiquitous and abundant and bentazone the only one not detected. Individual concentrations were most often below 100 ng/L and never surpassed the EU limits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Hydra attenuata regeneration assay was used to identify the teratogenic potential of 10 pharmaceuticals identified in effluent from a large city wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Three types of solvents were used to solubilise the pharmaceuticals (DMSO, acetone and ethanol), at concentrations determined to have no significant effect on measured endpoints. On the one hand, regeneration was significantly inhibited at (nominal) concentrations of 1, 5 and 1 mg/L for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen respectively and at the higher concentration of 50 mg/L for bezafibrate and trimethoprim. On the other hand, carbamazepine and the antibiotics sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline and novobiocin significantly increased regeneration at 25, 5, SO and 50 mg/L respectively. Relatively high IC50 values of 0.9, 3.84, 4.9 and 22.5 mg/L were calculated for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and bezafibrate, respectively. However when subjected to tier two toxicity assessment under EU regulatory guidance using environmentally relevant concentrations a MEC/PNEC value > 1 was calculated for gernfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen indicating teratogenic potential and the necessity for further tier three assessment. A toxicity index (TI) was also calculated using three different techniques, with TI values > 3 (indicating teratogenic potential) found for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and bezafibrate and > 1 (indicating a weak teratogenic potential) found for carbamazepine. These results are discussed in the context of their environmental relevance and toxic potential. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Absolute second-order rate constants for the reaction between the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and eight water samples containing non-isolated effluent organic matter (EfOM) collected at different wastewater and reclamation sites were measured by electron pulse radiolysis. The measured rate constants ranged from 0.27 to 1.21 x 10(9) M-C(-1) s(-1), with an average value of 0.86 ( +/- 0.35) x 10(9) M-C(-1) s(-1). These absolute values were 3-5 times faster than previously reported values using natural organic matter and wastewater isolates. The obtained rate constants were correlated (R-2 > 0.99) to bulk EfOM properties through an empirical equation that included terms relating to the polarity, apparent molecular weight, and fluorescence index of the effluent organic matter. The obtained data were used to model steady state (OH)-O-center dot concentrations during UV advanced oxidation. The steady-state (OH)-O-center dot concentration was lower than that obtained using previously reported values for the reaction with dissolved organic matter, indicating that accurate measurement of reaction rate constants at specific sites would greatly improve the design and prediction of the removal of organic contaminants. These results will improve the ability of researchers to accurately model scavenging capacities during the advanced oxidation process treatment of wastewaters.

AB Previous field studies utilizing solid-phase microextraction (SPME) predominantly focused on volatile and semivolatile compounds in air or water. Earlier in vivo sampling studies utilizing SPME were limited to the liquid matrix (blood). The present study has expanded the SPME technique to semisolid tissues under laboratory and field conditions through the investigation of both theoretical and applied experimental approaches. Pre-equilibrium extraction and desorption were performed in vivo in two separate animals. Excellent linearity was found between the amounts extracted by SPME from the muscle of living fish and the waterborne concentrations of pharmaceuticals. A simple SPME method is also described to simultaneously determine free and total analyte concentrations in living tissue. The utility of in vivo SPME sampling was evaluated in wild fish collected from a number of different river locations undervarying degrees of influence from municipal wastewater effluents. Diphenhydramine and diltiazem were detected in the muscle of fish downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant. Based on this study, SPME demonstrated several important advantages such as simplicity, sensitivity, and robustness under laboratory and in vivo field sampling conditions.

AB The fate of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) was investigated in two nitrite-accumulating sequencing batch reactors operating under strictly aerobic (SBR1) conditions at different sludge ages (SRT, 1.7 to 17.1 d) and anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic ISM) conditions with different phases and durations of redox conditions, using a modified GC-MS analytical method for estrogen detection to ng/L concentrations. In SBR1, >= 98% of E2 was removed (specific E2 removal rate ranged from 0.375 (at SRT 17.1 d) to 2.625 (at SRT 1.7 d) mu g E2.g MLVSS-1.d(-1)) regardless of SRT or DO (<1.0 to >5.0 mg/L. Removal of E1 and, to a greater extent, EE2 was adversely affected when this reactor was operated at SRT shorter than 5.7 d. However, whereas E1 was removed efficiently as long as SRT was long enough for AOB to bring about nitritation, EE2 removal efficiency was significantly lower when SBR1 was operated at SRT longer than 7.5 d. This reduced removal of EE2 may have been caused by the inhibition and toxicity of nitrite, both to the ammonium monooxygenase (AMO) and to the microbial population generally. In SBR2, less removal of E2 was found at the lower MLVSS concentrations, and El was not removed by sludge with poor settling qualities. The removal of EE2 observed in SBR2 was considered to be mainly a result of sorption. However, the binding of estrogens to the sludge in this reactor was apparently not as strong as the binding observed in the sludge of the strictly aerobic SBR1, since desorption was observed during the aeration phase in SBR2.

AB This paper evaluated the effect of mixing the effluent of a pharmaceutical plant producing acetylsalicylic acid with tannery wastewater, on the biodegradation of the effluents. The evaluation involved the analysis of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), profiles of each wastewater and the mixture by respirometry. Model calibration using the experimental OUR data identified major COD fractions and associated process kinetics for all samples analyzed. The tannery sample was a plain-settled effluent having a total COD of around 2200 mg/L with a readily biodegradable fraction of 15%. The same fraction was 57% in the pharmaceutical wastewater sample having a much stronger total COD content of 40,435 mg/L. Consequently, mixing of the pharmaceutical effluent with the tannery wastewater up to 38% of the total COD in the mixture increased the readily biodegradable COD fraction but had an inhibitory effect on the biodegradation kinetics. This effect was relatively lower on growth, but quite significant on the hydrolysis of the slowly biodegradable COD decreasing the maximum hydrolysis rate from 2.0 day(-1) to 1.2 day(-1). Model evaluation of the respirometric data, as performed in this study sets a workable protocol for the assessment of the compatibility of different wastewater mixtures for biological treatability.

AB Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were tested for their suitability for detecting sulfonamides in wastewater from various stages in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the river into which the wastewater is discharged, and two swine-rearing facilities. The sulfamethoxazole ELISA cross-reacts with several compounds, achieving detection limits of <0.04 mu g/L for sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethoxypyridine, sulfachloropyridine, and sulfamethoxine, whereas the sulfamethazine (SMZ) ELISA is more compound specific, with a detection limit of <0.03 mu g/L. Samples from various stages of wastewater purifications gave 0.6-3.1 mu g/L by SMX-ELISA, whereas river samples were similar to 10-fold lower, ranging from below detection to 0.09 mu g/L. Swine wastewater samples analyzed by the SMX-ELISA were either at or near detectable limits from one facility, whereas the other facility had concentrations of similar to 0.5 mu g/L, although LC-MS/MS did not confirm the presence of SMX. Sulfamethazine ELISA detected no SMZ in either WWTP or river samples. In contrast, wastewater samples from swine facilities analyzed by SMZ-ELISA were found to contain similar to 30 mu g/L [piglet (50-100 lb) wastewater] and similar to 7 mu g/L (market-weight hog wastewater). Sulfamethazine ELISA analyses of wastewater from another swine facility found concentrations to be near or below detection limits. A solid phase extraction method was used to isolate and concentrate sulfonamides from water samples prior to LC-MS/MS multiresidue confirmatory analysis. The recoveries at 1 mu g/L fortification ranged from 42 +/- 4% for SMZ to 88 +/- 4% for SMX (n = 6). The ELISA results in the WWTPs were confirmed by LC-MS/MS, as sulfonamide multiresidue confirmatory analysis identified SMX, sulfapyridine, and sulfasalazine to be present in the wastewater. Sulfamethazine presence at one swine-rearing facility was also confirmed by LC-MS/MS, demonstrating the usefulness of the ELISA technique as a rapid and high-throughput screening method.

AB Aqueous solubilities (S-w) and n-octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow) of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were measured and sorption to two sediments and three soils with organic matter contents ranging from 0.16% to 1.77% and pH ranging between 5.0 and 7.8 was investigated using a batch equilibrium method. SSRIs had high S-w (3,022-15,460 mg/l) and relatively low log K-ow (1.12-1.39). Sorption isotherms followed the Freundlich equation. All SSRIs had sorption capacities of greater than 91% except fluvoxamine with a minimum capacity of 73%. Organic matter contents partly affected sorption, however no correlation between sorption characteristics and cation exchange capacity (CEC) or clay content was observed for any SSRI or adsorbent. Values of K-f, K-d, and log K-oc ranged from 39 to 18,342, from 60 to 42,579, and 3.35 to 6.02 for the SSRIs. SSRIs likely exhibit mixed mechanisms of sorption such as ionic binding in addition to hydrophobic interactions.

AB Residues of malachite green (MG), a veterinary drug illegally used for the treatment of aquacultured fish, have been found in wild eels caught from surface waters downstream from the sewers of different municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). MG and its metabolite leucomalachite green (LMG) were detected with total concentrations up to 0.765 mu g kg(-1) fresh weight in the tissues of 25 out of 45 eels caught from different lakes, a river and a canal in Berlin, Germany. In all cases, the occurrence of the residues could directly be linked to the presence of discharges by municipal STPs into the receiving surface waters. MG is a multiple-use compound that is also used to color materials. Thus, it appears to be reasonable that the residues of MG found in the eel samples originate from such uses, e.g. by wash off from clothes or paper towels colored with MG. Additional loads from legal uses of MG as veterinary drug for the treatment of ornamental fish (private aquaria) are possible. The results obtained from this study are the first proof of background contaminations of a veterinary drug found in samples of fish not intentionally treated with such agents.
   MG and LMG are regarded as potential genotoxic carcinogens making it impossible to establish a tolerable daily intake. A margin of exposure (MOE) approach was applied to evaluate the human health risk associated with the consumption of the eels investigated in this study. With a MOE of 3.4 million the chronic risk was classified as being very low. Nevertheless, due to their potential to act as genotoxic carcinogens, any oral exposure to residues of MG and LMG should be avoided. According to European Union law, zero tolerance applies to all residues of MG and LMG found in food for human consumption as MG is not registered for use as veterinary drug. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multiple chemical constituents (nutrients; N, O, H, C stable isotopes; 64 organic wastewater compounds, 16 pharmaceutical compounds) and microbiological indicators were used to assess the impact on groundwater quality from the land application of approximately 9.5 million liters per day of treated municipal sewage effluent to a sprayfield in the 960-km(2) Ichetucknee Springs basin, northern Florida. Enriched stable isotope signatures (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were found in water from the effluent reservoir and a sprayfield monitoring well (MW-7) due to evaporation; however, groundwater samples downgradient from the sprayfield have delta O-18 and delta H-2 concentrations that represented recharge of meteoric water. Boron and chloride concentrations also were elevated in water from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and MW-7, but concentrations in groundwater decreased substantially with distance downgradient to background levels in the springs (about 12 km) and indicated at least a tenfold dilution factor. Nitrate-nitrogen isotope (delta N-15-NO3) values above 10 parts per thousand in most water samples were indicative of organic nitrogen sources except Blue Hole Spring (delta N-15-NO3 = 4.6-4.9 parts per thousand), which indicated an inorganic source of nitrogen (fertilizers). The detection of low concentrations the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET), and other organic compounds associated with domestic wastewater in Devil's Eye Spring indicated that leakage from a nearby septic tank drainfield likely has occurred. Elevated levels of fecal coliforms and enterococci were found in Blue Hole Spring during higher flow conditions, which likely resulted from hydraulic connections to upgradient sinkholes and are consistent with previoius dye-trace studies. Enteroviruses were not detected in the sprayfield effluent reservoir, but were found in low concentrations in water samples from a downgradient well and Blue Hole Spring during high-flow conditions indicating a human wastewater source. The Upper Floridan aquifer in the Ichetucknee Springs basin is highly vulnerable to contamination from multiple anthropogenic sources throughout the springs basin.

AB A Xanthomonas sp. was isolated from the sludge on the drain outlet of a pharmaceutical factory. Then, the bacterium and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were co-attached to an oxygen electrode for rapid analysis of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The response current was linear with BOD values in the range 10 to 300 mg/L for standard BOD solution with a response time of 35 seconds (R = 0.9994) and 20 to 580 mg/ L for pharmaceutical wastewater with a response time <= 200 seconds (R = 0.9985), which means that this modified electrode might be used for online BOD analysis of pharmaceutical wastewater. Further studies revealed that the modified electrode can be used for BOD measurement in a high-salt condition. Also, the bacterium/CNTs biofilm can maintain its activity and good performance, even after being sealed and stored at 4 degrees C for 50 days. Water Environ. Res., 80, 699 (2008).

AB The ozonation of an effluent from the secondary clarifier of two Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants was performed by using alkaline ozone and a combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Alkaline ozonation achieved only a moderate degree of mineralization, essentially concentrated during the first few minutes; but the addition of hydrogen peroxide eventually led to a complete mineralization. The evolution of total organic carbon (TOC) as a measure of the extent of mineralization and the concentration dissolved ozone were analyzed and linked in a kinetic model whose parameter represented the product of the exposure to hydroxyl radicals and the kinetic constant of indirect ozonation. This rate parameter yielded the highest values during the first part of O-3/H2O2 runs. The kinetic constant for the decomposition of ozone at the end of the run was also measured and computed for the non-oxidizable water matrix and yielded essentially the same values regardless of whether or not hydrogen peroxide was used. A group of 33 organic compounds, mainly pharmaceuticals and some relevant metabolites present in the wastewater effluents, were evaluated before and after the ozonation process using a liquid chromatography-hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap system (LC-QqLIT-MS). The results demonstrate that the ozonation degrades these compounds with efficiencies of over 99% in most cases, even under low mineralization conditions in alkaline ozonation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The potential of a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) to remove polar pollutants from municipal wastewater was studied for industrial and household chemicals over a period of 22 months parallel to a conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. For half of the compounds, such as benzotriazole, 5-tolyltriazole (5-TTri), benzothiazole-2-sulfonate and 1,6-naphthalene disulfonate (1,6-NDSA), removal by MBR was significantly better than in CAS, while no improvement was recorded for the other half (1,5-NDSA, 1,3-NDSA, 4-TTri and naphthalene-1-sulfonate). The influence of operational conditions on trace pollutant removal by MBR was studied but no significant effects were found for variation of hydraulic retention time (7 h-14 h) and sludge retention time (26 d-102 d), suggesting that the lowest values selected have already been high enough for good removal. It is shown that the seemingly inconsistent results reported here and in previous studies regarding the comparison of trace pollutant removal in MBR and CAS are highly consistent. MBR is neither superior for well degradable compounds that are already extensively degraded in CAS treatment nor for recalcitrant compounds that are not amenable to biodegradation. For most compounds of intermediate removal in CAS treatment (15-80%), among them pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals, the MBR is clearly superior and reduces the effluent concentration by 20-50%. Despite of this clear benefit of MBR, the effect is not pronounced enough to serve as a sole argument for employing MBR in municipal wastewater treatment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land application of municipal biosolids (sewage) is a common farming practice in many parts of the world. There is potential for transport of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from agricultural fields to adjacent surface waters via tile drainage systems. In this study, liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) (total solids=11,933 mg L-1), supplemented with selected PPCPs and the fluorescent dye tracer rhodamine WT (RWT), were applied to tile drained fields using two land application approaches. Objectives included evaluating the relative benefits of land application practices with respect to reducing PPCP loadings to tile drains, evaluating PPCP persistence in tile water, and determining whether rhodamine WT can be used to estimate PPCP mass loads in tile. The PPCPs examined included an antibacterial agent used in personal care products (triclosan), a metabolite of nicotine (cotinine), and a variety of drugs including two sulfonamide antimicrobials (sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole), a beta-blocker (atenolol), an anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), an antidepressant (fluoxetine), analgesic/anti-inflammatories (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen), and a lipid-regulator (gemfibrozil). Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in the spiked LMB were about 10(3) ng g(-1) dry weight. PPCPs were shown to move rapidly via soil macropores to tile drains within minutes of the land application. Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in tile effluent associated with the LMB application-induced tile flow event were similar to 10(1) to 10(3) ng L-1. PPCP mass loads, for the application-induced tile-hydrograph event, were significantly (p <0.1) higher for surface spreading over non-tilled soil (incorporation tillage occurring 20 h post-application), relative to aerating soil immediately prior to surface spreading using an AerWay (R) slurry deposition system. PPCP concentrations that were detected above the Emit of quantitation (LOQ) in tile water during several precipitation-induced tile flow events that occurred post-application, included: triclosan (max. similar to 1.5 x 10(2) ng L-1), carbamazepine (max. similar to 7 x 10(1) ng L-1), atenolol (max similar to 4 x 10(1) ng L-1), and cotinine (max similar to 2 x 10(1) ng L-1). In spite of their presence in biosolids, the other PPCPs were not observed above LOQ concentrations during these events. PPCP concentrations were predicted from RWT concentrations over a 40 day study period. Tile mass loads as a percent of PPCP mass applied to soil ranged from 4.2% +/- SD of 9.2% to 7.1% +/- 10.9% for the AerWay (R) system and surface spreading plus incorporation treatments, respectively.

AB This paper reports on a comprehensive reconnaissance of over seventy individual wastewater contaminants in the region of Western Balkan (WB; Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia), including some prominent classes of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, surfactants and their degradation products, plasticizers, pesticides, insect repellents, and flame retardants. All determinations were carried out using a multiresidue analytical approach, based on the application of gas chromatographic and liquid chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometric detection. The results confirmed a widespread occurrence of the emerging contaminants in municipal wastewaters of the region. The most prominent contaminant classes, determined in municipal wastewaters, were those derived from aromatic surfactants, including linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) and alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO), with the concentrations in raw wastewater reaching into the mg/l range. All other contaminants were present in much lower concentrations, rarely exceeding few mu g/l. The most abundant individual compounds belonged to several classes of pharmaceuticals (antimicrobials, analgesics and and inflammatories, beta-blockers and lipid regulators) and personal care products (fragrances). Due to the rather poor wastewater management practices in WB countries, with less than 5% of all wastewaters being biologically treated, most of the contaminants present in wastewaters reach ambient waters and may represent a significant environmental concern.

AB Currently, many articles report on pharmaceutical residues detected in various compartments of the environment. A major pathway into the aquatic environment is municipal wastewater. This article discusses the relevance of yellowwater (urine) as pharmaceutical source within this wastewater stream. Literature data about concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical residues detected in raw wastewater are compared to their theoretically calculated concentrations in urine. The study shows that these pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are excreted predominantly via urine although some substances show reasonable excretion via faeces. It is demonstrated that the influence of pharmacokinetic activities is one important issue affecting the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, only a weak correlation between concentrations of pharmaceuticals calculated in yellowwater and analysed in raw wastewater was observed. This is due to environmental effects taking place between the excretion of urine and the entrance of sewerage into the wastewater treatment plant. The data show that urine separation and separate handling/treatment of this wastewater stream represents a promising approach to protect the aquatic environment safely from human pharmaceuticals.

AB There is increasing concern about pharmaceuticals entering surface waters and the impacts these compounds may have on aquatic organisms. Many contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, are not completely removed by wastewater treatment. Discharge of effluent into surface waters results in chronic low-concentration exposure of aquatic organisms to these compounds, with unknown impacts. Exposure of virulent bacteria in wastewater to antibiotic residues may also induce resistance, which could threaten human health. The purpose of this study was to provide information on pharmaceutical threats to the environment. A preliminary risk assessment database for common pharmaceuticals was created and put into a web-accessible database named "Pharmaceuticals in the Environment, Information for Assessing Risk" (PEIAR) to help others evaluate potential risks of pharmaceutical contaminants in the environment. Information from PEIAR was used to prioritize compounds that may threaten the environment, with a focus on marine and estuarine environments. The pharmaceuticals were ranked using five different combinations of physical-chemical and toxicological data, which emphasized different risks. The results of the ranking methods differed in the compounds identified as high risk; however, drugs from the central nervous system, cardiovascular, and anti-infective classes were heavily represented within the top 100 drugs in all rankings. Anti-infectives may pose the greatest overall risk based upon our results using a combination of factors that measure environmental transport, fate, and aquatic toxicity. The dataset is also useful for highlighting information that is still needed to assuredly assess risk. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a facile approach for the surface modification of polypropylene non-woven fabric (NWF) by PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) to determine its filterability. The NWF surface modification involved the physical adsorption of PVA to immobilize PVA on the NWF surface. Chemical structures and morphological changes of the PVA-modified NWF sample surfaces were characterized in details by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron micrograph (SEM), and water contact angle measurements. Results reveal that PVA concentration has significant effects on the immobilization degree of PVA, and pure water contact angle on the NWF surface decreases with the increase in PVA concentration indicating an enhanced hydrophilicity for the modified NWF. Coomassie brilliant blue G250 method was utilized to quantify the static bovine serum albumin solution adsorption on the NWF surface. This adsorption was used to indicate the protein fouling property of the modified NWF with PVA. The results showed that after PVA modification, the polar groups such as C-O, C-O-C were introduced to the NWF surface, hydrophilicity was improved, and water static contact angles were decreased from 86 +/- 1 degrees to 43 +/- 3 degrees, the amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) static adsorption on modified NWF was decreased by 83.4%. Membrane bioreactor was used for the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater to determine the filterability of modified NWF. The results revealed that flux declination of modified NWF was only 12%, in comparison of the original NWF of 40%. The anti-fouling property for the modified NWF was enhanced greatly.

AB Microbiological flocculation in wastewater by a strain of Bacillus mucilaginosus was examined and the flocculation mechanism was investigated using Coomassie brilliant blue reaction, Anthrone reaction, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), scanning electronic microscope, and infrared spectroscopy. The GY03 strain, isolated from farmland soil, was identified as B. mucilaginosus by its morphology and 16S rDNA sequence. Cultivated in a nitrogen-free medium, the flocculation material (bacterium-mineral complex) was used to treat domestic, brewage, and pharmaceutical wastewater. On the basis of one-way experimental results, orthogonal experiments were carried out and the optimum processing conditions of the microbial flocculants were obtained. In the optimal conditions, the maximal removal ratio of COD in domestic, brewage, and pharmaceutical wastewater reached 74.6%, 70.5%, and 66.2%, respectively; the maximal removal ratio of BOD was 42.3%, 77.4%, and 41.7%, respectively; and the maximal removal of SS amounted 93.3%, 93.6%, and 88.4%, respectively. The treatment to kaolin suspended liquid by the GY03 strain may act as a model of studying microbial flocculation mechanisms in which bridging and charge neutralization hypothesis were proposed as the critical reasons based upon the experimental observations.

AB A review of consumption and excretion rates of 17 pharmaceuticals, two musk fragrances and two hormones by the Spanish population in 2003 was performed. For that purpose, three different models were used: (i) extrapolation of the per capita use in Europe to the number of inhabitants of Spain for musk fragrances; (ii) annual prescription items multiplied by the average daily dose for pharmaceuticals and; (iii) excretion rates of different groups of population for hormones. This information enabled the prediction of the expected concentrations (PEQ entering sewage treatment plants (STPs), which were subsequently compared with the measured environmental concentrations (MEC) in raw sewage. Annual drugs consumption in Spain ranges from few kilograms (Oxazepam and 17ot-ethinylestradiol) to several hundred of tons (lbuprofen). The quantities of musks used accounts for 110-450 kg d(-1) and the total amount of hormones excreted daily reaches almost 1 kg d(-1). 12 out of 21 selected substances were predicted to be present in raw sewage influent at concentrations greater than 100 ng l(-1) and these predicted concentrations fltted with the measured values for half of them (Carbamazepine, Diazepam, lbuprofen, Naproxen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Roxithromycin, Erythromycin and 17ot-ethinylestradiol).

AB Polycyclic and nitro musk (PNM) fragrances in personal care products persist and bioaccumulate in the environment following wastewater discharges and land application of biosolids. Influent and effluent concentrations, seasonal variations, and process removal efficiencies of 11 PNMs were investigated at six wastewater treatment plants representing four typical Canadian treatment processes: lagoon, oxidation ditch, extended aeration, and conventional activated sludge. Influent concentrations were as high as 40 000 ng/L for polycyclic musks and 400 ng/L for nitro musks, and showed some seasonal fluctuation. Effluent concentrations were as high as 4000 ng/L and 150 ng/L for polycyclic and nitro musks, respectively. Lagoon treatment produced the highest percent removal (> 95%) and the lowest effluent concentrations of PNMs, with process temperature exerting some influence on removal. Results indicate that simple hydraulic or solids retention time are not strong predictors of PNM removals from wastewater. Effluent PNM concentrations were extrapolated to all treatment plants in the watershed to estimate concentrations along the Grand River and its tributaries.

AB Goldfish were exposed to either treated municipal effluent (FE wastewater) or reuse water produced through membrane ultrafiltration (MF reuse water) or membrane ultrafiltration followed by activated carbon filtration (MCF wastewater) for up to 90 days. The xenobiotics present in the wastewater were identified using gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy and the efficacy of their removal by membrane ultrafiltration and activated carbon filtration were determined. At various time points post-exposure to wastewater or reuse water the following biological parameters were assessed: vitellogenin (Vtg) induction, immune gene expression, and mitogen-induced proliferation of blood leukocytes. Membrane ultrafiltration alone did not remove xenobiotics from FE wastewater, while activated carbon filtration efficiently reduced the levels of most xenobiotics. Vitellogenin was induced in fish exposed to both FE wastewater and MF reuse water, but not in fish exposed to MCF reuse water. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of select immune genes (tumor necrosis factor alpha, colony stimulating factor receptor-1) were up-regulated in FE and MF exposed fish on days 7 and 21 post exposure, while Toll-like receptor 22 mRNA level was similar in fish exposed to wastewater or control water. Prolonged exposure of fish to FE and MF wastewaters caused a significant reduction in the mitogen-induced proliferation of blood leukocytes. Our results suggest that goldfish may be used as biosentinels for xenobiotics present in wastewater and reuse water.

ID DOPED DIAMOND ELECTRODES
AB Wastewater effluents from sewage treatment plants (STP) are important point sources for residues of pharmaceuticals and complexing agents in the aquatic environment. For this reason a research project, which started in December 2006, was established to eliminate pharmaceutical substances and complexing agents found in wastewater as micropollutants. For the treatment process a combination of anodic oxidation by boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and ozonation is examined and presented. For the ozone production a non-conventional, separate reactor was used, in which ozone was generated by electrolysis with diamond electrodes For the determination of the achievable remediation rates four complexing agents (e.g., EDTA, NTA) and eight pharmaceutical substances (e.g., diazepam, carbamazepin) were analyzed in several test runs under different conditions (varied flux, varied current density for the diamond electrode and the ozone producing electrode of the ozone generator, different packing materials for the column in the ozone injection system). The flowrates of the treated water samples were varied from 3 L/h up to 26 L/h. For the anodic oxidation the influence of the current density was examined in the range between 22.7 and 45.5 mA/cm(2), for the ozone producing reactor two densities (1.8 a/cm(2) and 2.0 A/cm(2)) were tested. Matrix effects were investigated by test runs with samples from the effluent of an STP and synthetic waste water. Therefore the impact of the organic material in the samples could be determined by the comparison of the redox potential and the achievable elimination rates of the investigated substances. Comparing both technologies anodic oxidation seems to be superior to ozonation in each investigated area. With the used technology of anodic oxidation elimination rates up to 99% were reached for the investigated pharmaceutical substances at a current density of 45.5 mA/cm(2) and a maximum sample flux of 26 L/h.

AB The removal of selected surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), coconut diethanol amides (CDEA) and alkylphenol ethoxylates and their degradation products were investigated using a two membrane bioreactor (MBR) with hollow fiber and plate and frame membranes.
   The two pilot plants MBR run in parallel to a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. A total of eight influent samples with the corresponding effluent samples were analysed by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS-MS).
   The results indicate that both MBR have a better effluent quality in terms of chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD), NH4+, concentration and total suspended solids (TSS). MBR showed a better similar performance in the overall elimination of the total nonylphenotic compounds, achieving a 75% of elimination or a 65% (the same elimination reached by CAS).
   LAS and CDEA showed similar elimination in the three systems investigated and no significant differences were observed. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All. rights reserved.

AB Water treatment plants are often not effective in removing pharmaceuticals, personal care products or natural hormones from their effluents. To test the effects of these effluents on fish, we exposed male fat-head minnows (Pimephales promelas) for 48 h to effluents at two sites, one up-stream and the other down-stream from a water treatment plant. Gene expression profiling showed that significant changes occurred in the gonad of fish exposed below, compared to above the treatment plant and to laboratory control fish. Among the biological processes affected were the innate immune response, response to stress, control of homeostasis, control of transcription, metabolism, and cell communication. This work suggests that fish are impacted by exposures to the sewage treatment effluents and effects can be detected rapidly by gene expression profiling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of several psychoactive drugs in water resources from north-eastern Spain (NE-Spain) has been evaluated. The drugs were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) after enrichment by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Most of the studied controlled drugs (8 out of 11) were found in both influent and effluent samples from several wastewater treatment plants. Cocaine and its metabolite were detected in wastewaters at concentrations ranging from 4 ng/L to 4.7 mu g/L and from 9 ng/L to 7.5 mu g/L respectively while concentrations of amphetamine type stimulatory drugs ranged from 2 to 688 ng/L.
   Removal percentages were estimated by sampling eight WWTPs (n=4). Cocaine and benzoylecgonine removal percentages were higher than 88% while those of amphetamine type stimulants varied ranging from 40% to more than 99%. Daily variability was also evaluated by performing a sequential survey, which revealed important fluctuations in the concentrations of nicotine, paraxanthine, amphetamine and ecstasy during the week. From the total concentrations found in wastewater influents estimations of the cocaine and ecstasy consumption were performed. For cocaine the results were approximately 14 doses per 1000 inhabitants (15-64 years old) per day and for ecstasy, approximately 4 doses per 1000 young adults (15-34 years old) per day for ecstasy.

AB In order to add to the current state of knowledge regarding occurrence and fate of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCP's) in the environment, influent, effluent and biosolids from three wastewater treatment facilities in Northwest Ohio, USA, and a stream containing effluent discharge from a rural treatment facility were analyzed. The three WWTP facilities vary in size and in community served, but are all Class B facilities. one facility was sampled multiple times in order to assess temporal variability. Twenty compounds including several classes of antibiotics, acidic pharmaceuticals, and prescribed medications were analyzed using ultrasonication extraction, SPE cleanup and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The highest number of compounds and the greatest concentrations were found in the influent from the largest and most industrial WWTP facility. Short-term temporal variability was minimal at this facility. Many compounds, such as clarithromycin, salicylic acid and gemfibrizol were found at concentrations more than one order of magnitude higher than found in the effluent samples. Effluent waters contained elevated levels of carbamazepine, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole. Differences in composition and concentration of effluent waters between facilities existed. Biosolid samples from two different facilities were very similar in PPCP composition, although concentrations varied. Ciprofloxacin was found in biosolids at concentrations (up to 46 mu g/kg dry mass) lower than values reported elsewhere. Diclofenac survived the WWTP process and was found to persist in stream water incorporating effluent discharge. The low variability within one plant, as compared to the variability found among different wastewater treatment plants locally and in the literature is likely due to differences in population, PPCP usage, plant operations and/or local environment. These data are presented here for comparison with this emerging set of environmental compounds of concern. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A scoping study was conducted to investigate the residues of nineteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including 4 natural and 3 synthetic steroid estrogens, 7 endocrine-disrupting phenols, and 5 acid pharmaceuticals in three urban streams and the Major Pearl River at Guangzhou, a megapolis in the Pearl River Delta, South China. Estrone was detected in >60% water samples with a maximum concentration of 65 ng L-1. Endocrine-disrupting phenols (nonylphenol, bisphenol A, triclosan, 2-phenylphenol, methyparaben, and propylparaben) were found to be widely present at rather high concentrations in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou. Salicylic acid, clofibric acid and ibuprofen were detected in most water samples with maximum concentrations of 2098, 248 and 1417 ng L-1 respectively, whereas naproxen was less frequently detected and also at lower concentration. Both the detection frequencies and median concentrations of the PPCPs appeared higher during the low-flow season than during the high-flow season. The seasonal difference in PPCPs occurrence was probably attributed to the dilution effect caused by the rainfall. PPCPs in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou originated mainly from random discharge and/or leakage of municipal wastewater. PPCPs contamination in the Major Pearl River may be of a potential environmental issue, especially during the low-flow season. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot-scale test was conducted with a two-phase anaerobic digestion (TPAD) system and a subsequential membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The TPAD system comprised a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket-anaerobic filter (UASBAF), working as the acidogenic and methanogenic phases, respectively. The wastewater was high in COD, varying daily between 5789 and 58,792 mg L-1, with a wide range of pH from 4.3 to 7.2. The wastewater was pumped at a fixed flow rate of 1 m(3) h(-1) through the CSTR, the UASBAF and the MBR in series, resulting in respective HRTs of 12, 55 and 5 h. Almost all the COD was removed by the TPAD-MBR system, leaving a COD of around 40 mg L-1 in the MBR effluent. The pH of the MBR effluent was found in a narrow range of 6.8-7.6, indicating that the MBR effluent can be directly discharged into natural waters. A model, built on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory and linear regression techniques, was developed for the simulation of TPAD-MBR system performance in the biodegradation of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The model well fitted the laboratory data, and was able to simulate the removal of COD. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence and fate of 56 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) were investigated in the South Wales region of the UK. Two contrasting rivers: River Taff and River Ely were chosen for this investigation and were monitored for a period of 10 months. The impact of the factors affecting the levels of concentration of PPCPs and illicit drugs in surface water such as surrounding area, proximity to wastewater effluent and weather conditions, mainly rainfall was also investigated.
   Most PPCPs were frequently found in river water at concentrations reaching single mu g L(-1) and their levels depended mainly on the extent of water dilution resulting from rainfall. Discharge of treated wastewater effluent into the river course was found to be the main cause of water contamination with PPCPs. The most frequently detected PPCPs represent the group of pharmaceuticals dispensed at the highest levels in the Welsh community. These were antibacterial drugs (trimethoprim, erythromycin-H(2)O and amoxicillin), anti-inflammatories/analgesics (paracetamol, tramadol, codeine, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Only four PPCPs out of 56 (simvastatin, pravastatin, digoxin and digoxigenin) were not quantified over the course of the study. Several PPCPs were found to be both ubiquitous and persistent in the aqueous environment (e.g. erythromycin-H(2)O, codeine, carbamazepine, gabapentin and valsartan). The calculated average daily loads of PPCPs indicated that in total almost 6 kg of studied PPCPs are discharged daily into the studied rivers.
   The illicit drugs studied were found in rivers at low levels of ng L(-1). Average daily loads of amphetamine, cocaine and its main metabolite benzoylecgonine were as follows: 8, 1.2 and 39 g day(-1), respectively Their frequent occurrence in surface water is primarily associated with their high illegal usage and is strongly associated with the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater effluent.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption and degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) at mu g/L range in an aerobic activated sludge system. The sorption isotherms and thermodynamics indicated that the sorption of BPA on sludge was mainly a physical process in which partitioning played a dominating role. The values of sorption coefficient K-oc were between 621 and 736 L/kg in the temperature range of 10-30 degrees C. Both mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) and temperature influenced BPA sorption on sludge. The degradation of BPA by acclimated activated sludge could be described by first-order reaction equation with the first-order degradation rate constant of 0.80 h(-1) at 20 degrees C. The decrease of initial COD concentration and the increase of MLSS concentration and temperature enhanced BPA degradation rate. The removal of BPA in the activated sludge system was characterized by a quick sorption on the activated sludge and subsequent biodegradation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage sludge has been used as fertilizer for agricultural land over a long time. This is part of a sustainable practice utilizing and recycling the macronutrients back to land. During the last decades, questions have been raised concerning the risks related to heavy metals and xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) present in the sludge. Application on land used for agriculture is, therefore, not socially acceptable in some countries, e.g., Sweden. In this study, literature reviews showed that 541 XOCs potentially could be present in sewage sludge due to their presence in e.g. construction materials, pharmaceuticals, personal care products etc. 192 compounds have been quantified in sewage sludge, which indicate that, although many XOCs have been measured in sludge, there are potentially a vast number of compounds present that have not been analyzed for yet. In a hazard identification of the quantified compounds using their inherent properties and environmental fate it was shown that 99 XOCs could be classified as being hazardous with regard to the solid phase and 23 were found to be priority pollutants in the subsequent hazard assessment. The final selected priority pollutants can act as indicators when assessing sludge quality. They were compared with European legislations and discussed in regard for pointing out the need for mitigation such as substitution. Furthermore, the potential need for implementation of sludge treatment trains in order to meet the society's needs was addressed.

AB Pharmaceuticals, by design, induce biological responses in animals and humans at very low doses, making their presence in the aquatic environment an issue of concern. Prescription and over-the-counter drugs commonly found in wastewater are discharged on a continuous basis into the waters of two coastal watersheds in Atlantic Canada. Ten acidic drugs and caffeine were observed in the final effluents of sewage treatment facilities in Millcove (Halifax watershed), and Trenton (Pictou watershed), Nova Scotia. Naproxen and ibuprofen, two highly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and caffeine, were the predominant compounds. Naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylic acid (metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid), diclofenac (NSAID) and gemfibrozil (lipid regulator) were also detected in the low ng/L range in the receiving waters of treated and untreated sewage outflows. Acidic drugs were not detected in the marine waters of the Cocagne watershed located in southeast New Brunswick. This watershed was evaluated for the possibility of contamination of near-shore coastal waters from domestic septic systems in the vicinity of a densely populated cottage area. The observation of traces of caffeine suggests some organic pollution in the area. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal biosolids are a source of nutrients for crop production. Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) can be used to minimize the risk of contamination of adjacent water resources with chemical or microbial agents that are of public or environmental health concern. In this field study, we applied biosolids slurry at a commercial rate using either subsurface injection or broadcast application followed by incorporation. Precipitation was simulated at 1, 3, 7, 22, 36 and 266 days post-application on 2 m(2) microplots; to evaluate surface runoff of 9 model pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), atenolol, carbamazepine, cotinine, gemfibrozil, naproxen, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan. In runoff from the injected plots, concentrations of the model PPCPs were generally below the limits of quantitation. In contrast, in the broadcast application treatment, the concentrations of atenolol, carbamazepine, cotinine, gemfibrozil, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan on the day following application ranged from 701477 ng L(-1) in runoff and generally declined thereafter with first order kinetics. The total mass of PPCPs mobilized in surface runoff per m(2) of the field ranged from 0.63 mu g for atenolol to 21.1 mu g for ibuprofen. For ibuprofen and acetaminophen, concentrations in runoff first decreased and then increased, suggesting that these drugs were initially chemically or physically sequestered in the biosolids slurry, and subsequently released in the soil. Carbamazepine and triclosan were detected at low concentrations in a runoff event 266 days after broadcast application. overall, this study showed that injection of biosolids slurry below the soil surface could effectively eliminate surface runoff of PPCPs.

AB Membrane separations are finding greater use in wastewater treatment because of their efficiency. In order to prove the effectiveness of membrane filtration an applicability study is carried out. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are tested under quite different conditions to reduce the chemical oxygen demands (COD) of wastewaters to meet the Council Directive 76/464/EEC release limit. Two kinds of real wastewaters were selected for the investigation. The wastewaters represent extreme different circumstances since the difference between their COD is two orders of magnitude. All of the membranes tested can be applied either to the treatment of wastewater of high COD (pharmaceutical wastewater) or wastewater of low COD (dumpsite leachate), since the different conditions do not change the membrane characteristics. The experimental data show that none of the membranes can decrease the COD to the release limit in one step. However, if two-stage filtrations (nanofiltration followed by reverse osmosis) are accomplished for both of the wastewaters, a total COD reduction of 94% can be achieved. With the application of the two-stage filtration the COD of the wastewater of low COD can be decreased below the release limit but in case of wastewater of the high COD further treatment will be required.

AB In recent years pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been detected in increasing concentrations in hospital effluents, sewage treatment plants (STP) as well as in different environmental compartments such as surface water, groundwater and soil. Little is known about the elimination of these substances during sewage treatment or about the formation of potential metabolites in the environment caused by bacterial biotransformation. To assess the biodegradability of the popular cardiovascular drug verapamil and the possible formation of potential microbial degradation products, two tests from the OECD series were used in the present study: the widely used Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B).
   In the Closed Bottle test, a screening test that simulates the conditions of an environmental surface water compartment, no biological degradation was observed for verapamil at concentrations of 2.33 mg l(-1). In the Zahn-Wellens test, a test for inherent biodegradability which allows evaluation of aerobic degradation at high bacterial density, only a partial biological degradation was found. Analysis of test samples by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to multiple stage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS '') revealed 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl-5-(methylamino)pentane nitrile, already known as D617 (Knoll nomenclature), a metabolite of mammalian metabolism, which is the major degradation product and dead-end transformation product of aerobic degradation of verapamil.

AB To establish their environmental concentrations and to support surface water protection programs, we have undertaken a preliminary study of the concentrations of selected acidic and neutral pharmaceutical residues (clofibric acid, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine) in Taiwanese river and wastewater samples. These pharmaceutical residues were extracted from the water samples through the Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE). The analytes were then identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry with dual-polarity electrospray ionization in the product ion scan mode. The limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 0.5 and 20 ng l(-1) for 250 ml samples of water. We investigated the intra- and interbatch precision and accuracy at two levels of concentration. The selected analytes were detected at concentrations ranging from <0.5 to 960 ng l(-1) in wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background, aim, and scope The presence of a variety of pollutants in the aquatic environment that can potentially interfere with the production of sex steroid hormones in wildlife and humans has been of increasing concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of extracts from Hong Kong marine waters, and influents and effluents from wastewater treatment plants on steroidogenesis using the H295R cell bioassay. After exposing H295R cells to extracts of water, the expression of four steroidogenic genes and the production of three steroid hormones were measured. Materials and methods Water samples were collected during the summer of 2005 from 24 coastal marine areas and from the influents and effluents of two major waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in Hong Kong, China. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE). H295R cells were exposed for 48 h to dilutions of these extracts. Modulations of the expression of the steroidogenic genes CYP19, CYP17, 3 beta HSD2, and CYP11 beta 2 were determined by measuring mRNA concentrations by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). Production of the hormones progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) was quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
   Results Extracts from samples collected in two fish culture areas inhibited growth and proliferation of H295R cells at concentrations greater or equal to 10(5) L equivalents. The cells were exposed to the equivalent concentration of active substances in 10,000 L of water. Thus, to observe the same level of effect as observed in vitro on aquatic organisms would require a bioaccumulation factor of this same magnitude. None of the other 22 marine samples affected growth of the cells at any dilution tested. Twelve of the marine water samples completely inhibited the expression of CYP19 without affecting E2 production; inhibition of CYP17 expression was observed only in one of the samples while expression of CYP11 beta 2 was induced as much as five- and ninefold after exposure of cells to extracts from two locations. The expression of the progesterone gene 3 beta HSD2 was not affected by any of the samples; only one sample induced approximately fourfold the production of E2. Although more than twofold inductions were observed for P and T production, none of these values were statistically significant to conclude effects on the production of these two hormones. While influents from WWTPs did not affect gene expression, an approximately 30% inhibition in the production of E2 and a 40% increase in P occurred for the exposure with influents from the Sha Tin and Stonecutters WWTPs, respectively. Effluents from WWTPs did not affect the production of any of the studied hormones, but a decrement in the expression of the aldosterone gene CYP11 beta 2 was observed for the Sha Tin WWTP exposure. No direct correlation could be established between gene expression and hormone production.
   Discussion Observed cytotoxicity in the two samples from fish culture areas suggest the presence of toxic compounds; chemical analysis is required for their full identification. Although effluents from WWTPs did not affect hormone production, other types of endocrine activity such as receptor-mediated effects cannot be ruled out. Interactions due to the complexity of the samples and alternative steroidogenic pathways might explain the lack of correlation between gene expression and hormone production results.
   Conclusions Changes observed in gene expression and hormone production suggest the presence in Hong Kong coastal waters of pollutants with endocrine disruption potential and others of significant toxic effects. The aromatase and aldosterone genes seem to be the most affected by the exposures, while E2 and P are the hormones with more significant changes observed. Results also suggest effectiveness in the removing of compounds with endocrine activity by the WWTPs studied, as effluent samples did not significantly affect hormone production. The H295R cell showed to be a valuable toll in the battery required for the analysis of endocrine disrupting activities of complex environmental samples.
   Recommendations and perspectives Due to the intrinsic complexity of environmental samples, a combination of analytical tools is required to realistically assess environmental conditions, especially in aquatic systems. In the evaluation of endocrine disrupting activities, the H295R cell bioassay should be used in combination with other genomic, biological, chemical, and hydrological tests to establish viable modes for endocrine disruption and identify compounds responsible for the observed effects.

AB A high-throughput, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method has been developed for the determination of 51 emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) in environmental waters. The method was validated for the analysis of 38 pharmaceutically active, 10 endocrine disrupting, and three perfluoroalkylated compounds. Method performance parameters, including sample preservatives, pH values used in the solid-phase extraction (SPE), sample storage, sample extract storage time, and matrix effects were discussed in detail for different aquatic matrices, including drinking water, wastewater,and surface water. Isotope-labeled compounds were used as injection internal standards (IIS) or isotope dilution quantitation standards (VIS) to improve the data quality, investigate the behavior of matrix effects during SPE sample preparation and LC/MS-MS analysis, and to validate isotope dilution mass spectrometric (IDMS) determination of selected compounds. Method detection limits were determined to be in the low ng/L range for the compounds evaluated. By application of this method to the analysis of effluents and samples downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, more than 35 target EOPs were quantified. We demonstrated method ruggedness by quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) data, showed that matrix effects were dependent on modes of electrospray ionization, and could not be removed via SPE or cleanup procedures, exerting the same effect to target compounds in both raw and extracted samples. Both C-13- and H-2-labeled IDQS could be added to samples before sample extraction, and, their recoveries used to correct matrix effects in LC/MS-MS EOP analyses.

AB The adsorption of two representative pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (naproxen and carbamazepine) and one endocrine disrupting compound (nonylphenol) were evaluated on two types of activated carbon. When determining their isotherms at environmentally relevant concentration levels, it was found that at this low concentration range (10-800 ng/L), removals of the target compounds were contrary to expectations based on their hydrophobicity. Nonylphenol (logK(ow) 5.8) was most poorly adsorbed, whereas carbamazepine (logK(ow) 2.45) was most adsorbable. Nonylphenol Freundlich isotherms at this very low concentration range had a much higher 1/n compared to isotherms at much higher concentrations. This indicates that extrapolation from an isotherm obtained at a high concentration range to predict the adsorption of nonylphenol at a concentration well below the range of the original isotherm, leads to a substantial overestimation of its removals. Comparison of isotherms for the target compounds to those for other conventional micropollutants suggested that naproxen and carbamazepine could be effectively removed by applying the same dosage utilized to remove odorous compounds (geosmin and MIB) at very low concentrations. The impact of competitive adsorption by background natural organic matter (NOM) on the adsorption of the target compounds was quantified by using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) in combination with the equivalent background compound (EBC) approach. The fulfilment of the requirements for applying the simplified IAST-EBC model, which leads to the conclusion that the percentage removal of the target compounds at a given carbon dosage is independent of the initial contaminant concentration, was confirmed for the situation examined in the paper. On this basis it is suggested that the estimated minimum carbon usage rates (CURs) to achieve 90% removal of these emerging contaminants would be valid at concentrations of less than 500 ng/L in natural water.

AB Wastewater-derived contaminants (WWDCs), such as steroid hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, have been detected in surface waters at concentrations that pose potential risks to aquatic ecosystems. To assess the factors controlling biotransformation of these compounds in effluent-dominated surface waters (i.e., surface waters containing a high proportion of wastewater effluent), microcosm experiments were conducted with 10 pharmaceuticals and five steroids typically detected in wastewater effluent. Some of the compounds underwent rapid biotransformation under all conditions (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone and triclosan), while carbamazepine was always resistant to biotransformation. For the remaining compounds, the rate of biotransformation was related to the amount and type of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). The rates of biotransformation of these WWDCs increased as the initial concentration of wastewater BDOC increased, indicating a relationship between microbial activity and biotransformation rate. Furthermore, BDOC derived from aquatic plants resulted in a better ability to remove certain recalcitrant compounds (gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole) as compared to that derived from wastewater effluent. These observations indicate that for each source of BDOC, it may be possible to use BDOC for predicting the rate of biotransformation of WWDCs in surface waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate samples were obtained from a RO-membrane system that uses effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as feed water for the production of drinking water. A number of different pharmaceuticals (e.g. antibiotics, contrast media, beta blockers) were found in the WWTP effluent as well as in the RO-concentrate. Overall, a concentration factor (feed: concentrate) of approximately 3-4 was measured. Beta blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) were found in the range of low ng/L to low mu g/L. Because metoprolol and propranolol are classified as potentially toxic to aquatic organisms and all beta blocker molecules have moieties, which are reactive towards ozone (amine groups, activated aromatic rings), it was tested whether ozonation can be applied for their mitigation. Rate constants for the reaction of acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol with ozone and OH radicals were determined. At pH 7 acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol react with ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant (ko(3)) of about 2000 M-1 s(-1), whereas propranolol reacts with similar to 10(5)M(-1)s(-1). The rate constants for the reaction of the selected compounds with (OH)-O-center dot radicals were determined to be 0.5-1.0 x 10(10)M(-1) s(-1). Experiments with RO concentrate showed that an ozone dose of only 5 mg/L resulted in a quantitative removal of propranolol in 0.8s and 10 mg O-3/L, oxidized 70% of metoprolol in only 1.2s. Tests with chlorinated and non-chlorinated WWTP effluent showed an increase of ozone stability but a decrease of hydroxyl radical exposure in the samples after chlorination. This may shift the oxidation processes towards direct ozone reactions and favor the degradation of compounds with high kO(3). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sorption is an important mechanism for removal of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in biological wastewater treatment. In an effort to deepen our understanding of this process, this work investigated the underlying thermodynamic parameters. Biomass was harvested from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and sorption experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures. Sorption of EE2 to activated sludge was spontaneous (Delta G values were between -16 and -11 KJ/mol), enthalpy-driven (Delta H values were -37 KJ/mol (MBR) and -48 KJ/mol (SBR)), and entropy-retarded (Delta S values were -74 (MBR) and -119J/mol/K (SBR)). Although EE2 is nonpolar, hydrophobic interactions were not dominant driving forces. The thermodynamic data also suggested that EE2 sorption to biomass was primarily physisorption, but it also included low-level chemisorption. The FT-IR results suggested that chemical reactions were not significant enough to shift the detectable chemical bonding characteristics of the biomass functional groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Numerous human and veterinary pharmaceuticals are constantly entering surface waters, despite little understanding of their potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. To address this concern, an attempt to create a simple, reproducible, inexpensive, and sublethal toxicity bioassay for freshwater zooplankton was initiated. The approach was centered on characterizing the response of a zooplankton enzyme, chitobiase, to the presence of a toxicant. The aim of the present research was to develop a reproducible laboratory-based assay for Daphnia magna chitobiase activity and to screen four commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals using that assay. The four pharmaceuticals tested for potential effects on D. magna chitobiase activity were atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluoxetine, and sertraline. We were able to detect exposure-associated differences in chitobiase activity at concentrations of 0.1 mu g/L fluoxetine after 24 and 72 hours of exposure. Differences were also detected for the other compounds. The response of chitobiase was found to be promising as an assay to measure sublethal effects in D. magna and perhaps other zooplankton species.

AB There has been recent growing interest in the presence of antibiotics in different environmental sectors. One considerable concern is the potential development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, even at low concentrations. Cefaclor, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is widely used as an antibiotic. Kinetic studies were conducted to evaluate the decomposition and mineralization of cefaclor using gamma radiation. Cefaclor, 30 mg/l, was completely degraded with 1000 Gy of gamma radiation. At a concentration of 30 mg/l, the removal efficiency, represented by the G-value, decreased with increasing accumulated radiation dose. Batch kinetic experiments with initial aqueous concentrations of 8.9, 13.3, 20.0 and 30.0 mg/l showed the decomposition of cefaclor using gamma radiation followed a pseudo first-order reaction, and the dose constant increased with lower initial concentrations. At a given radiation dose, the G-values increased with higher initial cefaclor concentrations. The experimental results using methanol and thiourea as radical scavengers indicated that (OH)-O-center dot radicals were more closely associated with the radiolytic decomposition of cefaclor than other radicals, such as e(aq)(-) or H-center dot. The radical scavenger effects were tested under O-2 and N2O saturations for the enhancement of the TOC percentage removal efficiencies in the radiolytic decomposition of cefaclor. Under O-2 saturation, 90% TOC removal was observed with 100 000 Gy. Oxygen is well known to play a considerable role in the degradation of organic substances with effective chain reaction pathways. According to the effective radical reactions, the enhanced TOC percentage removal efficiencies might be based on the fast conversion reactions of e(aq)(-) and H-center dot with O-2 into oxidizing radicals, such as O-2(center dot-) and HO2 center dot, respectively. 100% TOC removal was obtained with N2O gas at 20 000 Gy, as reducing radicals, such as e(aq)(-) and H-center dot, are scavenged by N2O and converted into (OH)-O-center dot radicals, which have strong oxidative properties. The results of this study showed that gamma irradiation was very effective for the removal of cefaclor in aqueous solution. The use of O-2 or N2O, with radiation, shows promise as effective radical scavengers for enhancing the TOC or COD removal efficiencies in pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics. However, the biological toxicity and interactions between various chemicals during the radiolytic treatment, as well as treatments under conditions more representative of real wastewater will require further studies.

AB Three organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) were evaluated in theory and practice for their potential to trace sewage-derived microbial contaminants in surface waters. The underlying hypothesis was that hydrophobic OWCs outperform caffeine as a chemical tracer, due to their sorptive association with suspended microorganisms representing particulate organic carbon (POC). Modeling from first principles lab initio) of OWC sorption to POC under environmental conditions suggested an increasing predictive power: caffeine (0.2% sorbed) < triclosan (9-60%; pH 6-9) < triclocarban (76%). Empirical evidence was obtained via analysis of surface water from three watersheds in a rural-to-urban gradient in Baltimore, MD. Mass spectrometric OWC detections were correlated to microbial plate counts for 40 monitoring sites along 14 streams, including multiple chronic sewage release sites and the local wastewater treatment plant. Consistent with ab initio calculations, correlation analyses of 104 observations for fecal coliforms, enterococci, and Escherichia coli in natural surface waters showed that the particle-active antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban (R-2 range, 0.45-0.55) were indeed superior to caffeine (0.16-0.37) for tracking of microbial indicators. It is concluded that chemical monitoring of microbial risks is more effective when using hydrophobic OWCs such as triclosan and triclocarban in place of, or in conjunction with, the traditional marker caffeine.

AB The decomposition of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (B), nonylphenol (NP), and bisphenol A (BPA) during ozonation of municipal sewage grabbed from the outlets of primary sedimentation tanks was studied through laboratory-scale experiments. A newly developed in vitro bioassay called nuclear receptor-ligand assay and GC-MS were both utilized to respectively determine the estrogenicity and individual ENS in the wastewater samples. The original estrogenicity, expressed as the E2 equivalent concentration (EEQC), in the primary effluents was 315-1018 ng/ L. Results indicate that the EEQC can be reduced rapidly to below 10 ng/L after ozonation. The appearance of 0.1 mg/L dissolved ozone (DO3) which corresponds to a consumed ozone amount of 0.4 mg per initial TOC (total organic carbon) of wastewater samples, was an appropriate operational parameter to simultaneously achieve efficient EDC removal and control of BrO3- and total organic bromine (TOBr). The presence of suspended solids in the range of 38-67 mg/L exhibited no obvious impact on the removal of nonsorbed estrogenicity. A complete decomposition of E2, E3 and BPA was achieved once 0.1 mg/L 003 appeared in the primary effluent. The oxidative decomposition of NP was relatively less efficient with a residual concentration of 100 ng/L. This work investigates the feasibility of EDC removal and brominated byproduct control during ozonation of original municipal sewage prior to biological treatment.

AB The growth-inhibiting and binary joint effects of 12 antibacterial agents on the freshwater green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korschikov) Hindak were investigated over 72-h exposures. The toxicity values (the median inhibitory concentration value, in micromoles) in decreasing order of sensitivity were triclosan (0.0018) > triclocarban (0.054) > roxithromycin (0.056) > clarithromycin (0.062) > tylosin (0.20) > tetracycline (2.25) > chlortetracycline (3.49) > norfloxacin (5.64) > sulfamethoxazole (7.50) > ciprolloxacin (20.22) > sulfamethazine (31.26) > trimethoprim (137.78). Several of these antibacterial compounds would be toxic at the micrograms per liter concentrations reported in surface waters and sewage effluents. Simple additive effects were observed in binary mixtures of sulfonamides, and most tylosin, triclosan, or triclocarban combinations. Potentially synergistic effects were observed in binary mixtures of the same class, such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones, as well as in some combined drugs, such as trimethoprim and sulfonamides or tylosin and tetracyclines. Potentially antagonistic effects were only observed between tylosin and triclocarban, triclosan and norfloxacin, and triclocarban and norfloxacin. Although present at low concentrations in the aquatic environment, mixtures of these antibacterial agents can potentially affect algal growth in freshwater systems due to their combined action.

AB An investigation was carried out in the New York City Watershed for the presence of selected pharmaceuticals. In four seasonal sampling events between August 2003 and May 2004, surface water was collected from eight reservoir keypoints and effluent was collected from four wastewater treatment plants. We evaluated the following twelve compounds: amoxicillin, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, cephalexin, estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and valproic acid. In the treated effluents, carbamazepine was detected most frequently (100%; concentration range: 22-551 ng/L), followed by atenolol (94%; ND - 14,200 ng/L), trimethoprim (83%; ND - 37,000 ng/ L), ibuprofen (61%; ND - 14,600 ng/L), and caffeine (49%; ND - 37,200 ng/L), while estrone was detected once (56 ng/L). In the reservoir keypoint samples, only ibuprofen (2.5%; ND 932 ng/L) and caffeine (2.9%; ND - 177 ng/L) were detected. The other analytes were not detected in any sample. It is expected that investigation of other wastewater treatment plants in the New York City Watershed would show that their effluents are also a potential source of pharmaceuticals, but that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to be detected in the Watershed's surface waters.

AB Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFCWs) are a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for sanitation in small communities. SSFCWs are designed to remove suspended solids and organic matter from wastewater but there is little information on the effect of the characteristics of organic matter on the removal efficiency of specific contaminants. In this paper, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and clofibric acid were continuously injected into two SSFCW microcosms fed with synthetic wastewater containing different organic matter sources: dissolved (glucose) and particulate (starch). The response curves of carbamazepine and ibuprofen were compared with that of clofibric acid, which was used as a conservative tracer. The removal efficiencies were found to be independent of the organic matter type (i.e. dissolved or particulate). Carbamazepine was removed inefficiently (5%) by bed sorption, whereas ibuprofen was removed by degradation (51%). In addition, the behaviour of the two main ibuprofen biodegradation intermediates (carboxy and hydroxy derivatives) supported that the main ibuprofen elimination pathway occurs in aerobic conditions.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media have been detected in hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant effluent, rivers and groundwater aquifers. No process has been developed to remove triiodinated aromatic molecules. In this paper, we present a biological sequential process using an anaerobic fixed-bed reactor coupled in series with an aerobic fixed-bed reactor for degrading 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (ATIA), the core structure of a X-ray contrast media family The results obtained showed that the coupled reactor eliminated up to 870 + 44 mg of carbon L-1 day(-1), with a molar ethanol/ATIA ratio of 4 in the feeding medium. The anaerobic reactor (ANR) undertook the majority of the deiodination of the aromatic nucleus and had a maximum deiodination rate of 23.4 +/- 0.06 mM day(-1). The aerobic reactor (AER) mineralized ATIA and was also able to eliminate its metabolites. This study suggests that the mineralization of ATIA can be achieved efficiently in a coupled anaerobic-aerobic bioreactor. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the last years, increasing attention has been paid on the presence of POPs in water. It has been found that wastewaters and wastewater treatment plant effluents are the main source of surface and ground water pollution. Therefore, it seems important to improve the removal efficiency of such compounds in wastewater treatment plant as well as to understand the different mechanisms involved. The implementation of a pilot scale MBR in parallel of a large conventional biological treatment plant will allow the comparison of both processes, as well as to observe the effect of a much higher SRT on POPs removal. Biodegradation efficiencies of target compounds are going to be assessed through the use of a microcalorimeter Bio-RC 1. Moreover, the effect of POPs concentration in the feeding solution will be studied. Attention will be focused on inhibition and adaptation to the chosen pollutants, through the analysis of the responses to POP's pulses and continuous flow.

AB Three high volume septic systems in Ontario, Canada, were examined to assess the potential for onsite wastewater treatment systems to release pharmaceutical compounds to he environment and to evaluate the mobility of these compounds in receiving aquifers. Wastewater samples were collected from the septic tanks, and groundwater samples were collected below and down gradient of the infiltration beds and analyzed for a suite of commonly used pharmaceutical and trace organic compounds. The septic tank samples contained elevated concentrations of several pharmaceutical compounds. Ten of the 12 compounds analyzed were detected in groundwater at one or more sites at concentrations in the low ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 range. Large differences among the sites were observed in both the number of detections and the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds. Of the compounds analyzed, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen were observed to be transported at the highest concentrations and greatest distances from the infiltration source areas, particularly in anoxic zones of the plumes.

AB The behaviour of residues of phenazone-type pharmaceuticals during bank filtration was investigated at a field site in Berlin, Germany, where bank-filtered water is used for drinking water production. The concentrations of the pharmaceutical residues in the shallow, young bank filtrate (travel times < one month) were correlated to the prevailing hydrochemical conditions at the field site. In addition, their behaviour during passage through an undisturbed sediment core from the lake base at the site (clogging layer) was evaluated in the laboratory. Phenazone, 4-acetylaminoantipyrine (AAA), 4-formylaminoantipyrin (FAA) and 1,5-dimethyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP) were eliminated more efficiently under oxic conditions, while 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyloxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) was not eliminated at all. The redox conditions and the elimination of the respective pharmaceutical residues displayed strong seasonal variations. Oxic conditions were only encountered close to the shore in winter, when temperatures were low. The column study showed that the elimination is restricted to the uppermost decimetres of the lake base, where oxygen is present. While phenazone elimination is almost complete during aerobic rapid sand filtration in the waterworks, the compounds were found to be more persistent under anoxic field conditions.

AB Three sulfonamides - para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), ortho-toluenesulfonamide (o-TSA) and benzenesulfonamide (BSA) - have recently been detected in groundwater within a catchment area of one drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), which is located downstream of a former sewage farm. The degradation pathways of p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA were investigated during drinking water treatment with incubation experiments and an experimental filter. Incubation experiments showed that p-TSA is removed during the treatment by microbiological processes. Removal of p-TSA is performed by adapted microorganisms only present in polluted groundwater. The elimination in an experimental filter of 1.6 m length applying filtration velocities from 2 to 6 m h(-1) was similar to 93% of p-TSA. The microbial degradation rates in the incubation experiment were similar to 0.029 mu g l(-1) h(-1) (zero order reaction). In the experimental filter, the reaction rate constants were around 0.0063 s(-1) for all filtration velocities (1 st order reaction). Drinking water treatment does not reduce the concentration of o-TSA and BSA under conditions encountered in Berlin. p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA were only measured in the low mu g l(-1) concentrations range in the purified water.

AB The occurrence and fate of residues from the therapeutic use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug metamizole have been studied in investigations of sewage effluents from a military hospital, municipal sewers and a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Berlin, Germany. The loads of the metabolites aminoantipyrin (AA), 4-acetylaminoantipyrin (AAA) and 4-formyl-aminoantipyrin (FAA), rapidly formed after the application of metamizole, were predicted from pharmacokinetic data and based on the evaluation of extensive data sets of on the administration in hospitals and private households. In parallel, the actual concentrations were measured within three field trials.
   For the military hospital, the estimated average annual discharges of AA/AAA and FAA were 10.5 and 3.2 kg, respectively. For the STP, annual loads of 333 and 133 kg were determined for AA/AAA and FAA, respectively. During sewage treatment, an average decrease of 26% of the loads was measured for AA/AAA whereas no changes were observed for FAA. Generally, the prediction of the loads resulted in an overestimation of the residue levels compared to those measured in the respective sewers. Thus, modeling of predicted loads or concentrations alone will not be sufficient for a realistic assessment.
   Concerns for human or other mammals' health are not expected from the occurrence of metamizole residues in the aquatic system measured at concentrations up to 7 mu g l(-1) in STIR effluents. However, a rest of uncertainty remains as it was not possible to derive a no observed effect level for the induction of rare but potentially fatal toxicological side effects reported for metamizole.

AB Human pharmaceuticals including statin drugs are found in effluents post-waste water treatment plant. In order to establish whether statin drugs could affect an aquatic species, we initially characterized in the rainbow trout the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase or HMGCoAR which is the mammalian target of statin drugs. Two HMGCoAR transcripts (-1 and -2) were isolated to trout tissues and given their prevalence in liver and brain, these two tissues were used in activity assays. HMGCoAR activities were 87.2 and 66.0 pmol/min/mg protein for liver microsomes and whole brain homogenates. Liver activities were affected by conditions promoting phosphorylation but not by a 14 day fast; brain activities were differentially altered by fasting and re-feeding. Even though activities were altered by fasting, HMGCoAR-1 (but not -2) mRNA was reduced by fasting in both the liver and hypothalamus/pituitary. Both statin drugs (cerivastatin and atorvastatin) significantly decreased HMGCoAR activities in vitro and cerivastatin when injected significantly decreased hepatic but not brain activities; some changes in mRNA levels were noted. These studies demonstrate that at the concentrations of statins used in this study, effects on HMGCoAR activities and transcripts occur. Such changes could affect cholesterol content and may alter cholesterol dynamics in this species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal and diurnal fluctuations in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) concentrations in residential sewage water were ascertained in an area with no businesses industry (e.g., plants or offices) upstream. PPCPs with high detection rates included ibuprofen, acetaminophen and indomethacin (antipyretic analgesics), atenolol and disopyramide (antiarrhythmics), clarithromycin (antibiotic), levofloxacin (synthetic antimicrobial agent) and triclosan (disinfectant). In summer, the concentration of triclosan was the highest, while in winter, the concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were higher than the others. Moreover, three types of diurnal fluctuations were observed: no marked diurnal changes (triclosan), high daytime concentrations (disopyramide) and high nighttime concentrations (acetaminophen).

AB Occurrence and fate of 17 antibiotics were investigated in the aqueous phase of river water under different hydrological conditions at 5 sampling locations in the Seine River inner estuary. The target analytes belonged to 4 groups: quinolones, sulfonamides, nitro-imidazoles and diaminopyrimidines. This six-month survey (from January to June 2006) showed that different compounds were occurring at individual concentrations reaching 544 ng L-1 (sulfamethoxazole). All 17 compounds were detected at least once in the survey. Sulfamethoxazole was detected in every sample, and showed the highest concentrations. Norfloxacin and flumequine were found to be the most ubiquitous quinolones, with detection frequencies of 33 and 75% respectively at the most contaminated site (Poses). Investigations concerning the origins of this contamination were made by means of a longitudinal profile along the Seine River between Paris and Poses. It showed large inputs of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole from wastewater treatment plants, with an increase in norfloxacin and sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 84% and 70% respectively, both reaching 155 ng L-1 in the river, downstream from a wastewater outlet. The detected compounds showed different dissipation patterns and behaviours under different hydrological conditions. Higher inputs of norfloxacin were found in low flow conditions, which were rapidly attenuated along the stream. In contrast, sulfamethoxazole inputs were increasing in high flow conditions, and dissipation of this compound was found to be slow. Similar behaviour was observed for the synergist trimethoprim. Flumequine was also frequently detected and its input increased during flood events. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations and retention of pharmaceutically active substances are crucial for assessing the environmental risk of medication of humans. We hypothesize that environmental introduction concentrations (EICs) of drugs in the Mexico City-Mezquital Valley wastewater irrigation system can be estimated using information on water consumption, sales data, and excretion rates. EICs of six acidic and five basic drugs were calculated and compared with concentrations measured in wastewater, irrigation water, soil drainage, and springs by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). EICs of trimethoprim, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in sewage equaled or exceeded the US FDA action limit of 1 mu g/L for detailed environmental risk assessment (ERA). Concentrations of clarithromycin, clindamycin, metoprolol, sulfasalazine, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil were smaller. Calculated EICs of all compounds except metoprolol and clarithromycin were comparable to measured concentrations if excretion rates were considered. Whereas concentrations of basic compounds with positive or neutral charges were effectively reduced during reservoir storage and soil passage, acidic, anionic compounds were hardly retained. Though realistic EICs can be predicted for most substances, large deviations between EICs and measured concentrations in the case of metoprolol illustrate that estimated concentrations cannot substitute for monitoring programs.

AB Analysis of earthworms offers potential for assessing the transfer of organic anthropogenic waste indicators (AWIs) derived from land-applied biosolid or manure to biota. Earthworms and soil samples were collected from three Midwest agricultural fields to measure the presence and potential for transfer of 77 AWIs from land-applied biosolids and livestock manure to earthworms. The sites consisted of a soybean field with no amendments of human or livestock waste (Site 1), a soybean field amended with biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Site. 2), and a cornfield amended with swine manure (Site 3). The biosolid applied to Site 2 contained a diverse composition of 28 AWIs, reflecting the presence of human use compounds. The swine manure contained 12 AWIs, and was dominated by biogenic sterols. Soil and earthworm samples were collected in the spring (about 30 days after soil amendment) and fall (140-155 days after soil amendment) at all field sites. Soils from Site I contained 21 AWIs and soil from Sites 2 and 3 contained 19 AWIs. The AWI profiles at Sites 2 and 3 generally reflected the relative composition of AWIs present in waste material applied. There were 20 AWIs detected in earthworms from Site I (three compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/kg), 25 AWIs in earthworms from Site 2 (seven compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/ kg), and 21 AWIs in earthworms from Site 3 (five compounds exceeding concentrations of 1000 mu g/kg). A number of compounds that were present in the earthworm tissue were at concentrations less than reporting levels in the corresponding soil samples. The AWIs detected in earthworm tissue from the three field sites included pharmaceuticals, synthetic fragrances, detergent metabolites, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), biogenic sterols, disinfectants, and pesticides, reflecting a wide range of physicochemical properties. For those contaminants detected in earthworm tissue and soil, bioaccumulation factors (BAF) ranged from 0.05 (galaxolide)to 27 (triclosan). This study documents that when AWIs are present in source materials that are land applied, such as biosolids and swine manure, AWIs can be transferred to earthworms.

AB Berlin relies on induced bank filtration from a broad-scale, lake-type surface water system. Because the surface water contains treated sewage. wastewater residues are present in surface water and groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers, including tritium and helium isotopes (H-3, He-3, He-4), stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and a number of persistent sewage indicators, such as chloride. boron and a selection of pharmaceutical residues (phenazone-type analgesics and their metabolites, carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium, Gd-excess), were used to estimate travel times from the surface water to individual production and observation wells at two sites. The study revealed a strong vertical age stratification throughout the upper aquifer, with travel times varying from a few months to several decades in greater depth. Whereas the shallow bank filtrate is characterized by the reflection of the time-variant tracer input concentrations and young H-3/He-3 ages, the deeper, older bank filtrate displays no tracer seasonality, H-3/He-3 ages of a few years to decades and strongly deviating concentrations of several pharmaceutical residues, reflecting concentrations of the source surface water over time. The phenazone-type pharmaceuticals persist in the aquatic environments for decades. Bank filtration in Berlin is only possible at the sandy lakeshores. In greater water depth, impermeable lacustrine sapropels inhibit infiltration. The young bank filtrate originates from the nearest shore, whereas the older bank filtrate infiltrates at more distant shores. This paper illustrates the importance of using multiple tracer methods, capable of resolving a broad range of residence times, to gain a comprehensive understanding of time-scales and infiltration characteristics in a bank filtration system.

AB In this study, performance of a lab-scale hybrid up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, was evaluated under different operating conditions. This study consisted of two experimental stages: first, acclimation to the pharmaceutical wastewater and second, determination of maximum loading capacity of the hybrid UASB reactor. Initially, the carbon source in the reactor feed came entirely from glucose, applied at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1 kg COD/m(3) d. The OLR was gradually step increased to 3 kg COD/m(3) d at which point the feed to the hybrid UASB reactor was progressively modified by introducing the pharmaceutical wastewater in blends with glucose, so that the wastewater contributed approximately 10%, 30%, 70%, and ultimately, 100% of the carbon (COD) to be treated. At the acclimation OLR of 3 kg COD/m(3) d the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 2 days. During this period of feed modification, the COD removal efficiencies of the anaerobic reactor were 99%, 96%, 91% and 85%, and specific methanogenic activities (SMA) were measured as 240, 230, 205 and 231 ml CH4/g TVS d, respectively. Following the acclimation period, the hybrid UASB reactor was fed with 100% (w/v) pharmaceutical wastewater up to an OLR of 9 kg COD/m(3) d in order to determine the maximum loading capacity achievable before reactor failure. At this OLR, the COD removal efficiency was 28%, and the SMA was measured as 170 ml CH4/g TVS d. The hybrid UASB reactor was found to be far more effective at an OLR of 8 kg COD/m(3) d with a COD removal efficiency of 72%. At this point, SMA value was 200 ml CH4/g TVS d. It was concluded that the hybrid UASB reactor could be a suitable alternative for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the effluent of the Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria (HUSM). Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of CIP in the hospital wastewater, both before (P1) and after (P2) cesspit/filter system treatment (CFTS), were determined by means of solid phase extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). The MECs (n = 7 daily composed samples) were 19 to 155 mu g L-1 (average: 54 +/- 21 lug L-1) and 32 to 99 mu g L-1 (average: 65 45 lug L-1) in P1 and P2, respectively. No relevant removal was observed from P1 to P2. In a worst case scenario, the final effluent was regarded as MECs of surface water. These MECs were generally 5 to 20,000-fold higher than what was previously known. If the present data is drawn on to form a model of the situation in developing countries, the picture provides a first rough indication that the environmental risk associated with the use and emission of pharmaceuticals into the environment in developing countries might be higher than in developed countries.

AB The transmission and toxicity of metals and metalloids were initially investigated with various nanofiltration (NF) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, under oxic condition, using wastewater effluent and seawater samples. Various metals and metalloids were categorized into three groups according to their properties, such as specific gravity and concentration level, as well as others. The levels of various transition metals and metalloids included in the wastewater effluent and seawater samples were within ng/L-mu g/L range; the concentrations of almost all compounds were substantially reduced to ng/L or a few mu g/L levels after membrane filtrations, as measured by ICP-MS. Toxicity measurements were performed using bioassays, including both the Microtox and daphnia methods, for raw and membrane treated samples of wastewater effluent and seawater. The results indicated that (1) the SWRO membrane exhibited very good removal efficiencies for all metals and metalloids tested, (2) most metals and metalloids tested were efficiently removed by the tight NF membranes employed; however, some metals and metalloids included in seawater were not efficiently removed by the relatively loose NF membrane, (3) based on the Microtox measurements, only the seawater sample treated using the relatively loose NF membrane provided a relatively high toxic unit close to 1.0; otherwise, all other samples (both raw and membrane treated samples) exhibited relatively low toxicities.

AB Municipal wastewaters contain many organic compounds, among them active ingredients as pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products, which are used in large quantities throughout the world. Most of these compounds come either from domestic sewage or from hospital or industrial discharges and enter municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). Modem STPs can effectively accomplish carbon and nitrogen removal, as well as microbial pollution control. However, these plants have not been specifically designed to remove these trace polluting compounds.
   The dynamics of 12 micropollutants in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) have been studied when treating synthetic sewage. These selected substances correspond to different therapeutic groups such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine), tranquillisers (diazepam), analgesics (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), antibiotics (roxithromycin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) and three polycyclic musk fragrances (galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide). These micropollutants are spiked into the synthetic wastewater fed to the reactor at environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 mu g/L.
   Taking into account previous researches, the MBR is operated at a sludge retention time (SRT) of 44-72 days, since a high value of this parameter is considered as crucial for the removal of these micropollutants. Under these conditions, different fates are observed depending on pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) characteristics. Hydrophobic organic substances, like musk fragrances, are partially sorbed onto the sludge. This explains the partial removal observed in the reactor, with an overall efficiency around 50%. Other substances, like the anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen, are not sorbed but they are eliminated almost completely (98% and 84% of removal, respectively). On the other hand, substances like carbamazepine or diclofenac show a recalcitrant character and their elimination from the effluent is very limited, below 9%.

AB The immunotoxic potential of a primary-treated municipal effluent following enhanced disinfection by ozonation was studied in the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations (0%, 1%, 3%, 10%, and 20% v/v) of the effluent before and after ozone treatment (similar to 10mg/L of purged 03) in a continuous flow-through laboratory for 7 weeks. Immunocompetence was appraised by measuring phagocytosis, cell viability (fluorescein retention), cell adherence to polystyrene microwells, cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and total nitrite levels in peripheral hemocytes from the hemolymphs. The results showed that phagocytosis was significantly inhibited by the primary-treated effluent at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v. Cell viability was also significantly reduced three-fold compared to controls at the same effluent threshold concentration, but hemocyte adherence was unchanged. COX activity was increased 1.3-fold at a threshold concentration of 14% v/v. Total nitrite levels were significantly increased 2.2-fold at a threshold concentration of 5.5% v/v. Ozone treatment of the effluent was not successful in removing phagocytic inhibition, but did completely remove cytotoxicity from hemocytes. Ozonation also reduced cell adherence at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v. The inflammatory properties of the effluent appeared to be accentuated by the ozone, as evidenced by an increase in COX activity, which reached 2.6-fold activity compared to controls, as compared to the 1.3-fold increase witnessed in the primary-treated effluent. Furthermore, total nitrite levels reached a two-fold induction at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v in the ozone-enhanced effluent compared to 5.5% v/v in the primary-treated effluent. In conclusion, ozonation of a primary-treated effluent successfully reduced microbial loading and completely removed cytotoxicity, but increased the inflammatory properties of the effluent. Investigations aimed at examining the impacts of sustained inflammation on the host's capacity to remove potentially pathogenic bacteria are recommended.

AB INTRODUCTION: There are increasing concerns over the presence and implications of pharmaceutical agents in water. In 2002, California banned pharmaceutical use of lindane because of concerns about water quality, as lindane treatment for head lice and scabies was found to be a significant factor adversely affecting wastewater quality.
   OBJECTIVES: In this article we describe the effects the ban has had on wastewater quality, unintentional exposures, and clinical practice. This is the first time that a pharmaceutical has been outlawed to protect water quality. As such, this ban provides a rare opportunity to evaluate the possible or potential outcomes of future public health interventions aimed at reducing pharmaceutical water contamination.
   METHODS: We compiled data on lindane in wastewater treatment plant effluent for several large plants in California and one outside of California. Data on exposures to lindane were obtained from records of the California Poison Control System. We assessed the impact on clinical practice via a survey of 400 pediatricians.
   RESULTS: Wastewater treatment plant monitoring showed that lindane declined in California after the ban. Similarly, unintentional exposure calls declined. Most physicians were aware of the ban (8 1 %) and had used lindane previously (61 %), but they did not notice any difficulties with the ban (78%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The California experience suggests that elimination of pharmaceutical lindane produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures, and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment. This ban serves as a model for governing bodies considering limits on the use of lindane or other pharmaceuticals.

AB The presence of residual pharmaceuticals and environmental endocrine disrupters (EEDs) is increasingly significant due to their impact on human health and wildlife. Of the compounds implicated as EEDs, the most potent in their oestrogenic effect are the natural and synthetic oestrogens. As these compounds will be present in the sewage matrix, it is necessary to establish their fate during sewage treatment with a view of removal and safe disposal to avoid unnecessary exposure. Using methodology developed by the author this paper describes the results of a study undertaken to determine both the K,,, and the adsorption characteristics of these oestrogens. The experimental values obtained were compared to a computational default model. However, there was disparity between the default model and the values determined experimentally. This was especially the case in the determination of the K., which impacts directly on the sludge adsorbance potential. The calculated results ranged from log 4.21 for beta-oestradiol to log 4.68 for 17 alpha-EE-3-ME, the experimental results were higher log(5.04-log5.83), respectively. The implications of the findings in terms of water recycling and sewage sludge disposal are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A sensitive and highly selective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for triclosan, one of the most common bactericides in personal care products, which is also considered as an emerging contaminant, given its presence in the effluents of sewage and wastewater treatment plants. From synthesized haptens, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against triclosan were raised. The best ELISA immunoassay was based on an antibody-coated format, yielding a detection limit of 0.03 mu g L-1, an l(50) of 3.85 mu g L-1, and a dynamic range from 0.22 to 42.16 mu g L-1, with little or no cross-reactivity (< 10%) to similarly structured compounds, including its metabolite methyltriclosan (CR < 6%). The assay was applied as a screening method to quantify triclosan in surface water and in wastewaters. After C18 solid-phase extraction, nanogram per liter concentrations were determined in effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants. The satisfactory recoveries achieved as well as the agreement between immunochemical and chromatographic methods (GC-MS) indicate its potential for either screening or laboratory quantification.

AB We evaluated the occurrence of three antibiotics (roxithromycin, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol) in surface water and effluents from several sewage treatment plants (STPs) on the Han River, Korea. In addition, standard acute toxicity tests were conducted using the microbe Vibrio fischeri, freshwater macroinvertebrates Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa, and fish (Oryzias latipes) for these antibiotics. Antibiotics were more frequently detected at higher amounts in effluent samples and in samples collected during the low-flow season. For trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, the levels observed in surface water during low flow were, on average, 108 and 31 ng/L, respectively. These levels were comparable to those measured in the municipal effluents (average, 80 and 37 ng/L, respectively), suggesting the presence of other sources upstream (e.g., livestock wastes). For roxithromycin, surface water levels were approximately an order of magnitude lower than effluent levels. Adverse effects of roxithromycin, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol were observed at mg/L levels in standard acute aquatic ecotoxicity tests. Based on hazard quotients calculated for the three antibiotics, minimal risks to aquatic, systems are suggested. To further increase scientific understanding about the potential impacts of these pharmaceuticals in the environment, however, chronic ecotoxicology studies, with more subtle but ecologically meaningful end points or in combination with other mechanistically related contaminants, may be beneficial.

AB Wastewaters from fossil fuel refining, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides are the main sources of phenolic compounds. Those with more complex structures are often more toxic than the simple phenol, and yet little is known about the treatment of wastewater containing a mixture of phenolic pollutants.. The present study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of UASB and SBR for the treatment of mixtures of phenolics compounds.
   The experiments were conducted in a laboratory scale UASB reactor, which had a volume of 1.414 I. A gas-liquid solid separator, GLSS was provided at the top of the reactor. The reactor was operated at constant HRT of 24 h throughout the study. The reactor was seeded with digested sewage sludge obtained from Okhla Sewage Treatment Plant, New Delhi, India. Initially the microbial culture was acclimatized to phenol concentration of 600 mg l(-1) in UASB. Thereafter, different phenol: m-cresols ratio were introduced, 10:1, 4.5:1, 2.7:1, 1.75:1 and 1.2:1 and the performance of the reactor was evaluated under each case. The second experiment was conducted in a laboratory scale SBR reactor with a working volume of 1.4 I. The effluent was drawn from a volumetric exchange ratio of 50%. A fine bubble aerator in the bottom of the column was used to introduce air. The reactor was seeded with aerobic digested sludge obtained from Star Paper Mill, Saharanpur, UP, India. A constant HRT of 12h was kept throughout the study. Reactor was operated sequentially with fill, react, settle and draw periods for a cycle of 6h. In order to establish a viable biomass and minimize any potential toxic effects due to presence of phenolic compounds, the sludge was fed with phenol as batch culture up to 1000 mg l(-1) concentration. After acclimatization, different phenol: m cresol ratio were introduced 6.5:1, 2:1, 1.1:1, 0.5:1 and the performance of the reactor was evaluated under each case. A start up period of 40 days was required to acclimatize the anaerobic bacterial at HRT of 24 hrs for phenol concentration of 200 mg l(-1). UASB reactor successfully biodegraded phenol and m-cresol up to a maximum ratio (1.25:1) (300: 250 mg l(-1)) with 80% efficiency. A start up period of 30 days was required to acclimatize aerobic bacteria with phenol to concentration up to 1000 mg l(-1) as batch culture. The maximum phenol and m-cresol up to (1.1: 1) (800: 700 mg l(-1)) was successfully treated with efficiency of 95% in SBR. The results indicates that anaerobic treatment by UASB and aerobic treatment by SBR can be successfully used for phenol/cresol mixture, representative of major substrates in chemical and petrochemical wastewater and the results shows proper acclimatization period is essential for the degradation of m - cresol and phenol. Moreover, SBR was found as a better alternative than UASB reactor as it is more efficient and higher concentration of m cresols can be successfully degraded.

AB Dairy operations have the potential to elevate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in ground water, where it may interact with organic and inorganic contaminants, fuel denitrification, and may present problems for drinking water treatment. Total and percent bioavailable DOC and total and carbon-specific trihalomethane (THM) formation potential (TTHMFP and STHMFP, respectively) were determined for shallow ground water samples from beneath a dairy farm in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Sixteen wells influenced by specific land management areas were sampled over 3 yr. Measured DOC concentrations were significantly elevated over the background as measured at an upgradient monitoring well, ranging from 13 to 55 mg L(-1) in wells downgradient from wastewater ponds, 8 to 30 mg L(-1) in corral wells, 5 to 12 mg L(-1) in tile drains, and 4 to 15 mg L(-1) in wells associated with manured fields. These DOC concentrations were at the upper range or greatly exceeded concentrations in most sur e water bodies used as drinking water sources in California. DOC concentrations in individual wells varied by up to a factor of two over the duration of this study, indicating a dynamic system of sources and degradation. DOC bioavailability over 21 d ranged from 3 to 10%, comparable to surface water systems and demonstrating the potential for dairy-derived DOC to influence dissolved oxygen concentrations (Dearly all wells were hypoxic to anoxic) and denitrification. TTHMFP measurements across all management units ranged from 141 to 1731 mu g L(-1), well in excess of the maximum contaminant level of 80 mu g L(-1) established by the Environmental Protection Agency. STHMFP measurements demonstrated over twofold variation (-4 to -8 mmol total THM/mol DOC) across the management areas, indicating the dependence of reactivity on DOC composition. The results indicate that land management strongly controls the quantity and quality of DOC to reach shallow ground water and hence should be considered when managing ground water resources and in any efforts to mitigate contamination of ground water with carbon-based contaminants, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

ID POPULATION
AB Pharmaceuticals have been finding their way into our environment for a long time. The pharmaceutical compounds, after their final rounds of clinical trials, end up in the body, where finally they are excreted into treated wastewater, agricultural runoff, and biosolids and manure that are used as fertilizers. The compounds affect other living systems such as fishes, plants and aquatic life, showing drastic affects on their populations. Concentration-wise, pharmaceuticals represent just a small fraction of the thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Even though medications have been in the environment for as long as people have been taking them, it is only through the advent of advanced analytical instrumentation and techniques that scientists have been able to detect them in the wild.

AB Atenolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist ('beta-blocker') widely used for the treatment of angina, glaucoma related conditions. Since atenolol is not appreciably metabolized in humans, the parent compound is the predominant excretory product, and has been detected in sewage effluent discharges and surface waters. Consequently, atenolol has been chosen as a reference pharmaceutical for a European Union-funded research consortium, known as ERAPharm (http://www.erapharm.org), which focused on the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Here, we present data generated within this project from studies assessing population-relevant effects in a freshwater fish species. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as a standard OECD test species, embryo-larval development (early life stage or ELS) and short-term (21 d) adult reproduction studies were undertaken. In the ELS study, the 4 d embryo NOEChatching and LOEChatching values were 10 and > 10 mg/L, respectively, and after 28 d, NOECgrowth and LOECgrowth values were 3.2 and 10 mg/L, respectively (arithmetic mean measured atenolol concentrations were >90% of these nominal values). In the short-term reproduction study, NOECreproduction and LOECreproduction values were 10 and >10 mg/L, respectively (mean measured concentrations were 77-96% of nominal values), while the most sensitive endpoint was an increase in male fish condition index, giving NOECcondition index and LOECcondition index values of 1.0 and 3.2 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding measured plasma concentration of atenolol in these fish was 0.0518 mg/L. These data collectively suggest that atenolol has low chronic toxicity to fish under the conditions described, particularly considering the low environmental concentrations reported. These data also allowed the assessment of two theoretical approaches proposed as predictors of the environmental impact of human pharmaceuticals: the Huggett 'mammalian-fish leverage model'; and the acute:chronic ratio (ACR). The Huggett model gave a measured human: fish effect ratio (ER) of 19.3 for atenolol, which compared well with the predicted ER of 40.98. Moreover, for an ER of 19.3, the model suggests that chronic testing may be warranted, and from our resultant effects data, atenolol does not cause significant chronic effects in fathead minnow at environmentally realistic concentrations. The calculated ACR for atenolol is >31.25, which is far lower than that of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and other potent steroidal oestrogens, thus further supporting the observed low toxicity. The data produced for atenolol here fit well with both approaches, but also highlight the importance of generating 'real' experimental data with which to calibrate and validate such models.

AB The growth and composition of microorganisms found in a municipal wastewater treatment plant were investigated in the presence of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) [ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and clofibric acid] in batch reactors at varying organic loadings. Overall, the data suggest that microbial growth inhibition was correlated to organic loading rather than PhAC concentration. Significant inhibition ranging from 34 to 43% was observed under the lowest organic loading for all PhACs other than clofibric acid. No inhibition was observed at the highest organic loading. Higher microbial inhibition was not observed with increased PhAC concentration for a given organic loading. These results indicate that the presence of PhAC may affect microbial growth especially under lower organic loading conditions. Further validation is require with additional PhACs, organic substrates, and a wider loading range. In addition, significant microbial shifts were observed in the presence of ketoprofen and naproxen. These data suggest that, in addition to their effect on overall microbial growth, PhACs may affect the microbial ecology and additional research should be carried out to identify PhACs that have the potential of affecting ecologically important microorganisms in wastewater treatment processes and aquatic environments in general.

AB Fluoxetine is a biologically active pharmaceutical chemical that has been detected at parts-per-trillion levels in surface waters in North America and Europe. This has generated concern because negative effects in aquatic organisms are possible. Known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (e.g., Prozac; Elli Lilly) is neurologically active and widely prescribed for clinical depression in humans. In the present investigation, acute and chronic toxicities of fluoxetine were evaluated in an environmentally relevant species, western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis. Acute toxicity (5 to 5340 ppb fluoxetine) was assessed in neonates (age 24 to 48 hours) exposed in glass aquaria for 7 days; chronic toxicity (0.05 to 5 ppb fluoxetine) was examined in fish exposed from age neonate to age 91 days; and effects of chronic exposure (100 days) on sexual maturation was investigated in mesocosm tanks (100 L) in fish exposed (7 to 71 ppb) from age 59 to 159 days. Acute toxicity of fluoxetine in neonate western mosquitofish was observed to have a 7-day median lethal concentration of 546 ppb. Chronic exposure did not affect survival, growth, or sex ratio; however, increased lethargy in fish exposed to >= 0.5 ppb fluoxetine was observed. In fish exposed from age 59 to 159 days (juvenile to adult life stages), delayed development of external adult sexual morphology was observed at 71 ppb fluoxetine, which consisted of delayed onset of the presence of the black spot in the posterior abdomen in female fish and delayed formation of the elongated anal fin (gonopodium) in male fish. The present study demonstrated that chronic exposure of western mosquitofish to fluoxetine can affect sexual development; however, it does so only at concentrations 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those previously found in the environment.

AB Three wastewater samples from a pharmaceutical plant formulating medical ointments were subjected to lab-scale treatment by a Fenton-like system in combination with lime coagulation. All samples were plant pre-treated by adsorption/flocculation/filtration processes with utilization of bentonite, but-the quality of effluents did not comply with the regulations for wastewater discharged to local sewerage. The optimization of Fenton-like oxidation demonstrated the highest process efficacy at H2O2/COD weight ratio of 2: 1, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 10: 1 and 2 It of treatment time. The fast pH decrease to acidic values similar to 3 during first min of oxidation for all effluents suggested that pH adjustment was unnecessary. Combination of Fe(III) precipitation and lime coagulation proved feasible to improve considerably COD and residual iron concentration reduction in pharmaceutical effluents. Additionally, considerable BOD7 reduction and BOD7/COD ratio improvement of pharmaceutical wastewater samples was achieved by combined treatment. The application of Fenton-like oxidation with subsequent iron (III)/lime coagulation did not only enhance the quality of pharmaceutical effluents with different chemical characteristics and help to meet the requirements for wastewater discharged to sewage, but also improve the biodegradability of pharmaceutical effluents.

AB The occurrence of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) was investigated in the six sewage treatment plants (STPs) of Beijing, China. Of the 13 objective antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine and sulfamethizol were detected in the influents with the average concentrations of 1.2 +/- 0.45, 0.29 +/- 0.25, 0.048 +/- 0.012, 0.35 +/- 0.52 and 0.33 +/- 0.21 mu g center dot L-1, respectively, and those in the effluents were 1.4 +/- 0.74, 0.22 +/- 0.19, 0.021 +/- 0.008, 0.22 +/- 0.21and 0.01 +/- 0 mu g center dot L-1, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole was the predominant compound detected, and was found in all wastewater samples with the other two compounds sulfapyridine and sulfamerazine. It should be noted that sulfadiazine was first reported in wastewaters, and the concentration levels of all detected compounds except for sulfamethizol (detected once in the effluent samples) in the influents were observed to be similar to those in the effluents. From the data in this study, it can be found that sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine and sulfadiazine could be partly removed in anoxic and aerobic treatment unit and vice versa in anaerobic process, which led to their low or even negative removal rates in the effluents. The increase on the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine in the effluents was found probably due to the biotransformation of their acetylated forms in anaerobic treatment unit. In addition, it was observed that the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine could partly occur during the anoxic and aerobic process, while sulfamerazine was partly eliminated in the anaerobic and anoxic units.

AB A comprehensive gas chromatographic-high-resolution mass spectrometric (GC-HRMS)-based method was developed that permitted the simultaneous determination of 30 estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and related compounds. including surfactants, biogenic and synthetic steroids, fecal sterols, phytoestrogens, and plasticizers, in wastewater. Features of the method include low sample volume (similar to 40 ml), optimized Florisil(R) cleanup to minimize matrix interferences and optimized analyte derivatization to improve sensitivity via GC-HRMS. Detection limits were in the low- to mid-ng/L range, and recoveries were greater than 60% for most target analytes. This new method allows for high throughput analysis of many organic wastewater contaminants in a complex matrix with relative standard deviation of less than 15% for most measurable compounds. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by examining wastewater samples from different origins. Compounds such as di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, cholesterol, cholestanol, and other cholesterol derivatives were measured in much higher concentrations in untreated sewage and were reduced substantially in concentration by the treatment process. However, steroidal compounds, particularly estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), as well as plant sterols (except stigmastanol), were greater in the treated municipal wastewater versus the untreated effluent. Plant and fungi sterols, stigmastanol and ergosterol, were found largely associated with bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME) as compared to the municipal effluents.

AB Despite concerns about potential risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment, few toxicological data address the effects of these compounds. In aquatic systems, which often represent the final repository for PPCPs, increasing toxicological information regarding aquatic biota is improving our capacity to assess potential risks. However, responses of key biota, such as benthic invertebrates, have not been investigated as widely. In the present study, we examined the toxicity of four PPCPs-the lipid regulator atorvastatin (ATO), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ), the synthetic hormone]17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS)-to the midge Chironolnus tentans and the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca in 10-d waterborne exposures. The toxicity of the four compounds varied between 0.20 and 47.3 mg/L (median lethal concentration), with a relative toxicity ranking of TCS > EE(2) > ATO > CBZ. Hyalella azteca was more sensitive than C. tentans to these compounds. The toxicity data were used in a hazard quotient approach to evaluate the risk posed by the four PPCPs to benthic invertebrates and other aquatic organisms. For each compound, a hazard quotient was calculated by dividing the lowest toxicity value by the highest exposure value found in the literature, to which an uncertainty factor was applied. With hazard quotients of 3.55 to 11.5, we conclude that potential risks exist toward benthic invertebrates for the toxicity of TCS and CBZ and that further investigations of these compounds are required to characterize more completely the risks to benthic organisms. In contrast, our data also indicate that considering the low concentrations currently detected in the environment, ATO and EE2 pose negligible risks to benthic invertebrates.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. Our study focuses on the indication of anthropogenic impacts on the urban surface and groundwater in large cities, demonstrated for the cities of Halle/Saale and Leipzig (Germany). For the study we selected indicator substances such as xenobiotics, trace elements, and stable isotopes which are connected to human activities in urban areas. The xenobiotics reported here are the pharmaceutical carbamacepine, the polycylic musk compounds galaxolide and tonalide, the life style product caffeine, and industrial chemicals such as bisphenol A and t-nonylphenol. The investigated xenobiotics pose largely unknown risks to human health and the aquatic ecosystem. Trace elements are represented by the rare earth element gadolinium (Gd), used as magnetic resonance imaging contrast substance. Nitrogen isotopes in dissolved nitrate characterize the origin of nitrogen compounds, mixing and reaction processes.
   Methodology. River water was sampled along the flow path of the rivers Saale and Weisse Elster through the city of Halle/Saale, the rivers Luppe and Weisse Elster through the city of Leipzig. Separate samples were collected from the effluent of the local waste water treatment plants. Groundwater from Quaternary plain aquifers along the rivers and from different urban locations was collected at the same time. The indicators were analysed and assessed according to their sources, concentration and distribution patterns.
   Results and Discussion. Based on the nitrogen isotopic signature, dissolved nitrate in river water of the Saale was referred mainly to two sources: the effluent of the water treatment plant and a mixture of diffusive inputs from rain water channels, sewage leakages and agriculture activities along the rivers. The Gd anomaly was recognized in surface water of both cities, particularly in the effluent of the water treatment plants, but clearly attenuated in groundwater. We measured concentrations of xenobiotics in river and sewer water between 10 and 60,000 ng L-1, and, in groundwater, one order of magnitude lower. Distinctions of xenobiotic patterns were found in river water before and after the effluent of treated waste water into the rivers. Degradation of endocrine disrupters and fragrances, but also persistence of carbamacepine were recognized as essential processes during waste water treatment. At the study site Halle/Saale, mass balances were set up for xenobiotics and water fluxes.
   Conclusions. At both sites, we demonstrated that indicators such as xenobiotics, gadolinium, and nitrogen isotopes are suitable for assessing anthropogenic impacts on urban water. However, the behaviour of these indicators in surface and groundwater has to be considered according to the different geochemical environments.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in treated wastewater is gaining attention due to their potential environmental impact. An analytical method was developed to quantify estrogen compounds in samples from a concentrated wastewater matrix typical of water recycling systems used in space. The method employed conventional HPLC with UV detection. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to isolate the compounds of interest from wastewater. Spike-recovery tests in clean and wastewater matrices were used to test the extraction process. The results of these experiments suggest that deconjugation is the most predominant reaction occurring in the systems, as effluent concentrations of free estrogens typically exceeded influent concentrations. Despite the long retention times of the system or the near infinite solids retention time, free estrogens were not removed from graywater representative of space waste streams. For a closed-loop wastewater treatment system, these compounds may accumulate to levels requiring other removal mechanisms (i.e., reverse osmosis).

AB The aim of this work is to evaluate and compare the degradation achieved for three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by heterogeneous TiO2 photocatalytic means in aqueous solution at laboratory scale. The selected pharmaceutical compounds were diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP). These compounds were used in their sodium salt chemical form.
   Previous experiments (adsorption, photolysis and thermodegradation) were developed to evaluate non-catalytic degradation for each NSAID. Photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a Xe-lamp reactor in order to study the influences of different operational conditions (catalyst load, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration). These results showed that the optimum amount Of TiO2, to achieve maximum degradation, of IBP was 1 g/L. In contrast, the maximum degradation for DCF or NPX was observed at a TiO2 loading of 0.1 g/L. Temperature had a significant effect only for NPX degradation, achieving almost 99% phototransformation. No significant differences were observed for DCF and IBP at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen concentration was an important parameter to increase the degradation for NPX and IBP. However, it was observed that its rate of mineralization did not increase. Intermediate metabolites were detected in all cases. Hydroxyl metabolites were the most important residual compounds after the photocatalytic treatment of IBP. The inhibition percentage of bioluminescence from Vibro fischeri-as a toxicity parameter-increased during the irradiation time due to the residual concentration of the hydroxyl metabolites generated. However, after 120 min, in experiments with 40 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, a decrease of the % inhibition was observed. Only photocatalytic treatment of IBP drives to a satisfactory biodegradability index BOD5/COD (between 0.16 and 0.42) and, only in this case, a post-biological treatment could be suggested.

AB The mass emission rate of 12 pollutants from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) secondary effluent into a small tributary of the River Besos (northeastern Spain) was determined. The pollutants tested included pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and herbicides. Furthermore, a 1-ha surface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) was evaluated for pollution removal. Whereas the low concentration values (ngL(-1)) of PPCP discharge into the tributary was comparable to inter- and intra-campaigns, herbicides and a veterinary drug (flunixin) exhibited a high variability in concentrations (mu gL(-1)). Moreover, removal efficiencies were often higher than 90% for all compounds, with the exception of carbamazepine and clofibric acid (ca. 30-47%). As expected, a seasonal trend of pollutant removal in the wetland was observed for compounds with low biodegradation and moderate photodegradation rates (i.e. naproxen and diclofenac).

AB It is now well established that residues from therapeutic drugs consumed by humans can end up, through the sewage system, in the surface water of populated areas. Given that the global production of major illicit drugs is comparable to that of widely used pharmaceuticals, we tested for the presence of drugs of abuse (cocaine, opioids, amphetamines and cannabis derivatives), some related opioid pharmaceuticals (codeine and methadone) and or their metabolites in Italian and British surface waters. Having identified residues of all major drugs abuse in raw and treated urban wastewater, we now measured their levels in several rivers and lakes by a selective multi-residue assay based on liquid chromatography-tandern mass spectrometry.
   Recoveries in surface water were generally higher than 80%, with overall variability of the method lower than 10%. LODs were generally lower than 0.2 ng/L, and LOQs were lower than 0.6 ng/L, with few exceptions. Many of the tested substances were found in both rivers and lakes, at concentrations ranging from high pg/L to high ng/L, with loads in rivers in the range of tenths to hundreds of grams per day. our data indicate that residues of drugs of abuse have become widespread surface water contaminants in populated areas. Since most of these residues still have potent pharmacological activities, their presence in the aquatic environment may have potential implications for human health and wildlife.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are widely used and can reach surface waters, where they have the potential to exert biological effects on aquatic non-target organisms. Due to the high number of pharmaceutical drugs used in human medicine throughout the world, it is necessary to select the pharmaceuticals to search for, prior to implementing any environmental measurements and any extensive environmental risk assessment (ERA). This paper describes a methodology developed in order to define this selection. The prioritization scheme consists in three tiers. First, a preliminary classification based on the assessment of exposure is implemented. This exposure assessment is determined by calculating predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for each pharmaceutical according to the European Medicine Evaluation Agency's (EMEAs) environmental risk assessment guidelines [EMEA, 2006. European Medicine Agency Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.].
   In the second step, the preliminary classification is reviewed on a case-by-case hypothesis basis using all the biological data available: ecotoxicological, pharmacological (mechanism of action (MoA), enzyme modulation, adverse effects) and physicochemical data (log K-ow).
   Finally, an additional step is used to select priority compounds among molecules showing the same chemical structure and the same mechanism of action.
   We applied this methodology to the French situation and prioritized 120 parent molecules and 30 metabolites. The final prioritization list gathers 40 parent compounds and 14 metabolites. Among the 40 parent molecules, 21 have already been found in the aquatic environment, indicating a good agreement between the theoretical approach and the environmental measurements. Parameters used to construct the effect criteria are discussed for their relevance.

AB Pharmaceuticals previously identified in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Montreal discharging into the St. Lawrence river, were tested for acute and chronic toxicity using the cnidarian Hydra attenuata. Acute toxicity was based on the established technique looking at morphological changes in the Hydra, while recently developed endpoints of feeding behaviour, attachment and growth (hydranth number) were used to measure chronic effects. The compounds under investigation (ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, trimethoprim and caffeine) were tested individually in controlled laboratory exposures with LC50 and EC50 results calculated. All compounds tested had relatively high LC50 values with gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen having the lowest at 22.36 mg/L and EC50 values based on morphology of 1.18 to 2.62 mg/L (all concentrations are nominal). The EC50 values based on feeding were similar to those based on morphology but with increased sensitivity for carbamazepine, bezafibrate and novobiocin. A trend of a reduction in feeding with deterioration in morphology was observed in the Hydra, with the exception of novobiocin, where a lower than expected EC50 of 13.53 mg/L was found with no negative effect on morphology. Significant reductions in attachment and hydranth number were seen at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/L for gemfibrozil and ibuprofen respectively. A toxicity threshold (TT) of 320 mu g/L was calculated for ibuprofen, only a factor of 102 or 10 higher than the concentration found in the effluent in the present study (1.19 mu g/L) and in other Canadian effluents studied (22 mu g/L [Brun GL, Bernier M, Losier R, Doe K, Jackman P, Lee HB, Pharmaceutically active compounds in Atlantic Canadian sewage treatment plant effluents and receiving waters and potential for environmental effects as measured by acute and chronic aquatic toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2006; 25(8): 2163-2176.] respectively. Using EU directive 93/67/EEC the pharmaceuticals under investigation can be classified as toxic (gemibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen), harmful (carbamazepine, bezafibrate, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline and novobiocin) and non-toxic (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and caffeine) and their potential toxicity for the aquatic environment is discussed.

AB In order to help prioritize future research efforts within the US, risks associated with exposure to human prescription pharmaceutical residues in wastewater were estimated from marketing and pharmacological data. Masses of 371 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) dispensed in the US in 2004 were estimated from marketing data, and then divided by therapeutic dose rate to normalize for potency. Metabolic inactivation of the 50 most dispensed APIs was estimated from published data, and active metabolites were tabulated. Comparing maximum likely average wastewater concentrations of API-associated activity to exposure rates that produce therapeutic effects in humans suggests that the threat to healthy human adults from aquatic exposure is low, even when likely mixture effects are considered. Comparing predicted wastewater concentrations to human therapeutic plasma concentrations suggests that some APIs may be present at sufficient concentrations to affect organisms which eliminate them inefficiently. Comparing predicted antimicrobial concentrations to published minimum inhibitory concentrations suggests that antibacterial APIs in wastewater, but probably not antifungal APIs, may select for low-level antimicrobial resistance. The taxonomic distribution of molecular targets of the 50 most dispensed APIs suggests that potential effects of some APIs are likely restricted to vertebrates, while other APIs can probably affect many eukaryotic and prokaryotic clades.

AB Phenolic compounds in wastewaters are difficult to treat using the conventional biological techniques such as activated sludge processes because of their bio-toxic and recalcitrant properties and the high volumes released from various chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. In the current work, a modified heterogeneous advanced Fenton process (AFP) is presented as a novel methodology for the treatment of phenolic wastewater. The modified AFP, which is a combination of hydrodynamic cavitation generated using a liquid whistle reactor and the AFP is a promising technology for wastewaters containing high organic content. The presence of hydrodynamic cavitation in the treatment scheme intensifies the Fenton process by generation of additional free radicals. Also, the turbulence produced during the hydrodynamic cavitation process increases the mass transfer rates as well as providing better contact between the pseudo-catalyst surfaces and the reactants.
   A multivariate design of experiments has been used to ascertain the influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage and iron catalyst loadings on the oxidation performance of the modified AFP. High er TOC removal rates were achieved with increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, the effect of catalyst loadings was less important on the TOC removal rate under conditions used in this work although there is an optimum value of this parameter. The concentration of iron species in the reaction solution was measured at 105 min and its relationship with the catalyst loadings and hydrogen peroxide level is presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are detected in natural waters at high concentrations relative to other pharmaceuticals due to extensive use in medical diagnostics and high recalcitrance during conventional wastewater treatment. This study examines, for the first time, reductive treatment of ICM in water with hydrogen gas in combination with supported palladium and porous nickel catalysts. Kinetic experiments demonstrate rapid and complete hydrodehalogenation of both ionic (diatrizoate) and neutral (iopromide) ICM. Reaction rates in batch systems (continuous mixing, PH2 = 0.1 MPa, 25 C) appear to be surface-reaction controlled and are dependent upon catalyst identity (e.g., 5 wt % versus 1 wt % Pd/ Al2O3) as well as the concentration of ICM and catalyst. Reaction rates are not markedly affected by ICM structure, pH, or by the presence of many common ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, F-, CI-, Br-, ClO4-, SO42-, HCO3-, and NO3-). In contrast, elevated concentrations of iodide, (bi)sulfide, and dissolved organic matter inhibit hydrodehalogenation of ICM. However, catalyst activity can be regained by washing the catalyst (e.g., with water, NaOCl, or alkaline solution). Catalytic reduction of ICM present in treated wastewater effluent is slower than in deionized water, but similar reaction rates are observed when the effluent is pretreated to reduce the level of dissolved organic matter. The high selectivity of reductive catalytic treatment processes suggest that this is a promising strategy for targeted treatment of ICM present in mixed waste streams and natural water matrices containing much higher concentrations of nontarget Constituents.

AB Organic wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, caffeine, and nicotine, have received increased scrutiny because of their detection in water bodies receiving wastewater discharge. Despite recent measurement in United States streams, caffeine's effect on freshwater organisms is not well documented. The present study measured caffeine's lethal and sublethal effects on the freshwater species, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Pimephales promelas, and Chironomus dilutus. These organisms, which are used in standard testing or effluent monitoring, were exposed to aqueous caffeine solutions under static exposure for 48 hours and daily renewed static exposure for 7 days. Averaged responses of 48-hour acute end points indicated that C. dubia was more sensitive to caffeine exposures (LC50 = 60 mg/L) than either P. promelas (LC50 = 100 mg/L) or C. dilutus (LC50 = 1,230 mg/L). Exposure-response slopes confirmed these findings (3% mortality/mg/L for C. dubia; 0.5% mortality/mg/L for P. promelas; and 0.07% mortality/mg/L for C. dilutus). Comparative 7-day responses between C. dubia and P. promelas (LC50 = 46 and 55 mg/L, respectively) were more similar than the broad range of acute values. Sublethal effects measured for caffeine exposure included impaired C. dubia reproduction (IC50 = 44 mg/L) and inhibited P. promelas growth (IC50 = 71 mg/L). According to the results of this study, combined with earlier studies reporting environmental concentrations and product half-lives, caffeine should pose negligible risk for most aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate organisms.

AB The polycyclic musk fragrances AHTN (Tonalide) and HHCB (Galaxolide) are the most common components of cosmetics and detergents. Use of AHTN and HHCB per year (in the USA and in EU) was estimated at 1500 Mg and 3800 Mg, respectively. Because of their persistent character, musk compounds are introduced into environment mostly via urban sewage treatment plant effluents. The aim of the presented research was to assess the receptivity of AHTN and HHCB to the oxidation by means of UV-radiation and in the UV/H2O2 process. The investigations were performed in the treated wastewater and the drinking water. After 8 minutes, in all experiments performed on drinking water, the degradations of AHTN and HHCB in the range of 99% were observed. The removal of HHCB from wastewater by means of UV radiation exceeded up 93% (after 8 minutes of the process), whereas the disappearance degree of this compound in wastewater, after only 3 minutes of UV/H2O2 process, exceeded 99%. The degradation constant rate for AHTN in drinking water using UV radiation was equal to 0.764 min(-1) when the degradation rate of HHCB was estimated at 0.634 min(-1). In the wastewater, the coefficient rate of HHCB degradation by means of UV/H2O2 was nearly 4.5 times higher (1.580 min(-1)) in comparison to tile value obtained by direct photolysis of HHCB (0.354 min(-1)).

AB The objective of this research was the development, optimization, and demonstration of an ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) based method for organic anthropogenic waste indicators (AWIs) with a range of physicochemical properties from soil and sediment samples. The optimized method was designed to be cost effective compared to existing extraction methods, which may require large quantities of consumables, produce substantial volumes of organic waste, or require costly instrumentation or equipment. Reagent grade sand, soil collected from the native grassland in proximity to Eastern Washington University (EWU), and sediment samples collected from the Spokane river were used as sample matrices during method development. These matrices were fortified with eight AWls of varying chemical properties that are representative of a variety of household, industrial, and agricultural sources. The recoveries of the AWls spiked onto these matrices were determined in the extracts using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). These values reflect the efficiency of the method for extraction of these analytes from representative environmental matrices. Recoveries ranged from 46.1% to 110% in the fortified soil and from 49.2% to 118.6% in the fortified sediment samples, which is comparable with existing methods for the study analytes. The optimized method was then used to quantify AWls in a biosolid-amended soil. Indole and p-cresol were detected in the biosolid-amended soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estrogenic activity of treated sewage effluents and receiving waters surfaced as an issue of general concern some 15 years ago. Since then, a large number of studies investigated the distribution and nature of the estrogenic substances in various aquatic ecosystems. Within NRP50, a five-year Swiss research programme on endocrine disruptors, four field studies were performed to characterize the presence of environmental estrogens in rivers and effluents. The estrogenic activity was quantified with a biological assay - the yeast estrogen screen. An overview of the sampling approaches and results of the various studies is presented here. In a first study, using grab sampling, it appeared that estrogenic activity in river water was highly variable. Average estrogenicity values did not correlate with sewage treatment works and/or river characteristics, e.g. effluent dilution factor. However, variability was not 'random' but clearly associated with river size, and possibly its discharge. A second study specifically addressed this issue of variability of estrogenicity. The study was conducted at a single effluent source and its receiving river. Variability of estrogenicity in the grab samples was again large but again not 'random'; some of the variability was explained by the time over which the effluent resided in the treatment process. In a third study it was explored if passive sampling would be a better way to assess average estrogenicity. Indeed, passive samplers identified sources of estrogens, and passive sampling data correlated well with both repeated grab sampling and bioaccumulation data. Subsequently, passive samplers were deployed across Switzerland in a fourth study. It involved 22 effluent discharges and the associated rivers. Data analysis of the last study is still ongoing, preliminary observations are discussed here. Although a lot could be learned from repeated grab sampling campaigns, it emerged that passive sampling is a very effective and appropriate technique to assess: i) effluent treatment efficiency, and ii) the chemical load of river water. For these reasons it is a valuable monitoring tool for water quality criteria assessments as well as for studies that aim to link exposure and effect. The passive samplers that are currently available not only target estrogenic substances, but many other polar organic compounds of concern, such as antibiotics (see NRP49), other pharmaceuticals and biocides.

Data originate from water samples collected in the time span from September 2003 to April 2005 at 25 sampling locations. The detection frequency for all compounds was about 90%. Mean concentration levels of organophosphates were 502 ng/L (TCPP), 276 ng/L (TBP), 183 ng/L (TBEP), 118 ng/L (TCEP), and 117 ng/L (TDCPP). The synthetic musk fragrances HHCB and ATHN were detected with mean concentrations of 141 and 46 ng/L, respectively. The variability of the concentration of all compounds was high with respect to space and time. The highest concentrations were observed in the Schwarzbach system characterized by the highest proportion of wastewater compared to the other river systems. Concentration levels of synthetic musk fragrances were significantly lower in summer times compared to winter times.

AB The prescribing and usage of medications (for both humans and domestic animals) have ramifications extending far beyond the traditional objectives of conventional medical care. The healthcare industry has an environmental footprint that includes the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications, residues of which can establish themselves as environmental pollutants. This occurs by a variety of routes, but primarily from excretion, bathing and disposal. Many parallels exist between healthcare and the protection and remediation of the environment, spanning the stages from symptomology and diagnosis to treatment. The critical role played by pharmacovigilance in healthcare has a counterpart with the ecological environment. The term ecopharmacovigilance has been used with respect to the unforeseen consequences APIs can have once they enter the environment. We propose that conventional phannacovigilance could be expanded to encompass environmental concerns - a concept we term pharmEcovigilance - as a way to unify the parallel but interconnected needs for protecting both human and ecological health.
   To convey the scope of a pharmEcovigilance programme, we provide an overview of the occurrence of APIs as environmental pollutants, their ramifications for human health and the environment and some of the ways in which their impact could be reduced or minimized. The major areas discussed include: (i) the routes by which APIs become contaminants in the environment; (ii) the hazards of leftover drugs as a result of stockpiling and from disposal to sewage, which can also eventually contribute to the contamination of drinking water; (iii) why drugs accumulate unused; and (iv) the benefits for humans and the environment that could accrue from reducing the accumulation of leftover drugs and the subsequent introduction of APIs into the environment.
   A broad spectrum of actions could be taken by prescribers (including veterinarians) and the healthcare industry at large (including manufacturers and insurers) to reduce the release or introduction of APIs to the environment. Most significantly, however, a major reason to consider implementing a pharmEcovigilance programme - beyond reducing the environmental footprint of healthcare - is the previously unforeseen collateral benefit in making further progress in optimizing the delivery, effectiveness, outcomes and cost of healthcare, as well as improving safety for humans, pets and wildlife.
   For this reason, the relationships that healthcare professionals and patients have with medications might also include consideration of pharmEcovigilance. Like any profession that deals with chemicals, perhaps a major challenge to be faced is how to ensure the sustainability (and minimize the life cycle exposure hazards) of a chemical-based, chemical-centric society in the most cost-effective and safest manner. Given that the medical community is a major source of numerous 'exotic' chemical pollutants in the environment (with thousands of chemically distinct APIs in current use), albeit at very low levels, an imperative could be created for designing and implementing approaches for reducing and controlling this source of pollution. With reduced wastage of medications, in part driven by appropriate or rational prescribing and dispensing, the ecological footprint of medicine could be greatly reduced, with concomitant improvements in many aspects of healthcare.

AB Crystal violet (CV) and leucocrystal violet (LCV) were found in the tissues of wild eels caught from surface waters under the influence of effluents discharged by municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). LCV was the dominant residue detected with total concentrations up to 6.7 mu g kg(-1) fresh weight in tissues of eels caught from lakes, rivers and a canal in Berlin, Germany. The occurrence of the residues found in 35 out of 45 samples could directly be linked to the presence of discharges by municipal STPs into the receiving surface waters. CV is a multiple-use compound that is also used as a biological stain and to colour materials such as textiles, paints and printing inks. Thus, it seems very likely that the residues of CV found in the eel samples originate from such uses and from legal uses of CV as a veterinary drug for the treatment of ornamental fish. The results obtained from this study are the first report of background contamination by CV found in samples of fish not intentionally treated with this agent. Although the residues of CV and LCV measured in the tissues of the eels were very low, an oral exposure to residues of CV or LCV should be avoided with regard to their mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. According to European Union law, zero tolerance applies to all residues of CV and LCV found in food for human consumption, as CV is not registered for use as a veterinary drug.

AB A feasible method has been optimized to simultaneously determine multiclass antibiotic residues, including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol in urban riverine water and wastewater by off-line solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array ultraviolet detector and a fluorescence detector. Internal standard and standard addition methods were used in combination to identify and quantify these antibiotics to compensate for the matrix interference. The method quantification limits (MQLs) were determined to be 0.035 to 0.100 mu g/L and 0.100 to 0.300 mu g/L for the riverine water and wastewater, respectively. Recoveries of the investigated antibiotics ranged from 63 to 126%. Sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently detected antibiotic residue in Guangzhou section of the Major Pearl River, South China, with a maximum level of 0.510 mu g/L. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were relatively less detected with a maximum level of 0.459 mu g/L. The maximum concentration of sulfamethoxazole reached 5.597 mu g/L in the raw wastewater from a large-scale sewage treatment plant in Guangzhou city. Around 30% of sulfamethoxazole might survive the primary clarification and biotreatment processes in the sewage treatment plant. None of the investigated antibiotics have been found above MQLs in the final effluent after chlorine disinfection.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and fate of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its related substances, 4-epi-oxytetracycline (EOTC), alpha-apo-oxytetracycline (alpha-apo-OTC), and beta-apo-oxytetracycline (beta-apo-OTC), in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) treating OTC production wastewater and a river receiving the effluent from the WWTP using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The percent removal of OTC in the WWTP was 38.0 +/- 10.5%, and the concentration of OTC was still up to 19.5 +/- 2.9 mg/L in the treated outflow. The concentration slightly decreased along the river, from 641 +/- 118 mu g/L at site R2 (discharging point) to 377 +/- 142 mu g/L at site R4 (similar to 20 km from site R2), which was still higher than the minimal inhibition concentration of OTC reported (similar to 250 mu g/L). On the other hand, the total amount of its related substances in the treated effluent was less than 5% of OTC. Concentrations of alpha-apo-OTC and beta-apo-OTC increased along the river, from 5.76 +/- 0.63 and 2.08 +/- 0.30 mu g/L at site R2 to 11.9 +/- 4.9 and 12.0 +/- 4.6 mu g/L at R4, respectively, although EOTC decreased from 31.5 +/- 3.8 to 12.9 +/- 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. The mean concentration of beta-apo-CTC in river sediments was 20.8 +/- 7.8 mg/kg, and its ratio to OTC was approximately 0.11, nearly twice the ratio of alpha-apo-OTC and EOTC to OTC (0.058 +/- 0.014 and 0.061 +/- 0.015, respectively).

AB To evaluate the quality of reclaimed water, the estrogenicity of effluent from a sewage treatment plant and of reclaimed water treated with coagulation-sedimentation-filtration using the effluent as raw water was assessed using vitellogenin (VTG) as a biomarker. After a three-week exposure, significant (p < 0.05) induction of VTG occurred in female crucian carp (Carassius carassius) exposed continuously to the secondary effluent and reclaimed water with different dilutions (12.5, 25, 50, and 100% for secondary effluent; 50 and 100% for reclaimed water); no induction of VTG was detected when exposed to 12.5 and 25% reclaimed water. For male fish, however, only 100% secondary effluent induced the production of VTG (mean +/- standard deviation, 38.6 +/- 9.8 mu g/ml). When the exposure time was prolonged to three months, VTG was induced significantly in both females and males at all gradient concentrations of secondary effluent and at 50 and 100% reclaimed water. The results indicated that no obvious VTG was detected in fish exposed to reclaimed water diluted more than fourfold. Ozonation of the secondary effluent under an ozone consumption dose of 8.5 mg/L resulted in a VTG level equal to that of 12.5% secondary effluent or 50% reclaimed water. Furthermore, VTG induction reflects the cumulative effects of estrogenic activity in the secondary effluent and reclaimed water compared with the in vitro assays, in which estrogenic activities in effluent changed markedly during the experiment.

AB In order to produce biodegradable products, four different synthetically prepared wastewaters containing cephalosporine (ceftriaxone sodium), penicillin (penicillin VK and amoxicillin) and quinolone (enrofloxacin) group antibiotics at typical concentrations encountered in pharmaceutical formulation effluent were pretreated by ozonation. BOD5/COD and SOUR (specific oxygen uptake rate) were the parameters for the assessment of biodegradability of ozonation products. The results of HPLC analysis indicated that the complete removal of each antibiotically active substance was achieved within the short time period of ozonation. Depending upon the type of antibiotic in the synthetic wastewater. 65-81 % COD and 20-98% aromaticity (UV254) removals were obtained, with a 2960 mg/L.h ozone dosage applied at pH 7 (CODi = 900 mg/L). Ozonation brought about a rise in the BOD5/COD ratio of enrofloxacin-containing wastewater from an initial value of 0.02 to a maximum of 0.33. and this ratio was increased from 0 to 0.07, 0.28 and 0.42, for ceftriaxone sodium, penicillin VK and amoxicillin-containing wastewaters, respectively.

AB Antibiotics used in both human and veterinary medicine make an important group of drugs. However. the use of these compounds causes their expansion into the environment, where there accumulate and develop their resistance. It is documented that they block biological processes in wastewater treatment plants. They also affect natural ecosystems and may concentrate in food chain.
   Sulfonamides (widely known as "sulfa drugs") were the first antimicrobial drugs used in medicine. They are derivates of p-aminobenzenesulfonamide and are used as antimicrobial drugs in both veterinary and human medicine. A large number of human and animal infectious diseases is treated by these compounds.
   The analysis of sulfonamides is highly influenced by their properties, mainly by their insolubility in water, ethanol, ether and dichloromethane.
   The samples were collected from the municipal and veterinary wastewater treatment plants in Brno, the Czech Republic. The simple extraction method for sulfonamides (sulfathiazole) in wastewater has been developed. Sulfathiazole was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethylacetate and evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The evaporation residues were dissolved in methanol and mobile phase. The mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water was used as the mobile phase. The samples were filtered into the amber glass vials through membrane filters. The HPLC instrument equipped with a diode array detector was used to perform the sample analysis.
   The concentration levels of sulfathiazole in real samples are discussed in this paper.

AB Low levels of pharmaceuticals have been detected in many countries in surface waters. As a wide range of pharmaceuticals can reach aquatic environments, a selection of molecules to survey is the first step before implementing a monitoring program. We used a simple equation to calculate Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs), adapted from the European Medicine Agency model used for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of human pharmaceutical. Excretion fractions for pharmaceuticals were determined for 76 compounds. Using year 2004 French drug consumption data, we determined aquatic PECs for 112 parent molecules and several metabolites. Considering excretion fractions of pharmaceuticals can lead to drastically reduce predicted concentrations reaching the aquatic environment and help to target environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and metabolites. Calculated PECs using the described methodology are consistent with French field measurements. The simple model for calculating PECs can be used as a valuable estimation of the exposure. Risk quotient ratios were also calculated. Due to the lack of ecotoxicological data, the use of PEC/PNEC ratios is not enough informative to prioritize pharmaceuticals likely to pose a risk for surface waters. Alternative ways to prioritize risk to pharmaceuticals, combining PEC, pharmacological, and ecotoxicological data available from the literature, should be implemented.

AB Facing the increase of environmental concern in the water treatment field, stakeholders need reliable decision support tools to assess environmental performances of urban and industrial wastewater systems. To discuss how life cycle assessment (LCA) can be applied to wastewater treatment projects, such an assessment has been performed through a case study on a full-scale plant. Methodological issues that had to be dealt with are briefly exposed. Five life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods have been used: CML 2000, Eco Indicator 99, EDIP 96, EPS and Ecopoints 97. Consistent assessment between these methods has been obtained for greenhouse effect, resources depletion and acidification. Eutrophication is correctly estimated if one looks at the potential impact of a treatment scenario but not at the characterization of the eutrophication state of a specific receiving stream. Work is needed concerning human toxicity as large discrepancies are noticed between the impact assessment methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is an increasing need to monitor concentrations of polar organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Integrative passive samplers can be used to assess time weighted average aqueous concentrations, provided calibration data are available and sampling rates are known. The sampling rate depends on environmental factors, such as temperature and water flow rate. Here we introduce an apparatus to investigate the sampling properties of passive samplers using river-like flow conditions and ambient environmental matrices: river water and treated sewage effluent. As a model sampler we selected Empore (TM) SDB-RPS disks in a Chemcatcher housing. The disks were exposed for I to 8 days at flow rates between 0.03 and 0.4 m s(-1). Samples were analysed using a bioassay for estrogenic activity and by LC-MS-NIS target analysis of the pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and clarithromycin. In order to assess sampling rates of SDB disks, we also measured aqueous concentrations of the pharmaceuticals. Sampling rates increased with increasing flow rate and this relationship was not affected by the environmental matrix. However, SDB disks were only sampling in the integrative mode at low flow rates < 0.1 m s(-1) and/or for short sampling times. The duration of linear uptake was particularly short for sulfamethoxazole (1 day) and longer for clarithromycin (5 days). At 0.03 m s(-1) and 12-14 degrees C, the sampling rate of SDB disks was 0.09 L day(-1) for clarithromycin, 0.14 L day(-1) for sulfamethoxazole and 0.25 L day(-1) for carbamazepine. The results show that under controlled conditions, SDB disks can be effectively used as passive sampling devices.

AB An analytical method to determine a selection of 27 frequently prescribed and consumed pharmaceuticals in biosolid enriched soils and digested sludges is presented. Using a combination of pressurized liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, it was possible to detect all analytes in each sample type at the low-sub ng g(-1) level. Solid phase extraction efficiencies were compared for 6 different sorbent types and it was found that Waters Oasis HLB cartridges offered enhanced selectivities with 20 analytes showing final method recoveries >= 60% in both soils and digested sludges. The method was validated for linearity, range, precision and limits of detection in both sample matrices. All analytes were then determined in sludge enriched soils as well as the precursor thermally dried sludge fertilizer produced from a primary wastewater treatment plant. Levels of the antibacterial agent triclosan were found to exceed 20 mu g g(-1) in digested sludge and 5 mu g g(-1) in thermally dried sludge cake. Significant traces of carbamazepine and warfarin were also detected in the above samples.

AB A simple on-line method was developed for the analysis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and some metabolites in drinking, surface and wastewater samples. The technique is based on the use of on-line solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization (LC-ESI(PI)-MS/MS). The injection of only 1 mL of filtered water sample is used with a total analysis time of 20 min, including the period required to flush the SPE cartridge with organic solvent and reconditioning the LC column. Method detection limits were in the range of 2 to 24 ng L-1 for the compounds of interest, with recoveries from 87 to 110% in surface as well as wastewater samples. Matrix effects were observed for some compounds without exceeding more than 25%. All results displayed a good degree of reproducibility, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 12% for all compounds. Moreover, at least 200 samples were analyzed without altering the performance of the pre-concentration column. This method was preferred over traditional off-line procedures because it minimizes tedious sample preparation, increases productivity and sample throughput. The analysis of various water and wastewater samples showed that caffeine, carbamazepine and atrazine could be detected in all the samples analysed and the selected compounds are always present in at least one of the sample types.

AB We propose and evaluate a mode-of-action based test battery of low-complexity and in-vitro bioassays that can be used as a routine monitoring tool for sewage treatment efficiency and water quality assessment. The test battery comprises five bioassays covering five different modes of toxic action. The bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri and a growth rate inhibition test with the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are measures of non-specific integrative effects. A second endpoint in the algae test, the specific inhibition of the efficiency of photosynthesis, gives an account of the presence of herbicides. An enzymatic assay covers an important aspect of insecticidal activity, the inhibition of the acetylcholine esterase activity. Estrogenic effects are assessed with the yeast estrogen screen (YES) and genotoxicity with the umuC test. Three field studies, each lasting six to seven consecutive days, were undertaken at a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Switzerland. Samples were collected in summer and late autumn, under dry and rainy conditions. None of the bioassays gave positive results with raw water in whole effluent toxicity testing. Therefore, water samples from various sites during wastewater treatment and from surface water were enriched with solid-phase extraction. The focus was on non-volatile compounds of average to moderate hydrophobicity, a range that includes most pesticides, biocides and pharmaceuticals. Various polar solid phases were evaluated for their extraction efficiency, disturbance by matrix components and overall performance. We finally selected a mixture of a polymeric sorbent and a C18-sorbent, Lichrolut EN and RP-18 or, alternatively, Empore(TM) SDB-RPS disks. All bioassays gave clear and robust responses with the SPE extracts. With the bioassay data the treatment efficiency of the STP can be assessed with respect to different modes of toxic action and accordingly different groups of micropollutants. Furthermore, the data allowed for a comparison between the effluent and the receiving river. In all bioassays the primary effluent had a strong effect and this effect was reduced after passing the STP. Treatment efficiency was high (typically over 90%) but varied from bioassay to bioassay, which is expected because each bioassay detects different types of micropollutants and therefore we cannot expect a common answer.

TI Pharmaceutical residues in the river Rhine - results of a one-decade
   monitoring programme
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
LA English
DT Article
ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; TREATMENT-PLANT; WATER; FATE
AB In this paper, results of an extensive monitoring programme for pharmaceutical residues in the river Rhine are presented. For one decade (1997 until 2006), the occurrence of widely used human pharmaceuticals like analgesics, lipid regulators, antiepileptics and others has been studied at four locations along the river Rhine. The results of more than 500 analyses clearly prove that compounds such as carbamazepine or diclofenac are regularly found in the river Rhine in concentrations up to several hundred ng per litre. Combining concentration levels with data on water flow enables the calculation of transports, which e. g. for carbamazepine or diclofenac were in the range of several tons per year. The evaluation of the long-term monitoring data shows that only a slight decrease in concentration levels as well as in annual transports can be observed and thus the contamination of the river Rhine by pharmaceutical residues during the last decade has to be regarded as almost constant. Seasonal variations can be detected for bezafibrate, diclofenac and ibuprofen, for which the concentrations are much lower in the summer months. A more effective removal during wastewater treatment in the warmer periods of the year seems to be the major reason for those variations. For carbamazepine, no comparable seasonal effect can be found.

AB We examined the effects of tetracycline (TET) addition on the function of mesocosms representing aerated and unaerated septic system leachfields. Replicate mesocosms (n = 3) were filled with soil and either vented to a leachfield (LEACH) or aerated intermittently to maintain an O(2) level of similar to 0.21 mol mol(-1) (AIR). All mesocosms were dosed every 6 h for 10 d with 3 cm of domestic wastewater amended with 5 mg TET L(-1). Water quality parameters, headspace gas composition, and soil properties were measured prior to and during the dosing period, and for 42 days after the last antibiotic dose. No significant effect of TET was observed on the pH, level of dissolved O(2) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in drainage water from either treatment. In contrast, levels of Fe(2+) and SO(4) in drainage water from LEACH mesocosms decreased in response to TET dosing, with lower levels persisting until Day 52. Persistent increases were observed in the level of NO(3) in drainage water from AIR lysimeters and in NH(4) in LEACH mesocosms in response to TET additions. Removal of total P and DOC were unaffected by TET dosing in either treatment. Nitrogen removal in AIR mesocosms decreased during the TET dosing period, returning to pre-dosing values by Day 52. In contrast, TN removal in LEACH mesocosms increased during TET dosing, returning to pre-dosing values by Day 52. The composition of headspace gases in AIR mesocosms was not affected by tetracycline dosing. TET dosing resulted in significant increases in soil NH(4) concentration in LEACH mesocosms, whereas significant decreases were apparent in AIR mesocosms. Elevated levels of H(2)S and CH(4) in the headspace of LEACH mesocosms coincided with TET dosing and returned to pre-dosing levels when antibiotic dosing ceased. The effects of tetracycline on leachfield mesocosms differed as a function of aeration. Although most effects were transient, with values returning to pre-dosing levels after a 6-week recovery period in both treatments, persistent effects were observed in LEACH mesocosms.

AB This opinion paper assesses for the UK, whether the current use of cytotoxic drugs, one of the most toxic pharmaceuticals in common use, could pose a risk to aquatic organisms and to humans through water recycling. A water quality model was set up for one of these drugs, 5-fluorouracil, in the Aire and Calder catchment in Northern UK. The study predicts 5-50 ng/L concentrations for long stretches of this catchment under tow flow conditions. Due to their mode of action, practically all. eukaryotic organisms are vulnerable to damage, with teratogenicity being the greatest concern at such levels. However, it is unclear to what extent the predicted low concentrations would affect flora and fauna in receiving waters but there may be an additive effect of a mixture of cytotoxic drugs which should be taken into account. The exposure of the pregnant mother, or more specifically her foetus, to these drugs via drinking water should be minimised. Current drinking water purification technology gives grounds for optimism on removal of these compounds, but no appropriate data exist yet. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Santa Ana River (SAR) is the primary source of groundwater recharge for the Orange County Groundwater Basin in coastal southern California. Approximately 85% base flow in the SAR originates from wastewater treatment plants operated by three dischargers. An on-line, flow-through bioassay using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a means of judging potential public health impacts was employed to evaluate the water quality of the surface water and shallow groundwater originating from the SAR. Three chronic (3-4.5 mo) exposures using orange-red (outbred, OR) and see-through (color mutant, ST-II) Japanese medaka as bioindicators were conducted to evaluate endocrinologic, reproductive, and morphologic endpoints. No statistically significant differences in gross morphological endpoints, mortality, gender ratios, and vitellogenin induction were observed in fish from SAR groundwater treatment compared to the group tested in solute reconstituted reverse osmosis-treated or granular activated carbon (GAC)-treated control waters. Significant differences were observed in egg reproduction and the time to hatch in SAR groundwater; however, total hatchability was not significantly lower. To evaluate the estrogenic activity of the surfacewater source of the groundwater, SAR surface water was evaluated for vitellogenin and gonadal histopathology in juvenile medaka with no effects observed. These results demonstrate that OR Japanese medaka may be a sensitive strain as an on-line monitor to predict potential impacts of water quality, but further studies are needed to elicit causative agents within the water mixture.

AB A vast number of persistent organic pollutants have been found in wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water around the world. This indicates their ineffective removal from water and wastewater using conventional treatment technologies. In addition to classical persistent organics such as organochlorine insecticides, solvents, and polychlorinated biphenyls, a growing number of emerging pollutants of both synthetic and natural origins have been identified as major environmental pollutants in recent years. A variety of advanced and conventional treatment options have been suggested for the removal and/or destruction of these persistent organics in water and wastewater, such as chemical oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration. Of these options, chemical oxidation using ozone, alone or in combination with additional physical/chemical agents (i.e., advanced oxidation), has been proved a highly effective treatment process for a wide spectrum of emerging aqueous organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, microbial toxins, and natural fatty acids. In this paper, we discuss the emerging organic pollutants of concern in the aquatic environment and focus on the issues associated with their removal using ozonation and advanced oxidation processes.

AB Over the past decade a great amount of interest has arisen regarding the occurrence and fate of trace organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Of particular concern are human hormones and pharmaceuticals, many of which are ubiquitous contaminants in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents when measured with ng/L detection limits. As analytical procedures and bioassay techniques become more readily available and increasingly sensitive, new contaminants will be discovered. The presence or absence of any chemical in a wastewater effluent is essentially a function of analytical detection capability. This poses a unique challenge for drinking water treatment plants intent on the removal of organic contaminants, as complete removal is merely a reflection of reporting limits. The investigation described here sought to determine the occurrence, treatment, and human health relevance of a chemically diverse group of emerging contaminants.

AB Anti-inflammatory and anti-convulsive drugs are being detected in measurable quantities in municipal wastewaters. Some of these emerging substances undergo major transformation at the sewage treatment plant after biological and chemical treatments. The degradation of pharmaceutical products from high-quality treated wastewaters by disinfection processes is well documented. However, the effect of disinfection processes on these products in physicochemical primary-treated municipal effluents remains to be investigated. Pilot projects using ozone, performic acid and UV-radiation disinfection processes were carried out at the Montreal wastewater treatment plant. Residues of pharmaceutical products like salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen were found in the treated wastewaters before disinfection at concentrations ranging from 42 to 2556 ng/L. Most of these substances were eliminated at a rate greater than 50% at an ozone dose of 10 mg/L. Higher removal rates (as high as 70%) were observed when 20 mg/L of ozone was used. Removal rates for UV radiation, on the other hand, were often below 10% among the substances studied. Limited removal rate was observed after UV radiation for diclofenac and triclosan (25 and 40% efficiency, respectively). The irradiation used here (25 mJ/cm(2)) for bacterial treatment appeared, as previously reported, to be too low to cause the significant breakdown of many of the pharmaceutical substances contained in these wastewaters. Poor reduction efficiencies ( 8%) were observed with the performic acid treatment. Further investigations on analytical methodologies are therefore needed to assess the potential impact of degradation by-products on the environment and on human health.

AB This work determined the solid-water distribution coefficient (K-d) and the organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient (K-oc) of several pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, iopromide, sulfamethoxazole and roxithromycin), three estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) and two musk fragrances (HHCB and AHTN) in digested sludge. These sorption coefficients can be used to evaluate the fate of these substances during sludge treatment, thus avoiding the expensive and time-consuming analysis in the sludge phase.
   For determining the K-d and K-oc values of the target compounds in digested sludge, their concentrations were measured in the aqueous and solid phase of the effluent of an anaerobic digestion pilot plant run at several operational conditions. The results obtained were compared with the values modelled by using simple K-ow approaches. The resulting logK(d) values ranged between 3.5 and 4.4 for the two musk fragrances (logK(oc) of 4.S-6.0), between 2.1 and 2.9 for estrogens (logK(oc) of 2.9-4.2) and between 0.8 and 1.9 for the remaining pharmaceuticals (logK(oc) of 1.8-3.5). These values are in the same range as those reported in the literature for primary and secondary sludge and no significant influence of the anaerobic digestion operational conditions was observed. For most compounds, the modelled K-oc were close or within the lower range of the experimentally determined K-oc Major deviations of the modelled K-oc values were found for iopromide, sulfa methoxazole and roxithromycin, which were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than the measured values.

AB To investigate the fate of penicillin G (PEN G) in the wastewater from a PEN G production facility and the receiving river, an analytical method was developed for the simultaneous detection of PEN G and five degradation products using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS). PEN G had already undergone transformation before entering into the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), with concentrations of 153+/-4 mu g/L in raw wastewater. Most of the PEN G could be eliminated following successive treatments of anaerobic, hydrolysis, and two aerobic units under a hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 30h, and the final concentrations were 1.68+/-0.48 mu g/L in treated water. In the receiving river, the concentration of PEN G decreased from 0.31+/-0.04 mu g/L at the discharging point to under the detection limit (0.03 mu g/L) at the last sampling site (about 30km from the discharging point). The main PEN G degradation products in surface water were found to be penilloic acid, penicilloic acid and isopenillic acid, which occupied 65.8%, 20.4% and 12.9%, respectively, of the total concentration at the last site. This is the first study on the behaviors of PEN G and its main degradation products in wastewater treatment processes and the aquatic environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations of nine antibiotics [erythromycin- H2O (ERY-H2O); trimethoprim (TMP); tetracycline (TET); norfloxacin (NOR); penicillin G (PEN G); penicillin V (PEN V); cefalexin (CLX); cefotaxim (CTX); and cefazolin (CFZ)] were measured in influent and effluent samples from four sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hong Kong as well as in influent samples from one STP in Shenzhen. Levels of PEN V and CFZ were below method detection limits in all of the samples analyzed. CLX concentrations were the highest in most of the Hong Kong samples, ranging from 670 to 2900 ng/L and 240 to 1800 ng/L in influent and effluent samples, respectively, but CLX was not detected in the samples from Shenzhen. Comparatively lower concentrations were observed for ERY-H2O (470-810ng/L) and TET (96-1300 ng/L) in the influent samples from all STPs in Hong Kong. CTX was found to be the dominant antibiotic in the Shenzhen STP influents with a mean concentration of 1100 ng/L, but occurred at lower concentrations in Hong Kong sewage. These results likely reflect regional variations in the prescription and use patterns of antibiotics between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Antibiotic removal efficiencies depended on their chemical properties and the wastewater treatment processes used. In general, relatively higher removal efficiencies were observed for NOR (5-78%) and TET (7-73%), which are readily adsorbed to particulate matter, while lower removal efficiencies were observed for ERY-H2O (9-19%), which is relatively persistent in the environment. Antibiotics were removed more efficiently at Hong Kong STPs employing secondary treatment processes compared with those using primary treatment only. Concentrations of NOR measured in effluents from STPs in Hong Kong were lower than the predicted no-effect concentration of 8000 ng/L determined in a previous study. Therefore, concentrations of antibiotics measured in this preliminary study would be unlikely to cause adverse effects on microorganisms used in wastewater treatment processes at the sampled STPs.

AB Comparative experimental study is performed on purification of yellow wastewaters separated and collected in solarCity, Linz, Austria. Three membrane methods (micro-, ultra-, and nano-filtration), and two advanced oxidations (gamma radiation and electrochemical oxidation) were applied. Best results concerning the removal of pharmaceuticals and hormones from urine by membrane separation were achieved using the membrane NF-200 (FilmTec(TM)). Pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol, ethenyloestradiol, oestriol) were removed completely from urine. NF-separation also has some disadvantages: losses of urea, and lowering the conductivity in the product (permeate). The retentates (concentrates) received have to be treated further by oxidation to destroy the "problem" compounds. The results showed that electrochemical oxidation is more suitable than gamma radiation. Gamma-radiation with intensities higher than 10 kGy has to be applied for efficiently destroying of ibuprofen, and especially diclofenac. A high quantity of intermediate "problem" substances with oestrone structure was formed during the gamma oxidation of hormone containing urine samples. The electrochemical oxidation can be successfully applied for elimination of pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac, and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol) from yellow wastewater without loss of urea (nitrogen fertiliser).

AB Ozone oxidation is proven to be an effective solution for the degradation of selected oestrogenic active substances detected in secondary wastewaters such as beta-oestradiol, oestrone, oestriol, 17-alpha-ethinyloestradiol, mestranol, daidzeine, beta-sitosterol, bisphenol A, norethisterone, 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-iso-nonylphenol, up to their limit of detection. The matrix-effect of wastewater was investigated performing ozone experiments under batch mode and continuous mode using drinking water and a wastewater issued from a local plant both spiked with the non-detected substances. The results obtained indicate that the wastewater matrix greatly affects the kinetics of ozone reaction with these substances but does not really change the related reactivity scale. The ozone dose corresponding to the full conversion of target EDCs consequently increases as their oxidation takes place competing with reactions of background pollutants represented by the COD and DOC content. However, a usual dose close to 12 mg/L was found sufficient to provide high degradation yields for all substances studied while 35% of COD was removed. This is a contribution to the numerous current works focused on technologies able to improve the quality of water discharged from wastewater treatment plants, both considering conventional parameters and emerging contaminants.

In order to optimize it, their biodegradation P processes have to be better understood. So far, microcalorimetry has been used worldwide to investigate chemical reactions. For few years now it has also been developed to model and control biological processes. In the case of micropollutants, respirometry is, most of the time, not precise enough to determine biodegradation. That is why, microcalorimetric experiments have been set up. For this purpose, a 2 L Bio-RC1 (Mettler-Toledo) has been modified to reach a resolution of 5-10mW.L-1.
   In this study, the biodegradation rate of standard substrates (Ethanol and Ammonia) by an activated sludge from a full-scale CAS and one from a MBR pilot plant operating in parallel have been compared by means of microcalorimetry. Then few trials to determine the biodegradation of selected pharmaceutical substances, as well as the eventual inhibition induced by them have been made. The first results did not exhibit any biological activity. However, they have displayed inhibition for both studied substances.

AB The existence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the water environment is an emerging problem. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of eleven PPCPs through bioassays on bacteria, algae, crustaceans, amphibians and protozoa, and compared the toxicology indexes with the concentration of PPCPs in river water for ecotoxiclogical risk evaluation. Toxicity of the eleven PPCPs was observed and the values of EC50 or LC50 were in the order of mg/L. A distinctive finding is that antibacterial triclosan affected all aquatic lives tested. The effects of PPCPs varied according to species of lives. Contamination from PPCPs was detected at observation stations on the river, and the range of concentration was in the order of ng/L far lower than the values of toxicity indexes EC50 or LC50. Ecotoxicological risks posed by PPCPs at the observation stations was evaluated using the concentration in the river water and the NOEC examined by AGI tests. The results revealed that three PPCPs, triclosan, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, posed an ecotoxiclogical risk in rivers where wastewater treatment systems are not yet well developed.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT
AB The aim of this study is to find the macrophytes that possess high resource recovery efficiency in subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (SFCWs) while not pose any negative effects to the treatment performance. Five criteria were included in this analysis. The suitable alternative plants were proposed according to their availabilities in each climate zone. For their potentials as an energy sources, they are related to plants' productivity as well as growth rate. Concerning the utilization options, plants that possess high economical value and/or versatilities were encouraged. Among the options are handicrafts, fertilizers, animal feeds, construction materials, paper making, and pharmaceutical products. In term of nutrient uptakes, in most cases they were relatively minor comparing to other removal mechanisms in SFCWs. No significant differences in term of treatment efficiency could be found. The proposed species have to be able to tolerate the municipal wastewater. The cost differences of plant propagules between each species are marginal, hence they should not be considered as the main selection criteria. Based on an investigation of 45 species worldwide, the recommendation table is developed with 13 suitable species that fit all the criteria. It appears that there are more than one "most appropriate plant species" in each climatic region. To perform the selection, the operators should weight their preferences on each criteria and the availability of plants in the area.

AB Direct capillary nanofiltration also in combination with an upstream powdered activated carbon treatment was tested for high quality water reuse of tertiary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Two endocrine disruptors (BPA and EE2) and two cytostatics (CytR and 5-FU) were spiked in concentrations of 1 to 2 mu g/L to evaluate the process performance. In direct NF the real total removal of the micropollutants was between 5 and 40%. Adsorption to the membrane played a major role leading to a seemingly total removal between 35 and 70%. Addition of powdered activated carbon and lignite coke dust largely reduced the influence from adsorption to the membrane and increased the total removal to >95 to 99.9% depending on the PAC type and dose. The cytostatics showed already in direct NF a very high removal due to unspecified losses. Further investigations are ongoing to understand the underlying mechanism. The PAC/NF process provided a consistently high permeate quality with respect to bulk and trace organics.

AB A combined strategy of a photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) was evaluated for total C and N removal from a synthetic wastewater containing 200mgL(-1) of the antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Photo-Fenton reaction was performed with two different H2O2 concentrations (300 and 400mgL(-1)) and 10mgL(-1) of Fe2+. The pre-treated effluents with the antibiotic intermediates as sole carbon source, together with a nutrients solution, were used as feed for the biological reactor. The SBBR was operated under aerobic conditions to mineralize the organic carbon and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was optimized down to 8 hours. Then, an anoxic denitrification stage of 24 hours of HRT was added right after the aerobic stage of the same duration in order to remove the NO3- generated along the chemical-biological treatment. TOC, COD and SMX concentrations together with O-2 uptake rate (OUR) profiles were monitored in purpose of assessing the performance of the system. NO3-, NH4+ and total N concentrations were analyzed to find out the fate of N contained in the initial SMX molecule. A start up strategy resulted in the correct formation of a biofilm over the volcanic support. The total TOC removals achieved with the combination of the chemical and the biological processes were 75.7 and 87.7% for the low and the high H2O2 concentration pretreatments respectively. Practically all N present in the SMX solution was eliminated in the SBBR when the aerobic-anoxic strategy was used.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continually being introduced into the influent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Developing a better understanding of pharmaceutical removal mechanisms within the different treatment processes is vital in preventing downstream contamination of our water resources. in this study, ibuprofen, a popular over-the-counter pain reliever, was monitored by taking wastewater samples throughout the City of Guelph municipal WWTP. Greater than 95% of ibuprofen was found to be removed in the aeration tank, with aerobic biodegradation being the dominant mechanism. For comparison, first-order kinetics were used to quantify ibuprofen biodegradation in a conventional WWTP aeration tank and in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant. The rate constants, k(biol), for the conventional tank and the MBR were determined to be (-6.8 +/- 3.3) L/g SS*d and (-8.4 +/- 4.0) L/g SS*d, respectively. These two rate constants were found to be statistically similar. Preliminary study of a biological nutrient removal pilot system also suggests that ibuprofen can be anaerobically degraded.

AB The WFD is an overarching piece of legislation that aims to harmonize existing European water policy; since 2000 it requires managing the river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services and to promote sustainable water use of any specific water body. Nevertheless the goals of other directives, such as drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment (UWWT), are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological and PS/PSR/PHS contamination. Great challenges are due to emerging contaminants especially the technical improvement and harmonisation for risk identification and risk assessment: for biological effects and for chemical analysis and, finally integrate this knowledge to preserve the "good status". The methodologies implemented have as aim the identification of acceptable or unacceptable risks. This identification provides the basis for the regulatory decisions, which follow from the risk assessment. After priority setting the UWWT needs to be adjusted and existing or new treatment options should comply with the requirements of the different directives. This will be another step on the way to reach the targets given in EU water legislation and in the achievements of millennium development goals.

AB This article describes the development of an enhanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the analysis of a selected group of 57 organic contaminants in wastewater This. group comprises 39 pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutical classes and 10 of their most frequent metabolites. Six pesticides and two disinfectants were also included. The LC-MS method was developed using a hybrid quad rupole/linearion trap (Q TRAP) analyzer operating in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode (in both positive and negative electrospray ionization) in combination with a time-of flight (TOF) mass analyser. The application of both techniques provided very good results in terms of accurate quantification and unequivocal identification. Quantification was based on the use of a linearly accelerating (LINAC) high-pressure collision cell, which enable the analysis of a high number of compounds with enough acquisition data points for an optimal peak definition in SRM. Unequivocal identification was provided by the acquisition of at least two SRM transitions and by obtaining accurate mass measurements of the identified compounds with errors lower than 2 ppm. As an alternative for compounds where a second transition cannot be detected by Q-Trap-MS, the application of survey scans in enhanced product ion (EPI) was evaluated.
   The analytical performance of the method was evaluated in effluent wastewater samples. Linearity of response over three orders of magnitude was demonstrated (R-2 > 0.99 for most compounds). matrix effects resulting in suppression of the response were frequently observed, between 2-50% for most of compounds, except 4-DAA and 4-AA, which exhibit higher values (68%). Signal enhancement was also detected in 16 compounds. Method limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.1-50 ng L-1. Finally, the methodology was successfully applied to the evaluation of the efficiency of two ozone-based treatments applied to the effluent from the secondary clarifier of a municipal wastewater treatment facility. Preliminary results are presented demonstrating that ozonation of wastewaters degrade pharmaceuticals with a high efficiency. Removals higher than 90% were reached for most of target analytes.

AB Both biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS) and biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes, and physico-chemical treatment processes including ozonation process and Title 22 process consisting of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration followed by UV or chlorination disinfection after the above biological processes, were compared from the viewpoint of removal efficiency. 66 pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, analgesics, psychoneurotic agents were measured with SPE-LC/MS/MS. 26 compounds Out Of 66 were detected in the influent ranging ng/L to mu g/L order. Particularly, disopyramide, sulpiride, and dipyridamole that have been rarely detected before in the WWTP, occurred at concentration levels of more than 100 ng/L. The total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the influent was efficiently removed by 80% during the biological treatment. But removal efficiencies of carbamazepine and crotamiton were less than 30%. The total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the effluent from CAS process was 1.5 times higher than that from BNR process. Further, the total concentration of the individual pharmaceuticals in the discharge from WWTPs applying ozonation following activated sludge process was reduced to less than 20%. Physico-chemical treatment train called Title 22 treatment after CAS could not efficiently remove the pharmaceuticals. However, ozonation process followed by biological activated carbon process could efficiently reduce all the residual pharmaceuticals below their quantification limits.

AB Solutions to global water stress problems are urgently needed yet must be sustainable, economical and safe. The utilisation of alternative water sources like reclaimed municipal wastewater is one of the most obvious and promising options in integrated water resources management. Among the various beneficial uses of reclaimed wastewater Aquifer Recharge (AR) receives growing attention because it features advantages such as additional natural treatment, storage capacity to buffer seasonal variations of supply and demand as well as mixing with natural water bodies which promotes the acceptance of further uses, particularly indirect potable use. Major concerns about the safety of this exploitation route of an alternative water source are connected to microbial and chemical contaminants occurring in wastewater, among which are emerging trace organics like endocrine disrupters and pharmaceuticals. This paper reviews the current international debate about the relevance of emerging contaminants and technical mitigation options in water recycling for indirect potable use.

AB One of the key questions arising from the presence of micro-pollutants in surface-, ground-, and drinking water is whether they pose a risk to human and ecosystem health In our laboratories we. have identified a number of biological effects by several pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) on human, animal and/or plant cells at different levels of biological organisation. In part, these effects occur at concentrations even below those reported in drinking water. Even though it is often still difficult to fully deduce the role of some of these effects on the whole organism or population level as well as after chronic exposure, the effects observed illustrate that the input of micro-pollutants into the environment must be avoided or as far as possible reduced. Much effort has already been devoted to improved treatment of sewage and raw drinking water. A comprehensive protection from aquatic micro-pollutants, however, cannot reside in water treatment technology alone. instead, all components of the life cycle of these chemicals must be put to the table to turn around the current trend of increasing environmental loads. The goal of this report is to illustrate why a more comprehensive way of risk assessment is needed and what this should include.

AB A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was fed a synthetic wastewater containing glucose to study the effects of the antimicrobial tylosin on treatment performance. Measurements of methane, volatile fatty acids, and COD concentrations suggested that the addition of 1.67 mg/L and 167 mg/l of tylosin to the synthetic wastewater inhibited propionate oxidizing syntrophic bacteria and aceticlastic methanogens. The latter is presumed to be an indirect effect. A modified version of the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) with extensions for microbial storage and hydrolysis of reserve carbohydrates, and tylosin liquid-solid mass transfer and inhibition adequately described the dynamic profiles observed in the ASBR.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Down-the-drain household chemicals are mostly discharged intermittently (i.e. with water pulses, e. g. pharmaceuticals from toilet flushing) and well soluble micropollutants can, therefore, be subject to significantly high short-term fluctuations. It is not known how these fluctuations are attenuated by sorption to sewer sediments or biofilm. First, we investigated in this paper the effect of sorption for substances with high, medium and low affinity to particulate matter based on computational experiments. For substances with high K-oc we found that the additional attenuation of a load pattern due to sorption is in the same order of magnitude as caused by dispersion in a typical main sewer. The mass flux between wastewater and the first biofilm layer was identified as the most sensitive parameter. Furthermore, the interplay of systematic, slow diurnal variations does not affect short-term fluctuations. Second, during rain events partial erosion of the biofilm can lead to increased micropollutant loads for substances with high K-oc. This increase is in the same order of magnitude as diurnal variations of the loads in the liquid phase and the TSS.

AB A study was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of secondary effluent additional treatment, using a combination of pre-treatments ( ring filter, physico- chemical and infiltration-percolation) followed by disinfection methods ( chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid and ultraviolet light). Three different indicator microorganisms were determined: E. coli, total coliforms and somatic bacteriophages. The results show better efficiency of physico- chemical and infiltration-percolation processes. Bacteriophages were eliminated to a lesser extent than bacterial indicators in all the treatment systems. Chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid seems to be more efficient in disinfection than ultraviolet light when a ring filter is the pre-treatment used. For the same doses and contact times, the efficiency of the disinfection methods is higher when the pre-treatment used is the physico- chemical or the infiltration-percolation system. The final effluent quality from the physicochemical treatment train and the infiltration-percolation treatment train, followed by the disinfectants, achieves an E. coli content that allows the reuse in most of the uses described in the Spanish legislation for wastewater reuse.

ID RAY CONTRAST-MEDIA; PHARMACEUTICALS; DECHLORINATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM), as derivatives of 2, 4, 6-triiodo benzoic acid, are applied in high doses to humans and are excreted unchanged via urine within 24 h. Common as well as advanced wastewater treatment is not able to remove the iodinated compounds leading to an environmental pollution. A specific treatment of contaminated urine or hospital wastewater could minimise the emission. For that reason the deiodination of iopromide, the most commonly used ICM, was investigated using zero-valent iron. Initial experiments carried out in stirred batch reactors with an initial pH of 2 using iron powder and iopromide dissolved in ultra pure water showed that iopromide can be deiodinated by zero- valent iron. Even in contaminated urine collected in a hospital a deiodination of ICM was possible. Further experiments at different constant pH values, temperatures and stirring speeds were performed. The kinetic studies at constant pH showed that the deiodination can be described by pseudo-first order for equal iopromide and iron concentrations. In general, the reaction depends strongly on the pH, the temperature and the stirring speed. The observed rate constant K(obs) has an optimum at pH 3 and rises with increasing temperature and stirring speed.

AB The list of priority chemicals included in various regulations such as the European Water Framework Directive, as well as the list of hazardous contaminants identified in the aquatic environment, are increasing at an accelerated pace. Therefore, there is a need for broad spectrum methods capable of simultaneously determining hundreds, if not thousands, of contaminants. For the analysis of non-polar or semi-polar contaminants, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography ( GC x GC) is more powerful than conventional gas chromatography thanks to a separation on two different stationary phases. This paper reports the use of GC x GC for a broad screening of hazardous contaminants in an urban wastewater plant. Comparison between the raw and treated wastewater has been carried out using a semi-quantitative approach. A variety of drugs, personal care products, pesticides, carcinogens and compounds toxic for reproduction, were identified. Most of these compounds were removed or decreased by this wastewater treatment plant. Preliminary results from this single plant will need to be confirmed by a more extensive study before drawing conclusions on the removal efficiency of 2D-GC amenable compounds.

AB Integrating thermochemical conversion (TCC) technologies with current animal waste treatment practices can treat and reduce quantities of manure from consolidated animal feeding operations. Additionally, TCC technologies can produce value-added, renewable energy products. These products can meet heating and power needs or be catalytically converted into liquid fuels. The primary objectives of this study were to assess opportunities and obstacles in the treatment and energy conversion using currently available TCC processes. Both dry and wet livestock manures were assessed. Dry wastes like poultry litter and feedlot manures can be processed directly via pyrolysis and air/steam gasification technology. The solids in the aqueous waste streams from dairy and swine operations can undergo wet gasification or direct liquefaction processes. Alternatively, these solids can be separated and dried before conversion. Due to high ash and sulfur contents, pretreatment of manure is necessary to prevent catalyst poisoning and promote effective unit operation. While the energy input requirements for a conceptual wet gasification manure treatment system of a model swine farm is larger than a traditional anaerobic digestion operation, there are many significant advantages in implementing TCC technology including the following: compact design; faster treatment times; reduction of odors, BOD, and pharmaceutically activated compounds; and elimination of sludge.

AB Pharmaceuticals designed for humans and animals often remain unused for a variety of reasons, ranging from expiration to a patient's non-compliance. These leftover, accumulated drugs represent sub-optimal delivery of health care and the potential for environmentally unsound disposal, which can pose exposure risks for humans and wildlife. A major unknown with respect to drugs as pollutants is what fractions of drug residues occurring in the ambient environment result from discarding leftover drugs. To gauge the significance of leftover drugs as potential pollutants, data are needed on the types, quantities, and frequencies with which drugs accumulate. Absence of this data has prevented assessments of the significance of drug accumulation and disposal as a contributing source of drug residues in the environment. One particular source of drug accumulation is those drugs that become "orphaned" by the death of a consumer. A new approach to acquiring the data needed to assess the magnitude and extent of drug disposal as a source of environmental pollution is presented by using the inventories of drugs maintained by coroner offices. The data from one metropolitan coroner's office demonstrates proof of concept. Coroner data on leftover drugs are useful for measuring the types and amounts of drugs accumulated by consumers. This inventory also provides an accurate measure of the individual active ingredients actually disposed into sewage by coroners. The types of questions these data can address are presented, and the possible uses of these data for deriving estimates of source contributions from the population at large are discussed. The approach is proposed for nationwide implementation (and automation) to better understand the significance of consumer disposal of medications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to treat the wastewater collected from equalization tank of Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), which was a mixture of waste coming from 525 small-scale industries manufacturing textile and dyestuff intermediate, pigments and pharmaceuticals. Initially a pretreatment using ferric chloride and lime was carried out to increase the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of the effluent, which showed color removal of 74% and COD reduction of 75% at a concentration of 10 and 4 g/L. respectively. The biological treatment system using anaerobic fixed film reactor was investigated as secondary treatment. A mixture of bacterial consortium DMAB and cowdung slurry was used for the formation of biofilm. The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) on the efficiency of treatment of anaerobic reactor was analysed. Subsequent aerobic treatment after anaerobic step using aerobic culture Pseudomonas aeroginosa helped in further removal of COD and color. Formation of aromatic amines during anaerobic treatment was mineralized by sequential aerobic treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the distributions of 12 antibiotics (viz., sulfonamides, macrolides, and trimethoprim) in the water from the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and compared them with those in the Tamagawa River, Japan. In Vietnam, only a few antibiotics (viz., sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, and erythromycin-H2O) were detected in the river and canals from urban and rural sites, at concentrations of 7-360 ng/L. This contrasts with the results from the Japanese urban river, where more antibiotics (sulfa methoxazole, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin) were detected at concentrations ranging from 4 to 448 ng/L. The concentrations of sulfonamides in the Mekong Delta were comparable to those in the Tamagawa River, whereas macrolide concentrations were lower than those in the Tamagawa River. The ubiquitous occurrence of sulfamethazine, used as a veterinary medicine, in the waters in Vietnam at relatively high concentrations (15-328 ng/L) was unique. Extremely high concentrations of sulfamethazine [(18.5-19.2) x 10(3) ng/L] were detected in pig farm wastewaters, and relatively high concentrations were observed in canals near chicken and pig farms. All these data suggested the potential utility of sulfamethazine as a molecular marker of livestock-source contamination. The present study demonstrated widespread inputs of veterinary medicines to waters in Vietnam.

AB Removal efficiencies and elimination kinetics of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and BOD5, TSS, and ammonium were evaluated in a pilot vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and compared with those obtained by a sand filter. On the basis of the observed removals, the PPCPs studied were grouped in relation to their removal efficiency into (i) PPCPs very efficiently removed, that is, >95% removal in one of the systems (caffeine, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, CA-ibuprofen, hydrocinnamic acid, oxybenzone, ibuprofen, OH-ibuprofen); (ii) PPCPs moderately removed, with removals between 70 and 90% in the two systems (naproxen, diclofenac, galaxolide, and tonalide); and finally (iii) PPCPs poorly removed, with elimination rates of <30% (carbamazepine). At design hydraulic loading rate (HLR) the planted VFCW and the nonplanted SF exhibited similar PPCP removal efficiencies, but the VFCW was less sensitive to removal decline in overloading conditions (up to 2 times the design HLR). Moreover, under a clogging simulation, the HLR and the presence of vegetation were some of the key aspects affecting the PPCPs, BOD5, and ammonium removal from domestic wastewater. The VFCW evaluated was more efficient in terms of removal efficiency and loading rate for most of the PPCPs studied in comparison to constructed wetlands of other configurations (i.e., horizontal subsurface flow) and SF (nonplanted). The shorter hydraulic residence time (a few hours) in VFCW compared to that in other CW configurations ranging from days to weeks makes VFCWs a very appropriate wastewater treatment option in space-limited areas.

AB Aqueous sampling rates for 25 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were determined on the commercially available passive Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS). To date, POCIS calibration has only been carried out for a handful of compounds. Uptake rates were 0.040 to 2.462 L/d under conditions of flowing water; quiescent conditions resulted in uptake rates between 0.016 and 0.223 L/d. The uptake of many PPCPs appears to be boundary-layer controlled, as indicated by higher sampling rates under flowing conditions. Sampling rates were corrected for analyte dissipation rates, and some correlations with octanol-water partition coefficients were noted. Field deployments of POCIS in wastewater effluent and surface waters had time-weighted average concentrations derived from laboratory calibrations that were consistent with regular grab samples. This work indicates that POCIS can be used as a quantitative tool for measuring PPCPs in the aquatic environment.

AB A residential end use model (REUM) which accounts for indoor water demand, outdoor water demand, hot water demand, wastewater flow and the mass of total dissolved substances (TDS) In the wastewater, was earlier described by the authors. The integral relationship between water quality and quantity in the model allows for holistic modelling of different water demand management measures' effects. The model covers 16 independent micro-components of water use and requires numerous model parameters. This paper has the objective to prioritise the 79 parameters which remain after stripping all possible redundancy from the model in terms of their relative impact. Two ranking criteria are used: the elasticity and the sensitivity of each parameter. The results, benchmarked to a typical South African suburban residence, show that household size is the most notable parameter for modelling the indoor water demand, hot water demand and wastewater flow volume. Pan evaporation and a factor describing actual lawn irrigation in relation to theory are most notable for modelling the outdoor demand. Wastewater TDS concentration is dominated by what is added at the toilet rather than pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) added at other entry points to the wastewater system. The methodology developed and results obtained underpin the view that effective water demand management policies can only be rationally formulated with the assistance of a comprehensive water and wastewater model based on micro-components of water use.

AB The H295R cell bioassay was used to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting effects of 18 of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the United States. Exposures for 48 It with single pharmaceuticals and binary mixtures were conducted; the expression of five steroidogenic genes, 3 beta HSD2, CYP11 beta 1, CYP11 beta 2, CYP17 and CYP19, was quantified by Q-RT-PCR. Production of the steroid hormones estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P) was also evaluated. Antibiotics were shown to modulate gene expression and hormone production. Amoxicillin up-regulated the expression of CYP11 beta 2 and CYP19 by more than 2-fold and induced estradiol production up to almost 3-fold. Erythromycin significantly increased CYP11 beta 2 expression and the production of P and E2 by 3.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively, while production of T was significantly decreased. The p-blocker salbutamol caused the greatest induction of CYP17, more than 13-fold, and significantly decreased E2 production. The binary mixture of cyproterone and salbutamol significantly down-regulated expression of CYP19, while a mixture of ethynylestradiol and trenbolone, increased E2 production 3.7-fold. Estradiol production was significantly affected by changes in concentrations of trenbolone, cyproterone, and ethynylestradiol. Exposures with individual pharmaceuticals showed the possible secondary effects that drugs may exert on steroid production. Results from binary mixture exposures suggested the possible type of interactions that may occur between drugs and the joint effects product of such interactions. Dose-response results indicated that although two chemicals may share a common mechanism of action the concentration effects observed may be significantly different. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Wastewater treatment facilities use secondary treatment to stabilize the effect of discharged effluent on receiving waters by oxidizing biodegradable organic matter and reducing suspended solids and nutrients. The process was never specifically intended to remove trace quantities of xenobiotics, such as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Nevertheless, European studies performed at bench-scale or at small facilities have demonstrated that a critical minimum solids retention time (SRT) can achieve good reduction of many EDCs and pharmaceuticals. The objective of this study was to expand these findings to the removal performance for 20 PPCPs commonly found in the influent to full-scale facilities operating in the United States. The participating plants use SRT conditions ranging from 0.5 to 30 days and include facility capacities ranging from 19 000 m 3/d ( 5 mgd) to greater than 1 136 000 m(3)/d ( 300 mgd). Two pilot membrane bioreactors were also included in the study. The 20 PPCPs were categorized into nine bin combinations of occurrence frequency and treatment reduction performance. While most compounds were well removed, galaxolide ( a musk fragrance) occurred frequently and was resistant to removal. A minimum critical SRT, defined as the minimum SRT, needed to consistently demonstrate greater than 80% removal (SRT80), was compound-dependent, with most compounds removed at 5 to 15 days and a small group requiring longer SRTs. From limited data, no additional removal could be attributed to the use of membrane bioreactors, media filters, or longer hydraulic retention times. Reverse osmosis was effective in removing any remaining compounds.

AB In this study, two solar advanced oxidation processes, heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton, carried out at pilot-plant scale using compound parabolic collectors are proposed for the elimination of dipyrone and its metabolites in water. The two treatments are compared on the basis of their kinetics (parent compound and TOC), formation of degradation products (as determined by ionic chromatography, GC/MS and LC/TOF-MS), and toxicity (as evaluated by Vibrio fischeri bacteria). Photo-Fenton was more efficient than TiO2, but without, any relevant difference between the degradation products formed or toxicity. A degradation pathway is proposed, carboxylic acids being the main intermediates prior to mineralisation. Decrease in toxicity during treatment is also shown.

AB This work focuses on the application of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) to purify phenolic effluents, which when combined with innovation and effectiveness contribute towards the preservation of natural resources and environmental quality. Phenols are typical pollutants found in wastewaters from different industries such as petrochemical, pharmaceutical, resin manufacturing, olive-oil, pesticides, dyeing production or cosmetic industry. Nevertheless due to their toxicity and harmfulness, they cannot be poured to water systems. Phenol has been chosen as a model compound in this study because it is usually a component of industrial wastewaters. Furthermore phenol-like compounds are generated by intermediate compounds in the oxidation pathway of higher molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons.
   Phenol can be effectively removed but this does not imply that the all toxicity levels of the effluent have been diminished, since the oxidation pathway passes through more toxic products. Before each AOP application, the reaction intermediates must be identified in order to determine the influence they have on operating conditions, and subsequently establish the criteria for the complete destruction of toxic compounds. These studies will assist in the cost-effective operation of industrial setups, and also in the design of integrated processes for wastewater treatment.
   The main objectives of this work are, first to identify and measure toxic intermediates and, second, to develop a kinetic model for phenol degradation based on a mechanism in series. Chemical pathways in the phenol oxidation consider its hydroxylation to catechol, hydroquinone and resorcinol. These dihydroxylated rings are later oxidised to quinone-like compounds. These quinone-like compounds break into short-chain acids, like acetic, formic and oxalic acids. In order to propose a reaction pathway several runs were carried out at room temperature controlling the operational pH throughout the reaction. Experiments were carried out under different operating conditions, and the decay curves of phenol and aromatic intermediates were monitored, using doses of oxidant and catalyst until R=40 mol oxidant/mol phenol and [Fe(II)]=20 mg/L. Kinetic parameters were rightly fitted to the kinetic model, predicting successfully the reaction rates of each toxic compounds.

AB Residues of phenazone-type pharmaceuticals originating from spills of a former pharmaceutical production plant have recently been detected in ground water in Berlin, Germany. The degradation pathways of phenazone, propyphenazone, and dimethylaminophenazone (DMAA) during water purification were enlightened in batch experiments with groundwater and filter material obtained from operating waterworks. For phenazone and propyphenazone a complete biological transformation into their respective metabolites 1,5-dimetllyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP) and 4-(2-methylethyl)-1,5-dimethyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (PDP) was observed. Generally, removal of phenazone-type pharmaceutical residues during rapid Sand filtration was almost exclusively caused by microorganisms only present in polluted raw water. DMAA applied to fresh filter materials was rapidly degraded into its metabolites 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMPH), acetoaminoantipyrine (AAA), formylaminoantipyrine (FAA), and 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyloxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH). DMAA, AAA, and FAA were, however, only detected Lit low levels in a few samples of purified water from all operating water works. Whereas, the metabolites AMDOPH and DP were detected up to 1 mu g l(-1). Propyphenazone was rapidly removed and AMPH, phenazone, and PDP were only measured with concentrations in the low ng l(-1) range. The concentrations of the metabolites DP and PDP are even higher in the purified water than in the raw water caused by their formation during degradation of phenazone and propyphenazone. Reduction of filtration velocity on an experimental filter from 5 m h(-1) down to 2 m h(-1) resulted in improved removal of phenazone, propyphenazone and their metabolites DP and PDP, respectively. AMDOPH, however, was highly persistent in all experiments independent from filtration velocities and contact times. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The determination of acidic pharmaceutical and endocrine disrupting compounds at low ng/L levels in surface and wastewater requires highly selective and sensitive analytical procedures. Therefore, the water samples under study were prepared by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) for analyte enrichment and clean up. Prior to GC-NCI-MS, the polar analytes were derivatized using pentafluorobenzyl bromide. The performance of this analytical method has been revealed in fortification experiments by limits of detection ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 ng, L for, e.g., ibuprofen and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, respectively. SPE may be the most rate determining step of the analytical procedure. Therefore, the performance of SPE disks and cartridges was additionally compared. Method evaluation demonstrated that even complex sample matrices, such as model wastewater or even synthetic humic acids, did not interfere with the quantification and identification of target analytes. The performance of the analytical method developed for water monitoring was further emphasized by the investigation of surface water of the River Saale and effluents of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In those samples, acidic pharmaceuticals and corresponding metabolites occurred at 0.1 ng/L for clofibric acid up to 498 ng/L for bezafibrate. Technical nonylphenol and bisphenol A were found in every water sample. Meanwhile, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was determined only in one WWTP effluent sample at 1 ng/L.

AB The "Fish Plasma Model" has been proposed for prioritizing pharmaceuticals for in-depth environmental risk assessment efforts. The model compares estimated drug concentrations in fish plasma with human therapeutic plasma concentrations in order to assess the risk for a pharmacological interaction in the fish. In this study the equation used to estimate bioconcentration from water to fish blood plasma was field-tested by exposing rainbow trout in situ to sewage effluents from three treatment plants. Measured plasma levels of diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen and gemfibrozil were similar or lower than those modelled, which is acceptable for an early tier. However, measured levels of ibuprofen were >200 times higher than modelled for the largest plant (Gryaab Goteborg). Comparing measured fish plasma concentrations to the human therapeutic concentrations ranked the relative risks from the pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac and gemfibrozil, followed by ibuprofen, presented the highest risk for target interactions, whereas naproxen and ketoprofen presented little risk. Remarkably, measured bioconcentration factors varied considerably between sites. This variation could not be attributed to differences in water concentrations, temperatures, pH or exposure times, thereby suggesting that chemical characteristics of effluents and/or recipient waters strongly affected the uptake/bioconcentration of the pharmaceuticals.

AB Deep well injection is widely used in South Florida, USA for wastewater disposal largely because of the presence of an injection zone ("boulder zone" of Floridan Aquifer System) that is capable of accepting very large quantities of fluids, in some wells over 75,000m(3)/ day. The greatest potential risk to public health associated with deep injection wells in South Florida is vertical migration of wastewater, containing pathogenic microorganisms and pollutants, into brackish-water aquifer zones that are being used for alternative water-supply projects such as aquifer storage and recovery. Upwards migration of municipal wastewater has occurred in a minority of South Florida injection systems. The results of solute-transport modeling using the SEAWAT program indicate that the measured vertical hydraulic conductivities of the rock matrix would allow for only minimal vertical migration. Fracturing at some sites increased the equivalent average vertical hydraulic conductivity of confining zone strata by approximately four orders of magnitude and allowed for vertical migration rates of up 80m/year. Even where vertical migration was rapid, the documented transit times are likely long enough for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms.

AB We investigated the efficiencies of removal of 24 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) during sand filtration and ozonation in an operating municipal sewage treatment plant (STP). The target compounds were 2 phenolic antiseptics (thymol, triclosan), 5 acidic analgesics or anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid), 4 amide pharmaceuticals (propyphenazone, crotamiton, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide), 7 antibiotics (sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azithromycin, erythromycin anhydride, clarithromycin, roxithromycin), 3 phenolic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (nonylphenol:NP, octylphenol:OP, bisphenol A:BPA) and 3 natural estrogens (17 beta-estradiol:E2, estrone:E1, estriol:E3). Ozonation removed similar to 80% or more of the phenolic antiseptics, crotamiton, sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics, and 17 beta-estradiol. Their removal is discussed in terms of chemical structure. The study ascertained the validity of ozonation mechanisms proposed by previous studies in an actually running STP. Compounds with a C = C double bond or an aromatic structure with electron donors (e.g., phenol, alkyl, methoxy, or non-protonated amine) were susceptible to ozonation. Compounds with amide structures were resistant. Removal of the PhACs during sand filtration was generally inefficient, probably because of their low hydrophobicities. The combination of ozonation and sand filtration with activated sludge treatment gave efficient removal (>80%) of all the target compounds except carbamazepine and diethyltoluamide. Among all the steps in the plant, ozonation contributed substantially to overall removal of naproxen, ketoprofen, triclosan, crotamiton, sulfapyridine, macrolide antibiotics, and estrone.

AB The fate of two differently labelled radioactive forms of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was studied during the membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. The laboratory- scale MBR specially designed for studies with radioactive compounds was operated using a synthetic wastewater representative of the pharmaceutical industry and the activated sludge was obtained from a large-scale MBR treating pharmaceutical wastewater. By applying in MBR a concentration of 8 g/L mixed liquor solid suspension and a sludge retention time of 25 days over the whole test period (35 days), the removal performance of C-, N- and P-ranged between 80% and 95%. Balancing of radioactivity could demonstrate that real mineralization is <1%, while radioactivity mainly remained sorbed in the reactor, resulting in a removal of approximately 80%. The same metabolite pattern in the radiochromatograms for the two different labelling protocols led us to assume that the elimination pathway does not involve the removal of the ethinyl group from EE2 molecule.

AB In this paper, the occurrence and elimination of eight selected antibiotics mainly for human use, including chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, sulfonamide and macrolide groups, were investigated at four sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. The most frequently detected antibiotics in the present study were ofloxacin, norfloxacin, roxithromycin, erythromycin- H2O (the main degradation product of erythromycin) and sulfamethoxazole. The concentrations of these compounds in raw influents and final effluents at the four STPs ranged from 10 to 1978 ng L-1 and from 9 to 2054 ng L-1, respectively. The other analytes were detected only in a few samples from the four STPs. Antibiotics could not be eliminated completely at the four STPs, with the highest elimination efficiency reaching to 81%. Analysis of the dissolved daily mass flow showed that fluoroquinolones were mostly eliminated from the sewage, and high concentrations of these compounds were found in secondary sludge. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observed elimination of fluoroquinolones in the STPs was due to their sorption to the sludge, but not biodegradation. Macrolides, especially erythromycin-H2O, were stable in sewage during the treatment process, and in fact even higher concentrations were found in the final effluents than in the raw sewages. Sulfamethoxazole was also found in raw influent and final effluent, indicating that it could withstand different treatment processes in the STPs. Remarkable differences in the daily environmental loads (the sum of the amounts in the final effluent and sludge) of the five most frequently detected antibiotic compounds were found in the range of 0.5-828 g at the four STPs.

AB A bio-trickling filter packed with fibrous balls, ZX02, packing material was tested to treat a mixed waste gas containing butyl acetate (BA), n-butyl alcohol (n-BA) and phenylacetic acid (PA), which were discharged from penicillin workshop in a pharmaceutical factory. In order to investigate the effect of various factors such as inlet loading and spray water flow rate on the removal rate of these three volatile pollutants, a field experiment was carried out continuously for more than 3 months using a pilot bio-trickling filter and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as spray water during the pilot experiment. The removal rates of BA, n-BA and PA was 95%, 92% and nearly 100%, when their inlet concentration was lower than 2200, 2400 and 370 mg m(-3), respectively. To maintain 90% removal of BA, n-BA and PA, acceptable maximum inlet loadings cannot exceed 373.4, 317.2 and 209.5g m(-3) h(-1), respectively. The effluent from the secondary sedimentation tank of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant can be used as spray water, and its optimal flow rate was determined to be 9.5-10.5 L h(-1). The bio-trickling filter had significant ability to resist shock of high inlet loading while maintaining low resistances to air flow. Therefore, it can be operated for long-term without frequent backwashing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB This work investigated the degradation of a natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) and the removal of estrogenic activity by the ozonation process in three different pHs (3, 7 and 11). A recombinant yeast assay (YES assay) was employed to determine estrogenic activity of the ozonized samples and of the by-products formed during the ozonation. Ozonation was very efficient for the removal of 17 beta-estradiol in aqueous solutions. High removals (>99%) were achieved with low ozone dosages in the three different pHs. Several by-products were formed during the ozonation of 17 beta-estradiol. However, only a few compounds could be identified and confirmed. Different by-products are formed at different pHs, which is probably due to different chemical pathways and different oxidants (03 and OH radical). The by-products formed at pH 11 were 10 epsilon-17 beta-dihydroxy- 1, 4-estradieno-3-one (DEO) and 2-hydroxyestradiol, which were not formed in pH 3. Only testosterone could be observed in pH 3, whereas at pH 7 all three by-products were found. At pH 7 and 11 the applied ozone dosages were not enough to remove all the estrogenicity from samples, even though the 17 beta-estradiol residual concentration for these two pHs was lower than at pH 3. Higher estrogenicity was detected at pH 11. An explanation to this fact may be that oxidation via OH radical forms more by-products with estrogenic activity. Probably, the formation of 2-hydroxyestradiol at pHs 7 and 11 is contributing to the residual estrogenicity of samples ozonized at these pHs. In this work, complete removal of estrogenic activity was only obtained at pH 3. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The discovery that natural and synthetic chemicals, in the form of excreted hormones and pharmaceuticals, as well as a vast array of compounds with domestic and industrial applications, can enter the environment via wastewater treatment plants and cause a wide variety of environmental and health problems -even at very low concentrations, suggests the need for improvement of water recycling.
   Three Australian wastewater recycling schemes, two of which employ reverse osmosis (RO) technology, the other applying ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration, have been studied for their ability to remove trace organic contaminants including I I pharmaceutically active compounds and two non-steroidal estrogenic compounds. Contaminant concentrations were determined using a sensitive analytical method comprising solid phase extraction, derivatization and GC with MS using selected ion monitoring. In raw wastewater, concentrations of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications were comparable to those found in wastewaters around the world. Remarkably, removal efficiencies for the three schemes were superior to literature values and RO was responsible for the greatest proportion of contaminant removal. The ability of RO membranes to concentrate many of the compounds was demonstrated and highlights the need for continued research into monitoring wastewater treatment, concentrate disposal, improved water recycling schemes and ultimately, safer water and a cleaner environment.

AB The occurrence and distributions of six polycyclic musks were studied in influent, primary and effluent waters from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Guangdong. Five polycyclic musk compounds, 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4-Hinden-4-one (DPMI), 4-acetyl-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butylindan (ADBI), 6-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindan (AHMI), 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexah ydro-4,6,6,7,8,8 -hexa methylcyclopenta(g) -2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetraliydronaphthalene (AHTN) were found in wastewater in the WWTP. DPML HHCB and AHTN were measured at 0.38-0.69, 11.5-146, 0.89-3.47 mu g/l, respectively, in influents. Meanwhile 0.06-0.10 mu g/l DPM1, 0.95-2.05 mu g/l HHCB, 0. 10-0. 14 mu g/l AHTN were detected in effluents, ADBI and AHMI were also detected in some primary waters and effluents. The results suggested that wastewater from cosmetic plants cause high loadings of polycyclic musks to this WWTP. Under the currently applied treatment technology, the removal efficiencies achieved were 61-75% for DPMI, 86-97% for HHCB and 87-96% for AHTN by transfer to sludge as the main removal route.

AB The fate and effects of cytostatic (anticancer or antineoplastic) pharmaceuticals in the environment are largely unknown, but they can contaminate wastewater treatment effluents and consequently aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we have focused on five cytostatic compounds used in high amounts (cyclophosphamide. cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and etoposide), and we have investigated their ecotoxicity in bacterial Pseudomonas putida growth-inhibition test, algal Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth-inhibition test, and Dapnia magna acute immobilization test. Genotoxicity also was assessed with Escherichiel coli SOS-chromotest (with and without metabolic activation) and the GreenScreen Assay using yeast S. eerevisiae. All tested compounds showed significant effects in most of the assays with lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing 50% effects (EC50s) values ranging within mu g/L to mg/L. The most toxic compound was 5-fluorouracil in the assays with P. putida (EC50 = 0.027 mg/L) and P. subcapitata (EC50 0.11 mg/L), although cisplatin and doxorubicin were the most toxic to D, magna (EC50 = 0.64 and 2.0 mg/L, respectively). These two chemicals were also the most genotoxic in the SOS-chromotest (minimum genotoxic concentrations [MGC] = 0.07-0.2 mg/L), and 5-fluorouracil was the most genotoxic in the eukaryotic yeast assay (MGC = 0.02 mg/L). Our investigation seems to indicate generally lower risks of acute effects at concentrations expected in the environment. However, some effective concentrations were relatively low and chronic toxicity of cytostatics (and/or their transformation products), as well as specific sources of human pharmaceuticals such as hospital effluents, require research attention.

AB Phenol is a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound and its biodegradation is very important to meet the environmental regulations. Two bacterial strains capable of utilizing phenol as a sole source of carbon were isolated from the wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics these strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pseudomallei. Both of these strains were very efficient for phenol degradation. R pseudomallei degraded phenol at a maximum concentration of 1500 mg L-1 within seven days with a specific growth rate of 0.013 h(-1) and phenol degradation rate of 13.85 mg L-1 h(-1). Maximum initial concentration of phenol utilized by R aeruginosa was 2600 mg L-1 with 0.016 h(-1) specific growth rate and 26.16 mg L-1 h(-1) phenol degradation rate. Moreover, the effect of various salts i.e., NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4 and K2SO4 on the growth of these strains and phenol degradation rate (at 1000 mg L-1) was studied. In the presence of these salts, R aeruginosa showed up to 1.53 and 1.34 times faster phenol degradation rate and specific growth rate, respectively as compared to P. pseudomallei. In addition, P aeruginosa exhibited higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reduction rates as compared to the strain R pseudomallei. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Research was carried out with the aim of monitoring anaerobic digestion processes using thermal analysis with the aid of mass spectrometry so as to define the stability of the digestate obtained. Three different systems were investigated under varying conditions. The digestion of waste sludge from a pharmaceutical industry (PI) and the digestion of cattle manure (CM) were evaluated under mesophilic conditions.
   The co-digestion of a mixture of primary sludge (PS) and the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) was studied under thermophitic conditions. Temperature-programmed combustion tests were carried out to investigate the degree of stabilization of samples throughout the digestion processes. The derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles obtained for the mesophilic digestion of PI waste showed a decrease at low temperatures and an increase at high temperatures in the intensity of the peaks recorded as the stabilization process proceeded. These results are in accordance with those obtained by the present authors in their previous work on the mesophilic digestion of primary sludge and OFMSW. In contrast, the DTG profiles obtained from the stabilization process of CM and thermophilic codigestion of PS and OFMSW showed a reduction in peaks at high temperatures. When the stabilization products obtained from CM by anaerobic digestion and by composting processes were compared, it was observed that the composting process was capable of further decomposing materials readily oxidized at low temperatures and increasing the presence of structurally more complex substances. The evolution of the differential thermal analysis (DTA) signal recorded simultaneously showed considerable similarity to the mass/charge (m/z) signal 44 registered by the mass spectrometer. The use of mass spectrometry helped to clarify the inner workings of the digestion process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of 28 human and veterinary antibiotics was assessed in a conventional (activated sludge) and advanced (microfiltration/reverse osmosis) wastewater treatment plant (VJVvrTP) in Brisbane, Australia. The dominant antibiotics detected in wastewater influents were cephalexin (med. 4.6 gL(,)(-1) freq. 100%), ciprofloxacin (med. 3.8 mu gL(-1) freq. 100%), cefaclor (med. 0.5 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), sulphamethoxazole (med. 0.36 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) and trimethoprim (med. 0.34 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%). Results indicated that both treatment plants significantly reduced antibiotic concentrations with an average removal rate from the liquid phase of 92%. However, antibiotics were still detected in both effluents from the low-to-mid ngL(-1) range. Antibiotics detected in effluent from the activated sludge WWTP included ciprofloxacin (med. 0.6 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), sulphamethoxazole (med. 0.27 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) lincomycin (med. 0.05 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) and trimethoprim (med. 0.05 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%). Antibiotics identified in microfiltration/reverse osmosis product water included naladixic acid (med. 0.045 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), enrofloxacin (med. 0.01 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), roxithromycin (med. 0.01 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), norfloxacin (med. 0.005 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), oleandomycin (med. 0.005 mu g L-1, freq. 100%), trimethoprim (med. 0.005 mu g L-1, freq. 100%), tylosin (med. 0.001 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), and lincomycin (med. 0.001 mu gL(-1), freq. 66%). Certain traditional parameters, including nitrate concentration, conductivity and turbidity of the effluent were assessed as predictors of total antibiotic concentration, however only conductivity demonstrated any correlation with total antibiotic concentration (p = 0.018, r = 0.7). There is currently a lack of information concerning the effects of these chemicals to critically assess potential risks for environmental discharge and water recycling. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is generally accepted that the main route for human pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is via sewage treatment plants receiving wastewater from households and hospitals. We have analysed pharmaceuticals in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant serving about 90 bulk drug manufacturers in Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India-a major production site of generic drugs for the world market. The samples contained by far the highest levels of pharmaceuticals reported in any effluent. The high levels of several broad-spectrum antibiotics raise concerns about resistance development. The concentration of the most abundant drug, ciprofloxacin (up to 3 1,000 mu g/L) exceeds levels toxic to some bacteria by over 1000-fold. The results from the present study call for an increased focus on the potential release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from production facilities in different regions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Because of the vast use of organic chemicals in modem society, almost any wastewater stream from industrial processes or households contains such compounds and disposal without proper treatment will therefore result in exposure to humans and the environment. Some of them may exhibit endocrine disrupting effects (EDCs) and they widely exist in wastewater. The current effluent standards for Urban Wastewater Treatment Plants (UWWTPs) still include the conventional parameters of BOD, COD, pH, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, total number of E. coli etc. No limits for dangerous substances such as heavy metals or xenobiotic organic compounds exist in many countries. In the framework of the Water Frame Directive (WFD), environmental quality standards including 33 priority pollutants and some other xenobiotics have been proposed by the EU. As a consequence, member states have to establish monitoring programs for a number of priority and emerging pollutants. The integrated use of conventional biological treatment with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as ozone oxidation, photocatalysis, Fenton and Photo-Fenton oxidation have been applied in order to increase the biodegradability and also the detoxification of the effluent streams. The use of AOPs seems to be favorable for reuse applications that require high quality of treated water, like for example groundwater recharge and indirect potable reuse. However, total dissolved solids (TDS) which can be increased if AOPs are applied have to be removed before reuse. This paper aims at providing an updated review on EDCs and their removal by photocatalysis (PC) and ultrasound oxidation (US) from aqueous spiked solutions and wastewater. The recently established reuse limits in Italy are evaluated according to AOPs requirements discussed in this paper.

AB Antibiotics and antibiotic metabolites have been found in the environment, but the biological activities of these compounds are uncertain, especially given the low levels that are typically detected in the environment. The objective of this study was to estimate the selection potential of chlortetracycline (CTC on the antibiotic resistance of aerobic bacterial populations in a simulated river water ecosystem. Six replicates of a 10-day experiment using river water in continuous flow chemostat systems were conducted. Each replicate used three chemostats, one serving as a control to which no antibiotic was added and the other two receiving low and high doses of CTC (8 mu g/liter and 800 mu g/liter, respectively). The addition of CTC to the chemostats did not impact the overall level of cultivable aerobic bacteria (P = 0.51). The high-CTC chemostat had significantly higher tetracycline-resistant bacterial colony counts than both the low-CTC and the control chemostats (P < 0.035). The differences in resistance between the low-CTC and control chemostats were highly nonsignificant (P = 0.779). In general a greater diversity of tet resistance genes was detected in the high-CTC chemostat and with a greater frequency than in the low-CTC and control chemostats. Low levels of CTC in this in vitro experiment did not select for increased levels of tetracycline resistance among cultivable aerobic bacteria. This finding should not be equated with the absence of environmental risk, however. Low concentrations of antibiotics in the environment may select for resistant bacterial populations once they are concentrated in sediments or other locations.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a fugacity-based analysis of the fate of selected industrial compounds (alkylphenols and phthalates) with endocrine disrupting properties in a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP A) in South East Queensland, Australia. Using mass balance principles, a fugacity model was developed for correlating and predicting the steady-state-phase concentrations, the process stream fluxes, and the fate of four phthalates and four alkylphenols in WWTP A. Input data are the compound's physicochemical properties, measured concentrations and the plant's operating design and parameters. The relative amounts of chemicals that are likely to be volatilized, sorbed to sludge, biotransformed, and discharge in the effluent water was determined. Since it was difficult to predict biotransformation, measured concentrations were used to calibrate the model in terms of biotransformation rate constant. Results obtained by applying the model for the eight compounds showed <40% differences between most of the estimated and measured data from WWTP A. All eight compounds that were modelled in this study had high removal efficacy from WWTP A. Apart from benzyl butyl phthalate and bisphenol A, the majority is removed via biotransformation followed by a lesser proportion removed with the primary sludge. Fugacity analysis provides useful insight into compound fate in a WWTP and with further calibration and validation the model should be useful for correlative and predictive purposes.

AB While over seven million organic and inorganic compounds that have been indexed by the American Chemical Society's Chemical Abstracts Service in their CAS Registry are commercially available, most pollution monitoring programs focus only on those chemical stressors, for which regulatory benchmarks exist, and have been traditionally considered responsible for the most significant human and environmental health risks. Until the late 1990s, the San Francisco Estuary Regional Monitoring Program was no exception in that regard. After a thorough external review, the monitoring program responded to the need for developing a pro-active surveillance approach for emerging pollutants in recognition of the fact that the potential for the growing list of widely used chemical compounds to alter the integrity of water is high. We describe (1) the scientific and analytical bases underlying a new surveillance monitoring approach; (2) summarize approaches used and results obtained from a forensic retrospective; (3) present the growing data set on emerging pollutants from surveillance monitoring and related efforts in the San Francisco Bay Area to characterize newly targeted compounds in wastewater streams, sediment, storm water runoff, and biota; and (4) suggest next steps in monitoring program development and applied research that could move beyond traditional approaches of pollutant characterization. Based on the forensic analysis of archived chromatograms and chemical and toxicological properties of candidate compounds, we quantified a variety of synthetic organic compounds which had previously not been targeted for analysis. Flame retardant compounds, pesticides and insecticide synergists, insect repellents, pharmaceuticals, personal care product ingredients, plasticizers, non-ionic surfactants, and other manufacturing ingredients were detected in water, sediment, and/or biological tissue samples. Several of these compounds, especially polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants, exhibited concentrations of environmental concern. We also describe environmental management challenges associated with emerging pollutants and how pro-active surveillance monitoring might assist in implementing a more holistic approach to pollution prevention and control before, emerging pollutants become a burden on future generations.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) resist degradation in wastewater treatment plants. Thus, they may be transformed by chemical disinfectants in the final treatment stage, generating products that may possess enhanced toxicity/biological activity relative to the parent compounds. For this reason, the reaction of cimetidine,an over-the-counter antacid, with the frequently used disinfectant, free chlorine, was investigated. Cimetidine degraded rapidly in the presence of excess free chlorine, indicating that it will likely undergo significant transformation during wastewater disinfection. Four major products were isolated and extensively characterized by comparison of liquid chromatographic retention times to known standards, mass spectrometry, H-1- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. An expected sulfur oxidation product, cimetidine sulfoxide, was identified along with three unexpected products: 4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyl-1H-imidazole,4-chloro5-methyl-1H-imidazole, and a product proposed to be either a beta- or delta-sultam. The last three products are formed by transformations not frequently observed in free chlorine reactions of PPCPs such as C-C bond cleavage and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. The unexpected transformations yielded compounds with more substantial structural changes than would be observed in common free chlorine reactions such as N-chlorination or electrophilic halogenation. The reaction pathway was elucidated by kinetic analysis and by independently treating isolated intermediates with free chlorine, and reaction mechanisms were proposed. Finally, the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of the chlorination products was estimated, and the products 4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyl-1H-imidazole and 4-chloro-5-methyl-1H-imidazole were estimated to have lower PNECs than cimetidine.

AB Detoxication technologies require the combination of theoretical and practical knowledges of xenobiotic biodegradation, wastewater treatment technologies, and management rules. The purpose of this complicated combination is to propose specialized strategies for detoxication, based on lab- and pilot-scale modeling. These strategies include preliminary created algorithms for preventing the risk of water pollution and sediments. The technologies and algorithms are essentially important outcome, applied in the textile, pharmaceutical cosmetic, woodtreating, and oiltreating industries.
   In this paper four rehabilitation technologies for pretreatment of water contaminated by pentachlorophenol (PCP) have been developed in the frame of the European and Bulgarian National projects. Emphasize is put on the biological systems and their potential of detoxication management. The light and transmission electron microscopy of the reconstructed activated sludges, the microbial, kinetic and enzymological indicators are presented and approved as critical points in the biocontrol.

AB Anaerobic sludge granules were obtained from laboratory-scale anaerobic bioreactors used to treat pharmaceutical-like (methanol-, acetone- and propanol-contaminated) wastewater under low-temperature conditions (15 degrees C). The microbial diversity and diversity changes of the sludge samples were ascertained by applying 16S rRNA gene cloning and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analyses, respectively, and using sludge samples from the inoculum, throughout and at the conclusion of the bioreactor trial. Data from genetic fingerprinting correlated well with those from physiological activity assays of the reactor biomass. Specifically, for example, TRFLP profiles indicated the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens within the archaeal community, thus supporting the findings of specific methanogenic activity measurements. TRFLP data supported the hypothesis that the deviation between the replicated reactors, in terms of treatment efficiency, was associated with succession within the microbial communities present, and indicated that community development was linked to both operating temperature and wastewater composition. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also applied, to quantitatively assess the abundance of selected microbial groups, and revealed the underestimation of the abundance Methanosarcina by gene cloning analysis and demonstrated the spatial arrangement of these organisms within the architecture of the lowtemperature solvent-degrading anaerobic biofilms.

AB Rejection of trace organic compounds, including disinfection by-products (DBPs) and pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), by high-pressure membranes has become a focus of public interest internationally in both drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation/reuse. The ability to simulate, or even predict, the rejection of these compounds by high-pressure membranes, encompassing nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO), will improve process economics and expand membrane applications. The objective of this research is to develop a membrane transport model to account for diffusive and convective contributions to solute transport and rejection. After completion of cross-flow tests and diffusion cell tests with target compounds, modeling efforts were performed in accordance with a non-equilibrium thermodynamic transport equation. Comparing the percentages of convection and diffusion contributions to transport, convection is dominant for most compounds, but diffusion is important for more hydrophobic non-polar compounds. Convection is also more dominant for looser membranes (i.e., NF). In addition, higher initial compound concentrations and greater J(0)/k ratios contribute to solute fluxes more dominated by convection. Given the treatment objective of compound rejection, compound transport and rejection trends are inversely related. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is detected in sewage effluent at concentrations that can disrupt normal reproductive function in fish. The objectives of this study were to identify novel genomic responses to EE2 exposure using microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis in the liver and telencephalon of male zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to an environmentally relevant nominal concentration of 10 ng/L EE2 for a 21 -day period. In the liver, common biomarkers for estrogenic exposure such as vitellogenin 1 and 3 (vtg1; vtg3), estrogen receptor alpha (esr1), and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) mRNA were identified by microarray analysis as being differentially regulated. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that vtg1 was induced similar to 700-fold, vtg3 was induced similar to 100-fold and esr1 was induced similar to 20-fold. As determined by microarray analysis, ATPase Na+/K+ alpha 1a.4 (atp1a1a.4) and ATPase Na+/K+ beta la (atp1b1a) mRNA were down-regulated in the liver. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that there were common biological processes and molecular functions regulated by EE2 in both tissues (e.g. electron transport and cell communication) but there were tissue specific changes in gene categories. For example, genes involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism were down-regulated in the liver but were induced in the telencephalon. This study demonstrates that (1) tissues exhibit different gene responses to low EE2 exposure; (2) there are pronounced genomic effects in the liver and (3) multi-tissue gene profiling is needed to improve understanding of the effects of human pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms.

AB The effects of Clofibric acid (a persistent environmental metabolite of Clofibrate, a human pharmaceutical), on Fathead minnows were studied. Fibrates are used to prevent cardiovascular disease through their antilipidemic activity. In a series of experiments, in which fish were exposed to waterborne Clofibric acid, no convincing, reproducible antilipidemic effects were observed. In contrast, in three separate experiments, Clofibric acid affected the reproductive axis of fish. Spermatogenesis was apparently impaired, leading to a marked reduction in sperm count in two of the three experiments. Various measures of sperm motility were also reduced, although only significantly so at the highest concentration of Clofibric acid tested (1 mg/L). There were also indications that plasma androgen concentrations were reduced. These effects of Clofibric acid on the reproductive axis of fish are similar to those that occur in some mammals as a side-effect of the drug. Taken together, a weight-of-evidence argument would suggest that the main discernable effect of Clofibric acid on fish is likely to be a reproductive, not an antilipidemic, one. Although some of these reproductive effects of Clofibric acid occurred only at a high concentration (1 mg/L), others occurred at lower concentrations ( mu g/litre), near or similar to those reported in the aquatic environment (ng to low mu g/litre range). Although we recognise that this is not a definitive study of the effects of Clofibric acid on fish reproduction, the results strongly suggest that Clofibric acid could adversely affect sperm parameters and androgen concentrations in adult Fathead minnows. Further studies are warranted. This may be an example of a drug in which an accidentally discovered side-effect found in mammals turns out to be the most important effect in a different vertebrate group, namely fish.

AB Pharmaceuticals and selected major human metabolites are ubiquitous in Jamaica Bay, a wastewater-impacted estuary at concentrations in the low ng/L to low mu g/L range. Concentrations throughout the bay are often consistent with conservative behavior during dry-weather conditions, as evidenced by nearly linear concentration -salinity relationships. Deviation from conservative behavior is noted for some pharmaceuticals and attributed to microbial degradation. Caffeine, cotinine, nicotine, and paraxanthine were detected with the greatest analytical signal, although evidence is presented for in situ removal, especially for nicotine and caffeine. There is little evidence for significant removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, suggesting they are more conservative and useful wastewater tracers. Immediately following heavy precipitation, which induced a combined sewer overflow (CSO) event, the concentrations of all compounds but acetaminophen and nicotine decreased or disappeared. This observation is consistent with a simple model illustrating the effect of precipitation has on pharmaceutical concentration in the wastewater stream, given the balance between dilution from rain and the bypass of treatment.

AB In recent times, trace levels of pharmaceuticals detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters have raised the level of attention around the ultimate fate and the potential persistence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. We have seen the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines (EMEA) recently include more rigorous environmental fate testing in European Union (EU) Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) guidance to assess the ultimate fate in water/sediment systems. Yet to date, there is little data available that covers the fate of pharmaceuticals in the water/sediment compartment, and little that assess whether current aerobic and anaerobic methods are appropriate for pharmaceuticals. In this study, the biodegradation profiles of 3 Pfizer products were investigated following the latest ERA guidance and its recommendation for OECD 308 water/sediment biodegradation testing. Experiments included C-14-labeled exemestane, azithromycin, and varenicline representing neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals with average K-oc values of 3704, 49 400, and 10 483 respectively. Specific HPLC/radioactive monitoring (RAM) methods were used to profile water and sediment samples for biotransformation products. Binding to sediment, as "non -extractables", was considerable for all three pharmaceuticals, though most notable for the cationic pharmaceuticals varenicline and azithromycin ranging from 52% to 94% at study termination, respectively. In general, for all 3 pharmaceuticals studied, the anaerobic conditions demonstrated less biotransformation and mineralization than the aerobic; though their biotransformation profile (number of metabolites) and amount bound to sediment were similar. Based on these findings and our current understanding of anaerobic biodegradation, we would recommend a tiered approach to the OECD 308 water/sedimenttest: with default testing just for aerobic conditions; and then if needed, anaerobic testing only for those compounds potentially amenable to typical anaerobic processes. We suggest that as a simulation test would be better suited in later tier testing under EU ERA guidance. Inherent biodegradation or die-away tests seem better suited to derive biodegradation rate constants for subsequent environmental modeling of water and sediment compartments.

AB The removal of estrogen hormones from water and wastewater is of importance due to their adverse effects toward ecosystems and potential risks to human health. The ultrasound-induced destruction of estrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is studied in a batch reactor using a 1.1 W/mL sonication unit and in a continuous flow reactor using a 2.1 W/mL sonication unit. The estrogen compounds of interest are 17(x-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, estrone, equilin, gestodene, levonorgestrel, and norgestrel. Effects of process variables such as temperature, pH, and pressure are examined. The degradation of estrogens follows pseudo first-order kinetics. The reaction likely takes place in the interfacial region where supercritical environment is produced upon cavity implosion and in the bulk solution with radical species. Low solution pH is more favorable for destruction of estrogens. A kinetic degradation model is developed to predict the destruction of estrogen compounds. Low solution temperature shows favorable destruction of estrogens. Increasing the fluid pressure is detrimental to reaction efficiency.

AB Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) are widely used pharmaceuticals which have been detected in the environment. Predicting the transport and ultimate fate of beta blockers in the environment requires understanding their adsorption to soils and sediments, something for which little information is currently available. The objective of this work was to examine the adsorption of three beta blockers, propranolol, metoprolol and nadolol, to a natural alluvial material, as well as to six minerals present as components of the alluvial material. Batch adsorption experiments indicate that, for most of the minerals studied, compound hydrophobicity is an important predictor of adsorption, with propranolol, the most hydrophobic compound studied, adsorbing to the greatest extent. Results further suggest that, for the minerals studied, electrostatic effects are not a good predictor of adsorption; adsorption extent was not well-predicted by either surface zeta potential or by the difference between experiment pH and point of zero charge, despite the cationic nature af the three beta blockers at experiment pH values. Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), on adsorption. Results indicate that SDBS significantly increases the adsorption of propranolol to two different sorbents. This result is potentially important because surfactants such as SDBS are likely to be present in wastewater effluents with beta blockers and could influence their mobility in the environment.

AB The occurrence of 28 pharmaceuticals of major human consumption in Spain, including analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, and beta-blockers, was assessed along the Ebro river basin, one of the biggest irrigated lands in that country. Target compounds were simultaneously analyzed by off-line solid-phase extraction, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The loads of detected pharmaceuticals and their removal rates were studied in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the main cities along the basin. Total loads ranged from 2 to 5 and from 0.5 to 1.5 g/d/1,000 inhabitants in influent and effluent wastewaters, respectively. High removal rates (60-90%) were achieved mainly for analgesics and anti-inflammatories. The other groups showed lower rates, ranging from 20 to 60%, and in most cases, the antiepileptic carbamazepine, macrolide antibiotics, and trimethoprim were not eliminated at all. Finally, the contribution of WWTP effluents to the presence of pharmaceuticals in receiving river waters was surveyed. In receiving surface water, the most ubiquitous compounds were the analgesics and anti-inflammatories ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen; the lipid regulators bezafibrate and gemfibrozil; the antibiotics erythromycin, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and less frequently, ofloxacin; the antiepileptic carbamazepine; the antihistamine ranitidine; and the beta-blockers atenolol and sotalol. Although levels found in WWTP effluents ranged from low mu g/L to high ng/L, pharmaceuticals in river waters occurred at levels at least one order of magnitude lower (low ng/L range) because of dilution effect. From the results obtained, it was proved that WWTP are hot spots of aquatic contamination concerning pharmaceuticals of human consumption.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are neurologically active drugs that can contaminate surface waters and have the potential to negatively affect aquatic organisms. In this investigation, the 48-h acute toxicity of mixtures (binary and quaternary) of four common SSRIs (fluoxetine [Prozac((R))], sertraline [Zoloft((R))], paroxetine [Paxil((R))], and citalopram [Celexa((R))]) were determined in the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia. Logistic regression was used to model mortality data and to investigate the applicability of concentration addition and independent action models to explain observed mortality. The concentrations estimated to induce 50% mortality in 48 h for the individual SSRIs sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and citalopram were 0.48 to 0.66, 1.23 to 1.84, 2.23 to 3.57, and 10.47 to 14.53 mu M, respectively. Concentration addition was a better predictor of mixture effects than independent action and suggested that the tested SSRIs have a similar mechanism of action. Results indicate that environmental hazard assessments should be conservative and consider that acutely toxic effects in aquatic organisms can be additive for each SSRIs in a mixture.

AB Pharmaceutical androgens and estrogens discharged into the aquatic environment are now known to induce adverse effects in fish and are a health concern for wildlife. Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exposed to a pharmaceutical androgen, trenbolone, used to enhance cattle growth and found to pollute waters below feedlots in the USA, has been shown to alter the development of the anal fin of the females and disrupt gonopodium development in fry. In our work, we showed that altered gonopodimu development was associated with disruption in the normal patterns of expression of 2 cloned androgen receptors. Furthermore, exposure to trenbolone at 1 mu g/L induced spermatocytes in the ovary of sexually mature females.
   Roach (Rutilus rutilus) living in UK rivers are exposed to estrogenic chemicals in effluents derived from sewage treatment works and this causes feminizing effects, including the development of oocytes in the testis of males. The contraceptive estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) is believed to contribute to these feminized responses. Our lab-based studies showed that gonadal feminization of roach could be induced by exposure to EE2 at 4 ng/L and the phenotypic responses were associated with altered patterns of expression of 2 cloned estrogen receptors (ERs) and aromatase genes. EE2 was shown to induce similar feminized responses in the medaka (Oryzias latipes). We established a reporter gene assay system for roach and medaka ERs and showed that specific environmental estrogens differentially activated the two fish ER subtypes. We also found evidence for an enhanced sensitivity for some estrogens to activate the medaka ERs compared with the roach ERs.

AB The treatability of pharmaceutical industry wastewater bearing the antibiotic sulfamerazine in the lab-scale continuously feed upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor/continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system was investigated in order to determine the changes in the characterization on composition of the wastewater during biotreatment. The BOD5/COD ratio was determined to assess the approximate biodegradability. When the initial sulfamerazine concentration was 10 mg/l the methane percentage reached around 76% while it was measured at 60% at a sulfamerazine concentration of 90 mg/l. The total (overall) COD removal efficiency of the sequential UASB + CSTR treatment system was determined as 97%. The results of this study indicated that the system exhibited a good removal performance for sulfamerazine. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we used isotopic ( delta O-18, delta H-2, delta S-34-SO4) and chemical tracers (boron) to assess the sources and transport processes of the micropollutants carbamazepine, galaxolide, and bisphenol A in groundwater underlying the city of Halle (Saale), Germany Their ubiquitous presence in urban groundwater results from a combination of local river water infiltration, sewer exfiltration, and urban stormwater recharge. Attenuation during transport with infiltrating river water increased from carbamazepine (0-60%) to galaxolide (60-80%) in accordance with their increasing sorption affinity and decreasing recalcitrance against biodegradation. Distinctly higher attenuation during transport was found for carbamazepine (85-100%) and galaxolide (95-100%) if micropollutants originated from sewer exfiltration. Most likely, this is related to higher contents of organic matter and higher transit times of the respective flow paths. Although attenuation undoubtedly also affects the transport of bisphenol A, quantification is limited due to additional contributions from the urban stormwater recharge. As a consequence, micropollutant loads in groundwater indicate that groundwater discharge may dominate the export of bisphenol. A from urban areas. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this work was to explore the application of microwaves for the regeneration of activated carbons spent with salicylic acid, a metabolite of a common analgesic frequently found in wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry. The exhausted carbon was treated in a quartz reactor by microwave irradiation at 2450 MHz at different temperatures and atmospheres, the regeneration efficiency being highly dependent on the operating conditions. Quantitative desorption of the pollutant was achieved at high temperature and oxidizing atmosphere, with regeneration efficiencies as high as 99% after six cycles. The stripping efficiency was superior to 95% at high temperatures and decreased at 450 degrees C. The incomplete desorption of the adsorbate at low temperature was further confirmed by the changes in the porosity observed by N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms. Hence, micropores remain blocked which results in a reduction in loading capacities in successive cycles. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A microbial process for the degradation of three types of structurally distinct organonitriles (i.e., saturated and unsaturated aliphatic nitrile and aromatic nitrile) was studied. Microorganisms were enriched from the activated sludge of a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant and adapted through providing acetonitrile as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for their growth. The adapted mixed culture was then examined for their capability of degrading acetonitrile, acrylonitrile and benzonitrile under various operational conditions. The performance of biodegradation and the metabolic intermediate- and end-products in the process were monitored. The results show that an average removal rate of 0.083g acetonitrile g(-1)-VSSh(-1), 0.0074g acrylonitrileg(-1)-VSSh(-1) or 0.0029g benzonitrileg(-1)-VSSh(-1) was achieved in the batch bioreactor under the common operational condition of 25 degrees C and pH 7. The biodegradation of acetonitrile and acrylonitrile showed a two-step pathway, with the generation of acetamide followed by acetic acid and ammonia for acetonitrile or acrylamide followed by acrylic acid and ammonia for acrylonitrile. However, the biodegradation of benzonitrile appeared to have only one step, with the direct production of benzoic acid and ammonia, but without benzamide being detected in the process. The results suggest that, depending on the substrates, the adapted mixed culture can develop very different degradation pathways, such as nitrile hydratase plus amidase for acetonitrile or acrylonitrile and nitrilase for benzonitrile. Therefore, the adapted mixed culture has a great potential and flexibility for actual applications in biodegradation of various organonitrile compounds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are many reports documenting the adverse effects, such as feminization of fish, of estrogen hormones in the environment. One of the major sources of these compounds is from municipal wastewater effluents. The biological processes at municipal wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove these compounds. This paper discusses the use of ultrasound to destroy estrogen compounds in water. The study examines the effect of ultrasound power density and power intensity on the destruction of various estrogen compounds which include: 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol, equilin, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel. These tests were conducted in single component batch and flow through reactors using 0.6, 2 and 4 kW ultrasound sources. The sonolysis process produced 80-90% destruction of individual estrogens at initial concentration of 10 mu g/L within 40-60 min of contact time. First order rate constants for the individual compounds under different conditions are presented. The estrogen degradation rates increase with increase in power intensity. However, the energy efficiency of the reactor was higher at lower power density. The 4 kW ultrasound reactor was more energy efficient compared to the 0.6 and 2 kW sonicators. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of four beta blockers, one antiepileptic drug, one lipid regulator, four anti-inflammatories, and three fluoroquinolones was studied in a river receiving sewage effluents. All compounds but two of the fluoroquinolones were observed in the water above their limit of quantification concentrations. The highest concentrations (up to 107 ng L-1) of the compounds were measured during the winter months. The river water was passed to a pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant, and the elimination of the pharmaceuticals was followed during the treatment. The processes applied by the plant consisted of ferric salt coagulation, rapid sand filtration, ozonation, two-stage granular activated carbon filtration (GAC), and UV disinfection. Following the coagulation, sedimentation, and rapid sand filtration, the studied pharmaceuticals were found to be eliminated only by an average of 13%. An efficient elimination was found to take place during ozonation at an ozone dose of about 1 mg L-1 (i.e., 0.2-0.4 mg of O-3/mg of TOC). Following this treatment, the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals dropped to below the quantification limits with the exception of ciprofloxacin. Atenolol, sotalol, and ciprofloxacin, the most hydrophilic of the studied pharmaceuticals, were not fully eliminated during the GAC filtrations. All in all, the treatment train was found to very effectively eliminate the pharmaceuticals from the raw water. The only compound that was found to pass almost unaffected through all the treatment steps was ciprofloxacin.

AB Pollution from endocrine disrupting compounds and related micropollutants is widely regarded as a major environmental issue on both a regional and a global scale, largely due to concerns over risks to human and ecological health. Between 2005 and 2010, the United Kingdom is conducting a demonstration program, costing similar to 40 million (similar to$80 million at the time of writing), to evaluate technologies to remove these compounds from wastewater. However, while such advanced treatment techniques will undoubtedly reduce the discharges of micropollutants, they will also inevitably result in large financial costs, as well as environmentally undesirable increases in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Here we calculate the price of treating urban sewage with two of the major options specifically proposed in the U.K. demonstration program: (i) granular activated carbon and ozone and (ii) membrane filtration and reverse osmosis. Economic analysis indicates that treating wastewater with these advanced technologies may be economically and environmentally undesirable due to the increased energy consumption and associated economic costs and CO2 emissions. Since the costs of advanced treatment of sewage would most likely have to be passed on to customers (both domestic and industrial), we propose that national demonstration programs should not only compare and contrast the most advanced treatment methods but also consider alternative techniques, such as increased sludge ages and hydraulic retention times in conjunction with nutrient removal stages and the varying redox conditions associated with them, which potentially may be almost as effective but with much lower environmental and financial costs.

AB Lipid regulators have been detected in effluents from sewage treatment plants and surface waters from humans via excretion. This study was designed to assess the ecotoxicity of fibrates, lipid regulating agents. The following compounds were investigated: Bezafibrate, Fenofibrate and Gemfibrozil and their derivatives obtained by solar simulator irradiation. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, rotifers and microcrustaceans to assess acute and chronic toxicity, while SOS Chromotest and Ames test were utilized to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds.
   The photoproducts were identified by their physical features and for the first risk evaluation, the environmental impact of parental compounds was calculated by Measured Environmental Concentrations (MEC) using the available data from the literature regarding drug occurrence in the aquatic environment and the Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNEC) based on our toxicity data. The results showed that acute toxicity was in the order of dozens of mg/L for all the trophic levels utilized in bioassays (bacteria, rotifers, crustaceans). Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on rotifers and crustaceans while the algae seemed to be slightly affected by this class of pharmaceuticals. Genotoxic and mutagenic effects were especially found for the Gemfibrozil photoproduct suggesting that also byproducts have to be considered in the environmental risk of drugs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A 5-month "self-serve" pilot project was implemented to properly dispose of old and unwanted prescription and nonprescription medications. Obstacles encountered during the program included reluctance by major drug store chains to participate, regulatory and legal restrictions on pharmaceutical handling, and collection of detailed data from participants. Despite these difficulties, a total weight of 305 lb of discarded pharmaceuticals was collected during the pilot program period from an estimated 500 participants. A survey of participants indicated that discard of pharmaceuticals to the sanitary sewer, a newly discovered environmental hazard, is commonplace, with approximately 50% of participants using this method previously. The average age of the patients using the disposed medication was approximately 64 yr old, with the large majority being above 50 yr in age. The majority of participants learned of the program through newspaper advertisement. The average age or time after purchase, of the medication was approximately 3 yr, and the primary purpose cited for its disposal was that the medication had exceeded its expiration date.

AB The effects of bacterial activity on the degradation of estrone (El), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and ethinylestradiol (EE2) in nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) were studied with different substrates and organic loading rates (OLRs) and low temperature conditions. Heterotroph was shown to have utilized glucose prior to El for metabolism. The co-metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) dominated the degradation of El, E2 and EE2 in NAS. The higher the organic loading, the higher the rate of organic matter transformation, with less ammonia oxidation and less degradation of El, E2 and EE2. The degradation of E3 in NAS was shown to be largely due to heterotroph metabolism. On the basis of the difference of apparent activity between heterotroph and AOB at 4 degrees C, the process of estrogen degradation via the co-metabolism of AOB was able to be identified.

AB Biological treatment processes are probably important for preventing the proliferation of steroidal compounds in the environment, and a growing number of reports suggest that nitrification may play a role in removing these chemicals from wastewater. The link between nitrification and biotransformation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was investigated using enriched cultures of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizers. Batch experiments showed that ring A of EE2 is the site of electrophilic initiating reactions, including conjugation and hydroxylation. Ring A was also cleaved before any of the other rings were broken, which is likely because the frontier electron density of the ring A carbon units is higher than those of rings B, C, or D. EE2 and NH3 were degraded in the presence of an ammonium monooxygenase (AMO) containing protein extract, and the reaction stoichiometry was consistent with a conceptual model involving a binuclear copper site located at the AMO active site. Continuous tests showed a linear relationship between nitrification and EE2 removal in enriched nitrifying cultures. Taken together, these results support the notion that EE2 biotransformation can be cometabolically mediated under operating conditions that allow for enrichment of nitrifiers.

AB The purpose of this research was to study the fate and toxicity of triclosan (TCS) in activated sludge systems and to investigate the role of biodegradation and sorption on its removal. Two continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used; one system was used as a control, while the other received TCS concentrations equal to 0.5 and 2 mg 1(-1). At the end of the experiment, 1 mg 1(-1) TCS was added in the control system to investigate TCS behaviour and effects on non-acclimatized biomass. For all concentrations tested, more than 90% of the added TCS was removed during the activated sludge process. Determination of TCS in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of its mass flux revealed that TCS was mainly biodegraded. Activated sludge ability to biodegrade TCS depended on biomass acclimatization and resulted in a mean biodegradation of 97%. Experiments with batch and continuous-flow systems revealed that TCS is rapidly sorbed on the suspended solids and afterwards, direct biodegradation of sorbed TCS is performed. Regarding TCS effects on activated sludge process, addition of 0.5 mg 1-1 TCS on non-acclimatized biomass initially deteriorated ammonia removal and nitrification capacity. After acclimatization of biomass, nitrification was fully recovered and further increase of TCS to 2 mg 1(-1) did not affect the performance of activated sludge system. The effect of TCS on organic substrate removal was minor for concentrations up to 2 mg 1-1, indicating that heterotrophic microorganisms are less sensitive to TCS than nitrifiers.

AB The occurrence of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim antibiotics in four full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that differ in design and operating conditions was determined. The WWTPs chosen utilized a variety of secondary removal processes, such as a two stage activated sludge process with a nitrification tank, extended aeration, rotating biological contactors, and pure oxygen activated sludge. Several of the WWTPs also employed an advanced treatment process, such as chlorination and UV radiation disinfection. The detected concentrations (mu g/l) ranged from 0.20 to 1.4 for ciprofloxacin, 0.21 to 2.8 for sulfamethoxazole, 0.061 to 1.1 for tetracycline, and 0.21 to 7.9 for trimethoprim. The overall percent difference in the concentrations of the antibiotics in the effluent and influent of these antibiotics differed between plants and ranged from 33% to 97%. Based on these four full-scale WWTPs evaluated, the apparent removal of organic micropollutants in wastewater is dependent on a combination of biological and physicochemical treatment processes and operating conditions of the treatment system.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of two domestic wastewater aeration lagoons on freshwater mussels. Mussels were caged and placed in two final aeration lagoons for treating domestic wastewaters for 60 days, at a site I km downstream of the dispersion plume on the eastern shores of the Richelieu River; the western shore served as the reference site. The mussels were analysed for gonad activity, oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, stress biomarkers and neuroendocrine status (monoamine and arachidonic acid metabolism). The domestic wastewaters produced many different effects at all levels examined. The gonado-somatic index and vitellogenin-like proteins were significantly induced in both aeration lagoons and gonad pyrimidine synthesis (aspartate transcarbamylase activity) was significantly reduced, indicating that vitellogenin-like proteins were produced while DNA synthesis in gametes remained constant. Biomarkers of oxidative metabolism revealed that global heme oxidase (HO), glutathione S-transferase and Xanthine (caffeine) oxydoreductase (XOR) activities were significantly induced in at least one of the aeration lagoons, but not downstream of the dispersion plume. The activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome P4501A1), dibenzoylfluorescein (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5) and benzoyloxyresorurufin (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2136) dealkylases were readily induced by substances sharing structural similarities with coplanar polyaromatic hydrocarbons and hydroxylated or aminated aromatic or cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as pharmaceuticals or steroids in the domestic wastewaters Biomarkers of toxic stress revealed that exposure to aeration lagoons led to increased production of metallothioneins, lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks, with decreased heme oxygenase activity. LPO was significantly correlated with XOR, HO and cytochrome P4501A1 activities. Neuroendocrine effects included significant increases in dopamine and serotonin levels and in monoamine oxidase (MAO). Dopamine transport in synaptosorne was significantly increased while serotonin transport activity was significantly decreased, suggesting the mussels were in a state of serotonergicity. Moreover, arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was also readily increased in one aeration lagoon. Aeration lagoons for the treatment of domestic wastewaters are toxic, estrogenic and disrupt the metabolism of monoamines and COX in freshwater mussels.

AB Microbially catalyzed cleavage of the imadazole ring of caffeine was observed in stream sediments collected upstream and downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in three geographically separate stream systems. Microbial demethylation of the N-methyl component of cotinine and its metabolic precursor, nicotine, also was observed in these sediments. These findings indicate that stream sediment microorganisms are able to substantially alter the chemical structure and thus the analytical signatures of these candidate waste indicator compounds. The potential for in situ biotransformation must be considered if these compounds are employed as markers to identify the sources and track the fate of wastewater compounds in surface-water systems.

AB Oxidation of the antimicrobial agent triclosan by aqueous ozone (O-3) was investigated to determine associated reaction kinetics, reaction site(s), and consequent changes in antibacterial activity of triclosan. Specific second-order rate constants, k(O3), were determined for reaction of O-3 with each of triclosan's acid-base species. The value of k(O3) determined for neutral triclosan was 1.3 (+/- 0.1) x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), while that measured for anionic triclosan was 5.1 (+/- 0.1) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1). Consequently, triclosan reacts very rapidly with O-3 at circumneutral pH (the pH-dependent, apparent second-order rate constant, k(app,O3), is 3.8 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7). The pH-dependence of k(app,O3) and comparison of triclosan reactivity toward O-3 with that of other phenolic compounds indicates that O-3 reacts initially with triclosan at the latter's phenol moiety. k(O3) values for neutral and anionic triclosan were successfully related to phenol ring substituent effects via Brown-Okamoto correlation with other substituted phenols, consistent with electrophilic attack of the triclosan phenol ring. Biological assay of O-3-treated triclosan solutions indicates that reaction with O-3 yields efficient elimination of triclosan's antibacterial activity. In order to evaluate the applicability of these observations to actual wastewaters, triclosan oxidation was also investigated during ozonation of effluent samples from two conventional wastewater treatment plants. Nearly 100% triclosan depletion was achieved for a 4 mg/L (8.3 x 10(-5) mol/L) O-3 dose applied to a wastewater containing 7.5 mg/L of DOC, and degrees similar to 58% triclosan depletion for dosage of 6 mg/L (1.3 x 10(-4) mol/L) O-3 to a wastewater containing 12.4 mg/L of DOC. At O-3 doses greater than 1 mg/L (2.1 x 10(-5) mol/L), hydroxyl radical reactions accounted for < 35% of observed triclosan losses in these wastewaters, indicating that triclosan oxidation was due primarily to the direct triclosan-O-3 reaction. Thus, ozonation appears to present an effective means of eliminating triclosan's antibacterial activity during wastewater treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as template. It was then capable to recover this compound by 100 +/- 0.6% from a 2 mu g/L aqueous solution. By comparison, E2 recoveries of 77 +/- 5.2%, 87.1 +/- 2.3% and 19.1 +/- 7.8%, were achieved using a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) synthesized under the same conditions (but without template), a commercial C18 extraction phase and granular-activated carbon (GAC), respectively When fluoxetine hydrochloride and acenaphthene were added as interferences to the aqueous solution at 2 mu g/L each, E2 was recovered by 95.5 +/- 4.0% from the MIP, compared to 54.5 +/- 9.4%, 76.0 +/- 2% and 14.3 +/- 0.1% from the NIP, C18 and GAC phases, respectively Estrogenic activity equivalent to the effect caused by 22.4ng E2/L was recorded in the MIP extract from a wastewater sample whereas no activity was detected in the NIP extract. This suggested the imprinted polymers removed estrogenic compounds. This study therefore demonstrates the potential of MIPs for the selective removal of endocrine-disrupting compounds. By using a synthetic analogue to natural hormone receptors, adsorption is based on the same property that makes the contaminants harmful. Biological treatment of enriched E2 was also demonstrated.

AB This paper first reports the occurrence of six glucocorticoids (prednisone, prednisolone, cortisone, cortisol, dexamethasone, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone) in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and receiving rivers by establishing a method for analyzing glucocorticoids in complex environmental waters. For the various types of aqueous matrices considered, the absolute recoveries were from 73 to 99%, and limits of quantification were below 0.2 ng/L. Among the seven STPs studied, the average concentrations of prednisone, prednisolone, cortisone, cortisol, dexamethasone, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone in influents were, respectively, 2.6 +/- 2.1, 3.0 +/- 1.6, 30 +/- 21, 39 +/- 26, 1.2 +/- 0.70, and 0.62 +/- 0.65 ng/L, and their percent removals were 99 +/- 3.1, 78 +/- 8.8, 99 +/- 1.2, 98 +/- 2.5, 99 +/- 1.8, and 100 +/- 0%, respectively. The lower removal of prednisolone was found to be due to its relatively low efficiency of biodegradation, especially in anoxic and aerobic units. The frequently detected glucocorticoids in effluents were prednisolone, cortisol, and cortisone with average concentrations 0.56 +/- 0.06, 0.50 +/- 0.33, and 0.26 +/- 0.10 ng/L. In the receiving waters, the Tonghui and Qing Rivers, the concentrations of these compounds in some samples were much higher than those in their corresponding STP effluents; these differences depended on the sampling date, suggesting that there was random discharging of untreated wastewaters into these rivers. In addition, the ratio between the combined concentrations of two natural glucocorticoids (cortisol and cortisone) and the concentration of one synthetic glucocorticoid, prednisolone, was found to be a potential index to reflect the wastewater discharging.

AB The elimination of six acidic pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and naproxen) in a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using an activated sludge system and membrane bioreactors (MBRs) was investigated by using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system for measurement of the compounds. Limited information is available for some of the tested pharmaceuticals at present. Solid retention times (SRTs) of the WWTP and the two MBRs were 7, 15, and 65 days, respectively. The elimination rates varied from compound to compound. The MBRs exhibited greater elimination rates for the examined pharmaceuticals than did the real plant. Dependency of the elimination rates of the pharmaceuticals on SRTs was obvious; the MBR operated with a longer SRT of 65 days clearly showed better performance than did the MBR with a shorter SRT of 15 days. The difference between the two MBRs was particularly significant in terms of elimination of ketoprofen and diclofenac. Measurements of the amounts of adsorbed pharmaceuticals on the sludge and aerobic batch elimination experiments were carried out to investigate the elimination pathways of the pharmaceuticals. Results of the batch elimination tests revealed that the sludges in the MBRs had large specific sorption capacities mainly due to their large specific surface areas. Despite the sorption capacities of sludges, the main mechanism of elimination of the pharmaceuticals in the investigated processes was found to be biodegradation. Biodegradation of diclofenac, which has been believed to be refractory to biodegradation, seemed to occur very slowly.

The main photoproducts, isolated by chromatographic techniques, have been identified by spectroscopic means. Photoisomerization, photocyclization and, to a lesser extent, photooxygenation appear to be involved in the degradation of the drug. The acute and chronic toxicity of the parent drug and its photoproducts were tested on non-target aquatic organisms (Brachionus calyciflorus, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia). Exposure to all the compounds induced mainly chronic effects without significant differences among the parental and derivative compounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The expression levels of cytochrome P450 1A, p53 and vitellogenin were investigated in three different tissues of male medaka fish after exposure to diclofenac that is one of the main concerns among pharmaceuticals frequently found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. The results showed that cytochrome P450 1A, p53 and vitellogenin were highly expressed in tissue-specific gene expression patterns after exposure to 8 mg/l and 1 mu g/l of diclofenac. These elevated expression levels of three biomarkers suggested that diclofenac has potential to cause cellular toxicity, p53-related genotoxicity and estrogenic effects. It is also noteworthy that diclofenac has the potential to cause these effects even at an environmentally relevant concentration of diclofenac, 1 mu g/l. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of four anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine) and a nervous stimulant (caffeine) in influent and effluent samples from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Seville was evaluated. Removal rates in the WWTPs and risk assessment of the pharmaceutically active compounds have been studied. Analytical determination was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array (DAD) and fluorescence (Fl) detectors after sample clean up and concentration by solid phase extraction. All pharmaceutically active compounds, except diclofenac, were detected not only in wastewater influents but also in wastewater effluents. Mean concentrations of caffeine, carbamazepine, ketoprofen and naproxen ranged between 0.28-11.44 mu g l(-1) and 0.21-2.62 mu g l(-1) in influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. Ibuprofen was present in the highest concentrations in the range 12.13-373.11 mu g l(-1) and 0.78-48.24 mu g l(-1) in influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. Removal rates of the pharmaceuticals ranged between 6 and 98%. Risk quotients, expressed as ratios between the measured environmental concentration (MEC) and the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) were higher than 1 for ibuprofen and naproxen in influent wastewater and for ibuprofen in effluent wastewater.

AB An assessment of the steroid estrogen removing performance of 23 different sewage treatment plants (STPs) was performed. The assessment relied on a model to estimate influent concentrations, and completed questionnaires on the STP treatment details from the relevant water companies. This information was compared with observed effluent 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) concentrations. The 10 biological filter plants (BFP) in the study performed poorly with only 30% (SD 31) removal on average for El. This reduced El removal performance of the BFPs compared to all the other STP types in the survey was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Scenarios of all the STPs as activated sludge types, and one as all BFP types were modelled using the GREAT-ER model set up for the Aire/Calder catchment in the UK. This difference was shown to have an important effect on predicted river El concentrations and consequent risk classifications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Sweden has prohibited the deposition of organic waste since January, 2005. Since 1 million tons of sludge is produced every year in Sweden and the capacity for incineration does not fill the demands, other methods of sludge management have to be introduced to a larger degree. One common method in the USA and parts of Europe is the use of wetlands to treat wastewater and sewage sludge. The capacity of reed beds to affect the toxicity of a complex mixture of nitroaromatics in sludge, however, is not fully elucidated. In this study, an industrial sludge containing explosives and pharmaceutical residues was therefore treated in artificial reed beds and the change in toxicity was studied. Nitroaromatic compounds, which are the main ingredients of many pharmaceuticals and explosives, are well known to cause cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Recently performed studies have also showed that embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are sensitive to nitroaromatic compounds. Therefore, we tested the sludge passing through constructed wetlands in order to detect any changes in levels of embryotoxicity, genotoxicity and dioxin-like activity (AhR-agonists). We also compared implanted and planted systems in order to examine the impact of the root system on the fate of the toxicants.
   Methods. An industrial sludge containing a complex mixture of nitroaromatics was added daily to small-scale constructed wetlands (vertical flow), both implanted and planted with Phragmites australis. Sludge with an average dry weight of 1.25%, was added with an average hydraulic loading rate of 1.2 L/day. Outgoing water was collected daily and stored at -20 degrees C. The artificial wetland sediment was Soxhlet extracted, followed by clean-up with multi-layer silica, or extracted by ultrasonic treatment, yielding one organic extract and one water extract of the same sample. Genotoxicity of the extracts was measured according to the ISO protocol for the umu-C genotoxicity assay (ISO/TC 147/SC 5/ WG9 N8), using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 as test organism. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were studied using the fish egg assay with zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the dioxin-like activity was measured using the DR-CALUX assay. Chemical analyses of nitroaromatic compounds were performed using Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) and GC-MS.
   Results. Organic extracts of the bed material showed toxic potential in all three toxicity tests after two years of sludge loading. There was a difference between the planted and the unplanted beds, where the toxicity of organic extracts overall was higher in the bed material from the planted beds. The higher toxicity of the planted beds could have been caused by the higher levels of total carbon in the planted beds, which binds organic toxicants, and by enrichment caused by lower volumes of outgoing water from the planted beds.
   Discussion. Developmental disorders were observed in zebrafish exposed directly in contact to bed material from implanted beds, but not in fish exposed to bed material from planted beds. Hatching rates were slightly lower in zebrafish exposed to outgoing water from implanted beds than in embryos exposed to outgoing water from planted beds. Genotoxicity in the outgoing water was below detection limit for both planted and implanted beds. Most of the added toxicants via the sludge were unaccounted for in the outgoing water, suggesting that the beds had toxicant removal potential, although the mechanisms behind this remain unknown.
   Conclusions. During the experimental period, the beds received a sludge volume (dry weight) of around three times their own volume. In spite of this, the toxicity in the bed material was lower than in the sludge. Thus, the beds were probably able to actually decrease the toxicity of the added, sludge-associated toxicants. When testing the acetone extracts of the bed material, the planted bed showed a higher toxicity than the unplanted beds in all three toxicity tests. The toxicity of water extracts from the unplanted beds, detected by the fish egg assay, were higher than the water extracts from the planted beds. No genotoxicity was detected in outgoing water from either planted or implanted beds. All this together indicates that the planted reed beds retained semi-lipophilic acetone-soluble toxic compounds from the sludge better than the unplanted beds, which tended to leak out more of the water soluble toxic compounds in the outgoing water. The compounds identified by SPME/GC in the outgoing water were not in sufficient concentrations to have caused induction in the genotoxicity test.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. This study has pointed out the benefits of using constructed wetlands receiving an industrial sludge containing a complex mixture of nitroaromatics to reduce toxicity in the outgoing water. The water from planted, constructed wetlands could therefore be directed to a recipient without further cleaning. The bed material should be investigated over a longer period of time in order to evaluate potential accumulation and leakage prior to proper usage or storage. The plants should be investigated in order to examine uptake and possible release when the plant biomass is degraded.

AB Wild male roach (Rutilus rutilus) living in U.K. rivers contaminated with estrogenic effluents from wastewater treatment works show feminized responses and have a reduced reproductive capability, but the chemical causation of sexual disruption in the roach has not been established. Feminized responses were induced in male roach exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the pharmaceutical estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, EE2 (up to 4 ng/L), during early life (from fertilization to 84 days post-hatch, dph), and these effects were signaled by altered patterns of expression of two cloned roach estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ER alpha and ER beta, in the brain and gonad/liver. Transactivation assays were developed for both roach ER subtypes and the estrogenic potencies of steroidal estrogens differed markedly at the different ER subtypes. EE2 was by far the most potent chemical, and estrone (E-1, the most prevalent environmental steroid in wastewater discharges) was equipotent with estradiol (E-2) in activating the ERs. Comparison of the EC50 values for the compounds tested showed that ER beta was 3-21-fold more sensitive to natural steroidal estrogens and 54-fold more sensitive to EE2 as compared to ER alpha. These findings add substantial support to the hypothesis that steroidal estrogens play a significant role in the induction of intersex in roach populations in U.K. rivers and that the molecular approach described could be usefully applied to understand interspecies sensitivity to xenoestrogens.

AB Human use of pharmaceuticals results in the excretion and disposal of compounds that become part of municipal and domestic waste streams. On-site waste water disposal and leaking city sewer systems can provide avenues for the migration of effluent to the underlying aquifers. This research assessed the occurrence and persistence of 22 target pharmaceuticals in septic tank effluent and two shallow, coarse-grained aquifers in western Montana. Twelve compounds (acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, erythromycin-18, nicotine, paraxanthine, ranitidine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and warfarin) were detected in a high school septic tank effluent. Three of the 12 compounds, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and nicotine, were detected in the underlying sand and gravel aquifer after effluent percolation through a 2.0-m thick sand vadose zone. Sampling of a second sand, gravel, and cobble dominated unconfined aquifer, partially overlain by septic systems and a city sewer system, revealed the presence of caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, nicotine, and trimethoprim. The presence of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in these aquifers appears to correlate with local usage based on a reported monthly prescription volume. This work highlights the need for expanding geochemical investigations of sewage waste impacted ground water systems to include sampling for selected pharmaceuticals.

AB Hospital effluents are loaded with pathogenic microorganisms, partially metabolized pharmaceutical substances, radioactive elements, and other toxic substances. Such effluents if not treated properly can damage the natural environment and create a biological imbalance.
   This paper points out the areas of concern for hospital wastewater disposal and reports the findings of a limited physico-chemical study of treatment options for hospital effluents conducted at Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The effluent collected was checked for conventional parameters and subjected to coagulation experiments. The raw and settled effluents were coagulated with FeCl3, filtered and disinfected. Physico-chemical treatment seems to be an attractive option for the cost-effective disposal of hospital effluents. The results of this study call for further detailed study in this area.

ID SOURCE-SEPARATED URINE; WATER; NUTRIENT
AB Separating urine from wastewater at the source reduces the costs of extensive wastewater treatment. Recovering the nutrients from urine and reusing them for agricultural purposes adds resource saving to the benefits. Phosphate can be recovered in the form of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate). In this paper, the behaviour of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals during the precipitation of struvite in urine is studied.
   When precipitating struvite in urine spiked with hormones and non-ionic, acidic and basic pharmaceuticals, the hormones and pharmaceuticals remain in solution for more than 98%.
   For heavy metals, initial experiments were performed to study metal solubility in urine. Solubility is shown to be affected by the chemical conditions of stored and therefore hydrolysed urine. Thermodynamic modelling reveals low or very low equilibrium solute concentrations for cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb). Experiments confirmed Cd, Cu and Pb carbonate and hydroxide precipitation upon metal addition in stored urine with a reaction half-life of ca. 7 days.
   For all metals considered, the maximum specific metal concentrations per gram phosphate or nitrogen showed to be typically several orders of magnitudes lower in urine than in commercially available fertilizers and manure. Heavy metals in struvite precipitated from normal stored urine could not be detected.
   Phosphate recovery from urine over struvite precipitation is shown to render a product free from most organic micropollutants and containing only a fraction of the already low amounts of heavy metals in urine. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of natural estrogens, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (EI) and estriol (M), as well as estrogenic activity in wastewater influents and secondary effluents were investigated in 20 full-scale wastewater treatment plants in Japan. In all of the influent samples, natural estrogens were detected at concentrations above the minimum limits of detection (0.5 ng/L). The concentrations of natural estrogens detected in the effluent of oxidation ditch plants were generally lower than previously reported values. On the other hand, in the conventional activated sludge plants, increments of El during biological treatment were frequently observed although E2 and E3 were removed effectively in the process. The removal rates of natural estrogens or estrogenic activity show no observed statistical relationship with the solids retention time (SRT) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT). However, the plants with high SRT or HRT generally showed high and stable removal of both natural estrogens and estrogenic activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behaviour of 13 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) has been studied during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge: two musks (Galaxolide and Tonalide), one tranquilliser (Diazepam), one anti-epileptic (Carbamazepine), three anti-phlogistics (Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Diclofenac), two antibiotics (Sulfamethoxazole and Roxithromycin), one X-ray contrast medium (Iopromide) and three oestrogens (Estrone, 17 beta-oestradiol and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol). Two parallel processes have been carried out, one in mesophilic range (37 degrees C) and the other in thermophilic range (55 degrees C). The influence of temperature and sludge retention time (SRT) has been analysed. Among the substances considered, the higher removal efficiencies were achieved for the antibiotics, natural oestrogens, musks and Naproxen. For the other compounds, the values ranged between 20% and 60%, except for Carbamazepine, which showed no elimination. The removal of oestrogens, Diazepam and Diclofenac occurred after sludge adaptation. In general, no influence of SRT and temperature on PPCPs removal was observed.
   Considering the difficulty of obtaining reliable PPCPs concentrations, especially those corresponding to the fractions sorbed onto sludge, a methodology to validate the experimental data has been developed and successfully applied. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of an oxidative pre-treatment with ozone on the removal of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge has been investigated. Besides, the digested sludge characteristics in terms of pathogens content, dewatering properties, heavy metals content and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) were determined. During ozonation (20 mg O-3/g TSS), about 8% of volatile solids (VS) and 60% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were solubilized. However, no mineralization was observed. The elimination of VS and total COD during anaerobic digestion were not affected by ozone treatment with efficiencies ranging from 60% to 65%. All PPCPs considered were removed during anaerobic treatment of sludge, with efficiencies ranging from 20% to 99%. No significant influence of ozone pre-treatment was observed on PPCPs elimination except for carbamazepine. Pathogens, heavy metals and LAS contents after conventional and pre-ozonation treatment of sewage sludge were below the legal requirements. However, the dewatering properties of sludge were deteriorated when the ozone pre-treatment was applied. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been detected widely in surface waters in North America and Europe. The impact of diclofenac on river biofilm communities was investigated at exposures of 10 and 100 mu g L-1 of diclofenac or its molar equivalent in carbon and nutrients. Experiments were carried out with river water during spring and summer using rotating annular reactors as model systems. Diclofenac or nutrients at 10 mu g L-1 were observed to have no significant effect on algal, bacterial, and cyanobacterial biomass in spring, whereas in the summer the nutrient equivalent reduced algal biomass and diclofenac reduced cyanobacterial biomass relative to control biofilms (p < 0.05). In contrast, at 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac or nutrients, the result was increased cyanobacterial and bacterial biomass, respectively, relative to control biofilms in spring. In summer, 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac significantly increased bacterial biomass and the nutrient treatment had no significant effect (p < 0.05): both treatments resulted in increased biofilm thickness. The glycoconjugate composition of the exopolysaccharide matrix was influenced differentially by the treatments in both seasons. Biolog assessments ofcarbon use indicated that 100 mu g L-1 diclofenac or nutrients resulted in significant depressions in the use of carbon sources in summer and significant increases in spring. Impacts on protozoan and micrometazoan populations also were assessed. Denaturing gradient gel elec.trophoresis analyses of community DNA and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies indicated that diclofenac had significant effects on the nature of the bacterial community in comparison with control and nutrient-treated river biofilm communities.

AB An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was made for the common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen. The ERA was performed according to deterministic and probabilistic methods, based on different predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and measured environmental concentrations (MECs) on the exposure side as well as on published and newly elaborated acute ecotoxicity data on the effects side. Compilation of a large set of MECs allowed a qualification of the various PEC derivations. The European Medicines Evaluation Authority (EMEA) phase I PEC was shown to be far above realistic values, while the refined EMEA phase II (A and B) PECs were not too far from the 95th percentile MEC, in agreement with their nature as local PECs. The western European continental and regional PECs extrapolated based on actual use data, using the European Union system for the evaluation of substances, with the region reconfigured for Germany where most of the available European MECs are from, were in good to very close agreement with the median MECs. No risk to surface waters is apparent by any of the methodologies applied from the current use of naproxen; however, because only insufficient chronic ecotoxicity data are available, this is a preliminary conclusion.

AB Background, Aims, and Scope. One of the first occurrences of pharmaceutically active compounds in groundwater was reported from the sewage irrigation farms south of Berlin. At these sewage irrigation farms treated sewage effluent passed the soil and unsaturated zone before reaching the aquifer. Clofibric acid was detected in pore water from soils of those sewage irrigation farms in concentrations between 65 ng/L and 1430 ng/L. The aim of this study was to investigate the transport behavior of regularly detected clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone under conditions comparable to those at the sewage irrigation farms in a multiple compound sand column laboratory experiment.
   Materials and Methods. Sediment column experiments were conducted to study the transport of pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone. The migration was measured in fine to medium grained sand and leaching solution containing 1 mg/L of pharmaceutically active compounds and 61 mg/L of the tracer lithium chloride (LiCl). For the analysis of the pharmaceutical compounds the water samples were adjusted to a pH value of 2 and then extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Before extraction, the samples were spiked with a surrogate standard for analytical quality control. The sample extracts were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with selected ion monitoring (SIM). Depending on the sample volume (100 to 200 mL) and the matrix, the limits of detection were between 1 and 10 ng/L, and the limits of quantitation were between 5 and 25 ng/L. Analysis for calcium, magnesium and lithium were carried out using a 'Trace Scan' ICP-AES from Thermo Jarrel Ash. Sodium, potassium, iron and manganese were analyzed using a Philips PU 9400 flame AAS. Analysis of anions was performed on a Dionex ion chromatograph DX 120.
   Results. At the sewage irrigation farms the average concentrations of clofibric acid in the unsaturated zone declined from higher values near ground surface (480 ng/L) to lower values near the groundwater table (65 ng/L). From the pharmaceuticals analyzed only clofibric acid, primidone and propyphenazone could be analyzed in the first (upper) aquifer at the sewage irrigation farms. All other pharmaceuticals could neither be detected in the first aquifer nor in the deeper aquifers. Breakthrough curves from soil column experiments revealed no transformation and no retardation for clofibric acid, whereas transformation of diclofenac was so high (79%) that no retardation factor could be calculated. Ibuprofen was significantly transformed (37%), transformation of propyphenazone (17%) was quite low and retardation (R-f = 2.05) was in the range of previously conducted column experiments.
   Discussion. The results confirm previously conducted experiments with clofibric acid where this compound was identified as highly mobile and persistent. The results that diclofenac and ibuprofen are significantly transformed where unexpected as other studies exhibited much lower transformation under saturated conditions at least for diclofenac. However, lower pH values and higher oxygen contents in the unsaturated zone compared to the aquifer may explain this observed high transformation of these compounds at the column experiments.
   Conclusions. We conclude that irrigation with sewage effluent containing the compounds used in our experiments will lead to an input into groundwater of clofibric acid, whereas diclofenac and ibuprofen will most likely be transformed during the passage. Propyphenazone will be retarded but will most likely occur in groundwater. These results from the column experiments coincide very well with the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, primidone, and propyphenazone in the first aquifer.

AB Disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in tertiary wastewater was examined after ozonation (O-3) and advanced oxidation with O-3 and hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2). O-3 and O-3/H2O2 were applied at multiple dosages to investigate DBP formation during coliform disinfection and trace contaminant oxidation. Results showed O-3 provided superior disinfection of fecal and total coliforms compared to O-3/H2O2. Color, UV absorbance, and SUVA were reduced by O-3 and O-3/H2O2, offering wastewater utilities a few potential surrogates to monitor disinfection or trace contaminant oxidation. At equivalent O-3 dosages, O-3/H2O2 produced greater concentrations of assimilable organic carbon (5-52%), aldehydes (31-47%), and carboxylic acids (12-43%) compared to O-3 alone, indicating that organic DBP formation is largely dependent upon hydroxyl radical exposure. Bromate formation occurred when O-3 dosages exceeded the O-3 demand of the wastewater. Benchscale tests with free chlorine showed O-3 is capable of reducing total organic halide (TOX) formation potential by at least 20%. In summary, O-3 provided superior disinfection compared to O-3/H2O2 while minimizing DBP concentrations. These are important considerations for water reuse, aquifer storage and recovery, and advanced wastewater treatment applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a conventional bioreactor (CBR) were operated under various conditions to manipulate the biomass characteristics and evaluate the ensuing effects on the partitioning and sorption hysteresis of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). When the biomass was grown without nitrogen limitation, the biomass mean particle size had a dramatic effect on the observed partitioning coefficient (K-d) and on sorption hysteresis index (HI). MBR K-d (0.33-0.57 L/g) values were equal to or larger than those of the CBR (0.25-0.33 L/g). Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, the correlations between the biomass particle size and K-d and HI were poor, likely because of extracellular polymeric substances. The K-d and HI were determined for initial EE2 concentrations between 100 and 1000 mu g/L. Changing the SRT did not manipulate particle size, and the effects on K-d and HI were not dramatic. This study also numerically explored the impacts of sorption hysteresis on the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Total adsorbable organic iodine (TAOI) has been used as a surrogate parameter for X-ray contrast media in municipal wastewater. Available methods require specialized equipment for pyrolyzing these compounds to convert the covalently bound iodine into iodide, which is then measured by ion chromatography. In this study we describe a simple method for liberating iodide from these compounds with Cu(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Concentrations of TAOI were measured in wastewater effluent, surface waters that were expected to be impacted by wastewater, and unimpacted surface waters. TAOI concentrations ranged between 1.9 and 16.3 mu g/L 1 in wastewater with a median of 6.5 mu g/L 1. The lowest TAOI concentrations consistently were detected in a wastewater treatment plant that apparently had few hospitals within its collection area. In comparison, TAOI concentrations in surface water that was unimpacted by sewage were between 0.3 and 3.5 mu g/L 1. TAOI concentrations in surface waters that were impacted by sewage were consistent with the expected conservative behavior of TAOI. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB beta-Blockers are used to treat high blood pressure as well as patients recovering from heart attacks. In several studies, they were detected in surface water, thus indicating incomplete degradability of these substances in sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, we determined the sorption coefficients (K-D) and degradation rates of the four beta-blockers sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol in sludge from an STP operating with municipal wastewater.
   The sorption coefficients (K-D, standard deviations in brackets) were determined as 0.04(+/- 0.03S), 0.04(+/- 0.033), 0.00(+/- 0.023) and 0.32(+/- 0.058) L g(COD)(-1), and the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants were estimated to be 0.29(+/- 0.02), 0.69(+/- 0.05), 0.58(+/- 0.05) and 0.39(+/- 0.07) L d(-1) g(COD)(-1) for sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively.
   These values translate into a typical elimination in STPs (sludge concentrations of 4 g(COD) L-1 and a hydraulic retention time of 6h) of 25%, 37%, 44% and 50% for sotalol, propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol, respectively These results are also confirmed by measurements in two municipal STPs for atenolol, sotalol and propranolol. The estimated eliminations are slightly too high for metoprolol. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC) of ecotoxic or potentially ecotoxic micropollutants (ten pharmaceuticals, four X-ray contrast media, and eight industrial chemicals) present in a biologically treated municipal wastewater is studied. All but the X-ray contrast media are eliminated with high efficiency at an economically feasible PAC dosage of 10 mg/L. Based on the experimental data, the competition between the background organic matter and the micropollutant for the active sites of the adsorbent is modeled with the help of the adsorption and tracer analysis supported by the Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory. With granulated activated carbon, adsorption isotherms are determined by spiking. Based on these experimental data and modeled parameters, a lay-out of fixed-bed adsorbers may be simulated.

AB An existing GIs hydrology water quality model, LF2000-WQX, was applied to predict the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and propranalol in catchments. As a practical exercise the predominantly rural Tamar (UK) catchment was chosen. Consumption, excretion, and fate data were used to estimate the pharmaceutical input load for the model. The predicted concentrations throughout most of the catchment were 1 ng/L or less under low flow (90th percentile) conditions. However, at a few locations, downstream of small sewage treatment plants, concentrations above 25 ng/L were predicted. This exercise shows that it is relatively straightforward to predict the concentrations of new and emerging organic microcontaminants in real catchments using existing GIs hydrology water quality models. Further testing will be required to establish their accuracy (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Pre-treatment of industrial landfill leachate by fenton's oxidation
SO GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL

DT Article
DE advanced oxidation; industrial landfill leachate; Fenton's reagent
AB Biological treatment (aerobic and anaerobic) of industrial landfill leachate is limited by the presence of toxic contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) and recalcitrant (biopersistent) organics (e.g., polyphenols, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.,), hindering viable conditions for biomass proliferation in biological reactors, with difficulties in meeting concentration limits imposed by applied regulations.
   Fenton's oxidation by the use of Fe2+-H2O2-H+ mixture may be used as a pre-treatment of industrial landfill leachate for preliminary abatement of the organic load and to improve biodegradability (BOD/COD > 0.4) to favour biological oxidation in conventional wastewater treatment plants.
   Leachate from Grottaglie (S.E. Italy) non-hazardous landfill (pH 8.6; COD=11.000 mg l(-1); BOD5=2.400 mg l(-1); NH4-N=2.900 mg l(-1); conductivity=60.000 mu S cm(-1)) was laboratory tested in different operative conditions, i.e., initial pH, Fe2+/H2O2 ratio, concentrations and reaction time. The oxidation reaction was monitored by equilibrium pH and residual COD and BOD5 concentrations.
   Best operative conditions were obtained at pH 3, Fe2+ =700 mg l(-1), H2O2=9,900 Mg l(-1) (H2O2/Fe2+ ratio similar to 13w/w), reaction time=2h. Following the oxidation reaction, solution pH was neutralized by the addition of Ca(OH)(2) or NaOH (120 meq l(-1)) for further abatement of target parameters by precipitation/sorption.
   Preliminary technical/economical evaluation of possible process schemes is also given in the paper.

AB Removal of antibiotics by reverse osmosis/nanofiltration (RO/NF) from a model wastewater of a manufacturing plant producing pharmaceuticals for veterinary use was investigated. The rejection of the examined antibiotics by the selected RO and the tight NF membranes is acceptably high, exceeding in most cases 98.5%. The loose NF membrane retains the smaller antibiotics molecules less effective. Relating the solute rejections to the membranes' porosity has shown that the prevailing rejection mechanism of the examined antibiotics by all the membranes was the size exclusion effect. The rejection of the low molecular organic compounds by all the examined membranes is lower, ranging from 0.517 to 0.976 for the RO and tight NF membranes, and from 0.247 to 0.506 for the loose NF membrane. The rejections also follow the order of the solutes' molecular size. However, the specific physicochemical effects can influence the rejection of some low molecular organics by the examined membranes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceuticals (beta-blockers: acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol and sotalol; antiepileptic: carbamazepine; fluoroquinolone antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin) were assessed in the raw and treated sewage of 12 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Finland. The average concentrations in the raw and treated sewage ranged from 100 to 1060 ng L-1 and from < 24 to 755 ng L-1, respectively. The average daily loads ranged from 36 to 405 mg/1000 inh and from 2 to 302 mg/1000 inh, respectively. In the treatment plants, fluoroquinolones were eliminated by > 80%. Carbamazepine was not eliminated during the treatment and in fact even higher concentrations were frequently found in the treated than in the raw sewages. The increase in concentration was shown to be most likely due to enzymatic cleavage of the glucuronic conjugate of carbamazepine and release of the parent compound in the treatment plant. The beta-blockers were eliminated in average by less than 65% and the elimination varied greatly between the treatment plants. Especially the dilution of raw sewage by rainwater and a consequent decrease in the hydraulic retention time of a treatment plant was found to deteriorate the elimination of the beta-blockers. The work shows that especially carbamazepine and the fl-blockers may reach the recipient waters and there is a need to enhance their elimination in the sewage treatment plants. In this attempt, a denitrifying biofilter as a tertiary treatment could be of minor importance since in this study it did not result in further elimination of the target compounds.

AB Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was used to measure the concentrations of 14 pharmaceuticals, 6 hormones, 2 antibiotics, 3 personal care products (PCPs), and 1 flame retardant in surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents in South Korea. Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), iopromide, naproxen, carbamazepine, and caffeine were quite frequently observed (> 80%) in both surface waters and effluents. The analytes of greatest concentration were iopromide, TCEP, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine. However, the primary estrogen hormones, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol, were rarely detected, while estrone was detected in both surface water and wastewater effluent. The elimination of these chemicals during drinking water and wastewater treatment processes at full- and pilot-scale also was investigated. Conventional drinking water treatment methods were relatively inefficient for contaminant removal, while efficient removal (approximate to 99%) was achieved by granular activated carbon (GAC). In wastewater treatment processes, membrane bioreactors (MBR) showed limited target compound removal, but were effective at eliminating hormones and some pharmaceuticals (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and caffeine). Membrane filtration processes using reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration. (NF) showed excellent removal (> 95%) for all target analytes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants and untreated sewage constitute a low concentration but continuous source of pharmaceutical products to the aquatic environment. One such drug, ibuprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that primarily acts through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka) were exposed for 6 weeks via water to three concentrations of ibuprofen (1-100 mu g/L nominal concentrations) and a water control. Reproductive parameters, including frequency of spawning, fecundity, egg size, and rate of fertilization, were measured for each pair of adult medaka following 6 weeks of exposure. Livers homogenates from exposed individuals were assayed for COX activity and whole individuals were histologically examined for tissue damage. Increasing exposure to ibuprofen significantly increased the number of eggs per reproductive event, but decreased the number of spawning events per week. Liver tissue collected from females had less variability in COX activity with increasing concentration of ibuprofen exposure, and tended to have elevated hepatosomatic indices. No pathological damage was evident the in the gills, livers and head kidneys of animals from the highest exposure group. The results of this experiment begin to show that exposure to chronic low levels of ibuprofen alter the pattern of reproduction and may produce sex-specific responses in teleosts.

AB Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant and high-prescription-volume drug, is excreted unchanged or as a glucuronide from the human organism. Little is known about its fate in sewage treatment plants. Effects of fluoxetine on life-cycle parameters of the midge Chironomus riparius, especially development (mean emergence time), emergence, sex ratio, and fecundity, were assessed, as well as effects on reproduction of the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus and of the freshwater mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Due to the moderate lipophilic properties of the compound with a log POW of 4.05, C. riparius and L. variegatus were exposed to fluoxetine via spiked artificial sediment at a nominal concentration range between 0.15 and 5.86 mg/kg (dry weight). Additionally, a test was performed exposing P. antipodarum via water in a nominal concentration range between 0.64 and 400 mu g/L. As endpoints, emergence rate and timing, sex ratio, clutch numbers and clutch size of the midges, the number of worms in the oligochaete test, as well as the number of embryos in the snail test were monitored. For C. riparius, no clear substance-related effects were observed; for L. variegatus, the results indicated a slight increase in reproduction, which was statistically significant at nominal fluoxetine concentrations of 0.94 and 2.34 mg/kg. In P. antipodarum, the antidepressant reduced reproduction significantly. No observed effect concentration (NOEC) and 10% effect concentration (EC10) were determined to be 0.47 and 0.81 mu g/L, respectively, based on measured fluoxetine concentrations in water. These low values indicate that P. antipodarum and possibly other aquatic mollusks are sensitive to fluoxetine and that the drug might pose a risk to gastropod populations in the field.

AB Analytical technology is continuously improving, developing better methods for isolating and concentrating trace compounds in environmental samples. Polycyclic and nitro musks (PNMs) are one group of emerging trace compounds detected in municipal wastewater. Differences in sample storage, preparation, and extraction methods for their measurement have led to variability in results. We analyzed 11 PNMs by GC/MS and compared the results of different storage times and extraction methods (supercritical fluid (SFE) or microwave-assisted (MAE)) for 202 samples of primary sludge, waste activated sludge (WAS), raw sludge, and aerobically/anaerobically digested biosolids collected from Canadian municipal wastewater treatment plants. Sixty-three air-dried :samples were extracted by SEE, and 139 air-dried, centrifuged, or filtered samples were extracted by MAE. The mean Surrogate recoveries were 89%,, (standard deviation (SD) = 11%) for d(10)-anthracene by SFE and 88% (SD = 14%) for d(10)-phenanthrene by MAE. Storage study results showed that PNM concentrations changed by a mean of 7% and 9% for primary sludge and WAS respectively after four weeks and decreased up to 25% after 13.5 months of storage in amber glass containers at -18 degrees C. Air-drying of sludge at room temperature caused losses of about 50% of PNM concentrations compared to centrifugation. The proportions of PNMs present in the liquid phase of sludge samples were less than 5% compared to proportions in the sludge solids. The most complete liquid-solid separation was achieved by filtration of frozen/thawed sludge samples, producing a liquid phase that contained less than 1% of the total musk content of the sample.

AB Thermocatalytic low temperature conversion (LTC) is a new method for the disposal of sewage sludge. Using this method, sludge is converted into a residual solid (coal) along with reaction water, oil, and non-condensable gases. The oil can be used as an energy source and the coal as a substitute for charcoal. To this end, it is important to determine whether there are any easily available contaminants present in the coal generated by the process. Contaminants that can be strongly sorbed by sewage sludge solids are, e.g., pharmaceuticals and disinfectants. As an example the fate of the persistent and strong adsorbing disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) has been investigated within the LTC process. The sewage sludge was spiked with BAC and then subjected to the LTC process. The resulting coal was extracted and analyzed using LC-LC/ESI-MS/MS (ion trap). BAC could not be detected in the LTC coal, although it could be extracted from the spiked sludge before the LTC treatment. It can thus be concluded that the investigated compound is not easily available in the coal, and hence that its use does not present a risk.

AB The fate of C-14-labeled sulfamethoxazole and ace tyl-sulfamethoxazole in soil has been investigated with special respect to possible entry routes of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals into soil environments. Therefore, the stability of the test substances was monitored first in sewage sludge and bovine manure. Within the incubation period of 72 d, 1% at maximum of the initially applied radiotracers was released as C-14-carbon dioxide while 22 75% was transferred to non-extractable residues that were operationally defined by the ethyl acetate extraction. Test-sludge and test-manure samples with defined aged residues were prepared and, supplementary to standard solutions, applied to silty-clay soil samples. After standard and test-sludge application, soil/water distribution coefficients of Kd < 5 L kg(-1) were determined revealing both test substances as potential leachers. In contrast, the sorption of sulfamethoxazole increased after test-manure application (K-d > 10 L kg(-1)). In the long-term degradability tests, the metabolic fate of both test substances was characterized by the continuous decrease of extractable residues, resulting in disappearance times of DT90 <= 33 d, and the increase of non-extractable residues. Mineralization reached 11% at maximum. Thereby, the dynamics of these processes differed whether the test substances were applied via standard, test-sludge or test-manure application. This fact emphasized the relevance of entry route specific matrix effects on the fate of both test substances in soil.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent widely used in many personal care products. This study investigated the occurrence of TCS in effluents, biosolids and surface waters, and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The aqueous concentrations of TCS in nineteen effluents from Australian WWTPs ranged from 23 ng/L to 434 ng/L with a median concentration of 108 ng/L, while its concentrations in nineteen biosolids ranged from 0.09 mg/kg to 16.79 mg/kg on dry weight basis with a median concentration of 2.32 mg/kg. The removal rates for TCS in five selected WWTPs were found to range between 72% and 93%. Biological degradation was believed to be the predominant removal mechanism for TCS in the WWTPs. However, adsorption onto sludge also played a significant role in the removal of TCS in the WWTPs. TCS at concentrations up to 75 ng/L was detected in surface waters (outfall, upstream, and downstream) from five rivers receiving effluent discharge from WWTPs. Preliminary risk assessment based on the worst-case scenario showed that the TCS concentrations in surface waters might lead to risks to aquatic organisms such as algae. Based on the TCS levels in the biosolids, application of biosolids on agricultural land may also cause adverse effects in the soil environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nine selected antibiotics in the Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong and the Pearl River at Guangzhou, South China, were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the concentrations of antibiotics were mainly below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the marine water of Victoria Harbour. However, except for amoxicillin, all of the antibiotics were detected in the Pearl River during high and low water seasons with the median concentrations ranging from 11 to 67 ng/L, and from 66 to 460 ng/L, respectively; and the concentrations in early spring were about 2-15 times higher than that in summer with clearer diurnal variations. It was suggested that the concentrations of antibiotics in the high water season were more affected by wastewater production cycles due to quick refreshing rate, while those in the low water season may be more sensitive to the water column dynamics controlled by tidal processes in the river.

AB Pharmaceutical substances have been detected in sewage effluents as well as receiving waters in many parts of the world. In this study, the occurrence and removal of a number of drug compounds were studied within a large sewage treatment plant in the south of England. Samples were processed using solid phase extraction and analysed using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrate that ibuprofen, paracetamol, salbutamol and mefenamic acid were present in both the influent and effluent of the works while propranolol-HCl was not found above the limit of quantification in any sample. Elimination rates were circa 90% for each compound but several hundred nanograms per litre were still present in the final effluent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two different methods are proposed to perform the mass balance calculations of micropollutants in sewage treatment plants (STPs). The first method uses the measured data in both liquid and sludge phase and the second one uses the solid-water distribution coefficient NJ to calculate the concentrations in the sludge from those measured in the liquid phase. The proposed methodologies facilitate the identification of the main mechanisms involved in the elimination of micropollutants. Both methods are applied for determining mass balances of selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and their results are discussed. In that way, the fate of 2 musks (galaxolide and tonalide), 3 pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole), and 2 natural estrogens (estrone and 17 beta-estradiol) has been investigated along the different water and sludge treatment units of a STP. Ibuprofen, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole are biologically degraded in the aeration tank (50-70%), while musks are equally sorbed to the sludge and degraded. In contrast, estrogens are not removed in the STP studied. About 40% of the initial load of pharmaceuticals passes through the plant unaltered, with the fraction associated to sludge lower than 0.5%. In contrast, between 20 and 40% of the initial load of musks leaves the plant associated to solids, with less than 10% present in the final effluent. The results obtained show that the conclusions concerning the efficiency of micropollutants removal in a particular STP may be seriously affected by the calculation method used.

AB Ozonation has become more frequently used as oxidant to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxic substances in wastewater originating from different industrial processes. An ozonation pilot plant followed by two parallel biological filters are used to investigate the possibility to reduce the high concentration of refractory COD in the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, partly loaded with biologically treated wastewater from a large pharmaceutical industry. COD measurements are used to evaluate the overall reduction of organic matter, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and volatile fatty acids measurements are used for evaluation of the biodegradability of the remaining COD after ozonation. The impact of the ozone dose on the overall COD degradation and degradability of the remaining COD has been estimated. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurements confirm that parts of the COD are converted into biodegradable organic matter by ozonation. Biofilters following the ozonation plant secure that any degradable organic matter produced by ozonation is removed, which is confirmed from OUR-measurements.

AB We investigated the mobility and distribution of cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) in four contaminated soil profiles from Bangladesh. The sources of contamination of these profiles were tannery wastes, city sewage and the wastes of pharmaceutical and paper mill factories at different locations in Bangladesh. The samples were collected from the A-, B- and C-horizons of each profile: two sub-samples from the A-horizon at depths of 0-5 cm (A1) and > 5 cm (A2), and one sample each from the B- and C-horizons. Soil samples were analysed for total metal content by dissolution in aqua regia followed by sequential extraction of the fractions based on their varying solubility. There were six operationally defined groups of extraction sequences: water soluble (F1), exchangeable (F2), carbonate (F3), oxide (F4), organic (F5) and residual (F6). The total concentration of Cd, Ni and Zn in the A-horizon (0-5 cm) ranged from 0.10 to 0.62, from 31 to 54 and from 85 to 838 mg kg(-1), respectively. In the B- and C-horizons, the concentrations of these metals decreased many fold, particularly in the city sewage profile where the decrease for Cd and Zn was approximately fourfold. The distribution of metals among the chemical fractions depended on their total concentrations. In the A1-horizon, Cd had the highest mobility factor [MF = (F1+F2+F3)/(F1+F2+F3+F4+F5+F6) x 100] at 41-43% and Ni had the lowest at 3-13%, while Zn, showed intermediate values at 8-25%. The MF decreased with depth in all soil profiles. Among the fractions, the residual fraction contained the lowest levels of Cd but the highest levels of Ni and Zn. This state affected their relative mobility and distribution in soil profiles. Of the soil profiles, the mobility of all metals was higher in the city sewage soil than in any of the other three soils investigated, suggesting that the former may create a health risk by contaminating agricultural products and ground water as it also contained higher amounts of Cd and Zn.

AB While the 2005 progress report of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals stresses out the need of a dramatic increase in investment to meet the sanitation target in the third world, it is important to anticipate about some parallel negative impacts that may have this optimistic programme (extension of sewer networks without sufficient treatment works). Research was initiated on Lerma River (Mexico), subjected to many rejects disposal, to design a monitoring network and evaluate the impact of wastewaters on its water quality. The discharges was inventorized, geo-positioned with a GPS and mapped, while the physico-chemical characteristics of the river water, its tributaries and main rejects were evaluated. Microtox system was used as an additional screening tool. Along the 60 km of the High Course of Lerma River (HCLR), 51 discharges, with a diameter or width larger than 0.3 m (including 7 small tributaries) were identified. Based on the inventory, a monitoring network of 21 sampling stations in the river and 13 in the important discharges (> 2 m) was proposed. A great similitude was found between the average characteristics of the discharges and the river itself, in both the wet and dry seasons. Oxygen was found exhausted (< 0.5 mg/L) almost all along the high course of the river, with COD and TDS average levels of 390 and 1980 mg/L in the dry season, against 150 and 400 mg/L in the wet season. In the dry season, almost all the sites along the river revealed some toxicity to the bacteria test species (2.9 to 150 TU, with an average of 27 TU). Same septic conditions and toxicity levels were observed in many of the discharges. Four of the six evaluated tributaries, as well as the lagoon (origin of the river), were relatively in better conditions (2 to 8 mg/L D.O., TU < 1) than for the Lerma, acting as diluents and renewal of the HCLR flow rate. The river was shown to be quite a main sewer collector. The high surface water contamination by untreated wastewaters that is depicted in this research should be taken into account in the Millennium Goals strategies, by promoting treatment plan works simultaneously, when sewer networks in the third world would extend.

AB Ninety eight pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds (POOCs) that were amended to samples of chlorinated drinkingwater were extracted and analyzed 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 days after amendment to determine whether the total chlorine residual reacted with the amended POOCs in drinking water in a time frame similar to the residence time of drinking water in a water distribution system.
   Results indicated that if all 98 were present in the finished drinking water from a drinking-water treatment plant using free chlorine at 1.2 mg/L as the distribution system disinfectant residual, 52 POOCs would be present in the drinking water after 10 days at approximately the same concentration as in the newly finished drinking water. Concentrations of 16 POOCs would be reduced by 32% to 92%, and 22 POOCs would react completely with residual chlorine within 24 h. Thus, the presence of free chlorine residual is an effective means for transforming some POOCs during distribution. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports on the toxic effects of 35-days intragastric perfusion of pharmaceutical wastewater on the male reproductive system of Mus musculus. Flow cytometric analyses and staining with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) were used to assess the toxicity on spermatogenic cells. Significant depletions in the relative percentages of elongated spermatid (HC), diploid spermatogonia (2C), and S-phase cells were observed. These alterations in different germ cell populations were reflected in the various germ cell ratios. The ratios of 1C: 4C and HC: 2C showed a significant decline after pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, while the 4C:2C and 1C:2C ratios increased significantly. FDA and PI staining displayed reduced viability of spen-natogenic cells in wastewater treated group. Statistically significant percentages of sperm abnormalities showed the genotoxic potential of this pharmaceutical wastewater. Testicular histopathological studies of treated animals revealed expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells. Thus, the present study has established the toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater on the reproductive biology of male mice.

AB The primary objective of this study was to determine the presence of unregulated organic chemicals in reclaimed water using complementary targeted and broad spectrum approaches. Eleven of 12 targeted human pharmaceuticals, antioxidants, and plasticizers, and 27 tentatively identified non-target organic chemicals, were present in secondary effluent entering tertiary treatment trains at a wastewater treatment plant and two water reclamation facilities. The removal of these compounds by three different tertiary treatment trains was investigated: coagulant-assisted granular media filtration (California Title-22 water, 22 CCR 60301-60357; Barclay [2006]), lime clarification/reverse osmosis (lime/RO), and microfiltration-reverse osmosis (MF/RO). Carbamazepine, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, p-toluenesulfonamide, caffeine, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA) were present at low to high nanogram-per-liter levels in Title 22 water. The lime/RO product waters contained lower concentrations of clofibric acid, ibuprofen, caffeine, BHA, and N-BBSA (< 10 to 71 ng/L) than their Title 22 counterparts. The MF/RO treatment reduced concentrations to levels below their detection limits, although BHT was present in MF/RO product water from one facility. The presence of the target analytes in two surface waters used as raw drinking water sources and a recharged groundwater was also examined. Surface waters used as raw drinking water sources contained caffeine, BHA, BHT, and N-BBSA, while recharged groundwater contained BHT, BHA, and N-BBSA. Nontarget compounds in recharged groundwater appeared to be attenuated with increased residence time in the aquifer.

AB The potential risks associated with antibiotics present in the Swedish environment were assessed using concentrations found in hospital effluent, and sewage treatment waters and sludge, in combination with data on their environmental effects obtained from the literature. For the aqueous environment, measured environmental concentrations and effect/no observed effect concentration ratios were much lower than one in most cases. The only exceptions, where concentrations of the investigated substances were high enough to pose potential risks, were the concentrations of the two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, in the hospital effluent. Treating digested dewatered sludge by heat did not fully eliminate norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin, thus pellets may still contain high amounts of these substances (sub to low mg kg(-1) dw). In leaching tests less than 1% of the amounts of these fluoroquinolones in the sludge or pellets reached the aqueous phase, indicating that their mobility is limited if sludge is used to fertilize soil.

AB Trimethoprim (TMP), one of the antibacterials most frequently detected in municipal wastewaters and surface waters, reacts readily with free available chlorine (i.e., HOCl) at pH values between 3 and 9 (e.g., the pH-dependent apparent second-order rate constant, k"(app) = 5.6 x 10(1) M-1 s(-1), at pH 7). Solution pH significantly affects the rate of TMP reaction with HOCl. The reaction kinetics in reagent water systems can be well described by a second-order kinetic model incorporating speciation of both reactants and accounting for acid-mediated halogenation of TMP's 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety. Studies with the substructure model compounds 2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene show that TMP reacts with HOCl primarily via its 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety at acidic pH, and with its 2,4-diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at circumneutral and alkaline pH. LC/MS product analyses indicate that the TMP structure is not substantially degraded upon reactions with HOCl. Instead, a wide variety of (multi) chlorinated and hydroxylated products are formed. Experiments with real drinking water and wastewater matrixes confirmed that substantial TMP transformation can be expected for conditions typical of wastewater and drinking water chlorination.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were compared with conventional activated sludge systems (CAS) for micropollutant degradation, in laboratory-scale spiking experiments with synthetic and real domestic wastewater. The target micropollutants were polar in nature and represented a broad range in biodegradability. The experimental data indicated that MBR treatment could significantly enhance removal of the micropollutants 1,6- and 2,7-naphthalene disulfonate (NDSA) and benzothiazole-2-sulfonate. 1,5-NDSA, EDTA and diclofenac were not removed in either the MBR or the CAS. The other compounds were equally well degraded in both systems. For 1,3-naphthalene disulfonate, the existence of a minimum threshold level for degradation could be demonstrated. Although MBRs could not always make a difference in the overall removal efficiencies achieved, they showed reduced lag phases for degradation and a stronger memory effect, which implies that they may respond quicker to variable influent concentrations. Finally, micropollutant removal also turned out to be less sensitive to system operational variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the recent emergence of endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs) as an important potable drinking water and reclaimed wastewater quality issue, our study has investigated the removal of EDC/PPCP`s of 27 compounds by nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes from various drinking water sources using a dead-end stirred-cell filtration system. Experiments were performed at environmentally relevant initial EDC/PPCP concentrations ranging typically from 2 to < 150 ng/L. EDC/PPCP retention was quantified by liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. We have observed a general separation trend due to hydrophobic adsorption as a function of octanol-water partition coefficient between the hydrophobic compounds and porous hydrophobic membrane during the membrane filtration. The results have showed that both hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion mechanisms are dominant to retain EDC/PPCP for the NF membrane, while the UF membrane retained typically hydrophobic EDC/PPCPs due mainly to hydrophobic adsorption.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals represent two classes of emerging contaminants that are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater effluents. Some of these contaminants have been shown to impact aquatic organisms at trace concentrations (i.e., ng/L). Moreover, the public has expressed human health concerns regarding the presence of emerging contaminants in water reuse projects. The primary objective of this investigation was to determine the efficacy of various membranes and activated carbons for the removal of endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. A suite of structurally diverse target compounds was selected for evaluation based largely upon occurrence and molecular structure. Several membrane types and applications were evaluated at pilot- and/or full-scale, including: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis reversal, membrane bioreactors and combinations of membranes in series. Granular activated carbon was evaluated at bench-scale using rapid small scale column tests and at two full-scale utilities. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration were found to reject very few target compounds; however, some loss of steroidal type compounds was observed. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis were capable of significant rejection of nearly all target compounds, though compounds were detectable at trace levels in permeates. Granular activated carbon was highly effective at removing all target chemicals. However, break-through curves clearly demonstrated that compounds with greater hydrophilicity breach activated carbon faster than hydrophobic compounds. In full-scale applications, the impact of regeneration was observed as activated carbon filters that received regular regeneration had minimal breakthrough of organic contaminants, while non-regenerated filters displayed no removal of target compounds. Findings confirm that membrane and carbon processes are capable of greatly reducing the concentrations of emerging contaminants; however, several compounds are detectable in membrane permeate and carbon effluent.

AB Antibiotics, such as sulfirdiazine, reach agricultural soils directly through manure of grazing livestock or indirectly through the spreading of manure or sewage sludge on the field. Knowledge about the fate of antibiotics in soils is crucial for assessing the environmental risk of these compounds, including possible transport to the groundwater. Transport of (14)C-labelled sulfadiazine was investigated in disturbed soil columns at a constant flow rate of 0.26 cm h(-1) near saturation. Sulfadiazine was applied in different concentrations for either a short or a long pulse duration. Breakthrough curves of sulfadiazine and the nonreactive tracer chloride were measured. At the end of the leaching period the soil concentration profiles were determined. The peak maxima of the breakthrough curves were delayed by a factor of 2 to 5 compared to chloride and the decreasing limbs are characterized by an extended tailing. However, the maximum relative concentrations differed as well as the eluted mass fractions, ranging from 18 to 83% after 500 h of leaching. To identify relevant sorption processes, breakthrough curves of sulfadiazine were fitted with a convective-dispersive transport model, considering different sorption concepts with one, two and three sorption sites. Breakthrough curves can be fitted best with a three-site sorption model, which includes two reversible kinetic and one irreversible sorption site. However, the simulated soil concentration profiles did not match the observations for all of the used models. Despite this incomplete process description, the obtained results have implications for the transport behavior of sulfadiazine in the field. Its leaching may be enhanced if it is frequently applied at higher concentrations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution of DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni and Zn in four profile samples collected from areas contaminated with wastes from tannery, city sewage, pharmaceutical and paper mills located at different places in Bangladesh was investigated. Soil samples were analysed for the total and their DTPA-extractable metal contents. The total concentration of metals in the soil horizons ranged from 0.07 to 0.62 mg kg(-1) for Cd, 31 to 54 mg kg(-1) for Ni and 59 to 838 mg kg(-1) for Zn, respectively. These metal concentrations were highest in the surface and lowest in the subsurface horizons. This trend was also observed for the DTPA-extractable amounts of these metals. The relative extractability, expressed as the ratio of DTPA to total contents (aqua regia-extractable) was :33 to 46% for Cd, 2 to 10% for Ni and 3 to 28% for Zn, respectively, in the Al horizon, while in the B and C horizons the ratios decreased gradually as did total concentration, indicating that metal contamination was primarily limited to the surface horizon. For all three metals, the above mentioned ratio was highest in the city sewage soil and the lowest in. the paper mill soil. In general, the extent of contamination among the profiles investigated was in the following order: city sewage > tannery > > pharmaceutical > paper mill soil. Higher ratios of DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni and Zn in the city sewage soil than the other soils may create a risk for the contamination of agricultural products and ground water.

AB The antimicrobial agent triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol; TCS) is a member of a larger group of polychlorinated binuclear aromatic compounds frequently associated with adverse environmental and human health effects. Whereas the structure and function of TCS would suggest significant resistance to biotransformation, biological wastewater treatment currently is considered the principal destructive mechanism limiting dispersal of and environmental contamination with this compound. We explored the persistence of TCS in a typical full-scale activated sludge US sewage treatment plant using a mass balance approach in conjunction with isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ID-LC-ESI-MS) for accurate quantification. Average influent and effluent concentrations (mean +/- SD) of 4.7 +/- 1.6 and 0.07 +/- 0.06 mu g l(-1), respectively, revealed an apparent (liquid-phase) removal efficiency of 98 +/- 1%. However, further analyses demonstrated that the particle-active TCS (80 +/- 22% particle-associated in influent) was sequestered into wastewater residuals and accumulated in dewatered, digested sludge to concentrations of 30000 +/- 11000 mu g kg(-1). Overall, 50 +/- 19% (1640 +/- 610 g d(-1)) of the disinfectant mass entering the plant (3240 +/- 1860 g d(-1)) remained detectable in sludge, and less than half of the total mass (48 +/- 19%) was biotransformed or lost to other mechanisms. Thus, conventional sewage treatment was demonstrated to be much less effective in destroying the antimicrobial than the aqueous-phase removal efficiency of the plant would make believe. Furthermore, study findings indicate that the common practice of sludge recycling in agriculture results in the transfer of substantial quantities of TCS to US soils used, in part, for animal husbandry and crop production.

AB In this study the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products which are irrigated on arable land with treated municipal waste-water was investigated. In Braunschweig, Germany, wastewater has been irrigated continuously for more than 45 years. In the winter time only the effluent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) of Braunschweig is used for irrigation, while during summer digested sludge is mixed with the effluent. In the present case study six wells and four lysimeters located in one of the irrigated agricultural fields were monitored with regard to the occurrence of 52 pharmaceuticals and two personal care products (PPCPs; e.g. betablockers, antibiotics, antiphlogistics, carbamazepine, musk fragrances, iodinated contrast media (ICM) and estrogens). No differences in PPCP pollution of the groundwater were found due to irrigation of STP effluents with and without addition of digested sludge, because many polar compounds do not sorb to sludge and lipophilic compounds are not mobile in the soil-aquifer. Most of the selected PPCPs were never detected in any of the lysimeter or groundwater samples, although they were present in the treated wastewater irrigated onto the fields. In the groundwater and lysimeter samples primarily the ICM diatrizoate and iopamidol, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were detected up to several mu g l(-1), while the acidic pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, estrogens and betablockers were likely sorbed or transformed while passing the top soil layer. Potential estrogenic effects are likely to disappear after irrigation, since the most potent steroid estrogens were not measurable. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study attempts to provide an improved approach for the analysis of antibiotics, which normally exist at low concentration in complex matrices such as receiving streams of wastewater treatment plant discharge. The analytical method developed in this study combines an existing pretreatment technique of solid-phase extraction (SPE) with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MSD) through on-line connection. The on-line connection suppressed the target loss by keeping the cartridge from drying, which resulted in improvement of the recovery and saving of the analytical time. For the on-line solid-phase extraction of 10 ml water samples, recoveries were between 74.3% and 116.5% and average LOQ was 0.11 mu g l(-1) for the sulfonamide antibiotics (SA) and 0.09 mu g l(-1) for the tetracycline antibiotics (TA). Application of the developed method for the analysis of fourteen antibiotics revealed that several antibiotics were detected at concentrations above the LOQ in ARW. Treated and untreated sewage and agricultural wastewater were mostly responsible for the antibiotics contamination of the river. Antibiotics were detected at much higher concentrations in the agricultural wastewater sample than in the sewage sample, implying substantial use of antibiotics in the agricultural industry. Wastewater treatment was generally effective in separation of the antibiotics tested in this study. The extent of the treatment depended on the type of antibiotics. Hydrophobic antibiotics were more effectively separated from the solution than hydrophilic antibiotics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A one-year monitoring study was performed to evaluate the occurrence, persistence and fate of a group of 14 organic compounds in a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in the south of Spain. These results are part of a more extensive study, financed by the Spanish Ministry of Research with the aim to evaluate the traceability of new pollutants on the Mediterranean coast and to determine the removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants (STP) for these pollutants. The compounds which have been analyzed include pharmaceuticals of various therapeutic categories (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, dipyrone, diclofenac, carbamazepine and codeine), pesticides (chlorfenvinfos and permethrin), caffeine, triclosan, bisphenol A and three of their more relevant metabolites (1,7-dimethylxanthine, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide and 2,7/2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). An SPE/GC-MS multi-residue analytical method was developed and validated to facilitate simultaneous determination of these compounds in both influent and effluent wastewater. The method provided mean recoveries higher than 75%, with the exception of 2,7/2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, dipyrone and permethrin which exhibited recoveries lower than 22%. The overall variability of the method was below 14%. The method detection limit (LOD) was between 1 and 100 ng l(-1) and precision, which was calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), ranged from 1.8% to 11.2%. The application of the proposed method has allowed the identification of all the target compounds at mean concentrations which ranged from 0.12 to 134 mu g l(-1) in the influent and from 0.09 to 18.0 mu g l(-1) in the effluent. The removal efficiencies of the STP for these compounds varied from 20% (carbamazepine) to 99% (acetaminophen), but in all cases resulted insufficient in order to avoid their presence in treated water and subsequently in the environment.

AB An effective analytical method for simultaneously determining 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 28 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), and 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has been developed to measure their concentrations in the Mississippi river waters in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The method involves the simultaneous extraction of the selected PAHs, PCBs, and PPCPs, from the aqueous phase by solid phase extraction using two-layer disks consisting of C-18 and SDB-XC, and collection of suspended solid in water samples by 0.2-0.6 mu m filter in a single step. Target compounds adsorbed on the extraction disks were eluted with methanol, acetone, and dichloromethane. The suspended particles retained by the filter were sonically extracted using the same solvents. GC/MS was used for quantification of PAHs and PCBs directly and of PPCPs after derivatization. The analytical method was used in a 6-month field study of the Mississippi river water for contamination by PAHs, PCBs, and PPCPs and the following concentrations (ng/l) have been obtained: clofibric acid (3.2-26.7), ibuprofen (0-34.0), acetaminophen (24.7-65.2), caffeine (0-38.0), naproxen (0-135.2), triclosan (8.8-26.3), bisphenol A (0-147.2), carbamazepine (42.9-113.7), estrone (0-4.7), 17 beta-estradiol (0-4.5), total PAHs (62.9-144.7), and total PCBs (22.2-163.4).

AB A mixture of seven common pharmaceutical agents (acetaminophen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, and triclosan) was tested for its effects on the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca over three generations. The target concentration of each chemical (100 ng 1(-1)) was representative of the upper range observed for these substances in Canadian fresh waters, except in the immediate vicinity of effluent discharges. No statistically significant effects were observed on survival, mating, body size or reproduction. The sex ratio changed slightly to 17% more males. The seven pharmaceuticals tested do not appear to be substances of major concern for Hyalella in most Canadian fresh waters, but significant impacts might be observed in areas closer to effluent discharges.

AB Acidic aqueous solutions of clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid), the bioactive metabolite of various lipid-regulating drugs, have been degraded by indirect electrooxidation methods such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton with Fe2+ as catalyst using an undivided electrolytic cell with a Pt anode and an O-2-diffusion cathode able to electrogenerate H2O2. At pH 3.0 about 80% of mineralization is achieved with the electro-Fenton method due to the efficient production of oxidant hydroxyl radical from Fenton's reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2, but stable Fe3+ complexes are formed. The photoelectro-Fenton method favors the photodecomposition of these species under UVA irradiation, reaching more than 96% of decontamination. The mineralization current efficiency increases with rising metabolite concentration up to saturation and with decreasing current density. The photoelectro-Fenton method is then viable for treating acidic wastewaters containing this pollutant. Comparative degradation by anodic oxidation (without Fe2+) yields poor decontamination. Chloride ion is released during all degradation processes. The decay kinetics of clofibric acid always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction, with a similar rate constant in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton that increases with rising current density, but decreases at greater metabolite concentration. 4-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol, along with carboxylic acids such as 2-hydroxyisobutyric, tartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic and oxalic, are detected as intermediates. The ultimate product is oxalic acid, which forms very stable Fe3+-oxalato complexes under electro-Fenton conditions. These complexes are efficiently photodecarboxylated in photoclectro-Fenton under the action of UVA light. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceuticals present in the municipal sewage reach the municipal sewage treatment plants, but most often fail to be completely removed in there. Therefore, in the case where they constitute a substantial part of the sewage stream (hospitals, clinics, pharmacological production plants) their chemical pretreatment seems justifiable. A method based on the modification of Fenton's reaction has been suggested. It consisted in replacing peroxide hydrogen with compressed air and enhancing the reaction by UV rays and copper cations CU+2 as catalysts. All the process parameters have been determined experimentally. The possibility of implementing the method in industry has been taken into consideration, therefore the values of the parameters such as pH and aeration intensity were established on a lower level despite the fact that their higher values were more effective.

AB The occurrence of 15 antibiotics belonging to three different groups, tetracyclines (TCs), sulfonamides (SAs), and macrolides (MLs), mainly used to prevent or treat illness for humans and also to control disease or to promote the growth for animals was studied in aqueous and sediment matrices. The result of spatial and temporal statistical analysis revealed that measured concentrations of individual antibiotics were significantly different depending on sampling location and time periods for aqueous and sediment samples. High concentrations of human-used antibiotics were detected downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, and animal-used antibiotics were mainly found in a region with significant agricultural activity. Generally, the highest concentrations of antibiotics for both water and sediment samples were measured in winter indicating that low flow conditions and cold-water temperatures might enhance the persistence of these compounds. Furthermore, a pseudo-partitioning coefficient (P-PC) was introduced to provide a better understanding of the partitioning of antibiotics into the sediment. Different P-PC values were found depending on the sorption characteristics of the individual antibiotics. Sediment samples showed a greater detection frequency and a much higher concentration compared to aqueous samples taken at the same site. Since microorganism antibiotic resistance can develop in sediments, the importance of analyzing this matrix is underscored.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used as antidepressant medications. primarily in the treatment of clinical depression. They are among the pharmaceuticals most often Prescribed in the industrialized countries. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are compounds with an identical mechanism of action in mammals (inhibit reuptake of serotonin), and they have been found in different aqeous as well as biological samples collected in the environment. In the present study, we tested the toxicities of five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) as single substances and of citalopram, fluoxetine. and sertraline in binary mixtures in two standardized bioassays. Test organisms were the freshwater algae Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. In algae, test median effect concentrations (EC50s) ranged from 0.027 to 1.6 mg/L, and in daphnids, test EC50s ranged from 0.92 to 20 mg/L, with sertraline being one of the most toxic compounds. The test design and statistical analysis of results from mixture tests were based on isobole analysis. It was demonstrated that the mixture toxicity of the SSRIs in the two bioassays is predictable by the model of concentration addition. Therefore, in risk assessment based on chemical analysis of environmental samples, it is important to include the effect of all SSRIs that are present at low concentrations. and the model of concentration addition may be used to predict the combined effect of the mixture of SSRIs.

AB Swine wastewater is not easily treated in biological wastewater treatment plants. One reason is that some antibiotics are not easily degradable in a normal treatment system and inhibit the biological organisms in the treatment system. Specifically, tetracycline, sulfathiazole, and ampicillin are representative antibiotics found in poultry wastewater. To degrade these refractory and impediment antibiotics more easily, a special method is needed, such as an enzyme method. This research used a special enzyme in an experiment that tested feasibility with an enzyme assay of biological treatment in vitro. The Glutathion S- Transferases ( GSTs) are a family of proteins that catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione with a variety of hydrophobic chemicals containing electrophilic centers. Using GSTs, these major antibiotics were transformed into components that were non-toxic to the microorganisms that treat manure wastewater. The initial concentration of tetracycline, sulfathiazole, and ampicillin were 100 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 50 mg/L, respectively, and the concentration of pig feed was the same as usual. The GSTs have made the effect of biotransformation of antibiotics as their mode. They were 60 - 70% transformed by GSTs at the end of the degradation reaction. This lowered their inhibitory strength against microorganisms.

AB The identification and quantification of effluent toxicity plays an important role in the evaluation of harmful impacts on the aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the advantages of using the 'whole-effluent' toxicity approach compared to prediction of toxicity using key toxic compounds. An underestimation of 'whole-effluent' toxicity was always observed using bacteria, but in some cases the sum of individual toxic units was more accurate using daphnids. Good agreement was found in testing the wastewater from a chemical factory. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of using the 'whole-effluent' toxicity approach for the reliable assessment of wastewater quality.

AB A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the determination of selected pharmaceutical residues ( carbamazepine, salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and triclosan) in sewage influent and roughly primary-treated effluent. The method involved solid-phase extraction (SPE) with polymeric sorbents, and two SPE cartridges were compared for the extraction and elution of the targeted compounds in complex matrices. A successful chemical derivatization of carbamazepine and acidic compounds using N,O-bis( trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide +10% trimethylchlorosilane is also described. The quantification limits of the analytical procedure ranged from 30 to 60 ngL(-1) for 500 mL of wastewater. The best recovery rates (72-102%) in spiked effluent samples were obtained with Phenomenex Strata-X(TM) cartridges. Detection limits (S/N=3) were estimated at between 1 and 18 ng L-1. The reported GC-MS/MS method significantly reduces the strong matrix effects encountered with more expensive LC-MS/MS techniques. Application of the developed method showed that most selected analytes were detected at concentrations ranging from low mu g L-1 to trace level ng L-1 in Montreal's wastewater treatment plant effluent and influent, as well as in the receiving waters at more than 8 km downstream of the effluent outfall. The rugged alternative analytical method is suitable for the simultaneous analysis of carbamazepine and pharmaceutical acidic residues in wastewater samples from influents and effluents that have undergone rough primary treatment.

ID ANTIBIOTICS; WATER
AB The preoxidation of a highly polluted waste pharmaceutical fermentation broth using wet air oxidation (WAO) has been studied as a possible method for the effective removal of organics. The applied (pre)treatment method should enhance the biotreatability of the pharmaceutical fermentation broth in terms of reduced initial toxicity and higher biodegradability. Preliminary experiments in the pilot biological treatment plant were successful only at low organic loads, whereas the system collapses at higher ones. The characterization of the fermentation broth was started by common physicochemical analysis, whereas several bioassays were used to determine its impact on biological treatment plants and the environment. Toxicity prior to and after WAO was determined using the acute Vibrio fischeri test, measurement of inhibition Of O-2 consumption, and the Daphnia magna acute test. Ready biodegradability of the treated and untreated broth has also been assessed. WAO experiments were accomplished in the 2 L batch reactor at different temperatures (240/280 degrees C) and operating pressures. WAO experiments confirmed reduction of the toxicity toward microorganisms, whereas oxidized wastewater was more toxic to daphnids. Biodegradability of the oxidized broth has also been enhanced. Further work has been focused on designing appropriate combination of WAO and biological processes.

AB Effluent from sewage treatment plants has been associated with a range of pollutant effects. Depending on the influent composition and treatment processes the effluent may contain a myriad of different chemicals which makes monitoring very complex. In this study we aimed to monitor relatively polar organic pollutant mixtures using a combination of passive sampling techniques and a set of biochemistry based assays covering acute bacterial toxicity (Microtox (TM)), phytotoxicity (Max-I-PAM assay) and genotoxicity (umuC assay). The study showed that all of the assays were able to detect effects in the samples and allowed a comparison of the two plants as well as a comparison between the two sampling periods. Distinct improvements in water quality were observed in one of the plants as result of an upgrade to a UV disinfection system, which improved from 24x sample enrichment required to induce a 50% response in the Microtox (TM) assay to 84x, from 30x sample enrichment to induce a 50% reduction in photosynthetic yield to 125x, and the genotoxicity observed in the first sampling period was eliminated. Thus we propose that biochemical assay techniques in combination with time integrated passive sampling can substantially contribute to the monitoring of polar organic toxicants in STP effluents.

AB A solid phase extraction (SPE) method has been developed and applied in conjunction with a previously reported liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) procedure for the determination of illicit drugs and abused pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater and surface water samples at the ng L-1 level. A full method validation was also performed and determined levels of analytical sensitivity were found to lie in the 1-10 ng L-1 range using river water as a test sample matrix and a sample size of 500 mL. The developed procedure was successfully applied for the determination of the chosen analytes in wastewater treatment plants in Dublin, Ireland and rapidly expanding commuter towns in the surrounding counties. Cocaine was detected in 70% of the collected samples in the range of 25-489 ng L-1, its primary metabolite, benzoylecognine (BZE) was also detected in the range of 22-290 ng L-1. Other substances detected included morphine, Tempazepam and the primary metabolite of methadone.

AB The present work provides a multi-residue analytical method for determining a selection of 20 pharmaceuticals from diverse therapeutical classes in hospital effluent wastewater. The method is based on the simultaneous extraction of the target compounds by solid phase extraction (SPE), followed by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) analysis. Using TOF-MS, accurate mass measurements within 2 ppm error were obtained for most of the pharmaceuticals studied. Empirical formula information can be obtained by this method, allowing the unequivocal identification of the target compounds in the samples. Validation studies showed that LC-TOF-MS analysis is a valuable new tool for identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Recoveries, using Oasis HLB cartridges at pH 7, were higher than 75% for all pharmaceuticals, except for ranitidine, 4-methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAA), cefotaxime and omeprazole, which needed specific pH conditions for their extraction. Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression of the response were observed. For most of the compounds ion suppression was less than 39 %, except for metronidazole, carbarnazepine 10, 11-epoxide, naproxen and erythromycin, where the signal suppression was 42%, 59%, 46% and 95%, respectively. A simple and effective approach to minimize or avoid matrix interferences was the I : 4 dilution of the SPE extracts. Method detection limits (MDLs) and quantification limits (MQLs) ranged between 4-115 ng l(-1) and 14-384 ng l(-1); respectively. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), ranged from 1.1-19.8% and 1.7-21.7% for intra- and inter-day, respectively. The developed analytical method was applied to the analysis of hospital effluent wastewater during a survey study. 18 of the 20 pharmaceuticals studied were detected at concentration levels of mu g l(-1), reaching in some cases concentrations over 100 mu g l(-1), and in the case of the analgesic and antipyretic dipyrone metabolite, higher than 1000 mu g l(-1).

AB The mass flows of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were studied in the aqueous compartment of the river Somes in Romania. PPCPs were measured in wastewater treatment effluents and in the receiving river water. The analytical method for the determination of PPCPs in river water was based on solid phase extraction and GC-ITMS. Carbamazepine, pentoxyfylline, ibuprofen, diazepam, galaxotide, tonalide and triclosan were determined in wastewater effluents with individual concentrations ranging from 15 to 774 ng L-1. Caffeine was measured at concentrations up to 42 560 ng L-1. Due to the high contamination of WWTP effluents, the receiving river was also polluted. The most abundant PPCPs measured in the Somes were caffeine, galaxolide, carbamazepine and triclosan. They were present at all the 15 sampling sites along the Somes, the concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 ng L-1. The concentrations in the effluents of the different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) varied considerably and the differences are due to different elimination efficiencies of the studied PPCPs during sewage treatment. Only one of 5 WWTPs studied, the WWTP in Cluj-Napoca, was working properly, and therefore technical measures have to be taken for upgrading the WWTPs and reducing the environmental load of micropollutants. This study is the first overview of PPCPs along on Romanian part of river Somes.

AB The occurrence of twenty pharmaceutical compounds was quantitatively determined in effluents from two major Oslo city hospitals, Rikshospitalet and Ulleval, along with influent, sludge and final effluent from the city's VEAS wastewater treatment works ( WTW). Composite hospital effluents were collected over a twelve week period and were showed to contain paracetamol, metoprolol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, 17 beta-Estradiol, estriol, estrone, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, doxycycline, chlorotetracycline, demeclocycline, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Three pharmaceuticals were not detected above the limit of detection; cefuroxime, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and meclocycline. Composite influent, sludge and effluent samples were collected from VEAS WTW over a seven week period. The influent into VEAS WTW contained all of the same selected substances detected in the hospital effluents, except for oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline, demeclocycline, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. The percentage of pharmaceuticals entering the works from the hospitals was <10% for all of the selected compounds. VEAS sludge samples contained a different pro. le of substances reflecting their physico-chemical properties. Hydrophobic antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, were detected in all of the collected sludge samples. Their absence in the collected influent samples suggests that they enter the works bound to effluent particles, with the dissolved fraction observed in the hospital effluents partitioning onto particulate matter within the sewerage network. The final effluent from VEAS WTW contained reduced concentrations of many pharmaceuticals, including paracetamol, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. For other compounds, such as metoprolol, diclofenac and trimethoprim, there were often higher concentrations in the effluent than the influent. These effluent concentrations represent median inputs varying from low g day(-1) ( e. g. paracetamol and ibuprofen) to nearly 200 g day(-1) ( e. g. metoprolol and trimethoprim) into Oslofjord. A simple risk assessment showed that the antibiotic ciprofloxacin may at times pose an acute risk to the Oslofjord aquatic environment.

AB Pseudomonas pseudomallei EBN- 10 strain, previously isolated from a local pharmaceutical industry's wastewater, was spontaneously adapted to higher p- nitrophenol ( PNP) levels, which then was subjected to gamma ray- inducedmutagenesis; the efficient isolates hence obtained were designated as EBN- 11 and EBN- 12, respectively. EBN- 12 mutant strain could completely mineralize PNP ( 100 mg/ L) on the minimal media in 24 h while, the parent strain utilized only 6% of it. Addition of glucose as co- substrate further increased the PNP degradation rate; however, phenol inclusion inhibited the degradation process. Ammonium sulphate was experienced as the best of the nitrogen sources used by EBN- 12 mutant strain, while degrading PNP.

AB The elimination of sulfonamides, macrolides and trimethoprim from raw wastewater was investigated in several municipal wastewater treatment plants. Primary treatment provided no significant elimination for the investigated Substances. Similar eliminations were observed in the secondary treatment of two conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems and a fixed-bed reactor (FBR). Sulfamethoxazole, including the fraction present as N-4-acetyl-sulfainethoxazole, was eliminated by approximately 60% in comparison to about 80% in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) independently of the solid retention time (SRT), indicating a positive correlation of the observed elimination to the organic substrate concentration. The elimination for macrolides and trimethoprim varied significantly between the different sampling campaigns in the two CAS systems and in the FBR. In the MBR, these analytes were eliminated up to 50% at SRTof 16 +/- 2 and 33 +/- 3 d. Trimethoprim, clarithromycin and dehydro-erythromycin showed a higher elimination of up to 90% at a SRT of 60-80 d indicating a correlation with reduced substrate loading (SL). Together with the high SRT, the SL may lead to an increased biodiversity of the active biomass, resulting in a broader range of degradation pathways available. Two investigated sand filters showed different elimination behavior. One led to a significant elimination of most macrolides (17-23%) and trimethoprim (74 +/- 14%), while no elimination was observed in the other sand filter investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment is a rapidly emerging international issue A variety of drugs have been found in sewage effluents and surface waters in Europe, the United States, and Canada This study examines the presence of selected pharmaceuticals (8 acidic drugs) and the antimicrobial substance, triclosan, in raw water and finished water of drinking water plants across southern Ontario Twenty drinking water treatment plants that represented a variety of water sources and treatment process parameters were sampled None of the raw or finished water samples taken from wells showed detectable levels of any of the acidic drugs or triclosan River water samples downstream of sewage effluent outfalls showed the highest levels of contamination of the source water Levels of naproxen and Ibuprofen were elevated to levels as high as 176 and 150 ng/L, respectively, in raw water entering the treatment plants from a river source Low levels of gemfibrozil (19 2 ng/L), diclofenac (15 ng/L), indomethacin (6 ng/L), and the antimicrobial triclosan (34 ng/L) could be also detected in raw water from river sources Raw water taken from large lakes also had very low but detectable levels of several acidic drugs, suggesting that these chemicals are widespread in the environment Although treatment systems are not designed to remove these specific types of substances, most of the acidic drugs were not detectable in finished waters Naproxen and triclosan were detectable in finished water but were significantly reduced in concentration relative to the raw water The concentration of ibuprofen was detectable in the finished water of almost all treatment plants that used surface water as a source This work demonstrates the potential of Ontario source waters, particularly river water sources, to contain trace levels of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products There is a need to complete a more comprehensive assessment of these compounds in source waters and of the factors influencing their treatment and removal from finished drinking water

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds have been detected in North America and Europe in groundwater, surface water, wastewater, and drinking water In the province of Quebec in Canada, there has been little data to assess the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment In August of 2005, samples of surface water were collected at 10 sites along the Yamaska River basin in Quebec, which passes through important agricultural areas and receives wastewater from several urban centers with populations ranging up to 44,000 residents Several acidic drugs (naproxen, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil), neutral drugs (caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine), and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were detected in the majority of the surface water samples The antidepressant fluoxetine (neutral/basic drug) was not detected in any samples, while acetaminophen (acidic drug) was detected at only two sites, and sulfapyridine (sulfonamide antibiotic) was detected at only one site Sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were present at the highest maximum concentrations of 578 ng/L and 106 ng/L, respectively The concentrations of most of the target pharmaceutically active compounds observed in surface water samples within the watershed were generally consistent with the number of people in urban centers near the sampling sites when compared with other studies in urban watersheds However, carbamazepine, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole were present at surprisingly high concentrations for some of the low density areas Overall, these results demonstrate that pharmaceuticals are distributed in surface waters within a watershed in Quebec at concentrations similar to levels observed in previous studies done in other parts of North America

AB Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have developed as ecotoxicologically relevant micropollutants in the aquatic environment. During conventional biological wastewater treatment they are eliminated insufficiently and therefore reach surface waters via discharges. They are either partially or completely non-biodegradable and/or hardly eliminable by activated sludge adsorption because they often have polar structures. Membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR) was applied to pre-treat wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds, e.g., antibiotics like floxacins and their synthetic precursor compounds. Our objectives were to eliminate these persistent target compounds from wastewater prior to discharge into receiving waters. Therefore an advanced treatment applying MBR combined with different chemical and physicochemical processes was performed. The addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC), nano filtration (NF), reverse osmosis (UO) or ozone (O-3) and O-3/UV were applied to MBR permeate spiked with the selected target compounds. Treatment efficiency was assessed using conventional inorganic and organic chemical analyses besides advanced physicochernical methods like liquid chromatography coupled with mass and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS and -MS-MS).

AB Stream augmentation with tertiary treated municipal wastewater-i.e., recycled water - is increasingly considered as an ecologically beneficial way to utilize recycled water, especially in semi-arid regions of the American Southwest. There is concern that emerging contaminants, i.e. unregulated but biologically active organic compounds, may be present in recycled water and will impact on the aquatic environment and the underlying groundwater. Emerging contaminants include a wide variety of chemically disparate compounds, including pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, and residues of perfluorochemical surfactants (PFCs). This paper presents background data on the occurrence and transport of PFC in Upper Silver Creek (USC) and Coyote Creek, in San Jose, California. USC feeds into Coyote Creek, which discharges into San Francisco Bay. Augmenting the natural flow of Coyote Creek with highly treated recycled water is currently being considered as a means to provide more freshwater to the river ecosystem. The reach of interest is approximately 1,000m where USC flows on alluvial fan deposits. Data indicate that some PFCs are refractory

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment are raising concern. It is expected that many anthropogenic pharmaceuticals are largely excreted via urine; a popular argument for introducing urine source separation. However, to date, this assumption lacks verification. We close this gap with quantitative screening of official pharmaceutical data. We analysed the excretion pathways of 212 pharmaceuticals' active ingredients (Al), equalling 1,409 products. On average, 64% (+/- 27%) of each Al was excreted via urine, and 35% (+/- 26%) via faeces. In urine, 42% (+/- 28%) of each Al was excreted as metabolites. However, these numbers need cautious interpretation. We found an extreme variability (1) between different therapeutic groups, (2) within some groups and (3) sometimes even between products of the same Al. We discuss various therapeutic groups and include Swiss sales' quantities. For instance, urine source separation could very effectively remove the highly sold and non-degradable x-ray contrast media: 94% (+/- 4%) are excreted via urine. However, for different pharmaceuticals belonging to cytostatics, excretion via urine was 6-98%. Because of such large variability we advise caution to introduce the still imperfect urine separation, technology solely because of pharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, together with other good arguments for this innovation, removal of pharmaceuticals is a welcome side effect.

AB Industrial wastewater, especially from chemical and pharmaceutical production, often contains substances that need to be eliminated before being discharged into a biological treatment plant and following water bodies. This can be done within the production itself, in selected waste water streams or in a central treatment plant. Each of these approaches has certain advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, a variety of wastewater treatment processes exist that can be applied at each stage, making it a challenging task to choose the best one in economic and ecological terms. In this work a general approach for that and examples from practice are discussed.

AB The occurrence of 70 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) was investigated in the Tone River. The river has the largest basin in Japan, and the water is utilized not only for farming, but also as a source of water supply. One day in both January and October 2006, surface waters in the river and its tributaries and effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) directly discharging into the Tone River were collected, the location of which ranged over 150 km along the river. The 70 PPCPs in the samples were concentrated by solid phase cartridge and were measured by LC-MS/MS using three analytical methods. Fifty-seven PPCPs were detected in one or more samples. Bezafibrate, caffeine, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, crotamiton and sulpiride were frequently detected. Mass flow profiles of some PPCPs (e.g., crotamiton) were comparable to cumulative inhabitants in the basin, suggesting that these PPCPs could be markers of population. Total load of each PPCP into the basin from upstream, the tributaries, and the STPs were calculated. The contribution of selected PPCPs from the tributaries with lower sewerage system coverage was dominant compared to those from upstream and the STPs, suggesting the installation of sewerage systems is necessary to reduce the load of PPCPs in the Tone River basin.

AB Fertilisers may contain pollutants that are applied to the field together with the nutrients. Comparing fertilisers is difficult because of their different concentrations of nutrients and pollutants. In this study an already existing model was taken. It was further developed to compare nutrient fluxes (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S; humus) and pollutants (heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) of pig and cattle slurry as well as human urine. The data used is taken from literature and, in the case of pharmaceuticals in urine, daily excretion rates were calculated. An amount of 19m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) undiluted urine can be applied, limiting factor is sulphur. Without taking over-fertilisation into account, an addition of mineral fertiliser is required to any organic fertiliser application. In general, heavy metal, antibiotic, and hormone fluxes are higher by using animal manure then urine as fertiliser. However, additional loads of other pharmaceuticals consumed by humans have to be considered. Overall, the model is a suitable tool worthwhile to be extended in aspects of hygiene, environmental impacts as for example, degradation processes as well as ecotoxicology.

AB We look at the most important issues of the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and conclude that the nutrients from human metabolism are of no importance for the global nitrogen cycle and of minor. importance for the global phosphorus cycle. However, for water pollution control, N and P from the human metabolism are of extreme importance. Nitrogen is mainly an issue for coastal waters, whereas P is an issue for freshwater and coastal areas alike. It is by now generally recognised that coastal ecosystems a re exceedingly important for human well-being and at the same time highly endangered. The recycling issue is of high importance in areas where nutrient application is low due to economic constraints. NoMix technology (urine source separation) holds a large promise to become an efficient mainstream technology. The largest short-term potential is found in densely populated areas in coastal areas without existing infrastructure and in areas with nutrient deficiency, especially in urban areas with a large nutrient potential. We believe, however, that these technologies will, with time, also become competitive in Europe.

AB The demands established in the rules and regulations by the administration in Catalonia seem to exclude small communities from wastewater reclamation and reuse, due to the comparatively high costs associated with the practice at small scale. In the framework of the DRAC project (Demonstration on Wastewater Reclamation and Reuse in Catalonia) two different pre-treatment systems, one extensive (infiltration -percolation) and another intensive (ring filter), each one followed by chlorine dioxide disinfection, were tested in order to be applied for small communities wastewater reclamation and reuse. The results of this study show that infiltration-percolation systems remove very efficiently physico-chemical contaminants and microorganisms. The ring filter system does not show a significant removal rate of contaminants. The use of infiltration-percolation as a pre-treatment for advanced chemical disinfection allows reducing the dose of disinfectant and the contact time needed to achieve a specific water quality, and diminishes disinfection by-products (DBPs) generation. Therefore, this reclamation line is suitable for small communities due to its efficiency and low cost. However, further studies are needed in relation to the removal mechanisms of microorganisms, organic compounds in IP systems and the possible DBPs formation using chlorine dioxide.

AB Recent research projects have shown a good suitability of the ozonation process to transform trace concentrations of most pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The concentrations of carbamazepine and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, for instance, were reduced below their detection limits by use of ozone dosages resulting in a specific ozone consumption of 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOCO. At the same time a good disinfection performance was achieved. The given hygienic requirements of the EU bathing water directive (e.g. 2,000N/100 mL faecal coliforms) are fulfilled without the formation of bromate (< 10 mu g/L). As technical control parameter of the ozonation process usually the residual ozone in the liquid phase or in the off-gas are used. However, at very low specific ozone consumptions, ozone reacts instantaneously with dissolved compounds and cannot be detected. Hence, alternative parameters should be used for effective operation control. The present paper evaluates the relation between UVA decrease and the removal of different compounds (endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media), microbial parameters and bromate formation. The results can be used as a guideline for the control of the oxidation performance at large scale ozonation units.

The photochemical experiments of naproxen degradation were performed in the wastewater effluents from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Kloten/Switzerland at its real concentrations (without standard addition) and in drinking water containing naproxen standard, adjusted to pH = 7 and pH = 6. All performed experiments showed that within 5 min of photochemical oxidation, the disappearance of naproxen exceeded 90%. The first-order rate constants of naproxen degradation were determined. The maximal value of rate constant was observed by UV/H2O2 process in water samples at pH = 6 (k = 0.997 min(-1)).

AB Pharmaceutical and diagnostic substances like antibiotics, cytostatics and iodised X-ray contrast media (XRC) are well-known for not being metabolised and are excreted soon after application. As a result, these preparations are difficult to biodegrade and their adsorption behaviour is rather poor. Finally, the refractory properties of these substances are leading to an accumulation in the natural waterbody depending on the hydrological, situation. The elimination of contrast media from urine and diluted urine solutions by ozonation was investigated using a bubble column reactor to remove and recover the formed elemental iodine from the solution by gas stripping and down stream absorption. The experiments showed that the destruction of XRCs from concentrated solutions like urine is feasible and a recycling of elemental iodine from the exhaust gas is technically and economically possible.

AB Increasing concern in recent years over the occurrence and fate of low-level concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment stimulates research on alternative treatment methods. This paper presents a study of the degradation of sulphamethoxazole, an antibiotic,used on humans and animals in order to treat various bacterial infections, by ozonation. After 4.5 min of treatment, the concentration of sulphamethoxazole was below the HPLC detection limit of 0.6 mgL(-1), indicating degradation efficiency higher than 99.24%. This value is comparable and in some cases higher than published data on the degradation in drinking water. Kinetic analysis of the data indicated an overall first-order reaction with a rate constant of 1.0594 min(-1) at 20 degrees C. The reaction order differs with the second-order reaction observed by other researchers. This change of reaction order could be explained by the different treatment conditions used. Preliminary analysis using the FT-IR technique was also performed in order to obtain information on the structure of the degradation products. Further analysis using a GC-MS is needed in order to elucidate the structure of the degradation products. Finally, based on the experiments performed, ozonation seems to be a promising technique for the degradation of antibiotics, even in wastewater.

AB The occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment has become a crucial topic in the last two decades owing to the innovative development of analytical instrumentation such as LC tandem MS. Using these new techniques it became obvious that pesticides, pharmaceuticals, ingredients of personal care products, biocides, flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds are entering rivers and streams via treated wastewater. Also contamination of bank filtrates, groundwater and in a few cases even drinking water was identified. Wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove polar persistent organic pollutants occurring in the sub-mg/L range and hence many of these organic pollutants are passing WWTPs to a high extent. Waterworks with a potential pesticide contamination in their raw water are equipped with advanced techniques such ozonation, activated carbon or nanofiltration enabling the removal of a high variety of other organic compounds. However, waterworks without an expected pesticide contamination are frequently equipped with common treatment processes not enabling the removal of these kinds of organic pollutants. Therefore, comprehensive management activities for protection of aquatic environments and water resources must consider the removal of all micropollutants relevant to water quality and ecology, independent of their usage or origin.

We previously demonstrated that GEM bioconcentrates in blood and reduces plasma testosterone levels in goldfish (Carassius auratus). In this study, we address the potential of an environmentally relevant waterborne concentration of GEM (1.5 mu g/l) to induce oxidative stress in goldfish liver and whether this may be linked to GEM acting as a peroxisome proliferator (PP). We also investigate the autoregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) as a potential index of exposure. The three PPAR subtypes (alpha, beta, and gamma) were amplified from goldfish liver cDNA. Goldfish exposed to a concentration higher (1500 mu g/l) than environmentally relevant for 14 and 28 days significantly reduce hepatic PPAR beta mRNA levels (p < 0.001). Levels of CYP1A1 mRNA were unchanged. GEM exposure significantly induced the antioxidant defense enzymes catalase (p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase (P < 0.001) and glutathione-S-transferase (p = 0.006) but not acyl-CoA oxidase or glutathione reductase. As GEM exposure failed to increase levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), we conclude that a sub-chronic exposure to GEM upregulates the antioxidant defense status of the goldfish as an adaptive response to this human pharmaceutical.

AB Most antibiotics are only partially metabolised by patients before being discharged into the municipal sewage system along with patient excreta. Studies have shown that the majority of antibiotics pass through sewage treatment and are then released into the environment. Accordingly, investigations conducted in various countries have detected a number of antibiotics in the low mu g or ng per litre range in different environmental compartments. Studies connecting mass balances of use on a local scale and of input and analysis of the antibiotic concentrations present in municipal sewage treatment plants are scarce. Data on local use of antibiotics and their relation to nationwide consumption are not available. This study investigated the use, input, and fate of antibiotics on a local scale and this data were compared with the German nationwide consumption. 42 antibiotics and 15 antimycotics were used in the mass balance consideration over a period of one year. It was found that the local pattern of usage differed only little from that found nationwide. Seasonal changes were minor and the concentrations actually measured were found to be in the expected range. Differences in both the identified occurrence and the concentrations of the target compounds were observed within and between the three sampling periods.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been globally detected in impacted natural waters. The detection of trace quantities of EDCs and PPCPs in the environment is of great concern since some of these compounds have known physiological responses at low concentrations. EDCs can have a wide range of polarities, acidic and basic moieties, and exist in trace quantities, which often requires numerous complex extractions, large sample collection volumes, and multiple instrumental analyses. A comprehensive method has been developed allowing for the analysis of 58 potential EDCs in various water matrices using a single solid-phase extraction (SPE) of a 1 L sample with subsequent analyses using both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, each coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS). Instrument detection limits ranged between 0.12-7.5 pg with corresponding method reporting limits of 1-10 ng l(-1) in water. Recoveries for most compounds were between 50%, and 112% with good reproducibility (RSD 6-22%). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reactivities of the amine-containing pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol with hypochlorite were studied using conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection including neutral pH (7.0), a range of reaction times (2-60 min), and a molar excess of hypochlorite relative to the pharmaceutical concentration (5.7 times). The reactions were monitored using liquid chromatography (LC) with several detection modes including ultraviolet absorbance (UV), mass spectrometry (MS), and post-column reaction/reductive electrochemistry (EC) for determining active chlorine products. At levels of 10 mu M, both compounds reacted rapidly (< 2 min) to form principally N-chloramine products that were stable in aqueous solution for at least I h. The reaction was also studied in wastewater, and similar reactivity was noted. These results demonstrate that the cations fluoxetine and metoprolol are likely to be rapidly transformed into neutral N-chloramines during wastewater disinfection. The reactivity of the N-chloramines was also studied with sulfite to simulate dechlorination, which is often employed in wastewater treatment. Both N-chloramines reacted slowly with sulfite. In the pure water dechlorination experiments, it was estimated that 70% and 10% of the peak areas remained after 2 min reaction time for fluoxetine and metoprolol, respectively. At longer reaction times both N-chloramines had been completely reduced by sulfite, and the product of the sulfite reduction reaction was the parent pharmaceutical amine. Since typical dechlorination times in wastewater treatment are on the order of seconds, this suggests the chloramines formed from these two basic drugs might evade dechlorination and be released into the environment. The implications of chloramine release are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The recognition of pharmaceuticals as significant environmental contaminants has only been a recent phenomenon. Therefore there is a paucity of data relating to the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals once they enter an aquatic receiving system. The amount of work that needs to be done in terms of risk assessment for pharmaceuticals required by regulatory agencies is substantial. This paper has determined the environmental partitioning coefficient (K-d) of 13 diverse human pharmaceuticals in three model systems of differing combinations of solid phases and solutions. The K-d values were then compared with distribution values of the pharmaceuticals in the human body determined from pharmacological studies. This was done to assess the functional relationship between Kd and distribution values in the human body (VD). Kd values ranged from 3 to 2450 L kg(-1). Regression coefficients ranged from r(2) = 0.62-0.72, indicating that VD values are a useful indicator for the Kd values of the tested pharmaceuticals within the batch sorption systems. The relationship between K-d and V-D should therefore be further explored to determine whether this relationship can be applied to a broader range of pharmaceuticals in more diverse environmental systems. Exploiting available human pharmacological data in such a way would be of great benefit in prioritising human pharmaceuticals as environmental contaminants in the risk assessment process.

AB The complexing agents benzotriazole (BT) and tolyltriazole (TT) are not only widely applied as anticorrosives, e. g., in aircraft deicer and anti-icer fluid (ADAF), but they are also used for so-called silver protection in dishwasher detergents. Due to their low biodegradability and limited sorption tendency, BT and TT are only partly removed in wastewater treatment. Residual concentrations of BT and TT were determined in ambient surface waters in Switzerland including 7 rivers which have distinct water flows and receive treated wastewater effluents at various dilution ratios. A maximum BT concentration of 6.3 mu g/L was found in the Glatt River, and a maximum mass flow of 277 kg BT per week was observed in the Rhine River. In most cases, TT was about a factor 5-10 less abundant. During winter 2003/4, BT mass flows at 2 locations in the lower stretch of the Glatt River clearly indicated the input from nearby Zurich airport, where BT was applied as an anticorrosive ADAF component. BT concentrations measured in the three lakes Greifensee, Lake Zurich, and Lake Geneva were approximately 1.2, 0.1-0.4, and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively. The observed environmental occurrences indicate that BT and TT are ubiquitous contaminants in the aquatic environment and that they belong to the most abundant individual water pollutants.

AB A set of three benzotriazole corrosion inhibitors was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in wastewaters and in a partially closed water cycle in the Berlin region. Benzotriazole (BTri) and two isomers of tolyltriazole (TTri) were determined in untreated municipal wastewater with mean dissolved concentrations of 12 mu g/L (BTri), 2.1 mu g/L (4-TTri), and 1.3 mu g/L (5-TTri). Removal in conventional activated sludge (CAS) municipal wastewater treatment ranged from 37% for BTri to insignificant removal for 4-TTri. In laboratory batch tests 5-TTri was mineralized completely and 4-TTri was mineralized to only 25%. This different behavior of the three benzotriazoles was confirmed by following the triazoles through a partially closed water cycle, into bank filtrate used for drinking water production, where BTri (0.1 mu g/L) and 4-TTri (0.03 mu g/L) but no 5-TTri were detected after a travel time of several months. The environmental half-life appears to increase from 5-TTri over BTri to 4-TTri. Treatment of municipal wastewater by a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) instead of CAS improved the removal of BTri and 5-TTri but could not avoid their discharge. Almost complete removal was achieved by ozonation of the treatment plant effluent with 1 mg O-3/mg DOC.

AB In this study, the presence, composition, and concentrations of organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) were determined in solid materials produced during wastewater treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of these solids, collectively referred to as biosolids, as a source of OWCs to soil and water in contact with soil. Nine different biosolid products, produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants in seven different states, were analyzed for 87 different OWCs. Fifty-five of the OWCs were detected in at least one biosolid product. The 87 different OWCs represent a diverse cross section of emerging organic contaminants that enter wastewater treatment plants and may be discharged without being completely metabolized or degraded. A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 45 OWCs were detected in any one biosolid. The biosolids used in this study are produced by several production methods, and the plants they originate from have differing population demographics, yet the percent composition of total OWC content, and of the most common OWCs, typically did not vary greatly between the biosolids tested. The summed OWC content ranged from 64 to 1811 mg/kg dry weight. Six biosolids were collected twice, 3-18 months apart, and the total OWC content of each biosolid varied by less than a factor of 2. These results indicate that the biosolids investigated in this study have OWC compositions and concentrations that are more similar than different and that biosolids are highly enriched in OWCs (as mass-normalized concentrations) when compared to effluents or effluent-impacted water. These results demonstrate the need to better describe the composition and fate of OWCs in biosolids since about 50% of biosolids are land applied and thus become a potentially ubiquitous nonpoint source of OWCs into the environment.

AB Sulfonamide antimicrobials are used in both human therapy and animal husbandry. Sulfonamides are not readily biodegradable and have been detected in surface water and in secondary wastewater effluents. The chemical oxidation of sulfonamides by an environmentally friendly oxidant, ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)), was conducted. The sulfonamides used in the oxidation studies were sulfisoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethizole, sulfadimethoxine, and sulfamethoxazole. Kinetics of the reactions were determined as a function of pH (7.0-9.7) and temperature (15-45 degrees C) by a stopped-flow technique. The rate law for the oxidation of sulfonamides by Fe(VI) is first-order with respect to each reactant. The observed second-order rate constants decreased nonlinearly with an increase in pH and are possibly related to the protonation of Fe(VI) (HFeO4- <-> H+ + FeO42-; pK(a),(HFeO4) = 7.23) and sulfonamides (SH <-> H+ + S-; pK(a),(SH) = 5.0-7.4). The activation parameters of the reactions vary with pH due to temperature dependence on the protonation of Fe(VI) and sulfonamides. These results were used to obtain enthalpy of dissociation of sulfonamides. Stoichiometry and products of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) reactions with Fe(VI) were studied in detail using various analytical techniques to evaluate the effect of the oxidation process on the fate of sulfonamides in water. At a stoichiometric ratio of 4: 1 (Fe(VI): SMX), complete removal of SMX was achieved. Analyses of oxidation products of the reaction as well as kinetic measurements of substructural models of SMX suggest that the attack of Fe(VI) occurs at the isoxazole moiety as well as at the aniline moiety with minimal preference. The results of the studies reported suggest that Fe(VI) has the potential to serve as a chemical oxidant for removing sulfonamides and converting them to relatively less toxic byproducts in water.

Their mechanism of action, involving metabolic activation and unspecific alkylation of nucleophilic compounds, accounts for genotoxic effects described in the literature and is reason for environmental concern. The occurrence and fate of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and surface waters in Switzerland, using a highly sensitive analytical method based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The compounds were detected in untreated and treated wastewater at concentrations of < 0.3-11 ng/L, which corresponded well with concentrations predicted from consumption data and typical renal excretion rates. Weekly loads determined in influent and effluent wastewater were comparable and suggested a high persistence in WWTPs. Furthermore, no degradation was observed in activated sludge incubation experiments within 24 h at concentrations of similar to 100 ng/L. Processes that may be relevant for elimination in natural waterbodies were studied with a set of incubation experiments in the laboratory. After extrapolation to natural conditions in surface waters, a slow dark-chemical degradation (half-lives on the order of years) is the most important transformation process. Degradation by photochemically formed HO center dot radicals may be of some relevance only in shallow, clear, and nitrate-rich waterbodies but could be further exploited for elimination of these compounds by advanced oxidation processes, i.e., in a treatment of hospital wastewater. In surface waters, concentrations ranged from <= 50 to 170 pg/L and were thus several orders of magnitude lower than the levels at which acute ecotoxicological effects have been reported in the literature (mg/L range). However, due to a lack of studies on chronic effects on aquatic organisms and data on occurrence and effects of metabolites, a final risk assessment cannot be made.

AB Although wastewater-derived chemical contaminants undergo transformation through a variety of mechanisms, the relative importance of processes such as biotransformation and photolysis is poorly understood under conditions representative of large rivers. To assess attenuation rates under conditions encountered in such systems, samples from the Trinity River were analyzed for a suite of wastewater-derived contaminants during a period when wastewater effluent accounted for nearly the entire flow of the river over a travel time of approximately 2 weeks. While the concentration of total adsorbable organic iodide, a surrogate for recalcitrant X-ray phase contrast media in wastewater, was approximately constant throughout the river, concentrations of ethylenediamine tetraacetate, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, metoprolol, and naproxen all decreased between 60% and 90% as the water flowed downstream. Comparison of attenuation rates estimated in the river with rates measured in laboratory-scale microcosms suggests that biotransformation was more important than photolysis for most of the compounds. Further evidence for biotransformation in the river was provided by measurements of the enantiomeric fraction of metoprolol, which showed a gradual decrease as the water moved downstream. Results of this study indicate that natural attenuation can result in significant decreases in concentrations of wastewater-derived contaminants in large rivers.

AB A method has been developed for the trace analysis of 15 pharmaceuticals, four metabolites of pharmaceuticals, three potential endocrine disruptors, and one personal care product in various waters. The method employs solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative modes. Unlike many previous LC-MS/MS methods, which suffer from matrix suppression, this method uses isotope dilution for each compound to correct for matrix suppression, as well as SPE losses and instrument variability. The method was tested in five matrices, and results indicate that the method is very robust. Matrix spike recoveries for all compounds were between 88 and 106% for wastewater influent, 85 and 108% for wastewater effluent, 72 and 105% for surface water impacted by wastewater, 96 and 113% for surface water, and 91 and 116% for drinking water. The method reporting limits for all compounds were between 0.25 and 1.0 ng/ L, based on 500 mL of sample extracted and a final extract volume of 500 mu L. Occurrence of the compounds in all five matrices is also reported.

AB A multi-residue method was developed that allows for the simultaneous determination of psychoactive compounds such as opioids, tranquilizers, antiepileptics (primidone, carbamazepine plus two metabolites), the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine, the antidepressant doxepin, as well as the calcium channel blocker verapamil in raw and treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. After solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB at neutral pH, the analytes were detected by LC electrospray tandem MS in the positive ion mode. With a few exceptions relative recoveries of the analytes exceeded 70%. The limits of quantification were in the low ng/L range. Matrix effects were compensated by using appropriate deuterated or C-13-N-15-labeled surrogate standards. For raw and treated wastewater, concentration factors were lowered to reduce matrix effects. Most analytes (15 of 20) were found in raw and treated wastewater as well as in surface water, and hence, are presumably ubiquitously present in the environment. Antiepileptics, the opium alkaloids morphine and codeine, dihydrocodeine, the two tranquilizers oxazepam and temazepam, the opioid tramadol, doxepin, and verapamil were detected in STP discharges and German rivers at concentrations up to the Ag/L range. In drinking water, only carbamazepine, its metabolite 10,11-dihydroxy-10,11- dihydrocarbamazepine, and primidone were present at concentrations up to 0.020 Ag/L.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems serve approximately 25% of the U. S. population. However, little is known regarding the occurrence and fate of organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs), including endocrine disrupting compounds, during onsite treatment. A range of OWCs including surfactant metabolites, steroids, stimulants, metalchelating agents, disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, and pharmaceutical compounds was quantified in wastewater from 30 onsite treatment systems in Summit and Jefferson Counties, CO. The onsite systems represent a range of residential and nonresidential sources. Eighty eight percent of the 24 target compounds were detected in one or more samples, and several compounds were detected in every wastewater sampled. The wastewater matrices were complex and showed unique differences between source types due to differences in water and consumer product use. Nonresidential sources generally had more OWCs at higher concentrations than residential sources. Additional aerobic biofilter- based treatment beyond the traditional anaerobic tank-based treatment enhanced removal for many OWCs. Removal mechanisms included volatilization, biotransformation, and sorption with efficiencies from < 1% to > 99% depending on treatment type and physicochemical properties of the compound. Even with high removal rates during confined unit onsite treatment, OWCs are discharged to soil dispersal units at loadings up to 20 mg/m(2)/d, emphasizing the importance of understanding removal mechanisms and efficiencies in onsite treatment systems that discharge to the soil and water environments.

AB Iopromide (an X-ray contrast agent) and trimethoprim (an antibacterial drug) are frequently detected pharmaceuticals in effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in surface waters due to their persistence and high usage. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that a significantly higher removal rate in nitrifying activated sludge as compared to conventional activated sludge was observed for both iopromide and trimethoprim. When the activity of the nitrifying bacteria was inhibited, the percent removal of iopromide decreased from 97 to 86% while trimethoprim removal decreased from 70 to 25%. The metabolite of iopromide identified when nitrification was not inhibited was a dehydroxylated iopromide at the two side chains. However, when the nitrifying bacteria were inhibited the metabolite identified was a carboxylate, formed during the oxidation of the primary alcohol on the side chain of iopromide. These results suggest that the nitrifying bacteria are important in the observed biodegradation of iopromide in the activated sludge with higher solid retention time (SRT). Results from the laboratory-scale study were corroborated by the observed removal efficiencies in a full-scale municipal WWTP, which showed that iopromide (ranging from 0.10 to 0.27 Ag/ L) and trimethoprim (ranging from 0.0.08 to 0.53 Ag/ L) were removed more effectively in the nitrifying activate sludge which has a higher SRT (49 days) than in the conventional activated sludge (SRT of 6 days). In nitrifying activated sludge, the percent removal of iopromide in the WWTP reached 61%, while in conventional activated sludge, average removal was negligible. For trimethoprim, removal was limited to about 1% in the conventional activated sludge, while in the nitrifying activated sludge, the removal was increased to 50%.

AB The oxidative removal of a diverse group of trace organic contaminants from surface water and wastewater was evaluated using ozone (O-3) and O-3 combined with hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2). Target compounds included estrogenic and androgenic steroids, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Bench- and pilot-scale experiments were conducted with surface water spiked with the target compounds and wastewater effluent containing ambient concentrations of target compounds. Full-scale water treatment plants were sampled before and after ozonation to determine if bench- and pilot-scale results accurately predict full-scale removal. In both drinking water and wastewater experiments, the majority of target compounds were removed by greater than 90% at O-3 exposures commonly used for disinfection. Atrazine, iopromide, meprobamate, and tris-cliloroethylphosphate (TCEP) were the most recalcitrant compounds to oxidize using O-3, with removals generally less than 50%. The addition of H2O2 for advanced oxidation was of little benefit for contaminant removal as compared to O-3 alone. O-3/H2O2 provided a marginal increase in the removal of dilantin, diazepam, DEET, iopromide, and meprobamate, while decreasing the removal efficacy of pentoxifylline, caffeine, testosterone, progesterone, and androstenedione. In wastewater experiments, O-3 and O-3/H2O2 were shown to remove in vitro estrogenicity. Collectively, these data provide evidence that O-3 is a highly effective oxidant for removing the majority of trace organic contaminants from water.

AB Fifty-nine stream-water samples and 14 municipal wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) discharge samples in Johnson County, northeastern Kansas, were analyzed for 55 compounds collectively described as organic wastewater compounds (OWCs). Stream-water samples were collected upstream, in, and downstream from WWTF discharges in urban and rural areas during base-flow conditions. The effect of secondary treatment processes on OWC occurrence was evaluated by collecting eight samples from WWTF discharges using activated sludge and six from WWTFs samples using trickling filter treatment processes. Samples collected directly from WWTF discharges contained the largest concentrations of most OWCs in this study. Samples from trickling filter discharges had significantly larger concentrations of many OWCs (p-value < 0.05) compared to samples collected from activated sludge discharges. OWC concentrations decreased significantly in samples from WWTF discharges compared to stream-water samples collected from sites greater than 2000 m downstream. Upstream from WWTF discharges, base-flow samples collected in streams draining predominantly urban watersheds had significantly larger concentrations of cumulative OWCs (p-value=0.03), caffeine (p-value=0.01), and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (p-value < 0.01) than those collected downstream from more rural watersheds.

The concentrations of antimicrobials do not show substantial changes after preliminary mechanical sedimentation. No quantifiable sulfionamides and chloramphenicol have been identified, and > 85% of ofloxacin has been removed in the effluents after activated sludge treatment in the two STPs, indicating that activated sludge treatment is effective and necessary to remove antimicrobial substances in municipal sewage.

AB The removal of trace organic compounds through membrane bioreactors (MBR) compared with a conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a long-term study was investigated. Two MBR pilot plants were operated in parallel to a full-scale WWTP fed with the same municipal raw wastewater. Polar compounds (phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, their metabolites, and carbamazepine) and less polar estrogenic steroids (estradiol, estrone, and ethinylestradiol) were quantified.
   The removal rate of phenazone, propyphenazone, and formylaminoantipyrine by the conventional WWTP was less than 15%. Significantly higher removal rates (60 to 70%) started to be clearly monitored in the pilot plants after approximately 5 months. Higher removal rates coincided with higher temperatures in the summer.
   The conventional WWTP removed, on average, more than 90% of the natural steroids estrone and estradiol and approximately 80% of the synthetic ethinylestradiol. Approximately 99% of estradiol and estrone and approximately 95% of ethinylestradiol was eliminated by the MBR processes.

AB It is important to determine the behavior of constituents in treated sewage during soil aquifer treatment for water recycling. A collaborative project with Herman Bouwer published in 1984 documented the fate and occurrence of Priority Pollutants during groundwater recharge using wastewater with application to water reuse and agricultural systems. New compounds are continually being manufactured and released to the environment. The interest today has shifted to the behavior of emerging contaminants. One important class of emerging contaminants is pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The hazards to the environment and human health of trace levels of PPCPs in water supplies are poorly understood. A multi compound method using solid phase extraction and chemical derivatization with pentafluorobenzylbromide, followed by analysis via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to study the occurrence and removals of 18 PPCPs in a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Overall, 16 out of the 18 selected PPCPs, which span a range of therapeutic classes and some commonly used personal care products, were detected in raw sewage samples collected from the Baltimore Back River WWTP. Ten of the 18 selected PPCPs were detected in the treated sewage effluent, signifying incomplete removal for the majority of the PPCPs during the wastewater treatment processes. The majority of the target analytes were detected in both the influent and effluent WWTP samples at mu g/L levels, although some PPCPs (e.g., naproxen and ibuprofen) were encountered at mu g/L levels. Biodegradation is an important process for wastewater and soil aquifer treatment. Aerobic batch biodegradation (using activated sludge as microbial inocula) experiments were conducted to gain insight into the biodegradation behavior of our target PPCPs at initial concentrations of 50, 10, and 1 mu g/L Sterile control studies showed no loss of our target PPCPs during the entire incubation period, and sorption to the biomass was found to be negligible for all testing conditions. Biodegradation results were not sensitive to the initial concentration and showed that 13 of the 18 PPCPs tested exhibited biotransformations greater than 80% after 50 days of incubation. Phenytoin, 5-fluorouracil, and diclofenac were the only three compounds with removals less than 60%. The occurrence study revealed the presence of PPCPs in sewage effluents, and the biodegradation study suggests that biotransformation is a possible removal mechanism for PPCPs during groundwater recharge or soil aquifer treatment for water recycling.

AB Aqueous solutions of a mixture of several pesticides (alachlor, atrazine, chlorfenvinphos, diuron and isoproturon), considered PS (priority substances) by the European Commission, and an intermediate product of the pharmaceutical industry (alpha-methylphenylglycine, MPG) chosen as a model industrial pollutant, have been degraded at pilot-plant scale using ozonation. This study is part of a large research project [CADOX Project, A Coupled Advanced Oxidation-Biological Process for Recycling of Industrial Wastewater Containing Persistent Organic Contaminants, Contract No.: EVK1-CT-2002-00122. European Commission, http://www.psa.es/webeng/projects/cadox/index.html [1]] founded by the European Union that inquires into the potential coupling between chemical and biological oxidations for the removal of toxic or non-biodegradable contaminants from water. The evolution of pollutant concentration, TOC mineralization, generation of inorganic species and consumption of 03 have been followed in order to visualize the chemical treatment effectiveness. Although complete mineralization is hard to accomplish, and large amounts of the oxidant are required to lower the organic content of the solutions, the possibility of ozonation cannot be ruled out if partial degradation is the final goal wanted. In this sense. Zahn-Wellens biodegradability tests of the ozonated MPG solutions have been performed, and the possibility of a further coupling with a secondary biological treatment for complete organic removal is envisaged.

AB Photo solid-phase microextraction (photo-SPME) is applied for the first time to study the photochemical behavior of an emerging pollutant, triclosan, in real contaminated wastewater samples using a solar simulator. In this study, water samples are extracted by SPME and then, the fiber coating is irradiated for a selected time. This on-fiber procedure, so-called photo-SPME, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry makes it possible to study photodegradation kinetics and the generation of byproducts. Several photoproducts were identified in the real samples including the 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, dichlorophenols and a compound tentatively identified as other DCDD congener or a dichlorohydroxydibenzofuran. Accordingly, it was possible to postulate main photodegradation mechanisms. Photo-SPME demonstrated slower kinetics in wastewater than in spiked ultrapure water probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter. This technique was extensively compared with conventional aqueous photodegradation showing high similarity. The influence of pH on the triclosan photolysis and on the triclosan-dioxin conversion was also investigated in wastewater. Photodegradation of triclosan and formation of 2,8-DCDD occurred independently of sample pH. This study represents an advance in the use of photo-SPME to understand the photochemical fate of environmental organic pollutants and demonstrates its clear advantages with real samples.

AB Little is known about the fate of cytostatics after their elimination from humans into the environment. Being often very toxic compounds, their quantification in hospital effluents may be necessary to individualise the putative magnitude of pollution problems. We therefore developed a method for the determination of the very important group of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin, and daunorubicin) in hospital effluents. Waste water samples were enriched by solid phase extraction (concentration factor 100), analysed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and monitored by fluorescence detection. This method is reproducible and accurate within a range of 0.1-5 mu g l(-1) for all compounds (limits of quantification: 0.26-0.29 mu g l(-1); recoveries > 80%). The applicability of the method was proven by chemical analysis of hospital sewage samples (range: 0.1-1.4 mu g l(-1) epirubicin and 0.1-0.5 mu g l(-1) doxorubicin). Obtained over a time period of one month, the results were in line with those calculated by an input-output model. These investigations show that the examined cytostatics are easily detectable and that the presented method is suitable to estimate the dimension of pharmaceutical contamination originating from hospital effluents.

AB The toxicity of fourteen widely used human pharmaceuticals was determined using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Stage 9 Xenopus blastulae were exposed for 96 h to single concentrations of commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), statin blood lipid regulators, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, a stimulant, and an anti-epileptic. Toxicity, teratogenicity, minimum concentration to inhibit growth, and types and severity of associated malformations were determined. EC(10)s ranged from 3.0 mg/l to > 100 mg/l and LC(10)s ranged from 3.6 mg/l to > 100 mg/l. Toxicity varied between and within compound class of pharmaceutical. The fluoroquinolones, stimulants, anti-epileptics, and antibiotics tested were determined to be nontoxic and non-teratogenic at singular, water-soluble concentrations. The hazard quotients (HQ) for the pharmaceuticals ranged from 6.10 x 10(-7) to 1.6 x 10-4, all of which are orders of magnitude below EPA's levels for concern for harm to aquatic animals. Thus, based on the data from the present study, concentrations of individual pharmaceuticals currently detected in surface water are far below concentrations of effective and lethal concentrations.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous water contaminants that may have subtle detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, and possibly also on human health. The risks of pharmaceuticals, or pharmaceutically active compounds, remain poorly understood. Awareness of the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, coupled with evidence of effects such as fish feminization, however, suggest that precautionary management action to reduce the release of pharmaceuticals to the environment should be considered. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the scope of the issue and possible management strategies from the perspectives of expert stakeholders, drawn from government, academia, and the pharmaceutical and consulting industries, involved in scientific research or policy and management activity, from Canada, the United States, and Europe. Twenty-seven interviewees were asked about their views on management strategies such as pharmaceutical-return programs and incentives for the development of "green'' pharmaceuticals. Interviewees generally believed that pharmaceuticals in the environment represented a concern for both human and ecosystem health, although they were more concerned about impacts on aquatic ecosystems. They believed that advanced wastewater treatment technology, education of medical professionals to reduce overprescription, pharmaceutical-return programs coupled with public education, and requirements for all municipalities to have a minimum of secondary wastewater treatment were the most effective management strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals. These strategies should be considered by governments interested in managing the risks of human pharmaceuticals in the environment. Combinations of management strategies will likely be most effective in mitigating the risks presented by pharmaceuticals.

AB The transport pathways of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP) discharges within the urban water cycle include both combined and separate sewer systems with only the former receiving treatment. The dry-weather flow dilution patterns for selected PPCPs following discharge from a sewage treatment works (STW) to a North London stream indicate a persistent downstream increase in concentration. The dilution ratio analysis also indicates that the STW's final effluent only contributes a dilution of the endogenous concentrations already present in the river flow which reflects a progressive PPCP load with increasing urbanization; "worst-case" scenarios being probably related to wet-weather conditions. Maximum PPCP concentrations fall above the reported PEC levels and the analysis highlights the deficiencies of conventional acute toxicity for the evaluation of long-term effects of episodic urban discharges. Groundwater analysis points to sewer extiltration which is limited in terms of PPCP impact to 25-50 cm depths. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During a 48 In exposure to a very high concentration of propranolol (70.9 mu g/L) no effects on heart rate were found. After a subsequent intravenous injection of propranolol, heart rate remained unaffected in pre-exposed fish but was significantly lowered in naive fish. Other studies have reported effects on the reproduction of fish by propranolol dissolved in water at much lower concentrations. The present study suggests that physiological systems under homeostatic control, like heart rate, may not be particularly sensitive despite being direct targets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental fates and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have been the focus of recent research in environmental ecotoxicology. Worldwide studies of common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals have reported detectable levels in the aquatic environment, but there are few studies examining impacts on marine habitats. These drugs can affect the functions of various vertebrates and invertebrates. The stability of two pharmaceuticals, cyclizine (CYC) and prochlorperazine (PCZ), in seawater was examined under light and dark conditions, as well as the toxicity of these compounds to larvae of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, which is a cosmopolitan marine organism found in most of the world's oceans. CYC was very stable under all the tested conditions. On the other hand, PCZ degraded in light but not in the dark, and was more stable in seawater than fresh water. For the barnacle larvae, the LC50 of prochlorperazine was 0.93 mu ml and the LC50 for CYC was approximately 0.04 mu g/ml.

AB In this study, the optimum operating conditions of a lab-scale completely stirred acidogenic reactor treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater were determined. Individual effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR) and pH on the degree of acidification were investigated at a mesophilic temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C), for HRT in the range 8-24 h, OLR up to 14 kg COD/m(3) d and pH in the range of 5.0-6.3. A maximum acidification level of 44% and COD removal efficiency of 13%, were obtained at an OLR of 13 kg COD/m(3) d at pH of 5.5 +/- 0.1 with an HRT of 12 It. Under these conditions, acetic, propionic and n-butyric acids were found to be predominant volatile fatty acids in the acidogenic reactor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two solar-driven advanced oxidation processes, namely heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis and homogeneous photo-Fenton, both coupled to biological treatment, is carried out in order to identify the environmentally preferable alternative to treat industrial wastewaters containing nonbiodegradable priority hazardous substances. The study is based on solar pilot plant tests using alpha-methyl-phenylglycine as a target substance. The LCA study is based on the experimental results obtained, along with data from an industrial-scale plant. The system under study includes production of the plant infrastructure, chemicals, electricity, transport of all these materials to the plant site, management of the spent catalyst by transport and landfilling, as well as treatment of the biodegradable effluent obtained in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant, and excess sludge treatment by incineration. Nine environmental impact categories are included in the LCA: global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic toxicity, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, energy consumption, and land use. The experimental results obtained in the pilot plant show that solar photo-Fenton is able to obtain a biodegradable effluent much faster than solar heterogeneous photocatalysis, implying that the latter would require a much larger solar collector area in an industrial application. The results of the LCA show that, an industrial wastewater treatment plant based on heterogeneous photocatalysis involves a higher environmental impact than the photo-Fenton alternative, which displays impact scores 80-90% lower in most impact categories assessed. These results are mainly due to the larger size of the solar collector field needed by the plant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A study of the photodegradation of different pharmaceuticals [furosemide, ranitidine (hydrochloride), ofloxacine, phenazone, naproxen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid] in aqueous medium at various pHs by using a batch photoreactor and a photocatalytic membrane reactor working in recirculation regime was carried out. Polycrystalline TiO2 was used as the photocatalyst, and different membranes (NTR 7410, PAN GKSS HV3/ T, N 30 F, NF PES 10) were tested. A different adsorption of the substrates onto the catalyst surface was observed owing to the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic character of the catalyst, depending on the pH. The photodegradation of the seven molecules in the batch reactor was successfully carried out and the behaviour was in accordance with pseudo-first order kinetics. Furosemide and ranitidine were selected to carry out the study of rejection and photodegradation in the hybrid membrane system. The permeate flux of the treated water was in the 31.5-60.0 L/(hm(2)) range for NTR 7410 membrane, whereas rejection values in the range 10-60% for furosemide and 5-30% for ranitidine in the dark (without photoreaction) were found. The degradation in the hybrid membrane photoreactor showed that the photocatalyst was retained by the membrane in the reaction ambient, while the membrane rejection towards the pollutants was not very satisfactory. A net decrease of the rejection down to 0 was observed in the contemporary presence of light, photocatalyst and oxygen. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent recognition of the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment has highlighted concerns regarding potential threats of antibiotics to humans and wildlife. Antibiotics are commonly applied to animals to prevent diseases and promote growth, making livestock agriculture a major source of antibiotic pollution. The purpose of our study was to examine chlorination technology as a method for preventing the release of antibiotics as well as antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment from concentrated animal feeding operations. Wastewaters from various sites of two anaerobic lagoon systems, one aerated and the other not, on a swine facility were investigated. Each system consisted of a primary treatment lagoon and a subsequent polishing lagoon. Free chlorine ( or monochloramine for comparison) was applied to oxidize antibiotics and to disinfect lagoon bacteria as well. Results indicate that aeration substantially improves lagoon functionality, thereby adding both organic and ammonia removal. Ammonia present in the wastewaters plays a critical role in antibiotics decomposition and bacterial inactivation due to its rapid competition for free chlorine to form monochloramine. Generally, a chlorine dose close to breakpoint is required to achieve complete removal of antibiotics, leading to high consumption of free chlorine in most of the wastewaters examined. However, because of a low ammonia concentration in the polishing lagoon wastewater of the aerated system, a chlorine dose of 100 mg/L can effectively achieve complete removal of both antibiotics and bacteria. On the basis of our experimental findings, a possible strategy for the treatment of swine wastewater is suggested.

AB This study aimed at giving a better insight into the possible fate of nonylphenol (NP) during wastewater treatment by using a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) designed and optimized for fate studies carried out with radiolabeled compounds. After a single pulse of C-14-labeled-NP isomer (4-[1-ethyl-1,3-dimethylpentyl]phenol) as radiotracer, the applied radioactivity was monitored in the MBR system over 34 days. The mass balance of NP residues at the end of the study showed that 42% of the applied radioactivity was recovered in the effluent as degradation products of NP, 21% was removed with the daily excess sludge from the MBR, and 34% was recovered as adsorbed in the component parts of the MBR. A high amount of NP was associated to the sludge during the test period, while degradation compounds were mainly found in the effluent. Partial identification of these metabolites by means of HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry coupled to radio-detection showed they are alkyl-chain oxidation products of NP. The use of this MBR and a radiolabeled test compound was found suitable for demonstrating that under the applied conditions, the elimination of NP through mineralization and volatilization processes (both less than 1%) was negligible. However, the removal of NP via sorption and the continuous release of oxidation products of NP in permeate were of relevance.

AB The persistence and fate of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been investigated in laboratory-scale experiments, including studies with various aqueous solutions, water/sediment systems, and activated sludge-amended medium. The samples were placed in the dark and/or in a growth chamber fitted with fluorescent lamps simulating the ultraviolet output of sunlight. Over a period of 30 d, fluoxetine was hydrolytically and photolytically stable in all aqueous solutions except synthetic humic water (pH 7), in which the degradation rate was increased by approximately 13-fold in comparison with buffered solutions at the same pH. Fluoxetine rapidly dissipated from the aqueous phase in water/sediment systems, primarily because of distribution to sediments. The dissipation rate from the aqueous phase was similar between light and dark systems, indicating a low contribution of photodegradation to the dissipation of fluoxetine in this system. The potential impact of fluoxetine in aquatic environments would be decreased because of adsorption to sediments. Based on results of ready-biodegradability investigations, fluoxetine would not be expected to rapidly biodegrade in wastewater treatment plants. A photoproduct was detected only in a sample of synthetic humic water and was identified as norfluoxetine formed by demethylation. Results indicate that fluoxetine is relatively recalcitrant to hydrolysis, photolysis, and microbial degradation and that it is rapidly removed from surface waters by adsorption to sediment, where it appears to be persistent.

AB We measured six acidic analgesics or anti-inflammatories (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid), two phenolic antiseptics (thymol, triclosan), four amide pharmaceuticals (propyphenazone, crotamiton, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide), three phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (nonylphenol, octylphenol, bisphenol A), and three natural estrogens (17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol) in 24-h composite samples of influents and secondary effluents collected seasonally from five municipal sewage treatment plants in Tokyo. Aspirin was most abundant in the influent, with an average concentration of 7300 ng/L (n = 16), followed by crotamiton (921 ng/L), ibuprofen (669 ng/L), triclosan (511 ng/L), and diethyltoluamide (503 ng/L). These concentrations were 1 order of magnitude lower than those reported in the USA and Europe. This can be ascribed to lower consumption of the pharmaceuticals in Japan. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and thymol were removed efficiently during primary+secondary treatment (> 90% efficiency). On the other hand, amide-type pharmaceuticals, ketoprofen, and naproxen showed poor removal (< 50% efficiency), which is probably due to their lower hydrophobicity (logK(ow)< 3). Because of the persistence of crotamiton during secondary treatment, crotamiton was most abundant among the target pharmaceuticals in the effluent. This is the first paper to report ubiquitous occurrence of crotamiton, a scabicide, in sewage. Because crotamiton is used worldwide and it is persistent during secondary treatment, it is a promising molecular marker of sewage and secondary effluent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biodegradation of selected non-adsorbing persistent polar pollutants (P) during wastewater (WW) treatment was studied by comparing a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) running in parallel to activated sludge treatment (AST). The investigated P-3 are relevant representatives or metabolites from the compound classes: pesticides, pharmaceuticals, insect repellents, flame retardants and anionic surfactants. Analyses of all these P-3 at low ng L-1 levels with sufficient standard deviations was performed in WW influents and effluents. Non-degradable micropollutants, such as EDTA and carbamazepine were not eliminated at all during WW treatment by any technique. However, the MBR showed significant better removals compared to AST for the investigated poorly biodegradable P-3, such as diclofenac, mecoprop and sulfophenylcarboxylates. An application of such an in terms of sludge retention time optimised MBR may lead to a reduction of these P-3 in the watercycle. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal efficiency and elimination rates of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in two subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands (SSFs) characterized by different water depths (i.e. 0.3 and 0.5 m) in a 2-year study. Dissolved and particulate phases of wastewater and gravel samples were collected and analyzed. The PPCP influent concentration ranged from 1 to 25 mu g L-1. The best removal efficiency was found in the shallower bed SSF due to its less negative redox potential. PPCPs were classified in four groups according to their removal behavior: (i) the efficiently removed (> 80%) namely caffeine, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, and carboxy-ibuprofen, (ii) the moderately removed (50-80%) namely ibuprofren, hydroxy-ibuprofen, and naproxen, (iii) the recalcitrant to the elimination namely ketoprofen and diclofenac, and, finally, (iv) compounds that were eliminated by hydrophobic interactions namely polycyclic musks (i.e. galaxolide and tonalide). These compounds were removed more than 80% from the effluent but occurred at high concentrations (up to 824 mu g kg(-1)) in the gravel bed. Accordingly, their elimination by sorption onto the organic matter retained is the predominant removal mechanism. Furthermore, the constructed wetland clogging appears to induce a negative effect in the PPCP degradation in the SSF evaluated. The PPCP elimination classified as efficiently and moderately removed through the shallow bed fitted to either zero- or a first-order areal kinetics. Finally, the apparent distribution coefficients between suspended solids (Kd'(ss)) or gravel bed (Kd'(gb)) and water were determined in the different sampling points of the wetland obtaining values comparable to the described previously for sewage sludge.

AB Large parts of the central highlands of Mexico are heavily eroded and the success of a planned reforestation program will greatly improve when the organic matter and nutrient content of the soil increases prior to the planting of the trees. This study investigated how the application of biosolids from a pharmaceutical company producing cephalosporines or third generation antibiotics could be used as a soil amendment and affect dynamics of C, P and N in soil. A sandy clay loam soil was sampled, amended with 24 g of dry biosolids kg(-1) dry soil or approximately 32 x 10 3 kg ha(-1) for the 0-10 cm layer, and incubated aerobically while production of carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics of ammonium (NH4+),nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) extractable phosphorus (PO43-), and microbial biomass carbon (C) were monitored. Results showed that the biosolid with pH 12, organic C content 162 g kg(-1), total N 21 g kg(-1), was of excellent quality considering its heavy metal content (USEPA) and a class "B" (USEPA) biosolid considering the amount of pathogens. No cephalosporines could be detected in the biosolid. Addition of biosolid to soil increased production Of CO2 1.4 times and added > 60 mg NH4+ kg(-1). The application of biosolids did not significantly increase the concentration of NO2- which remained < 2 mg N kg(-1) soil, but the concentration of NO3- did increase with 175 mg N kg(-1) soil. The microbial biomass C did not change when sewage biosolids was added and concentrations of extractable PO43- only increased temporarily. Washing the biosolids reduced concentrations of NH4+ and NO3-, but also reduced pathogens and concentrations of chloride (Cl-), which might pose a treat to humans and the environment, respectively. Although the biosolid added valuable nutrients to the soil and did not inhibit C and N mineralization, further investigation into possible long-term environmental effects on soil processes and plant growth is necessary before this biosolid can be used in the field.

ID OZONATION; OXIDATION; PHARMACEUTICALS; REMOVAL
AB Macrolide antibiotics are widely used (in the order of I g per person per year). They pass the body largely unchanged and are also not degraded in wastewater treatment plants. With not too much effort, they may be eliminated from their effluents by ozonation. The macrolide antibiotics have all a dimethylamino group at one of the carbohydrate residues in common. This functional group is the target of the ozone reaction, and clarithromycin has been selected here for a more detailed study. Since only the free amine reacts with ozone, the rate of reaction is pH dependent (at pH 7: k = 4 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). In analogy to the ozonolysis of trimethylamine, the main reaction is a transfer of an O-atom yielding the N-oxide (identified by HPLC/MS-MS). A minor product (10%, based on formaldehyde yields) is demethylated clarithromycin (identified by HPLC/MS-MS). The dimethylamino group is thought to be essential for the binding of the macrolide antibiotics to their target. As a consequence, chemical changes of this functional group, notably the formation of the N-oxide that is no longer a proton acceptor, inactivates these drugs as assayed by the suppression of the growth of Pseudomonas putida. This is most important for wastewater treatment, as mineralization of clarithromycin by ozone would require 100 times as much ozone. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Mediterranean regions where the population is rapidly growing, the risk of water resource contamination by wastewater is likely to increase. This is the case of the Herault watershed (south of France), where the presence of treated wastewater in surface and ground waters has been shown in a previous study. To assess the consequence of these wastewater contaminations as regards pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds, 16 common pharmaceuticals (amitryptilin, acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, clenbuterol, diazepam, diclofenac, doxepin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, imipramine, ketoprofen, naproxen, nordiazepam, paracetamol, salbutamol, and terbutalin) as well as wastewater related pollutants (caffeine, gadolinium anomaly, and boron) were analyzed in wells pumped for potable water supply and in two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In addition, a monitoring along the Lergue River (the main tributary of the Herault River) was achieved to assess pharmaceutical behavior in surface waters. Pharmaceuticals and other wastewater-related contaminants are present in several reservoirs tapped for drinking water, confirming wastewater contamination; paracetamol, caffeine, and diclofenac are the most frequently detected. Paracetamol is present at rather high concentrations (up to 11 mu g/L and 211 ng/L, respectively, in a wastewater effluent and in a drinking water sample). Though degradable in WWTP, caffeine is commonly encountered in surface waters and detected in highly polluted groundwater. On the contrary, acetylsalicylic acid concentrations are generally low despite a large consumption in France; this is related to its metabolism in humans and rapid degradation in the aquatic environment. The monitoring of pharmaceuticals along the Lergue River shows that dilution is sufficient to decrease pharmaceutical values.

AB The effluents of eight municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Western Europe were analyzed by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry for the occurrence of 36 polar pollutants, comprising household and industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. In a long-term study of the effluents of three WWTP over 10 months, sulfophenyl carboxylates and ethylene diamino tetraacetate (EDTA) were detected above 10 mu g/L on average, while benzotriazoles, benzothiazole-2-sulfonate, diclofenac, and carbamazepine showed mean concentrations of 1-10 mu g/L, followed by some flame retardants, naphthalene disulfonates, and personal care products in the range of 0.1-1 mu g/L. Half of the determined compounds were not significantly removed in tertiary wastewater treatment. By dividing the effluent concentration of a compound by its relative removal in WWTP a water cycle spreading index (WCSI) was calculated for each compound. We propose that this index provides a measure for the potential of a polar compound to spread along a partially closed water cycle after discharge with municipal wastewater and to occur in raw waters used for drinking water production. Polar pollutants in surface water samples of different catchments showed increasing concentration for compounds with increasing WCSI.

AB The influence of seasonal changes in water conditions and parameters on several major pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) and s-triazine herbicides was assessed in the wastewater and sewage treatment plant (WSTP) effluent as well as the downstream surface water from sites on the Canadian side of the upper Detroit River, between the Little River WSTP and near the water intake of a major drinking water treatment facility for the City of Windsor (ON, Canada). The assessed PhACs were of neutral (carbamazepine, cotinine, caffeine, cyclophosphamide, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, pentoxifylline, and trimethoprim) and acidic (ibuprofen, bezafibrate, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, indomethacin, naproxen, and ketoprofen) varieties. The major assessed s-triazine herbicides were atrazine, simazine, propazine, prometon, ametryn, prometryn, and terbutryn. At sampling times from September 2002 to June 2003, 15 PhACs were detected in the WSTP effluent at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 1,244 ng/L. The PhAC concentrations decreased by as much 92 to 100% at the Little River/Detroit River confluence because of the river dilution effect, with further continual decreases at sites downstream from the WSTP The only quantifiable s-triazine in WSTP effluent, atrazine, ranged from 6.7 to 200 ng/L and was higher in Detroit River surface waters than in WSTP effluent. Only carbamazepine, cotinine, and atrazine were detectable at the low-nanogram and subnanogram levels in surface waters near a drinking water intake site. Unlike the PhACs, atrazine in the Detroit River is not attributable to point sources, and it is heavily influenced by seasonal agricultural usage and runoff. Detroit River surface water concentrations of carbamazepine, cotinine, and atrazine may present a health concern to aquatic wildlife and to humans via the consumption of drinking water.

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; WASTE-WATER CONTAMINANTS; PHARMACEUTICALS;
   NAPROPAMIDE; STREAMS; FATE
AB Th anti-seizure medication carbamazepine is often found in treated sewage effluent and environmental samples. Carbamazepine has been shown to be very persistent in sewage treatment, as well as ground water. Due to environmental persistence, irrigation with sewage effluent could result in carbamazepine contamination of surface and ground water. To determine the potential for leaching of carbamazepine, a series of adsorption and desorption batch equilibrium experiments were conducted on irrigated soils. It was found that carbamazepine adsorption to biosolid-amended (T) soils had a K-D of 19.8 vs. 12.6 for unamended soil. Based on adsorption, carbamazepine leaching potential would be categorized as low. During desorption significant hysteresis was observed and K-D increased for both soils. Desorption isotherms also indicate a potential for irreversibly bound carbamazepine in the T soil. Results indicate that initial removal of carbamazepine via adsorption from irrigation water is significant and that desorption characteristics would further limit the mobility of carbamazepine through the soil profile indicating that carbamazepine found in sewage effluent used for irrigation has a low leaching potential.

AB In this experimental study both biological treatability of pharmaceuticals and their potential toxic effect in biological processes were evaluated. The pharmaceuticals were selected among those that are present at higher concentration in the Italian wastewater treatment plant effluents and widely used as antiulcer (ranitidine), beta-blocker (atenolol) and antibiotic (lincomycin). The present paper is the continuation of a work already presented,[1] which used a synthetic wastewater fed to laboratory scale SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) operated with different sludge ages (8 and 14 days), different biochemical conditions (aerobic or anoxic-aerobic mode) and several influent drug concentrations (2, 3 and 5 mg/L). In this case a real municipal wastewater was used as influent to the SBR. In parallel, batch tests were conducted to determine the removal kinetics of drugs and nitrogen. Toxicity tests using a titrimetric biosensor to verify possible inhibition on microorganisms were also performed. Finally, the possible adsorption of the pharmaceuticals on activated sludge was evaluated. The drugs under investigation showed different behaviours in terms of both biodegradability and toxicity effect on nitrifiers. Ranitidine showed generally low removal efficiencies (17-26%) and a chronic inhibition on nitrification. Atenolol showed generally higher removal efficiencies than ranitidine, even if the fairly good efficiency obtained in the previous experimentation with synthetic wastewater (up to 90%) was not attained with real wastewater (36%). No inhibition on nitrification was observed on both acclimated and non acclimated microorganisms with a high nitrification activity, whilst it was present with activated sludge characterised by a lower nitrification activity. Consistently with his pharmaceutical properties, lincomycin showed significant inhibition on nitrification activity.

AB The pretreatment of synthetic penicillin formulation effluent containing Procain Penicillin G (PPG) with the O-3/H2O2 process (applied ozone dose = 1440 mg h(-1) treatment time = 60 minutes; pH 7; H2O2 = 10 mM) was investigated. The effect of chemical pretreatment was assessed on the basis of acute toxicity and biodegradability with activated sludge using water flea Daphnia magna toxicity and activated sludge inhibition tests. Biological treatability studies were performed with a mixture of untreated or pretreated PPG effluent (25% on volume basis) and synthetic domestic wastewater simulating readily biodegradable organic substrate to simulate the characteristics of domestic wastewater (75% on volume basis). Pretreatment of PPG effluent the O-3/H2O2 process resulted in more than 70% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and a 50% decrease in the acute toxicity towards Daphnia magna . On the other hand, biodegradation of untreated PPG effluent needed prolonged acclimation periods to obtain a significant biological COD removal (= 80%). Pretreatment employing the O-3/H2O2 process not only decreased the ultimate biodegradability of PPG effluent but also increased its inhibitory effects on activated sludge treatment speculatively due to the formation of less biodegradable oxidation by-products.

AB Over the last ten years there have been reports of pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) residuals in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The principle goal of this study was specifically to expand and in some cases establish a Canadian database for the presence of selected acidic drugs, triclosan, polycyclic musks, and selected estrogens in MWWTP influent and effluent. The impact of treatment configuration (e.g. lagoons, conventional activated sludge (CAS), and CAS followed by media filtration (CAS +filtration)) was also examined. For CAS systems, the most prevalent treatment type, the effect of operating temperature and SRT was evaluated. Selected PPCPs included ten acidic pharmaceuticals (i.e. a group of pharmaceuticals that are extractable at a pH of 2 or less), triclosan, five polycyclic musks and two estrogens. The pharmaceuticals and musks were selected on the basis of levels of use in Canada; reported aquatic toxicity effects; and the ability to analyze for the compounds at low levels. Twelve MWWTPs discharging into the Thames River, the second largest river in southwestem Ontario, were surveyed.
   The only common characteristic of acidic drugs is their extraction pH as they differ in their intended biological function and chemical structure. Many organics degraded by WWTP processes benefit from warm temperatures and long SRTs so the impact of these variables warranted additional attention.
   Influent concentrations and reductions for acidic drugs reported by this study were compared to other Canadian studies, when available, and European investigations. The data of this study seems consistent with other reports. Ten acidic drugs were considered by this study. Three were consistently present at non-quantifiable levels (e.g. CLF, FNP and FNF). Additionally, one analyte, SYL, presented results that were so inconsistent that the values were not analysed.
   The remaining six acidic pharmaceuticals were placed into three categories. IBU and NPX members of the first category had consistently high reductions. At the level of reduction achieved (i.e. median reduction of greater than 93%) and any effect of treatment type or operating characteristics would be subtle and non-discemable given the analytical noise. In the second group are KTP and IND, and definitive comments are difficult to make on the impact of treatment type and operational considerations due to a sparse data set (i.e. many influent values were at non-quantifiable concentrations). Median reductions were in the 23% to 44% range. In the last category are GMF and DCF which have median reductions of 66% and -34%, respectively. Several negative reduction values in the data set (i.e. twelve of twenty six sampling events) suggest that DCF may be deconjugated under certain conditions. This warrants further evaluation when analytical methods for measuring human metabolites of DCF are available. For both GMF and DCF, reduction does not appear to be strongly influenced by SRTs up to 15 days, while SRTs over 30 days were associated with more frequent non-quantifiable effluent levels of DCF. This would suggest that better treatment would be provided by lagoons and CAS systems with extended aeration. Preliminary data suggests that temperature does not play a strong role in the reduction of these compounds.
   Triclosan (TCL) was detected at concentrations of 0.01-4.01 mu g/L in influent samples and 0.01-0.324 mu g/L in effluent samples. Reduction of TCL ranged from 74% to 98%. Lagoon treatment seems to be the best TCL reduction as it was present in the influent and effluent at quantifiable and non-quantifiable concentrations, respectively, on nine of nine sampling occasions.
   Influent and reduction values of five polycyclic musks (e.g. ADBI, AHMI, ATII, HHCB, and AHTN) were examined over the course of this study. AJIMI was predominantly present at non-quantifiable concentrations. HHCB and AHTN were present at the highest concentrations. A comparison between Canadian values and those of European studies indicate that in general polycyclic musk concentrations in Canadian MWWTP effluents are 5-10 times lower. More extensive European and Canadian databases would be useful in confirming this initial observation.
   Median reductions for the five remaining musks range between 37% and 65% in CAS systems. CAS+filtration systems would be expected to have higher reductions if musks were bound to the effluent solids. This trend is not apparent but this may be due to the small size of the data set. In lagoon systems, musk reduction for HHCB and AHTN are approximately 98-99%. For ADBI and ATH musk, there are no numerical reduction values as most often the effluent concentration was non-quantifiable. In some instances, both the influent and effluent concentrations were non-quantifiable.
   The hormones 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were detected at concentrations of 0.006 to 0.0 14 and 0.0 16 to 0.049 mu g/L, respectively. E2 was not detected in any effluent samples (< 0.005 gg/L) whereas El was detected in effluent samples from CAS treatment plants (median of 0.008 mu g/L), and in one sample from lagoons.
   These data demonstrate that there are detectable levels of PPCPs entering Canadian waterways at trace levels, and that only some of these compounds are being reduced in a significant proportion by municipal wastewater treatment processes.

AB The applicability of Fenton's oxidation to improve the biodegradability of a pharmaceutical wastewater to be treated biologically was investigated. The wastewater was originated from a factory producing a variety of pharmaceutical chemicals. Treatability studies were conducted under laboratory conditions with all chemicals (having COD varying from 900 to 7000 mg/L) produced in the factory in order to determine the operational conditions to utilize in the full-scale treatment plant. Optimum pH was determined as 3.5 and 7.0 for the first (oxidation) and second stage (coagulation) of the Fenton process, respectively. For all chemicals, COD removal efficiency was highest when the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ was 150-250. At H2O2/Fe2+ ratio of 155, 0.3 M H2O2 and 0.002 M Fe2+, provided 45-65% COD removal.
   The wastewater treatment plant that employs Fenton oxidation followed by aerobic degradation in sequencing batch reactors (SBR), built after these treatability studies provided an overall COD removal efficiency of 98%, and compliance with the discharge limits. The efficiency of the Fenton's oxidation was around 45-50% and the efficiency in the SBR system which has two reactors each having a volume of 8 m(3) and operated with a total cycle time of 1 day, was around 98%, regarding the COD removal.

AB Urine can be collected separately from the general wastewater with the aim of recycling the nutrients. Urine source-separation not only prevents wasting nutrients but also prevents potentially hazardous micropollutants from entering the wastewater stream and tainting a final fertilizer product. We assessed various urine treatment technologies for their performance to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic steroid hormones, and their human biotransformation products. Removal efficiencies were determined with a combination of bioassays and chemical target analysis. The yeast estrogen screen yielded information on estrogenicity. Specific phytotoxicity and nonspecific baseline toxicity was determined with an algae chlorophyll fluorescence test. Filtration methods, such as nanofiltration and electrodialysis, were highly efficient with respect to toxicity reduction. Micropollutant degradation during biological treatment in a sequencing batch reactor was very compound specific. Ozonation removed the target analytes and the estrogenicity completely, but the baseline toxicity was only reduced by 50-60% depending on the ozone doses. Struvite precipitation produced a very "clean" fertilizer product that is ready to use. The examples show that bioassays and chemical analysis yield complementary information, but are very useful to monitor treatment efficiencies and to assess the ecotoxicological potential of byproducts of urine treatment processes. The results of this study present a method to assess the micropollutant removal efficiency, and therefore, support the choice of an appropriate urine processing technique for real-world applications.

AB A monitoring programme was carried out in order to determine iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) in the River Danube and to investigate the raw water quality for drinking water production at Langenau waterworks. The study revealed that the maximum concentrations of ICM (over 500 ng l(-1) for diatrizoic acid and iopamidol) were found in 2 h-composite samples taken from the downstream of the Ulm/Neu-Ulm metropolitan area. By means of a concentration profile over one month the highest ICM concentrations were observed on weekdays. The extended data evaluation with principal component analysis shows that the upstream and downstream samples had different pattern of variations in ICM concentration and also demonstrates a clear change in ICM composition by the discharge of municipal wastewater. In addition to load profiles of ICM, time-dependent plots of principal component I exhibited peaks, indicating a short-term discharge of ICM between the two sampling sites. In conclusion, a point source for ICM contamination between the sampling sites in Ulm upstream and Leipheim downstream seems to be the reasonable explanation for peak ICM concentrations. Due to the observed high variations of ICM concentrations in river, the evaluation of natural waters by means of a single analysis is not representative. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The advent of global warming has given rise to the issue on how temperature impacts the susceptibility of ectothermic organisms to pollution. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pharmaceutical products and domestic wastewaters on temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity in the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mitochondria from mussels were freshly prepared and exposed to increasing concentrations of various pharmaceutical products known to be found in municipal effluents for 30 min at 4, 12 and 20 degrees C. Electron transport activity as well as lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks were determined in the mitochondria. Next, mussels were placed in the aeration lagoons of two municipal wastewater treatment plants for 30 days. Mitochondrial electron transport (MET), temperature-dependent MET (METT) and lipid peroxidation in gonad were then determined. The results show that all products were able to increase MET activity, but at two different ranges of threshold concentration. Certain pharmaceutical products (i.e., ibuprofen, cotinine, fluoxetine, coprostanol and trimethoprim) increased METT at a lower threshold concentration than observed at 20 degrees C. Products of lesser potency in reducing lipid peroxidation were those that produced more DNA strand breaks in mitochondria., Both MET and METT were significantly increased in mussels exposed to aeration lagoon effluents. Lipid peroxidation was also increased in the gonad and was! significantly correlated with MET and METT activities. The data indicate that pharmaceutical products and municipal effluents increase respiration rates in isolated mitochondria, such that interaction with temperature could enhance the susceptibility of mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress in environments contaminated by domestic wastewater.

AB Ten acidic and two neutral pharmaceuticals were detected in the effluents of eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) from across Atlantic Canada. Concentrations varied between nondetectable and 35 mu g/L. The analgesic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and naproxen were predominant. Carbamazepine, a neutral compound used as an antiepileptic drug, was observed consistently at a median concentration of 79 ng/L. Acetaminophen was found in the effluents of the three largest mechanical STPs at a median concentration of 1.9 mu g/L, but not in the lagoon treatment systems. The substantially longer hydraulic retention times may have contributed to more effective removal of acetaminophen in the lagoon treatment systems. Drugs generally were not detected at significant concentrations in the larger bodies of receiving water (Saint John River, Hillsborough River, and Bedford Bay, Canada). However, drug residues in the small receiving streams were 15 to 30% of the effluent median concentrations. Six compounds (caffeine, naproxen, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, metoprolol, and sotolol) were found to persist in a small stream for a distance of at least 17 km, suggesting that small stream exposure to pharmaceutically active residues may be relatively greater than that in large bodies of water. Bioassays assessing acute and chronic effects on four organisms were conducted on four high-use drugs: Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and salicylic acid (metabolite of acetyl salicylic acid). Results indicated no negative effects except for the chronic algal (Selanastrum capricornutum) growth test on ibuprofen (no-observed-effect concentration, 10 mu g/L: lowest-observed-effect concentration, 32 mu g/L). Effects of these four compounds on invertebrates and plants in the receiving environments are unlikely based on the concentrations measured.

AB The electrolytic removal of ethinylestradiol (EE2), the most potent synthetic estrogen, in effluent of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating hospital sewage and in drinking water, was studied at dosed concentrations of about 1 mg EE2 L-1. Removal efficiencies of up to 98% were obtained with supplemental efficient eradications of bacteria (up to 3.4 log units). Residual effects were observed when a treated flow was mixed with an untreated flow. An increasing concentration of NaCl resulted in an enhanced EE2 removal. This effect was more pronounced in MBR effluent than in drinking water. To approach more environmentally realistic concentrations, an experiment with initial concentration of 10 mu g EE2 L-1 drinking water was set up, still resulting in an EE2 removal of 85%.

AB The decomposition of ozone in wastewater is observed starting 350 milliseconds after ozone addition. It seems not to be controlled by the autocatalytic chain reaction, hut rather by direct reactions with reactive moieties of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). A larger ozone dose increases ozone consumption prior to 350 milliseconds but decreases the rate of ozone decomposition later on; this effect is predicted by a second-order kinetic model. Transferred ozone Dose (TOD) is poorly correlated with ozone exposure (= integral[O-3]dt) indicating that TOD is not a suitable parameter for the prediction of disinfection or oxidation in wastewater. HO circle concentrations (> 10(-10) M) and R-ct (=integral[HO circle]dt vertical bar integral[O-3]dt > 10(-6)) are larger than in most advanced oxidation processes (AOP) in natural waters, but rapidly decrease over time. R-ct also decreases with increasing pre-ozonation doses. An increase in pH accelerates ozone decomposition and HO circle generation; this effect is predicted by a kinetic model taking into account deprotonation of reactive moieties of the DOM. DOC emerges as a crucial water quality parameter that might be of use to normalize ozone doses when comparing ozonation in different wastewaters. A rapid drop of absorbance in the water matrix-with a maximum between 255-285 nm- is noticeable in the first 350 milliseconds and is directly proportional to ozone consumption. The rate of absorbance decrease at 285 nm is first order with respect to ozone concentration. A kinetic model is introduced to explore ozone decomposition induced by distributions of reactive moieties at sub-stoichiometric ozone concentrations. The model helps visualize and comprehend the operationally defined "instantaneous ozone demand" observed during ozone batch experiments with DOM-containing waters.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter aquatic environments in unchanged form or as metabolites. Little is known about their potential hormonal activity, which is of particular interest due to potential long-term effects on fertility and reproduction in aquatic organisms. Moreover, there is a need to assess the combined activity of pharmaceutical mixtures. In this study, 37 pharmaceuticals have been analysed in vitro for estrogenic activity using a recombinant yeast system expressing the human estrogen receptor a. Six pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes, cimetidine, fenofibrate, furosemide, paracetamol, phenazone and tamoxifen, exhibited weak estrogenic activity. Furosemide showed an almost full concentration-response curve, whereas the other compounds showed low efficacy. The half-maximal activities of the pharmaceuticals were in the range of 0.66-25.53 mM. Furthermore, binary mixtures of furosemide and 17 beta-estradiol (132), and furosemide and phenazone, and mixtures of up to five active pharmaceuticals were assessed for their combinatory activity at different equipotent concentrations. The estrogenic activity of binary mixtures of furosemide with E2 and phenazone, respectively, followed the model of concentration addition (CA). Mixtures of other pharmaceuticals often deviated from the CA model, because extrapolations become inaccurate with only partial and non-parallel concentration-response curves having low efficacy. This demonstrates that full and parallel concentration-response curves are a prerequisite for accurate predictions of mixture activity. Our study demonstrates for the first time weak estrogenic activity in vitro of some common pharmaceuticals and their mixtures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study had three objectives: 1) determine occurrence of antibiotics in effluent from hospitals, residential facilities, and dairies, and in municipal wastewater 2) determine antibiotic removal at a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Albuquerque, NM, and 3) determine concentrations of antibiotics in the Rio Grande, which receives wastewater from the Albuquerque WWTP.
   Twenty-three samples of wastewater and 3 samples of Rio Grande water were analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotics. Fifty-eight percent of samples had at least one antibiotic present while 25% had three or more. Hospital effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lincomycin, and penicillin G, with 4 of 5 hospital samples having at least one antibiotic detected and 3 having four or more. At the residential sampling sites, ofloxacin was found in effluent from assisted living and retirement facilities, while the student dormitory had no detects. Only lincomycin was detected in dairy effluent (in 2 of 8 samples, at 700 and 6600 ng/L). Municipal wastewater had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, with 4 of 6 samples having at least one antibiotic present and 3 having 3 or more. The relatively high concentrations (up to 35,500 ng/L) of ofloxacin found in hospital and residential effluent may be of concern due to potential genotoxic effects and development of antibiotic resistance.
   At the Albuquerque WWTP, both raw wastewater and treated effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and ofloxacin, at concentrations ranging from 110 to 470 ng/L. However, concentrations in treated effluent were reduced by 20% to 77%. No antibiotics were detected in the Rio Grande upstream of the Albuquerque WWTP discharge, and only one antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, was detected in the Rio Grande (300 ng/L) below the WWTP.

Average influent concentrations of OMC, HHCB, OC, AHTN, 4-MBC and OT were at 20070, 4420, 1680,1430, 960 and 720 ng L-1, respectively The other PCMs, permethrin and carbendazim ranged between < limits of quantification and 670 ng L-1. Concentrations in the water line decreased significantly for most compounds. Removal rates for PCMs ranged from 72% to 86%, for UV filters from 92% to > 99% and were at 92% and 37% for permethrin and carbendazim, respectively. Removal during wastewater treatment was mainly driven by sorption onto solids and biodegradation. For anaerobic sludge digestion, elimination of PCMs, OMC and the biocides was observed.

AB Predicted environmental concentrations for five commonly used pharmaceuticals were calculated using data from the UK Department of Health according to risk assessment guidelines proposed by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Surface waters from the South-East of England were analysed and results were compared with predicted concentrations and findings from other studies from the UK and Europe. it was found that the efficacy of these predictions varied and was hampered by a shortage of data for many of the drugs. Ibuprofen, paracetamol and salbutamol were detected and quantified in all locations sampled. Ibuprofen was consistently found at the highest concentrations (up to 3 mu g1(-1)). Levels up and downstream of two wastewater treatment works were compared in order to investigate the link between sewage discharge and environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals. Results from one site demonstrated a considerable increase in concentrations of ibuprofen, salbutamol and paracetamol downstream from the treatment works; however, no link was established for a second works.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are found in municipal effluents and represent the major sources of contamination for the aquatic environment. A preliminary chemical analysis of wastewater identified several compounds associated with PPCPs, including caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine. The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxic and oxidative effects of these products and other wastewater-related products (i.e., coprostanol, cotinine, estradiol-17 beta, nonylphenol, and cholesterol) in primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes. The redox activity of various PPCPs in trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver microsomes was investigated in vitro by tracking the rate of oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) after a 60-min incubation period. In addition, primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to various drugs identified in the municipal effluent for 48 h at 15 degrees C. Our results show that most PPCPs (83%) accelerated the rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of microsomes and 72% of them increased LPO in microsomal membranes. LPO levels were significantly correlated (R = 0.5; P < 0.05) with the number of functional groups on the molecule's backbone (i.e., number of O, S, N, P/number of C and H) and negatively so (R = -0.44; P < 0.05) with the octanol/water partition coefficient, suggesting that nucleophilicity and hydrophobicity are related to oxidative activity for these compounds. Exposure of trout hepatocytes to these products leads in many cases to decreased cell viability, increased CYP3A-related monooxygenase activity (benzylether resorufin dealkylase), and LPO. No induction of CYP1A1-related activity (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase)was observed. Moreover, municipal effluent extracts (ethanol) were able to increase all the above responses in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the basic redox properties of PPCPs could influence oxidative metabolism in liver cells and lead to oxidative damage. These products have the potential to produce a toxic response in aquatic organisms and the above biomarkers were shown to respond readily to PPCPs in aquatic organisms.

AB Effluents front three wastewater treatment plants with varying wastewater treatment technologies and design were analyzed for six antibiotics and caffeine on three sampling occasions. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and clindamycin were detected in the effluents at concentrations rari-im, from 0.090 to 6.0 mu g/L. Caffeine was detected in all effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.19 to 9.9 mu g/L. These findings indicate that several conventional wastewater management practices are not effective in the complete removal of antibiotics. and their discharges have a large potential to affect the aquatic environment. To evaluate the persistence of antibiotics coming from the wastewater discharges on the surrounding surface waters, samples were collected from the receiving streams at 10-, 20- and 100-m intervals. Ciprofloxacin. sulfamethoxazole. and clindamycin (0.043 to 0.076 mu g/L) were found as far as 100 in front the discharge point, which indicates the persistence of these drugs in surface waters.

AB Antibiotics may appear in the environment when manure, sewage sludge, and other organic amendments are added to soils. There is concern that the presence of antibiotics in soils may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which may spread to the rest of the environment. This paper aims at evaluating the sorption kinetics of two antibiotics frequently used in pig production. The results indicate that sorption of chlortetracycline (CTC) and tylosin (TYL) in sandy loam and clay occurs very fast. More than 95% of the CTC adsorption is completed within 10 min on both soils and of TYL within 3 h. These results suggest that 24-h soil and antibiotic solution mixtures is enough for sorption studies. Also, there is less likelihood that these antibiotics will leach through soil and appear in the ground water since their sorption on soils is very high unless they are carried by soil particles through preferential flow. There was also no effect of soil sterilization on sorption kinetics of these antibiotics thus suggesting that there is minimal probability of the antibiotics degrading by microorganisms during 24- to 48-h adsorption studies.

AB Recently, our attention has focused on the low level detection of many antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and other organic chemicals in water resources. The limited studies available suggest that urban or rural streams receiving wastewater effluent are more susceptible to contamination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and other organic chemicals at 18 sites on seven selected streams in Arkansas, USA, during March, April, and August 2004. Water samples were collected upstream and downstream from the influence of effluent discharges in northwestern Arkansas and at one site on a relatively undeveloped stream in north-central Arkansas. At least one antibiotic, pharmaceutical, or other organic chemical was detected at all sites, except at Spavinaw Creek near Mayesville, Arkansas. The greatest number of detections was observed at Mud Creek downstream from an effluent discharge, including 31 pharmaceuticals and other organic chemicals. The detection of these chemicals occurred in higher frequency at sites downstream from effluent discharges compared to those sites upstream from effluent discharges; total chemical concentration was also greater downstream. Wastewater effluent discharge increased the concentrations of detergent metabolites, fire retardants, fragrances and flavors, and steroids in these streams. Antibiotics and associated degradation products were only found at two streams downstream from effluent discharges. Overall, 42 of the 108 chemicals targeted in this study were found in water samples from at least one site, and the most frequently detected organic chemicals included caffeine, phenol, para-cresol, and acetyl hexamethyl tetrahydro naphthalene (AHTN).

AB As part of achieving national environmental goals, the Swedish Government commissioned an official report from the Swedish Medical Products Agency on environmental effects of pharmaceuticals. Considering half-lives/biodegradability, environmental occurrence, and Swedish sales statistics, 27 active pharmaceutical ingredients were selected for environmental hazard and risk assessments. Although there were large data gaps for many of the compounds, nine ingredients were identified as dangerous for the aquatic environment. Only the sex hormones oestradiol and ethinyloestradiol were considered to be associated with possible aquatic environmental risks. We conclude that risk for acute toxic effects in the environment with the current use of active pharmaceutical ingredients is unlikely. Chronic environmental toxic effects, however, cannot be excluded due to lack of chronic ecotoxicity data. Measures to reduce potential environmental impact posed by pharmaceutical products must be based on knowledge on chronic ecotoxic effects of both active phan-naceutical ingredients as well as excipients. We believe that the impact pharmaceuticals have on the environment should be further studied and be given greater attention such that informed assessments of hazards as well as risks can be done.

AB The continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into the environment results in a chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to these substances and their metabolites. As concentrations in surface waters are in the ng/L range, and sometimes in the low mu g/L range, they are not likely to result in lethal toxicity. However, prolonged exposure to low concentrations of anthropogenic chemicals may lead to sublethal effects, including changes in behaviour. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of three pharmaceuticals, the antidepressant fluoxetine, the analgesic ibuprofen and the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, and one cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), on the activity of the benthic invertebrate Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae). We used the multispecies freshwater biomonitor to assess changes in activity of G. pulex in a quantitative manner.
   Exposure to low concentrations (10-100 ng/L) of fluoxetine and ibuprofen resulted in a significant decrease in activity, whereas the activity of G. pulex at higher concentrations (I mu g/L-1 mg/L) was similar to the control. Response to carbamazepine showed a similar pattern, however, differences were not significant. The tested surfactant CTAB evoked a decrease in activity at increasing concentration. These behavioural effect concentrations were 10(4) to 10(7) times lower than previously reported LOECs and in the range of environmentally occurring concentrations. The potential consequences of this decreased activity for G. pulex population growth and benthic community structure and the exposure to mixtures of pharmaceuticals deserves further attention.

AB A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor was used to treat a model substrate mixture representing pharmaceutical wastewater at an organic loading rate of 2.9 g COD/(Ld). After reaching stable operation the reactor was first exposed to low (1 mg/L) and, subsequently, to high ( 200 mg/L) concentrations of the antibiotic erythromycin. The addition of low levels of erythromycin resulted in a significant but limited reduction of biogas production by 5% and the higher level of erythromycin did not impact biogas production further, suggesting that a substantial fraction of the microbial populations in the ASBR were resistant to the antibiotic. Effluent soluble COD could not be accounted for in measured volatile fatty acids, perhaps suggesting the production of soluble microbial products. In batch tests evaluating the specific methanogenic activity, conversion of the model substrate mixture was only slightly affected by the presence of erythromycin. However, the conversion of butyric acid was inhibited when erythromycin was present. After 47 days of exposure to erythromycin, the conversion of butyric acid was inhibited to a lesser extent, suggesting the development of antibiotic resistance in the biomass. Exposure to antibiotics can affect specific substrate degradation pathways, leading to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids, soluble microbial products, and potentially to overall system instabilities.

AB Tamoxifen and 5-fluorouracil are widely used in cancer therapy. They are highly toxic (teratogenic, mutagenic, etc.), as are most of the anticancer drugs. Two methods were set up to analyse these drugs in wastewaters to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination by cytostatic agents. Liquid-liquid extraction followed by purification on OASIS (R) MCX cartridge and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS) was used for the analysis of tamoxifen. 5-Fluorouracil was extracted with an ENV+(Isolute) cartridge (solid-phase extraction), derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) and detected by GC-MS. Both methods showed good recoveries (> 70%), repeatability (RSD < 10%) and limits of detection (LOD 6-15 ng/L). Wastewaters from a residential area, a hospital, and sewage-treatment plants (STPs) were analysed using the analytical methods developed in this study. Tamoxifen was detected in wastewaters of the hospital, residential area, and influent of STPs, but not in treated wastewaters. 5-Fluorouracil in all wastewaters was below the LOD of the analytical method.

AB A pilot study for wastewater treatment in Exir pharmaceutical Co. (Borojerd, Iran) was conducted using a RO system with the capacity of 14.38 m(3)/d. A Filmtec TW30HP-4641 RO element (polyamide, thin-film composite) was used in this study. The pilot plant consists of two spiral-wound RO elements. The RO train was configured in series. Trial runs were conducted at different operating conditions including pressures, temperature and concentration.
   The pilot results showed that flux of water containing nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and sulfite was about 58 l/m(2) h. Taguchi method was employed for flux optimization. Analysis of the experiments indicated that the temperature of feed solution and transmembrane pressure have the most contribution in water flux. The flux was improved to 69 l/m(2) h by setting the control factors according to the Taguchi method. The technique showed that concentration of feed solution has the highest contribution in rejection of a solution containing nitrate, nitrite, sulfite and phosphate. After setting the control factor according to the Taguchi method rejection was enhanced to 99.9% for this case study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal wastewaters are recognized as a major source of pharmaceutical and personal care products to the aquatic environment, thereby exposing biota to unknown chronic effects. This study sought to examine the immunotoxic effects of pharmaceutical and urban waste products on the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Hemolymph samples were collected and treated in vitro with increasing concentrations of various drugs (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, morphine, naproxen, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazole, sulfapyridine and trimethoprim) and urban waste related chemicals (coprostanol, caffeine, cotinine) for 24 h at 15 degrees C. In a parallel experiment, mussels were caged and placed in two final aeration lagoons for the treatment of domestic wastewaters. At the end of the exposure period, hemolymphs were tested for phagocytic activity, intracellular esterase activity, cell adherence and lipid peroxidation (LPO). The products that most increased phagocytosis were bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and trimethoprim, while novobiocin and morphine reduced its activity. Intracellular esterase activity was reduced most strongly with sulfamethazole, novobiocin, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate and carbamazepine. Cell adherence was decreased by oxytetracycline, novobiocin and naproxen, and increased by gemfibrozil, bezafibrate and sulfapyridine. Exposure to these products also modulated LPO in hemocytes. Coprostanol and naproxen were more potent to reduce LPO while novobiocin and sulfapyridine were the most potent to induce LPO. The potential to induce LPO was positively correlated with the number of functional groups on the molecule (i.e., its nucleophilicity). Mussels exposed to domestic wastewater treatment plant aeration lagoons had decreased intracellular esterase and phagocytic activity as well, suggesting immunosuppression. PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) that are recognized to disrupt cytokine signalling network by the nitric oxide pathway and cell permeability were generally the most potent ones. The data suggest that PPCPs have the potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system of bivalves. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The algal growth responses to the effluents of an aluminum plating plant and to the wastewater from an analgesic/ antiinflammatory-drug-producing pharmaceutical plant were investigated. Growth response of the marine alga Dunaliella tertiolecta was monitored by measuring the two response parameters optical density (OD640) and in vitro chlorophyll fluorescence for a period of 14 days. Generally, the two response measurements gave similar results for all effluents but the raw effluents of the aluminum plating plant due to the composition of the wastewater. All wastes affected algal growth either by inhibition only or by stimulation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. Since pollutant tolerance of algae biased toxicity test results, acclimation of algae to the raw effluent of the aluminum plating plant was examined. Although the water quality parameters of treated effluent of both plants were in the permitted range reported by the Turkish Water Pollution Control Act, they inhibited growth at higher concentrations, implying that the two treatment plants were inefficient. Therefore, the importance of toxicity tests in wastewater discharge regulations was emphasized. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Veterinary antibiotics are widely used at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to prevent disease and promote growth of livestock. However, the majority of antibiotics are excreted from animals in urine, feces, and manure. Consequently, the lagoons used to store these wastes can act as reservoirs of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There is currently no regulation or control of these systems to prevent the spread of these bacteria and their genes for antibiotic resistance into other environments. This study was conducted to determine the disinfection potential of chlorine, ultraviolet light and ozone against swine lagoon bacteria. Results indicate that a chlorine dose of 30mg/L could achieve a 2.2-3.4 log bacteria reduction in lagoon samples. However, increasing the dose of chlorine did not significantly enhance the disinfection activity due to the presence of chlorine-resistant bacteria. The chlorine resistant bacteria were identified to be closely related to Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis. A significant percentage of lagoon bacteria were not susceptible to the four selected antibiotics: chlortetracycline, lincomycin, sulfamethazine and tetracycline (TET). However, the presence of both chlorine and TET could inactivate all bacteria in one lagoon sample. The disinfection potential of UV irradiation and ozone was also examined. Ultraviolet light was an effective bacterial disinfectant, but was unlikely to be economically viable due to its high energy requirements. At an ozone dose of 100mg/L, the bacteria inactivation efficiency could reach 3.3-3.9 log. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Samples from several wastewater treatment facilities in Wisconsin were screened for the presence of 21 antibiotic compounds. These facilities spanned a range of community size served (average daily flow from 0.0212 to 23.6 million gallons/day), secondary treatment processes, geographic locations across the state, and they discharged the treated effluents to both surface and ground waters (for ground water after a soil passage). A total of six antibiotic compounds were detected (1-5 compounds per site), including two sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole), one tetracycline (tetracycline), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin), macrolide (erythromycin-H2O) and trimethoprim. The frequency of detection of antibiotics was in the following order: tetracycline and trimethoprim (80%)> sulfamethoxazole (70%)> erythromycin-H2O (45%)> ciprofloxacin (40%) > sulfamethazine (10%). However, the soluble concentrations were in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range (<= 1.3 mu g/L), and importantly were unaffected by the size of the wastewater treatment facility. The concentrations detected were within an order of magnitude of those reported for similar systems in Europe and Canada: they were within a factor of two in comparison to those reported for Canada but generally lower relative to those measured in wastewater systems in Europe. Only sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were detected in groundwater monitoring wells adjacent to the treatment systems. Future intensive wastewater monitoring programs in Wisconsin may be limited to the six antibiotic compounds detected in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) could represent a useful marker of contamination of effluent from agricultural land receiving biosolids. The persistence characteristics of caffeine in three agricultural soils was investigated. In laboratory microcosms of moist soil incubated at 30 degrees C, [8-ring-C-14]-caffeine was rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 in a sandy loam and a loam soil, and less rapidly in a silt loam soil. Caffeine mineralization was very responsive to soil temperature and moisture. Mineralization of caffeine was hastened by the addition of liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) from three municipal sewage-treatment plants (MSTPs) that aerate this material. In contrast, LMB from three MSTPs that did not aerobically digest their LMB did not accelerate caffeine mineralization. Autoclaved LMB had no effect on caffeine dissipation. A bacterium, designated Pseudomonas sp. Strain TH1, was isolated from aerated LMB. The bacterium first demethylated caffeine to 3,7-dimethylxanthirle, and then mineralized the molecule. Inoculation of Pseudomonas sp. Strain TH1 into soil hastened mineralization of [8-ring-C-14]caffeine. In summary, caffeine was more stable in a silt loam soil than a sandy loam or loam soil, but biodegradation in all three soils was quite uniform upon the addition of caffeine-degrading bacteria or aerated biosolids. We suggest that caffeine would likely not be a suitably conservative chemical marker for detecting chronic contamination of agricultural drainage water following fertilization with LMB. Aerobic digestion of LMB promotes the enrichment of caffeine-degrading microorganisms.

AB Pharmaceutical products for humans and animals, as well as their related metabolites end up in the aquatic environment after use. Recent investigations show that concentrations of pharmaceuticals are detectable in the order of ng/l - mu g/l in municipal wastewater, groundwater and also drinking water. Little is known about the effects, and the hazard of long-term exposure to low concentrations of pharmaceuticals for non-target aquatic organisms.
   This study was designed to assess the ecotoxicity of furosemide, a potent diuretic agent, and its photoproduct in the aquatic environment. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, rotifers and microcrustaceans to assess acute and chronic toxicity. while the SOS Chromotest and the Ames test were utilized to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds.
   A first approach to risk characterization was to calculate the environmental impact of furosemide by measured environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration ratio (MEC/PNEC). To do so we used occurrence data reported in the literature and our toxicity results. The results showed that acute toxicity was in the order of mg/l for the crustaceans and absent for bacteria and rotifers. Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on the consumers, while the algae did not seem to be affected. A mutagenic potential was found for the photoproduct compared to the parental compound suggesting that byproducts ought to be considered in the environmental assessment of drugs. The risk calculated for furosemide suggested its harmlessness on the aquatic compartment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low-temperature or psychrophilic (< 20 degrees C) anaerobic biological treatment of simple industrial wastewaters has recently been proven feasible as an alternative to more expensive mesophilic (ca. 37 degrees C) technology. We implemented novel expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-based bioreactor designs for 27 psychrophilic anaerobic digestion (PAD) trials for the treatment of a broad range of simple and complex synthetic wastewaters representing dairy, food-processing and pharmaceutical sector effluents. A variety of operating parameters, such as hydraulic retention time, organic and volumetric loading rates and upflow velocity, were tested. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were recorded, which were comparable to previous mesophilic trials. Specific methanogenic activity, toxicity and biodegradability batch assays were employed to monitor the metabolic capabilities of microbial consortia in anaerobic reactors. The prevalence of psychrotolerant communites was observed and psychrophilic populations were detected in two of the reactors. The potential of PAD with respect to global sustainable development is discussed.

AB Removal efficiencies of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), bisphenol A and nonylphenol, during various types of water treatment processes were evaluated extensively using laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments. The specific processes of interest were coagulation/flocculation sedimentation/filtration (conventional water treatment process), powdered activated carbon (PAC), granular activated carbon (GAC), ozonation and chlorination. Batch sorption tests, coagulation tests, and ozone oxidation tests were also performed at higher concentrations with 14 EDCs including bisphenol A. The conventional water treatment process had very low removal efficiencies (0 to 7%) for all the EDCs except DEHP, DBP and DEP that were removed by 53%, 49%, and 46%, respectively. Ozonation at 1 mgO(3)/L removed 60% of bisphenol A and 89% of nonylphenol, while chlorination at 1 mg/L removed 58% and 5%, respectively. When ozone and chlorine doses were 4 and 5 mg/L, respectively, both EDCs were not detected. PAC removal efficiencies ranged from 15% to 40% at 3 to 10 mg/L of PAC with a contact time of 15 minutes. In the high concentration batch sorption tests, EDC removal efficiencies by PAC were closely related to octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow). GAC adsorption was very effective water treatment process. The type and service time of GAC did not affect EDC removal efficiencies. The combination of ozonation and GAC in series appears to remove EDCs effectively to safe levels while conventional water treatment could not.

AB A simple classification scheme is suggested to characterize the biological degradation of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances and estrogens during wastewater treatment. The scheme should be a basis for the discussion about potential removal efficiencies. Hence, the biological degradation of 25 pharmaceuticals, hormones and fragrances was studied in batch experiments at typical concentration levels using activated sewage sludge originating from nutrient-eliminating municipal wastewater treatment plants.
   Since pseudo first-order degradation kinetics was observed for all compounds down to ngL(-1) levels, the removal rates can be predicted for various reactor configurations. Therefore dilution of wastewater (e.g. by extraneous water) is expected to reduce the degree of biological removal. Wastewater segregation and treatment at the source are therefore to be favoured for elimination of persistent micropollutants over centralized end-of-pipe treatment. For reactor configurations typical for nutrient removal in municipal wastewater, the derived formula for predicting removal allows the identification of three groups of micropollutants according to their degradation constant k(biol): compounds with k(biol)<0.1Lg(ss)(-1)d(-1) are not removed to a significant extent (<20%), compounds with k(biol)>10Lg(ss)(-1)d(-1) transformed by >90% and in-between moderate removal is expected. Based on the degradation of a heterogeneous group of 35 compounds (including literature data), state of the art biological treatment schemes for municipal wastewater are not efficient in degrading pharmaceuticals: only 4 out of 35 compounds are degraded by more than 90% while 17 compounds are removed by less than 50%.

AB Due to a lack of adequate experimental techniques, the kinetics of the first 20 s of ozone decomposition in natural water and wastewater is still poorly understood. Introducing a continuous quench-flow system (CQFS), measurements starting 350 ms after ozone addition are presented for the first time. Very high HO. to O-3 exposures ratios (R-ct = integral HO(.)dt/integral O(3)dt) reveal that the first 20s of ozonation present oxidation conditions that are similar to ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOP). The oxidation of carbamazepine could be accurately modeled using O-3 and HO. exposures measured with CQFS during wastewater ozonation. These results demonstrate the applicability of bench scale determined second-order rate constants for wastewater ozonation. Important degrees of pharmaceutical oxidation and microbial inactivation are predicted, indicating that a significant oxidation potential is available during wastewater ozonation, even when ozone is entirely decomposed in the first 20 s.

AB Triclosan, widely employed as an antimicrobial additive in many household personal care products, has recently been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents and in source waters used for drinking water supplies. Chloramines used either as alternative disinfectants in drinking water treatment or formed during chlorination of nonnitrified wastewater effluents have the potential to react with triclosan. This study examined triclosan reactivity in chloraminated waters over the pH range of 6.5-10.5. Experimental and modeling results show that monochloramine directly reacts with the phenolate form of triclosan; however, the reaction is relatively slow as evinced by the second-order rate constant k(Ar0-NH2Cl) = 0.025 M-1 s(-1). Kinetic modeling indicates that for pH values less than 9.5, reactions between triclosan and two monochloramine autodecomposition intermediates, hypochlorous acid (k(Ar0-HOCl) = 5.4 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1)) and dichloramine (k(Ar0-NHCl2) = 60 M-1 s(-1)), are responsible for a significant percentage of the observed triclosan decay. The products of these reactions include three chlorinated triclosan byproducts as well as 2,4- dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. Low levels of chloroform were detected after 1 week at pH values of 6.5 and 7.5. The slow reactivity of triclosan in the presence of chloramines explains the recalcitrance of this species in nonnitrified wastewater effluents.

AB We recently proposed how to expand the applicability of multimedia models towards polar organic chemicals by expressing environmental phase partitioning with the help of poly-parameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs). Here we elaborate on this approach by applying it to three pharmaceutical substances. A PP-LFER-based version of a Level III fugacity model calculates overall persistence, concentrations and intermedia fluxes of polar and non-polar organic chemicals between air, water, soil and sediments at steady-state. Illustrative modeling results for the pharmaceuticals within a defined coastal region are presented and discussed. The model results are highly sensitive to the degradation rate in water and the equilibrium partitioning between organic carbon and water, suggesting that an accurate description of this particular partitioning equilibrium is essential in order to obtain reliable predictions of environmental fate. The PP-LFER based modeling approach furthermore illustrates that the greatest mobility in aqueous phases may be experienced by pharmaceuticals that combines a small molecular size with strong H-acceptor properties.

AB Pharmaceutical substances have been detected in sewage effluents as well as receiving waters in many parts of the world. To assess the fate and removal of these compounds within sewage treatment plants, an understanding of their partitioning behavior between the solid and aqueous phases is critical. Therefore, a preliminary study was conducted to ascertain an understanding of the binding behavior of five drug substances sorbing to the solid phase in a laboratory scale-activated sludge plant (Husmann unit). For comparison, uncontaminated river sediment was also used as a substrate. All of the compounds tested partitioned more readily to the sludge than the sediment, likely because of the former's higher organic carbon content. Partitioning to the solid phase correlated roughly with predicted log K-ow values. A period of initial sorption was followed by a phase of desorption, and net absorption of the selected drugs (with the exception of mefenamic acid) after 5 hours of mixing was minimal.

AB Degradation rates and removal efficiencies of Metronidazole using UV, UV/H2O2, H2O2/Fe2+, and LTV/H2O2/Fe2+ were studied in de-ionized water. The four different oxidation processes were compared for the removal kinetics of the antimicrobial pharmaceutical Metronidazole. It was found that the degradation of Metronidazole by UV and UV/ H2O2 exhibited pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. By applying H2O2/Fe2+, and UV/H2O2/Fe2+ the degradation kinetics followed a second order behavior. The quantum yields for direct photolysis, measured at 254 mn and 200400 nm, were 0.0033 and 0.0080 mol E-1, respectively. Increasing the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide promoted the oxidation rate by UV/ H2O2. Adding more ferrous ions enhanced the oxidation rate for the H2O2/Fe2+ and UV/H2O2/Fe2+ processes. The major advantages and disadvantages of each process and the complexity of comparing the various advanced oxidation processes on an equal basis are discussed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of the antiepileptic, analgesic drug carbamazepine on the growth, morphology, and life-history characteristics of Daphnia pulex were examined at nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 200 mu g L-1. At 1 mu g carbamazepine L-1, Daphnia matured and reproduced slightly earlier than did controls, and at a given body length females produced more offspring than did controls or those receiving other treatments. In combination with a relatively high juvenile somatic growth rate and highest total number of progeny produced per female, carbamazepine at 1 mu g L-1 seemed to exert a stimulatory effect. The rates of population growth of the 100 and 200 mu g L-1 treatment groups was 9% and 32% lower, respectively, than the rates of growth of the controls and the Daphnia receiving treatments of up to 10 mu g carbamazepine L-1. At the highest dose, retardation of juvenile somatic growth resulted in delayed maturity and consequently in a lower rate of population growth. Adult somatic growth, spine length, reproductive output, and size of newborns were similar among treatments. Male offspring were only produced in the third broods, with broods that were 8% and 28% male at 1 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Neck teeth were never observed in Daphnia. Chronic adverse effects of carbamazepine on nontarget Daphnia were detected at 200 mu g carbamazepine L-1, but stimulatory effects might occur at environmentally realistic concentrations. However, additional studies of chronic toxicity investigating various combinations of pharmaceuticals and various environmental stresses, such as food condition, temperature, and kairomones, are needed to fully explore potential long-term adverse effects and to assess the environmental risk of common pharmaceuticals.

AB The relevance of endocrine-disrupting compounds as potential contaminants of drinking water is reviewed, particularly in the reuse of wastewater. Growing populations and increasing intensification of land and water use for industry and agriculture have increased the need to reclaim wastewater for reuse, including to supplement the drinking water supply. The variety of anthropogenic chemicals that have been identified as potential endocrine disruptors in the environment and the problems arising from their use as human and livestock pharmaceuticals, as agricultural chemicals and in industry are discussed. The potentially adverse impact of these chemicals on human health and the ecology of the natural environment are reviewed. Data for the removal of estrogenic compounds from wastewater treatment are presented, together with the comparative potencies of estrogenic compounds. The relative exposure to estrogens of women on oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and through food consumption is estimated. A brief overview of some methods available or under development for the assessment of estrogenic activity in environmental samples is provided. The review concludes with a discussion of the directions for further investigation, which include human epidemiology, methodology development, and wastewater monitoring.

AB Ozone and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) reaction kinetics were measured for 14 antibacterial compounds from nine structural families, to determine whether municipal wastewater ozonation is likely to result in selective oxidation of these compounds' biochemically essential moieties. Each substrate is oxidized by ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant, k(O3,app)' > 1 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), at pH 7, with the exception of N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole (k(O3,app)' is 2.5 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) k(O3,app)' values (pH 7) for macrolides, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, vancomycin, and amikacin appear to correspond directly to oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. Initial reactions of ozone with N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, lincomycin, and beta-lactams do not lead to appreciable oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. However, ozone oxidizes these moieties within fluoroquinolones and lincomycin via slower reactions. Measured k(O3,app)' values and second-order center dot OH rate constants, k(center dot OH,app') were utilized to characterize pollutant losses during ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent. These losses were dependent on k(O3,app)', but independent of k(center dot OH,app)". H,app- Ozone doses >= 3 mg/L yielded >= 99% depletion of fast-reacting substrates (k(O3,app)' > 5 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) at pH 7.7. Ten substrates reacted predominantly with ozone; only four were oxidized predominantly by center dot OH. These results indicate that many antibacterial compounds will be oxidized in wastewater via moiety-specific reactions with ozone.

AB Emissions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO,) from spent mycelia of the mold Penicilium notatum and sludge from the effluent treatment facility (ETPS) of a pharmaceutical industry were estimated twice during a two-week composting before vermicomposting. These wastes are dumped in landfills or sometimes used in agricultural fields and no reports are available on their greenhouse gas producing potentials. The solid wastes contained appreciable organic carbon and nitrogen while very high Fe, Mn and Zn were found in ETPS only. Pure wastes did not support germination of Vigna radiata L. while mixing soil with ETPS and spent mycelia at the ratios of 12:1 and 14:1 led to 80% and 50% germination, respectively. The wastes were mixed with cowdung at the ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 for composting. Carbon dioxide emissions were always significantly higher than CH4 emissions from all the treatments due to prevalence of aerobic condition during composting. From some treatments, CH4 emissions increased with time, indicating increasing activity of anaerobic bacteria in the waste mixtures. Methane emissions ranged from 21.6 to 231.7 mu g m(-2) day(-1) while CO2 emissions were greater than thousand times at 39.8-894.8 mg m(-2) day(-1). The amount of C emitted as CH4-C and CO2-C from ranged from 0.007% to 0.081% of total C composted. Cowdung emitted highest CH4 followed by spent mycelia and ETPS while ETPS emitted more CO2 than spent mycelia but lesser than cowdung. Global warming potential of emitted CH4 was found to be in the range of 10.6-27.7 mg-CO2-equivalent on a 20-year time horizon. The results suggest that pharmaceutical wastes can be an important source of CH4 and CO2 during composting or any other stockpiling under suitable moisture conditions. The waste mixtures were found not suitable for vermicomposting after two weeks composting and earthworms did not survive long in the mixtures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. In the past few years, there was an increasing awareness of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water and drinking water resources, and measurements in surface water, sediment or waste water were done for a number of PPCPs. In the regulatory context, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has become essential for new PPCPs. Reliably predicted or measured environmental concentrations (PECs or MECs) of chemicals are essential for the exposure assessment, which is one of the two main pillars of environmental risk assessment (ERA). This paper reports on measured data of selected PPCPs in surface waters and compares the measured values with predicted environmental concentrations from exposure models. Such models have been proposed by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and the Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for New Notified and Existing Chemical Substances (TGD).
   Methods. Four pharmaceuticals and one personal care product were in the scope of the investigation reported here: 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide as well as tonalide. Measured environmental concentrations in surface waters for these PPCPs were reviewed in the scientific literature. The appropriateness of these data was evaluated according to criteria for monitoring data recommended by the TGD. A total of 38 references were evaluated with emphasis on the adequacy of chemical analysis and the representativeness of sampling. Measurements of concentrations in surface water (MECsw), which were found to be adequate for use in exposure assessment according to the monitoring quality criteria, were averaged and compared with respective PECs in surface water (PECsw) derived from exposure modelling (cf. EMEA and TGD).
   Results and Discussion. Measured environmental concentrations adequate for use in exposure assessment were found in 20 out of 38 references. Several of the measurements from Germany could be used for a comparison with calculated PECs. Average MECssw in Germany were < 0.58 ng/L for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 454 ng/L for carbamazepine, 126 ng/L for sulfamethoxazole, 1105 ng/L for iopromide and 311 ng/L for tonalide. In comparison to the measured concentrations, PECs calculated with the model proposed by the EMEA in 2001 were in the same range, but slightly higher than the MECs. The EMEA model from 2001 is based on a production/use volume of the PPCPs. The more recent EMEA model (2003/2005) overestimated the PECs by more than one order of magnitude for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, but underestimated the concentration of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol by a factor of almost 5 compared to the MECs. This model is based on maximum daily doses and the assumption that 1% of the population is consuming the pharmaceutical (default value). Calculations with the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), which is part of the TGD describing the risk assessment of chemicals and biocides, resulted for the investigated pharmaceuticals in almost the same PECs as derived by the older EMEA model (2001). For the PCP tonalide, to which the recent EMEA model (2003/ 2005) cannot be applied, the PEC was overestimated by a factor of 3 with the older EMEA model (2001), but underestimated with EUSES by a factor of 5 compared to the averaged MECsw in Germany.
   Conclusions. It was shown that PEC calculations with exposure models provided by EMEA and the TGD, resulted in PECs very close to the corresponding MECs in most cases. However, environmental concentrations can be underestimated by models in cases, where, e.g. due to high lipophilicity, sorption to sewage sludge is assumed which does not occur to that extent under real conditions. Thus, it appears that the exposure models do not come up to the complexity of the real environment. However, the main factor with the highest impact on predicted environmental concentrations and a high degree of uncertainty is the production volume.
   Recommendations and Outlook. References and their data evaluated as not adequate for use in exposure assessment were mainly rejected due to missing or insufficient specifications related to the sampling procedure and/or representativeness of the samples. Several of the evaluated studies aimed at the introduction and establishment of a new analytical methodology. A detailed description of sampling frequency and pattern, for example, was therefore neglected. Often, a more accurate description of analytical procedure, sampling pattern and statistical analysis of data would be sufficient to provide an adequate basis for exposure assessment and hence establish confidence in environmental risk assessment procedures.
   For new substances, an exposure assessment is solely based on estimations using environmental fate models. To avoid unacceptable risks for the environment, PECs should not underestimate actual environmental concentrations. Since it was shown that under specific conditions the models applied in this study underestimated measured environmental concentrations, further development of the calculation models appears to be necessary.

AB This paper presents the results of a survey of the wastewater effluent and surface waters of the lower river Tyne, UK. Samples were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry following solid phase extraction, for the presence of 13 pharmaceuticals selected from the priority lists of the UK Environment Agency and the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR). The pharmaceutical compounds measured were acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, clofibric acid, clotrimazole, dextropropoxyphene, diclofenac, erythromycin, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, tamoxifen and trimethoprim. Of the wastewater treatment works (WTW) samples (n = 9) analysed, all compounds except sulfametboxazole and acetylsulfamethoxazole were detected at concentrations ranging from 11 to 69,570 ng l(-1) (in raw effluent). In the surface water samples (n = 18), clotrimazole, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin, ibuprofen, propranolol, tamoxifen and trimethoprim were detected at concentrations ranging from 4 to 2370 ng l(-1). Results of this study show that various pharmaceutical compounds are effectively reduced during their passage through a tertiary wastewater treatment works, whilst others are sufficiently persistent to occur in estuarine systems.

AB Green chemists have recently created enzyme-like catalysts called tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand activators (TAMLs) that are capable of destroying stubborn pollutants by accelerating cleansing reactions with hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. When applied to the wastewater from pulp mills, TAMLs have been shown to reduced staining and hazardous chemicals. TAMLs could also be used to treat runoff from agricultural waste lagoons as well as residential sewage, which contains dyes from washing machines and traces of harmful pharmaceuticals that are excreted in human urine. These catalysts may also someday be used to disinfect drinking water and clean up contamination from bioterror attacks.

AB To assess the stability of precursors of the chloramine disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) under conditions expected in effluent-dominated surface waters, effluent samples from four municipal wastewater treatment plants were subjected to chlorination and chloramination followed by incubation in the presence of inocula derived from activated sludge. Samples subjected to free chlorine disinfection showed lower initial concentrations of NDMA precursors than those that were not chlorinated or were disinfected with pre-formed chloramines. For chloraminated and control (unchlorinated) treatments, the concentration of NDMA precursors decreased by an average of 24% over the 30-day incubation in samples from three of the four facilities. At the fourth facility, where samples were collected on three different days, NDMA precursor concentrations decreased by approximately 80% in one sample and decreased by less than 20% in the other two samples. in contrast to the low reactivity of the NDMA precursors, NDMA disappeared within 30 days under the conditions employed in these experiments. These results and measurements made in an effluent-dominated river suggest that although NDMA may be removed after wastewater effluent is discharged, wastewater-derived NDMA precursors could persist long enough to form significant concentrations of NDMA in drinking water treatment plants that use water originating from sources that are subjected to wastewater effluent discharges.

AB There is an increasing trend to require more efficient use of water resources, both in urban and rural environments. A major mechanism that can be used to achieve greater efficiencies is the reuse of water that once would have been discarded into the environment after use. The reuse of water for agricultural irrigation is often viewed as a positive means of recycling water due to the potential large volumes of water that can be used. Recycled water can have the advantage of being a constant, reliable water source and reduces the amount of water extracted from the environment. In addition, in some cases treatment requirements may be need to be less than for water used in an urban environment due to less potential human contact. There are concerns and unknowns, however, about the impact of the quality of the recycled water, both on the crop itself and on the end users of the crops. Water quality issues that can create real or perceived problems in agriculture include nutrient and sodium concentrations, heavy metals, and the presence of contaminants such as human and animal pathogens, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors. Social attitudes to the use of crops that have been irrigated with recycled waters and the resulting impact on market value of crops are also a major consideration. This paper will discuss the benefits from using different types of recycled water and outline the current knowledge and opinions relating to risks such as water quality issues.

AB Reports of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have raised substantial concern among important potable drinking water and reclaimed wastewater quality issues. Our study investigates the removal of EDC/PPCPs of 52 compounds having different physico-chemical properties (e.g., size, hydrophobicity, and polarity) by nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes using a dead-end stirred-cell filtration system. EDC/PPCPs were applied to the membrane in one model water and three natural waters. Experiments were performed at environmentally relevant initial EDC/PPCP concentrations ranging typically from 2 to < 250 ng/L. EDC/PPCP retention was quantified by liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. A general separation trend due to hydrophobic adsorption as a function of octanol-water partition coefficient was observed between the hydrophobic compounds and porous hydrophobic membrane during the membrane filtration in unequilibrium conditions. The results showed that the NF membrane retained many EDC/PPCPs due to both hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion, while the UF membrane retained typically hydrophobic EDC/PPCPs due mainly to hydrophobic adsorption. However, the transport phenomenon associated with adsorption may depend on water chemistry conditions and membrane material. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current water quality guidelines for reclaimed wastewater have predominantly addressed risks associated with the presence of microbial organisms. Comparatively, chemical parameters have been largely overlooked or inadequately considered. Acceptable levels of chemical parameters will be dependant on the proposed reuse applications for the water and, in many cases, site-specific factors such as the degree of dilution with water from other sources. However, some general principals for the determination of acceptable levels of chemical contaminants in reclaimed water may be applied universally. This study describes a general risk-assessment approach to the determination of acceptable contaminant concentrations. It provides some analysis of the principal functions of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response relationship characterisation and risk characterisation as they relate to chemical contaminants in reclaimed water. Examples of some key modelling calculations for this process are provided for three selected contaminants (chloroform, 1, 1, 2-trichloroethane and pyrene) during hypothetical irrigation of agricultural areas. Predicted environmental concentrations were calculated and compared with predicted no effect concentrations. The results of the hypothetical modelling exercise indicate that the contaminants considered in this theoretical analysis pose an acceptable risk to human health via the single exposure path considered (uptake through food grown in the irrigated soil).

AB In an engineering context the precautionary principle is often perceived as an excuse to do nothing or a substantial barrier to technical progress. The precautionary principle requires that remedial measures be taken in situations of scientific uncertainty where evidence of harm cannot be proven but potential damage to human or environmental health is significant. In this paper the scope of the precautionary principle in water recycling is discussed. It is clear that uncertainties and risks exist in many areas of water recycling. These risks are closely linked to the risks of sewage discharge. Hence, water recycling has two main areas of concern: (1) the dilemma that minimising potential environmental harm by reducing effluent discharge may increase potential harm through reducing the water flow in receiving waters and (2) the consequences of using recycled water of varying quality for a number of applications. The precautionary principle can be regarded as an opportunity to improve water recycling practice and in fact increase the scope of ecologically sustainable water recycling. The precautionary principle has an important role to play as a guide in decision making and in dealing with the vast number of risks and uncertainties in water recycling.

AB NPRO membrane filtration processes have been recognized as an important technology to facilitate water recycling. Those processes are well-proven technologies, which can be used to remove a wide range of contaminants including trace contaminants that are of particular concern in water recycling. However, risk implications in association with brine or concentrate and membrane cleaning wastewater disposal have to date not been adequately understood. This study examines the adsorption and release process of several endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during NF/RO filtration processes. Results reported here indicate that the membrane can serve as a large reservoir for EDCs and their release may be possible during membrane cleaning, or erratic pH variation during operation. Treatment of membrane cleaning solution should be carefully considered when EDCs are amongst the target contaminants in NF/RO membrane filtration.

AB Clofibric acid is the active metabolite of several fibrate drugs prescribed to reduce blood cholesterol levels. It is persistent and widely detected in the environment. Clofibric acid toxicity was assessed using three estuarine organisms: an alga (Dunaliella tertiolecta), a crustacean (Palaemonetes pugio), and a fish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Mortality and sublethal physiological responses (protein, lipid, cholesterol, and cytochrome P450 levels) were examined. Clofibric acid did not significantly affect cell density or growth rate of D. tertiolecta (concentrations <= 1000 mu g/L). Survival of P. pugio and E heteroclitus were also unaffected at clofibric acid concentrations <= 1000 mu g/L. In addition, no significant changes in the sublethal test endpoints were found. An additional chronic (17-day) exposure of F heteroclitus to clofibric acid (10 mu g/L) was conducted and found no effects on survival or sublethal endpoints. The rabbit polyclonal CYP450 4A antibody did cross react with E heteroclitus, demonstrating that a CYP4A-like isoform is present in this teleost species and may be used in future induction studies. Clofibric acid, however, did not alter CYP4A levels in F heteroclitus. Measured concentrations in the environment have not exceeded 10 mu g/L. Therefore, the results of this study indicate a low risk of adverse effects from environmental exposure to clofibric acid for the species tested. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Southern California imports nearly all of its potable water from two sources: the Colorado River and the California State Water Project (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin). Sewage treatment plant effluent (STPE) heavily impacts both of these sources. A survey of raw and treated drinking water from four water filtration plants in San Diego County showed the occurrence of several polar organic '' pharmaceuticals and personal care products '' (PPCP). These included phthalate esters, sunscreens, clofibrate, clofribric acid, ibuprofen, triclosan, and DEET. Several of these were also found in the finished water, such as di(ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzophenone, ibuprofen, and triclosan. Occurrence and concentrations of these compounds were highly seasonally dependent, and reached maximums when the flow of the San Joaquin River was low and the quantity of imported water was high. The maximum concentrations of the PPCPs measured in the raw water were correlated with low flow conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that feeds the State Water Project. The PPCP concentrations in raw imported water in the summer months approached that of reclaimed nonpotable wastewater.

AB The behavior and fate of three fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin), one sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole), and trimethoprim were investigated at a sewage treatment plant in Umea, Sweden, in 2004. This plant uses conventional mechanical, chemical, and activated sludge methods to treat the sewage water and digest the sludge; the dewatered digested sludge is pelleted (dry weight > 90% of total weight). Raw sewage water and particles as well as effluents and sludge from specific treatment areas within the plant were sampled. In addition to quantifying the antibiotics within the plant, we characterized the sample matrixes to facilitate evaluation of the results. Of the five substances examined, only norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim were present in concentrations higher than their limits of quantification. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin sorbed to sludge in a manner that was independent of changes in pH during sewage treatment, and more than 70% of the total amount of these compounds passing through the plant was ultimately found in the digested sludge. The results suggest that fluoroquinolones undergo thermal degradation during pelleting, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Trimethoprim was found in the final effluent at approximately the same concentration and mass flow as in the raw sewage, and could not be quantified in any solid sample. Predicted environmental concentrations, based on consumption data for Umea municipality, correlated well with the results obtained, especially when the predicted concentrations were corrected to account for the amount of each active substance excreted in urine. The results obtained were compared to those of previous studies of these three substances' behavior and fate and were found to be similar, although some of the other plants studied employed the various treatment steps in different orders.

AB The removal of selected pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, carbamazepme and sulfamethoxazole) by chemical coagulation was studied. Jar test experiments were done in MilliQ water, in lake water and in commercial humic acid solutions using aluminium (pH 6) and ferric sulphate (pH 4.5). The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the studied water samples were determined by HPLC analysis and UV detection. In MilliQ water coagulation, the pharmaceuticals were poorly removed (<10%) with the exception of diclofenac, which was removed up to 66% with ferric sulphate. This compound was also the only pharmaceutical removed (30%) during the lake water coagulation with ferric sulphate. In the presence of dissolved humic matter, diclofenac as well as ibuprofen and bezafibrate could be removed by ferric sulphate coagulation. The removal of diclofenac reached a maximum of 77% while 50% of ibuprofen and 365 of bezafibrate were removed. Hence, a high amount of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter enhanced the removal of ionisable pharmaceuticals. The non-ionisable compounds, carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, were not affected by the coagulation processes studied. Although conditions such as high humic material content, low coagulation pH and ferric coagulant increase the removal of certain ionic pharmaceuticals, it can be concluded that by coagulation it is not possible to entirely remove pharmaceuticals from water.

AB Three sites in the Front Range of Colorado, USA, were monitored from May through September 2003 to assess the presence and distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil irrigated with reclaimed water derived from urban wastewater. Soil cores were collected monthly, and 19 pharmaceuticals, all of which were detected during the present study, were measured in 5-cm increments of the 30-cm cores. Samples of reclaimed water were analyzed three times during the study to assess the input of pharmaceuticals. Samples collected before the onset of irrigation in 2003 contained numerous pharmaceuticals, likely resulting from the previous year's irrigation. Several of the selected pharmaceuticals increased in total soil concentration at one or more of the sites. The four most commonly detected pharmaceuticals were erythromycin, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and diphenhydramine. Typical concentrations of the individual pharmaceuticals observed were low (0.02-15 mu g/kg dry soil). The existence of subsurface maximum concentrations and detectable concentrations at the lowest sampled soil depth might indicate interactions of soil components with pharmaceuticals during leaching through the vadose zone. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates that reclaimed-water irrigation results in soil pharmaceutical concentrations that vary through the irrigation season and that some compounds persist for months after irrigation.

AB The antimicrobial triclosan was analyzed in unfiltered samples from influent, effluent, and receiving stream and before and after a pilot-scale constructed wetland at a North Texas municipal wastewater treatment plant. Triclosan concentrations were reduced by 97 to 99% by the activated sludge treatment plant. Effluent concentrations were further reduced by passage through the constructed wetland, but receiving stream concentrations were not statistically significantly different from effluent concentrations. Effluent concentrations of triclosan were seasonal with highest concentrations occurring during the summer months. The effluent-dominated receiving stream maximum concentrations during summer months were below reported algal no-observed-effect concentrations based on biomass and growth rate but exceeded concentrations reported to cause shifts in algal community structure.
