AB Cell-based metabolomics was used in a proof-of-concept fashion to investigate the biological effects of contaminants as they traveled from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge to a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intake in a surface-water usage cycle. Zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells were exposed to water samples collected along a surface-water flowpath, where a WWTP was located similar to 14.5 km upstream of a DWTP. The sampling sites included: 1) upstream of the WWTP, 2) the WWTP effluent discharging point, 3) a proximal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 4) a distal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 5) the drinking water intake, and 6) the treated drinking water collected prior to discharge to the distribution system. After a 48-h laboratory exposure, the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites in ZFL cell extracts were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct changes in metabolite profiles in response to WWTP effluent exposure. These effects on the hydrophilic metabolome gradually diminished downstream of the WWTP, becoming nonsignificant at the drinking water intake (comparable to upstream of the WWTP, p = 0.98). However, effects on the lipophilic metabolome increased significantly as the river flowed from the distal location downstream of the WWTP to the drinking water intake (p < 0.001), suggesting a source of bioactive compounds in this watershed other than the WWTP. ZFL cells exposed to treated drinking water did not exhibit significant changes in either the hydrophilic (p = 0.15) or lipophilic metabolome (p = 0.83) compared to the upstream site, suggesting that constituents in the WWTP effluent were efficiently removed by the drinking water treatment process. Impacts on ZFL cells from the WWTP effluent included disrupted energy metabolism, a global decrease in amino acids, and altered lipid metabolism pathways. Overall, this study demonstrated the utility of cell-based metabolomics as an effective tool for assessing the biological effects of complex pollutant mixtures, particularly when used as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring.

AB The performances of an equilibrium and a kinetic passive sampler for monitoring a range of organic contaminants (Log K-OW from -0.03 to 6.26) were evaluated in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant, the receiving river Saar as well as the river Mosel in Germany. The polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and a new mixed polymer sampler (MPS) were selected as kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers, respectively. Concentrations were described in terms of a time-weighted average concentration (C-TWA) from the POCIS measurements and as an equilibrium concentration from the MPS (CEquil-MPS) and POCIS membrane (CEquil-PES) analyses. Twenty-seven compounds could be detected, includig eight priority substances of the EU Water Framework Directive. Both sampler types detected a similar range of compounds in the low ng/L to mu g/L range, with a high proportion of pharmaceuticals being detected at all sampling sites. To account for uncertainty in the POCIS sampling rates, a range in C-TWA was estimated by applying low and high sampling rates. For the compounds that were detected in the POCIS this range was within a factor of 3.5. Interestingly, the MPS extracts showed lower ionisation artefacts than the POCIS extracts during the LC-MS/MS analysis. Finally, total water concentrations (G(Total)) were estimated from the dissolved concentrations, literature organic carbon partition coefficients (K-OC) and the total organic carbon levels measured in the rivers. For the compounds in this study, negligible differences between C-Total and the passive sampler-derived dissolved concentrations were found with a maximum difference of 15% for diclofenac. Overall, this study demonstrated that the parallel application of kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers can improve the description of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) typically occur in urban rivers. Wastewater effluents are a major source of many CECs. Urban runoff (stormwater) is a major urban water budget component and may constitute another major CEC pathway. Yet, stormwater-based CEC field studies are rare. This research investigated 384 CECs in 36 stormwater samples in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. Nine sampling sites included three large stormwater conveyances (pipes) and three paired iron enhanced sand filters (IESFs; untreated inlets and treated outlets). The 123 detected compounds included commercial-consumer compounds, veterinary and human pharmaceuticals, lifestyle and personal care compounds, pesticides, and others. Thirty-one CECs were detected in >= 50% of samples. Individual samples contained a median of 35 targeted CECs (range: 18-54). Overall, median concentrations were >= 10 ng/L for 25 CECs and >= 100 ng/L for 9 CECs. Ranked, hierarchical linear modeling indicated significant seasonal- and site type-based concentration variability for 53 and 30 CECs, respectively, with observed patterns corresponding to CEC type, source, usage, and seasonal hydrology. A primarily warm weather, diffuse, runoff-based profile included many herbicides. A second profile encompassed winter and/or late summer samples enriched with some recalcitrant, hydrophobic compounds (e.g., PAHs), especially at pipes, suggesting conservative, less runoff-dependent sources (e.g., sediments). A third profile, indicative of mixed conservative/non-runoff, runoff, and/or atmospheric sources and transport that collectively affect a variety of conditions, included various fungicides, lifestyle, non-prescription, and commercial-consumer CECs. Generally, pipe sites had large, diverse land-use catchments, and showed more frequent detections of diverse CECs, but often at lower concentrations; while untreated sites (with smaller, more residential-catchments) demonstrated greater detections of "pseudo-persistent" and other ubiquitous or residentially-associated CECs. Although untreated stormwater transports an array of CECs to receiving waters, IESF treatment significantly removed concentrations of 14 (29%) of the 48 most detected CECs; for these, median removal efficiencies were 26%-100%. Efficient removal of some hydrophobic (e.g., PAHs, bisphenol A) and polar-hydrophilic (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) compounds indicated particulate-bound contaminant filtration and for certain dissolved contaminants, sorption.

AB Ozone is an effective oxidant and disinfectant commonly used for elimination of micropollutants and inactivation of resistant microbes. However, undesirable oxidation/disinfection byproducts such as bromate might form during ozonation. In this study, the UV absorbance and fluorescence indices were applied as surrogate indicators for predicting the inactivation of bacteria and formation of bromate during ozonation of water and wastewater effluents. The inactivation efficiencies of lab-cultured Escherichia coli (E. coli) and autochthonous bacteria were measured by plating (for E. coli only) and flow cytometry with fluorescence staining. During ozonation of E. coli spiked into wastewater effluents (similar to 10(6) cell/mL), the priority of inactivation efficiency determined by different cell viability methods were in the order of CFU > membrane damage > DNA damage. Approximately, 99% membrane damage and/or 90% DNA damage are conservatively supposed as an indicator for sufficient bacterial inactivation as well as degradation of antibiotic resistance genes. The related required O-3 dosing thresholds for sufficient inactivation of E. coli and autochthonous bacteria refer to similar to 0.6 O-3/DOC (g/g), similar to 50% decrease of UVA254, similar to 60% decrease of UVA280, or similar to 80% decrease of humic-like fluorescence. Within the range of 10(6)-10(8) cell/mL the bacterial concentration did not have significant effects on the required thresholds of the specific O-3 doses or spectroscopic indicators required for bacterial inactivation. The addition of 50 mM tert-BuOH as center dot OH scavenger increased the required specific ozone doses but decreased the losses of spectroscopic indicators necessary for sufficient bacterial inactivation, and also suggested that the membrane/DNA damages for bacterial inactivation were mainly attributed to the direct O-3 attacks. The bromate concentration was determined using ion chromatography with MS/MS detection. The results showed that when O-3 was dosed at the required thresholds for sufficient bacterial inactivation, bromate formation could usually be suppressed below 10 mu g/L. The present work supports that it is possible to reach a balance between bacterial inactivation and bromate formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we comparatively investigated the degradation of 12 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) processes. Second-order rate constants for the reactions of iopromide, phenytoin, caffeine, benzotriazole, and primidone with sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) were determined for the first time. Experiments were conducted in buffered pure water and wastewater effluent with spiked TOrCs. UV/PDS degraded all TOrCs more efficiently than UV/H2O2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of SO4 center dot- than that of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) at the same initial molar dose of PDS and H2O2, respectively. UV/PDS showed higher selectivity toward TOrCs removal than UV/H2O2 in wastewater effluent. Compounds with electron-rich moieties, such as diclofenac, venlafaxine, and metoprolol, were eliminated faster in UV/PDS whereas UV/H2O2 was more efficient in degrading compounds with lower reactivity to SO4 center dot-. The fluence-based rate constants (k(obs-UV/H2O2)) of TOrCs in wastewater effluent linearly increased as a function of initial H2O2 dose during UV/H2O2, possibly due to the constant scavenging impact of the wastewater matrix on (OH)-O-center dot. However, exponential increase of k(obs-UV/PDS) with increasing PDS dose was observed for most compounds during UV/PDS, suggesting the decreasing scavenging effect of the water matrix (electron-rich site of effluent organic matter (EfOM)) after initial depletion of SO4 center dot- at low PDS dose. Fulvic and humic-like fluorophores appeared to be more persistent during UV/H2O2 compared to aromatic protein and soluble microbial product-like fluorophores. In contrast, UV/PDS efficiently degraded all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward the fluorescent EfOM components. Removal pattern of TOrCs during pilot-scale UV/PDS was consistent with lab-scale experiments, however, overall removal rates were lower due to the presence of higher concentration of EfOM and nitrite.

AB Antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper provides comprehensive data on the occurrences of 19 antibiotics, bacteria resistant to 10 antibiotics, and 15 ARGs in raw influent and different treatment stages of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems. Seventeen out of the 19 target antibiotics were detected in raw influent with concentrations of up to ten micrograms per liter. Concentrations of antibiotics measured in the secondary effluent were much lower compared to those in the raw influent. Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, meropenem, minocycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine and vancomycin had highest removal by CAS or MBR systems with median removal efficiency (RE) > 70%, while trimethoprim and lincomycin were recalcitrant in the CAS system with median RE <50%. Similarly, the target ARB and ARGs were omnipresent in the raw influent samples with average concentrations as high as 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/mL and 2.0 x 10(7) gene copies/mL, respectively. The concentrations of ARB in secondary effluent of the CAS system declined relative to the raw influent (i.e. lower than raw influent by 2-3 orders of magnitude) and no ARB were detected in the MF permeate of the MBR system. For ARGs, their concentrations in secondary effluent/MF permeate ranged from below method quantification limit (<MQL) to 10(4) gene copies/mL. It is noteworthy that several ARGs, i.e. bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(SHV), ermB, intl1, sul1 and tetO, were still found in the MF permeate of the MBR system at average concentrations up to 10(3) copies/mL. In conclusion, MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of ARB, ARGs and most target antibiotics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated, using rapid small-scale column testing, the breakthrough of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and eleven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) during granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration of different water qualities, including wastewater, surface water and synthetic water (riverine organic matter dissolved in deionized water). Fluorescing organic matter was better adsorbed than UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in all tested water. Furthermore, highest adsorption of DOM (in terms of DOC, UV254 and fluorescence) was observed during wastewater filtration. UV absorbing DOM had fast and similar breakthrough in surface water and synthetic water, whereas fluorescence breakthrough was very rapid only in synthetic water. PARAFAC modeling showed that different fluorescing components were differently adsorbed during GAC process. Particularly, fluorescing components with maxima intensity at higher excitation wavelengths, which are corresponding to humic-like fluorescence substances, were better removed than other components in all waters. As opposed to DOM, EOCs were better adsorbed during synthetic water filtration, whereas the fastest EOCs breakthrough was observed during filtration of wastewater, which was the water that determined the highest carbon fouling. Exception was represented by long-chained perfluoroalkylated substances (i.e., PFOA, PFDA and PFOS). Indeed, adsorption of these compounds resulted independent of water quality. In this study was also investigated the applicability of UV254 and fluorescing PARAFAC components to act as surrogates in predicting EOCs removal by GAC in different water matrices. Empirical linear correlation for the investigated EOCs were determined with UV254 and fluorescing components in all water qualities. However, fluorescence measurements resulted more sensitive than UV254 to predict EOC breakthrough during GAC adsorption. When the data from all water qualities was combined, good correlations between the microbial humic-like PARAFAC component and EOC removals were still observed and they resulted independent of water quality if considering only real water matrices (wastewater and surface water). On the contrary, correlations between EOC removals and UV254 removals were independent of water quality when combining data of surface waters and synthetic water, but a different correlation model was needed to predict EOCs breakthrough in wastewater.

AB Emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals have been focusing international attention for a few decades. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a common drug that is widely found in hospital and wastewater treatment plants effluents, as well as in rivers. In this work, the feasibility of CIP degradation by ultrasound process at high frequency is discussed and sonolysis, sonolysis with hydrogen peroxide and sono-Fenton are evaluated. The amounts of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions (Fe2+) needed were optimized using response surface methodology. Best results were obtained with the sono-Fenton process resulting in a total pharmaceutical degradation within 15 min and a mineralization greater than 60% after 1 h. Optimal conditions were tested on a real matrix from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Even if the degradation of the pollutants by sono-Fenton was hampered, the removal efficiency of both CIP and total organic carbon (TOC) is interesting as an increase in the biodegradability of the wastewater is found. These results show that sono-Fenton oxidation can be a promising pretreatment process for pharmaceutical-containing wastewaters.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharge micropollutants like pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products or endocrine disrupting chemicals but also nutrients. Both can adversely influence the freshwater ecosystem and may finally affect the ecological conditions. Many studies focus on the potential impact of large WWTPs even if smaller ones are more common, often less efficient and discharge into small creeks or the upper reaches of rivers. As a result, the receiving waters are characterized by relatively high shares of treated wastewater. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the ecotoxicological effects of a small WWTP on freshwater amphipods and mollusks in a small creek using an active and passive monitoring approach, accompanied by laboratory experiments (LE). In vitro assays with recombinant yeasts and the microtox assay with Aliivibrio fischeri were performed in parallel to determine the endocrine potential and the baseline toxicity. The evaluation of the effects of the analysed WWTP was possible due to its shutdown during our study and the application of the same in vivo and in vitro assays before and after the shutdown. During the operation of the WWTP the discharge of treated wastewater caused significantly higher mortalities and lower reproduction of the anaylsed invertebrates in the active and passive montoring as well as in the LEs. Furthermore, the amphipod species assemblage in the creek was affected downstream of the WWTP effluent. Besides, the endocrine activity and baseline toxicity were significantly higher downstream of the effluent. After the shutdown of the WWTP, the in vitro activity levels and adverse in vivo effects in the receiving water recovered quickly with no significant differences downstream of the former WWTP effluent compared to the upstream station. Furthermore, the previously disturbed amphipod species assemblage recovered significantly with a shift in favor of Gammarus fossarum downstream of the effluent. These biological results are consistent with a marked decline by 81.5% for the detected micropollutants in the receiving creek after the shutdown which points to a prominent role of micropollutants for the observed effects.

AB Treatment efficiency and electricity generation were evaluated using a solid plain-graphite plate microbial fuel cell (MFC) anoxic/oxic (A/O) process that treated pharmaceutical sewage using different hydraulic retention times (HRT). Short HRTs increased the volumetric organic loading rate, thereby reducing the MFC performance due to rapid depletion of the substrate (carbon/nitrogen source). The COD removal efficiency decreased from 96.28% at a HRT of 8 h to 90.67% at a HRT of 5 h. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen was reduced from 74.16% at a HRT of 8 h to 53.42% at a HRT of 5 h. A shorter HRT decreased the efficiency in treatment of the pharmaceutical products (PPs), which included acetaminophen, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole in an aerobic reactor because these antibiotic compounds inhibited the microbial activity of the aerobic activated sludge in the MFC A/O system. The average power density and coulombic efficiency values were 162.74 mW m(-2) and 7.09% at a HRT of 8 h and 29.12 mW m(-2) and 2.23% at a HRT of 5 h, respectively. The dominant bacterial species including Hydrogenophaga spp., Rubrivivax spp. and Leptothrix spp., which seem to be involved in PP biodegradation; these were identified in the MFC A/O system under all HRT conditions for the first time using next generation sequencing. Bacterial nanowires were involved in accelerating the transfer of electrons and served as mediators in the SPGRP biofilm. In conclusion, a SPGRP MFC A/O system at a HRT of 8 h gave better removal of COD, T-N and PPs, as well as generated more electricity.

AB Large subsurface treatment systems (LSTS) and rapid infiltration basins (RIB) are preferred onsite wastewater treatments compared to direct discharge of treated wastewater to streams and adjacent facilities. Discharge of these wastewater treatments may result in contaminant loading to aquifers that also serve as drinking water sources downgradient from the discharge site. Until recently, few studies have characterized the contribution of micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals, fragrances, flame retardants, etc.) to receiving aquifers. We conducted a pilot project to characterize the occurrence of micropollutants in groundwater downgradient from 7 on-site treatment systems in Minnesota, USA: 5 community LSTS and 2 municipal RIB. One downgradient monitoring well was sampled three times at each facility over one year. Of 223 micropollutants analyzed, 35 were detected. Total sample concentrations ranged from 90 to 4,039 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) was detected in all samples at concentrations from 7 to 965 ng/L. Other pharmaceuticals (0.12-1,000 ng/L), organophosphorus flame retardants (10-500 ng/L), and other anthropogenic chemicals (4-775 ng/L) were also detected. The numbers and concentrations of micropollutants detected were inversely related to dissolved oxygen and depth to water. Ratios of pharmaceutical concentrations to human-health screening values were <0.10 for most samples. However, concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole exceeded screening values at two sites. Study results illustrate that large on-site wastewater systems designed to discharge to permeable soil or shallow groundwater effectively deliver pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants to groundwater aquifers and could contribute micropollutants to drinking water via water supply wells.

AB The organic-diffusive gradients in thin-films (o-DGT) technique has emerged as a promising aquatic passive sampler that addresses many of the challenges associated with current sampling tools used for measurement of polar organic contaminants. This study represents the first comprehensive field evaluation of the o-DGT in natural surface waters, across a wide suite of polar pharmaceuticals and pesticides. We explore the utility and limitations of o-DGT as a quantitative measurement tool compared to grab sampling and the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) across four connected agricultural and wastewater-influenced freshwater systems spanning 600 km from the U.S. border to northern Manitoba, Canada. Overall, the suite of analytes detected with o-DGT and POCIS was similar. Concentrations in water estimated using o-DGT were greater than concentrations estimated from POCIS in 71 of 80 paired observations, and on average, the estimates from o-DGT were 2.3-fold greater than estimates from POCIS. Grab sample concentrations suggested that the systematic underestimation with POCIS were largely a result of sampling rate variation related to flow rate and boundary-layer effects, an issue reported consistently in the POCIS literature. These comprehensive measurements in an agriculturally influenced fast-flowing river, long-term sampling (>40 days) in a large dilute lake system, deployments in wastewaters, and under ice at near-freezing temperatures represent effective stress testing of o-DGT under representative and challenging conditions. Overall, its strong performance and improved accuracy over POCIS supports its use as a robust, quantitative, and sensitive measurement tool for polar organic chemicals in aquatic systems.

TI Degradation and Mineralization of Carbamazepine Using an Electro-Fenton

AB Pharmaceutical wastes are considered to be important pollutants even at low concentrations. In this regard, carbamazepine has received significant attention due to its negative effect on both ecosystem and human health. However, the need for acidic conditions severely hinders the use of conventional Fenton reagent reactions for the control and elimination of carbamazepine in wastewater effluents and drinking water influents. Herein, we report of the synthesis and use of flexible bifunctional nanoelectrocatalytic textile materials, Fe3O4-NP@CNF, for the effective degradation and complete mineralization of carbamazepine in water. The nonwoven porous structure of the composite binder-free Fe3O4-NP@CNF textile is used to generate H2O2 on the carbon nanofiber (CNF) substrate by O-2 reduction. In addition, center dot OH radical is generated on the surface of the bonded Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) at low applied potentials (-0.345 V). The Fe3O4-NPs are covalently bonded to the CNF textile support with a high degree of dispersion throughout the fiber matrix. The dispersion of the nanosized catalysts results in a higher catalytic reactivity than existing electro-Fenton systems. For example, the newly synthesized Fe3O4-NPs system uses an Fe loading that is 2 orders of magnitude less than existing electro-Fenton systems, coupled with a current efficiency that is higher than electrolysis using a boron-doped diamond electrode. Our test results show that this process can remove carbamazepine with high pseudo-first-order rate constants (e.g., 6.85 h(-1) ) and minimal energy consumption (0.239 kW.h/g carbamazepine). This combination leads to an efficient and sustainable electro-Fenton process.

AB Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is a synthetic water-insoluble polymer widely used as fining agent in the wine industry for removing low-molecular-weight phenolics. Used PVPP, estimated in 2014 of 1037 tons, ends up in the municipal wastewater treatment plants with a detrimental environmental impact. Recycling of PVPP for obtaining fully reusable PVPP and wine phenolic concentrates for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries would increase the sustainability of its use. An ammoniacal solution of ethanol allows one to desorb with high recoveries (average 73%) the PVPP adsorbed phenolics with yields ranging from 2.82 to 10.80 g/kg of wet PVPP, depending on the wine. Extracts were nearly pure concerning the phenolics abundance (>89%), without need of further purification. The performance of the recycled PVPP for white wine fining was not significantly different from that of the new PVPP, which can be recycled at least four times without loss of fining performance and allow a good recovery of adsorbed phenolics to be maintained. Results obtained in this work show that by using a simple, cheap, and eco-friendly recycling strategy, it is possible to reuse PVPP for wine fining, providing a cleaner winemaking process and additionally obtain wine phenolic concentrates with high purity, antioxidant, and bioactivity, valuable for other industries.

AB Many pharmaceuticals inevitably end up in surface waters, exerting unwanted biological activity in nontarget organisms. This effect is confined by the compound's environmental persistence. Regulatory laboratory simulation tests are used in persistence assessment and exposure modeling. While doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of laboratory-derived persistence indicators under field conditions, these remain the only inputs for chemical fate models due to difficulties of measuring persistence in situ, especially at large scales. To improve understanding about relationships between laboratory experiments and the environmental fate in streams, we developed a mathematical model of biodegradation in stream networks and combined it with in-stream monitoring data to (i) test if persistence could be evaluated from field data, (ii) check if persistence extracted from laboratory tests applied in the field, and (iii) locate hot spots of biodegradation in a large river basin. The model describes partitioning, and particle settling and resuspension, and is structurally compatible with those applied for evaluating laboratory simulation tests. Application to the Rhine river basin suggests that biotransformation rate constants extracted from laboratory tests underestimate those in the field, yet the percentage of biotransformation in the Rhine basin is less than in the laboratory tests due effective biotransformation being limited to small- and medium-sized streams. In conclusion, our data show that biotransformation rates can accurately be predicted if (i) monitoring is performed across a wide range in stream order and (ii) precise estimates for consumption and removal rates at wastewater treatment plants are known.

AB A Na-smectite clay mineral (Na-Mt) was exchanged with two concentrations of benzyldimethyltetradecyl ammonium chloride cationic surfactant up to one time the cation exchange capacity. Nonionic organoclay was prepared with polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether (Brij-O20) nonionic surfactant at one concentration. The resulting organoclays displayed lateral layer organization of the surfactants within their interlayer space.. The adsorption properties of these organoclays and the starting raw clay mineral were evaluated for three extensively used antibiotic pharmaceutical products: the amoxicillin (AMX), the sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and the trimethoprim (TRI), recognized as recalcitrant compounds to conventional water treatments and to display a complex behavior for different pH and temperature experimental conditions. Besides showing short half-life time with possible degradation by UV radiation, these antibiotics associated with mineral phases cause serious environmental issues of which the toxic effect can be exacerbated in the presence of other chemical compounds. From the set of data obtained by complementary techniques: UV and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction, it appears that the nonionic organoclay shows its versatility for the adsorption of individual molecules as well as a pool of antibiotics. The mixing of the three antibiotics showing different electric charged species (cations, anions, and zwitterions) mimics the natural context drives to a deep modification of the adsorption behavior onto the different materials that can act as possible carrier mineral phases in aquatic environment. These competition effects can be measured through the significant decrease of the K-F Freundlich constants for AMX in the presence of other molecules (or electrolytes), whereas TRI and SMX, by their possible association, create a synergistic effect that favors their adsorption on the whole layered materials.

AB To investigate the adverse effect of two widely used pharmaceuticals, paracetamol (acetaminophen [APAP]) and oxytetracycline (OTC) on the marine rotifer Brachionus rotundiformis (B. rotundiformis), the animals were exposed to various environmentally-relevant concentrations. Up to date, acetaminophen and oxytetracycline have been considered as toxic, if used above threshold concentration, i.e. overdosed. However, this study demonstrated these two pharmaceuticals even at low concentration (i.e., mu g/L scale) elicited oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with the increased glutathione S-transferase activity, despite no-observed effect in in-vivo population growth. To validate the adverse effects of the two pharmaceuticals at relatively low concentrations, mRNA expression analysis was performed of the entire set of genes encoding 26 cytochrome P450s (CYPs) of phase I and 19 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) of phase II of the rotifer B. rotundiformis. The mRNA expression analysis suggested specific genes CYP3045A2 and GST sigma 1, GST sigma 4, and GST omega 1 take part in detoxification of APAP and OTC, resulting in no significant changes in the population growth and undetermined no observed effect concentration (NOEC) in the marine rotifer B. rotundiformis.

AB Ornidazole is a well-known antibiotic which has been widely used for both human and veterinary treatments. The present study investigated the degradation of ornidazole using TiO2 as a photocatalyst with UV light irradiation. Artificial neural network (ANN) was applied for the modeling of the photocatalytic degradation of ornidazole. In slurry mode, the input parameters were pH, ornidazole concentration, TiO2 dose, treatment time and % degradation as output. Parametric optimization was performed by Box-Behnken design (BBD). At optimum conditions the % degradation was found to be 84.02, 82.63 and 77.7% as predicted by BBD, simulated by ANN and by experimental run respectively. The results showed that the predictions agreed with the experimental results. The degradation of ornidazole follows the second-order reaction kinetics. For fixed-bed studies, TiO2 immobilized spherical cement beads were used to carry out the degradation of ornidazole at laboratory scale as well as at pilot scale with volume handling of 5 L. The catalyst immobilized beads were successfully recycled for at-least 40 runs without any significant reduction in the degradation efficiency of ornidazole. The activity as well as stability of immobilized catalyst over the surface of beads was confirmed through SEM/EDS, XRD and DRS analysis. Bioassay test was conducted for the safe disposal of treated wastewater and was found to be non-toxic.

AB The removal of 26 organic micropollutants (OMPs) in synthetic municipal wastewater was investigated via the process of aerobic sequential batch reactor (SBR) alone and SBR followed by nanofiltration (NF). SBR-NF performed better than SBR alone, ascribed to the contribution of NF: 1) complete biomass rejection resulted in diverse microbial community and much less fluctuated performance than SBR alone, and 2) direct OMPs rejection (74-98%) increased their retention time in SBR and thus overall removal via biodegradation/transformation and accumulation in SBR. Nine OMPs showed high biological removal (over 60%), 6 OMPs showed moderate biological removal (30-70%) and 10 OMPs showed low biological removal (below 40%). Most readily and moderately biodegradable OMPs contained strong electron donating group. Most refractory OMPs contained strong electron withdrawing group and/or halogen substitute. The batch addition of powdered activated carbon (100 mg/L) into SBR showed short term sorption performance for both OMPs and bulk organics.

AB Antibiotics and nanoparticles, emerging contaminants, present great environmental risks and human health concerns. Sludge adsorption, a biological wastewater treatment removal mechanism, targets ciprofloxacin (Cip) antibiotics, C-60, and ZnO, leaving complex pollution in sludge anaerobic digestion. This study investigated the mechanisms through which individual and combined ZnO, Cip, and C-60 affect sludge anaerobic digestion by studying their effects on CH4 production, metabolism, and microbial community. ZnO was generally more toxic to CH4 production than Cip. The ZnO + Cip complex was more influential (> 29%) than ZnO or ZnO + C-60, with short-lasting acute and additive toxicity effects on methanogenesis and degradation of protein and carbohydrate. ZnO + C-60 and ZnO + Cip exerted apparent additional complex effects on Firmicutes, Aminicenantes, Chloroflexi, and Parcubacteria. These results would potentially aid toxicity control related to complex pollution, and improve energy production and reduce pollution risks when used in land applications.

AB Hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of pharmaceuticals, which pose risks to receiving waters. In this study, a pilot plant consisting of six moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) in series (with the intention to integrate Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal, nitrification and denitrification as well as prepolishing Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) for ozonation) was built to integrate pharmaceutical removal and intermittent feeding of the latter reactors aimed for micropollutant removal. Based on the experimental resultss, nitrifying MBBRs achieved higher removal as compared to denitrifying MBBRs except for azithromycin, clarithromycin, diatrizoic acid, propranolol and trimethoprim. In the batch experiments, nitrifying MBBRs showed the ability to remove most of the analysed pharmaceuticals, with degradation rate constants ranging from 5.0 x 10(-3) h(-1) to 2.6 h(-1). In general, the highest degradation rate constants were observed in the nitrifying MBBRs while the latter MBBRs showed lower degradation rate constant. However, when the degradation rate constants were normalised to the respective biomass, the intermittently fed reactors presented the highest specific activity. Out of the 22 compounds studied, 17 compounds were removed with more than 20%.

AB A method based on matrix-solid phase dispersion (MSPD), focused on the principles of green analytical chemistry, aimed at the use of alternative solid supports and less toxic solvents, was developed for the simultaneous determination of 19 pharmaceuticals, 4 personal care products (PPCPs) and 4 degradation products in sewage sludge samples. Higher recoveries were achieved when 2 g sample was macerated for 5 min in a glass mortar, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and 1 min vortex agitation with 5 mL methanol. The performance of the method was evaluated through linearity, recovery, precision (intra-day), method detection and quantification limits (MDL and MQL) and matrix effect. The calibration curves prepared in methanol and in the matrix extract showed a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. MQL values ranged from 1.25 to 1250 ng g(-1). Recoveries between 50 and 120% were reached with RSDs lower than 20% for most compounds. The method presented low and medium matrix effects for most analytes. This method was successfully applied to real samples and of the 27 compounds determined, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, diclofenac, haloperidol, ketoconazole, miconazole, albendazole, mebendazole, thiabendazole, triclosan and triclocarban were detected in concentrations between 2.5 and 5400 ng g(-1).

AB A passive sampling device, a polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), was used to monitor 13 pharmaceuticals and 8 transformation products in upstream and downstream wastewater treatment plant effluent. A POCIS laboratory calibration study was performed to determine uptake behavior and the effect of water flow on the sampling rate. Most compounds showed a linear accumulation, and the sampling rate values ranged from 0.031 to 0.559 L/day. The developed POCIS samplers were used in field experiments in a wastewater-impacted river. Using the calculated sampling rates, the time-weighted average concentration values were measured by three different approaches: (1) laboratory calibration sampling rates (2) performance reference compound (PRC) correction sampling rates and (3) field calibration sampling rates. Nine deuterated compounds (acetaminophen-d(3), antipyrine-d(3), sulfamethoxazole-d(4), carbamazepine-dio, diclofenac acid-d(4), clofibric acid-d(4), bezafibrate-d(6), ibuprofen-d(3) and naproxen-d(3)) were studied as PRCs. Antipyrine-d(3) was successfully tested as a PRC for sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen, diclofenac acid, 4-hydroxydiclofenac acid, carbamazepin, carbamazepin 10,11-epoxide, sulfadiazine, 1-naphthol, antipyrine, naproxen and 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Finally, the POCIS was used to monitor target compounds in river water and measure their attenuation. For most compounds, the POCIS attenuation results were not significantly different from those of the spot samples, which demonstrated that a POCIS with a PRC correction can determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes such as electrooxidation (EO), electrooxidation witt hydrogen peroxide generation (EO-H2O2) and electro-Fenton process (EF) have been investigated as alternative treatment techniques for complete removal of anionic surfactants and organic matters from real carwash wastewater. The electrochemical processes were performed with acidified real carwash wastewater using boron doped anode and carbon felt cathode. In all cases, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was always increased with rise in applied current and complete organic matter decay was achieved at applied current of 500 mA or above after 6 h of electrolysis. Faster and higher COD decay was observed with EF compared to either EO or EO-H2O2 treatment, at all currents and electrolysis time. Besides, complete degradation of anionic surfactants the major organic content of the wastewater could be achieved at all applied currents studied irrespective of the process used, indicating the efficacy of processes for total remediation of real carwash wastewater. The short-chain carboxylic acids formed as the final organic byproducts were identified and quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography More so, lower energy consumption and higher current efficiency were achieved with EF compared to EO-H2O2. Electrochemical treatment was found to be a powerful technology for the complete abatement of organic matter in carwash wastewater for possible reuse. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although granular activated carbon (GAC) has been broadly applied in ozone-biologically activated carbon filtration (O-3/BAC) systems for potable reuse of municipal wastewater, the mechanisms of various pollutant removal remain largely unknown as the regenerated GAC develops microbial populations resulting in biofiltration but loses significant adsorption capacity as it becomes spent GAC. Therefore, pilot-scale parallel performance comparisons of spent and regenerated GAC, along with a range of preoxidant ozone doses, were used to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the removal of various types of treatment byproduct precursors and trace organic compounds. It was confirmed from this pilot-study that ozone alone can effectively degrade chlorinated trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors, chloramine-reactive N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors, and 29 PPCP5. In contrast, biodegradation by microbial population on spent or regenerated GAC can remove NDMA and 22 PPCPs, while the adsorption by regenerated GAC can remove chlorinated THM and HAA precursors, PFAS, flame retardants, and 27 PPCP5. The results of this pilot study are intended to provide those interested in potable reuse with an example of the simultaneous removal capabilities and mechanisms that can be anticipated for treating a complex mixture of organics present in real municipal wastewater effluent.

AB We investigated the effects of activated carbon, used as constructed wetlands (CWs) medium, on its ability to remove four emerging endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs): bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and 4-tert-butylphenol (4-tert-BP). Two types of CWs planted with common reed were constructed, one with pumice rock called normal CW and the other was amended with activated carbon (AC) called AC-CW. EDCs contaminated synthetic wastewater (5 mg/L of each) was treated by CWs for 8 weeks. AC-CW completely and sustainably removed all four EDCs (98-100%) starting immediately and continuing throughout the experiment. Removal performances of all EDCs by AC-CW were significantly higher than those by normal CW. After experiment, no BPA and BPF and very small amounts of BPS and 4-tert-BP were detected in AC. In AC-CW, final elimination step of EDCs might be biodegradation. In addition, bacterial populations on AC component of AC-CW were one-two orders higher than those on the pumice rock of normal CW. Therefore, in AC-CW, EDCs were initially adsorbed onto AC, where they could be effectively degraded by high bacterial population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An environment-friendly iodine and potassium co-doped g-C3N4 (IK-C3N4) photocatalyst was synthesized via the co-pyrolysis of urea and potassium iodate. Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the physical, thermal and chemical characteristics of the as-synthesized photo catalyst. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was used as a representative antibiotic pollutant. SMX removal by IK-C3N4 photocatalysts exceeded 99% (similar to 23 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4) within 45 min of visible light irradiation. The kinetics of SMX removal was analyzed with respect to solution pH, photocatalyst dosage and initial SMX concentration. Experimental data was found to fit the pseudo-first order kinetics and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. The reuse of the photocatalyst up to 3 consecutive photo degradation cycles gave a minimal decline in SMX removal while the structure and the crystallinity of the nanomaterials remained unchanged. Overall, morphology engineering of conventional bulk graphitic carbon nitride can produce highly efficient photocatalysts for the decontamination of antibiotics in the aqueous environment.

AB Nowadays, ensuring the protection and health of the environment is an effective step toward sustainable development. One of the primary environmental concerns around the world is the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from water and wastewater. Solving such problem and many other environmental issues, along with treading the path toward sustainable development, can be achieved with the use of nanotechnology. This study investigated the use of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in removing the beta-blocker atenolol from aqueous solutions. To achieve this goal, the efficiency of atenolol removal was evaluated in a four-level Taguchi experiment that involved the evaluation of pH value (2-11), contact time (5-90 min), adsorbent dose (0.5-2 g/L), and initial atenolol concentration (10-90 mg/L). Data analysis and interpretation were performed using Design Expert 6. The results indicated that the highest atenolol removal (94.8%) occurred at a pH of 7, a contact time of 20 min, an atenolol concentration of 10 mg/L, and a MWCNT dose of 0.5 g/L. The adsorption capacity of the MWCNTs used in this work was 16.76 mg/g. The data analysis based on the adsorption isotherm models of the Isotherm Fitting Tool showed good agreement with the results of a linear model. The findings confirmed that MWCNTs present great potential as effective adsorbents for the removal of atenolol from water and wastewater.

AB The present study was aimed to characterize the adsorptive properties of pharmaceutical-based activated charcoals (Biocarbon and Dyna) for the adsorption of reactive orange 16 (RO16) and rhodamine B (Rh B). A commercial activated (CAC) was employed for comparison. The materials were characterized for textural properties and functional groups. Batch adsorption was evaluated at different concentrations of dyes and contact times. The adsorption data were analyzed using isotherm and kinetics models. Result shows that the specific surface area is in the order of CAC > Biocarbon > Dyna. The surface area of CAC is 909 m(2)/g, renders a higher removal of RO16 of 69.4 mg/g, while Biocarbon displays a higher removal of Rh B of 54.5 mg/g, despite a lower surface area of 172 m(2)/g. The adsorption data fitted well with Langmuir model and pseudo-kinetics models. The adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceutical-based activated charcoals are unique and may not necessarily dependent on surface area alone. The charcoals demonstrate a promising attribute as dyes adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds are known as emerging contaminants and their amounts are increasing in the environment. This study is focused on removing codeine phosphate (CPh) from water. In this respect, removing CPh by sand and two different types of modified sand were analyzed. The first silica sand modification was carried out by (3-Amino propyl) trimethoxysilane, and silica particles were coated by amine groups (S-A). With the second modification, the carboxylic acid group was bound with silica particles (3-Amino propyl) trimethoxysilane. Characterization was conducted by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-Ray Diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Effects of pH, contact time, and temperature of two modified silica sand were investigated. The results showed that silica sand does not have any effect on removing CPh; however, the removal percentages of S-A and S-C were 55% and 69%, respectively. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic were studied for both adsorbents. The results of the experiments show that the adsorbents follow Langmuir and pseudo-second-order rate. Maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of the S-A and S-C was 3.3 and 4.14 (mg/g) respectively. These adsorbents could be regenerated easily and used for more than 10 times. The speed of desorption was very fast. This study proposes that these adsorbents could be utilized for CPh removal from wastewater: the results show that removal percentages of CPh from wastewater for S-A and S-C adsorbents are 30% and 37%, respectively.

AB This article presents the current and important results of bioaerosol studies which allow for the comparison of microbial contamination of air in 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which differed in terms of capacity from 350 to 200,000m(3)/day. The abundance of mesophilic bacteria, M+ and M- Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Actinobacteria, coliform and psychrophilic bacteria, and microscopic fungi was determined. Additionally, the air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and direction were also analyzed at each research station. The obtained very numerous results of bioaerosol and climate parameter studies were subjected to statistical analysis. The results regarding the minimum, maximum, and median abundance of the studied bacteria and microscopic fungi at 11 WWTPs and in background studies at control stations were presented in tables. Additionally, basic descriptive statistics for all studied microorganisms at specific seasons were presented. It was established that at the areas of WWTPs, the microscopic fungi were present that the highest concentrations (ranging from 0 to 1,148,530CFUm(-3)), followed by psychrophilic bacteria (ranging from 40 to 225,000CFUm(-3)) and mesophilic bacteria (ranging from 0 to 195,000CFUm(-3)). The novel elaboration of bioaerosol study results based on cluster analysis and determination of a dendrogram allowed to compare the studied WWTPs. The similarity was decided based on the type of studied microorganisms and their dominance and abundance, while no similarities were observed in terms of capacity. In order to investigate the relation between the abundance of bacterial groups as well as microscopic fungi and microclimatic parameters (air temperature and humidity), a calculation of Spearman's range correlation coefficients was conducted.

AB This study reports the development of a multi-residue method for determining 48 compounds of emerging concern (CEC) including three diclofenac transformation products (TP) in Slovenian wastewater (WW) and surface water (SW). For solid-phase extraction (SPE), Oasis (TM) Prime cartridges were favoured over Oasis HLB (TM). The validated method was then applied to 43 SW and 52 WW samples collected at nine locations. Ten bisphenols in WW and 14 bisphenols in SW were traced in Europe for the first time. Among all of the 48 targeted CEC, 21 were >LOQ in the influents and 20 in the effluents. One diclofenac TP was also quantified in WWs (3.04-78.1 ng L-1) for the first time. As expected, based on mass loads in the wastewater treatment plant influents, caffeine is consumed in high amounts (105,000 mg day(-1) 1000 inhab.(-1)) in Slovenia, while active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are consumed in lower amounts compared to other European countries. Removal was lower in winter in the case of four bisphenols (17-78%), one preservative (36%) and four APIs (-14-91%), but remained constant for caffeine, one API, two UV-filters and three preservatives (all >85.5%). Overall, a constructed wetland showed the lowest (0-80%) and most inconsistent removal efficiencies (SD > 40% for some CECs) of CECs including caffeine, two UV-filters, two preservatives and two APIs compared to other treatment technologies. The method was also able to quantify Bisphenol Sin SW (<36.2 ng L-1). Environmental risk was assessed via risk quotients (RQs) based on WW and SW data. Two UV-filters (oxybenzone and dioxybenzone), estrone and triclosan, despite their low abundance posed a medium to high environmental risk with RQs between 0.282 (for HM-BP) and 15.5 (for E1).

AB Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a threat to human life. Recently, sewers have been identified as potential reservoirs. The intermittent injection of sewage into adjacent surface waters is inevitable, due to capacity limitations of the urban drainage system. Information regarding the effect to natural freshwater biofilms (NFB) due to the intermittent contaminations are scarce. Therefore, a fundamental screening is necessary. In April, we placed NFB-attachment constructions in a brook upstream and downstream from urban drainage overflow constructions. In meanwhile two sampling campaigns were conducted. The sewage and the brook water were collected to gather information about antibiotic background exposure of ciprofloxacin (CIP), clarithromycin (CIA) and doxycycline (DOX). Six months later we experimentally determined the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the NFB-communities after a 24 h lasting exposure with additionally dosed antibiotics. Concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 were selected. CIP, CIA and DOX were individually dosed, and also in mixtures. The mean antibiotic background concentration in sewage was in a range of 575.5-1289.1 ng L-1, which mainly exceeded the concentrations published in literature. The determined mean concentration in the brook was in a range of 4.6-539.0 ng L-1. The first significant inhibition of the OUR with individually dosed antibiotics started mainly at a concentration of 1.0 mg L-1. Antibiotics in a mixture with concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg L-1 were as effective as single dosed antibiotics with a concentration of 10.0 mg L-1. The increased antibiotic tolerance and resistance of NFB-communities downstream of the combined sewer overflow (CSO) structure was a consequence of a severe impact due to urban drainage overflows. Hence, NFB-communities downstream of CSO-constructions are hot spots of antibiotic tolerant and resistant subpopulations and access restrictions should be announced, if an infection risk is present.

AB Trends in the widespread use of personal care products (PCPs) containing triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) have led to continuous emissions of these chemicals into the environment. Consequently, both chemicals are ubiquitously present at high concentrations in the aquatic systems based on widely reported measured environmental concentration (MECs) data in different environmental systems (e.g. freshwater) worldwide, especially in developed countries. In developing countries, however, lack of MECs data is a major issue, and therefore, inhibits effective risk assessment of these chemicals. Herein, TCS and TCC releases from personal care products (PCPs) were quantified, using a modelling approach to determine predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in wastewater, freshwater, and soils, and likely risk(s) were estimated by calculating risk quotient (RQs). TCS and TCC in freshwater had RQs >1 based on estimated PECs with wide variations (approximate to 2-232) as performed across the three dilutions factors (1,3, and 10) considered in this study; an indicator of their likely adverse effect on freshwater organisms. In untreated and treated wastewater, TCS RQs values for bacteria were >1, but <1 for TCC, implying the former may adversely affect the functioning of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and with no plausible impacts from the latter. In terrestrial systems, RQ results for individual chemicals revealed no or limited risks; therefore, additional investigations are required on their toxicity, as effects data was very limited and characterised by wide variations. Future national monitoring programs in developing countries should consider including TCS and TCC as the results suggest both chemicals are of concern to freshwater, and TCS in WWTPs. Potential risks of their metabolites remain unquantified to date. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water resources in many arid to semi-arid regions are stressed by population growth and drought. Growing populations and climatic changes are influencing contaminant and water chemistry dynamics in urban inland waters, where flows can be dominated by, or even dependent on, wastewater effluent discharge. In these watersheds, interacting stressors such as dissolved oxygen and environmental contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals) have the potential to affect fish physiology and populations. Recent field observations from our group identified the calcium channel blocker (CCB) diltiazem in fish plasma exceeding human therapeutic doses (e.g., C-min) in aquatic systems impaired because of nonattainment of dissolved oxygen water quality standards. Therefore our study objectives examined: 1) standard acute and chronic effects of dissolved oxygen and diltiazem to fish, 2) influences of dissolved oxygen at criteria levels deemed protective of aquatic life on diltiazem toxicity to fish, and 3) whether sublethal effects occur at diltiazem water concentrations predicted to cause a human therapeutic level (therapeutic hazard value [THV]) in fish plasma. Dissolved oxygenxdiltiazem co-exposures significantly decreased survival at typical stream, lake, and reservoir water quality standards of 5.0 and 3.0mg dissolved oxygen/L. Dissolved oxygen and diltiazem growth effects were observed at 2 times and 10 times lower than median lethal concentration (LC50) values (1.7 and 28.2mg/L, respectively). Larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) swimming behavior following low dissolved oxygen and diltiazem exposure generally decreased and was significantly reduced in light-to-dark bursting distance traveled, number of movements, and duration at concentrations as low as the THV. Individual and population level consequences of such responses are not yet understood, particularly in older organisms or other species; however, these findings suggest that assessments with pharmaceuticals and other cardioactive contaminants may underestimate adverse outcomes in fish across dissolved oxygen levels considered protective of aquatic life.

AB Mucilage (represented as CEM) is abundantly present in Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott or taro and is a water-soluble neutral polysaccharide that can act as a binder, thickening agent, and matrix agent in the pharmaceutical fields of research. Presence of hydroxyl groups on its surface structure allows chemical modification. This study describes in details the synthesis and characterization of its graft copolymer with polylactide (CEM-g-PLA). The polymerization has performed using both the microwave irradiation and conventional methods. Ring opening polymerization of lactide onto the mucilage carried out in presence of stannous octoate as catalyst in chloroform medium produced CEM-g-PLA copolymer under optimum condition. The structure of CEM-g-PLA copolymers obtained from both the methods were comprehensively characterized for their physicochemical and thermal properties by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning colorimetric (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG) and Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Grafting of lactide onto CEM backbone has changed its water absorption capacity, solubility and swelling power, morphology, crystalline structure, and thermal property of the mucilage. The newly synthesized CEM-g-PLA copolymer may find potential applications in wastewater treatment and for sustained and controlled drug delivery systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Composted sewage sludge (CSS) has been extensively used in agriculture and landscaping, offering a practical solution for waste disposal. However, some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) like triclosan (TCS) and carbamazepine (CBZ) have restricted its land application. In this study, CSS was added to agricultural soil and garden soil at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 25% (w/w soil), and 4 mL of TCS and CBZ stock solution (1000 mg/L in methanol) was spiked into soil amended with CSS of each bottle to arrive at the concentration of 10 mg/kg. Samples were then collected after incubation for 120 days and analyzed for concentrations and half-life (t(1/2)) of TCS and CBZ, and soil physicochemical properties, together with enzyme activities. The results showed that TCS was degraded completely during the incubation period. In contrast, only about 5.82-21.43% CBZ was degraded. CSS amendment inhibited TCS and CBZ degradation and prolonged t(1/2) compared to the control, and the t(1/2) of TCS and CBZ increased with CSS addition amount in all treatments except for CBZ in the garden soil amended with 10% CSS. Correlation studies showed a significantly positive relationship between t(1/2) of TCS and CBZ and total organic carbon (TOC), while a significantly negative relationship between t(1/2) of the two PPCPs and pH was observed. Alkaline phosphatase showed a significantly negative relationship with the C-t/C-0 of TCS in garden soil amended with 25% CSS and CBZ in the control. The urease activity was negatively correlated with the C-t/C-0 of TCS in 10% and 25% CSS treatments and CBZ in 10% CSS treatment for garden soil.

AB This study examined the impact of soil filtration on water quality for reclaimed water from two municipal wastewater treatment processes with two soils (forest and farm). Soils were watered for 16 wk. Nutrients (NO3-N, NH3-N, and PO4-3), electrical conductivity, hardness, pH, total metals, and estrogenic activity in source and effluents were measured. Results were evaluated in reference to current regulations in Washington State. Both reclaimed waters met standards for unrestricted agricultural use but did not meet current state regulations for ecological use. Metal concentrations in reclaimed waters were generally similar to the control (tap water). Both source and soil filtered water met Washington State stream water criteria for chronic exposure for As but exceeded groundwater standards. Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ag, and Zn in the effluents were similar or slightly elevated to reclaimed source water for both soils and water types. Soil filtration improved water quality to levels within Washington State regulatory limits for ecological use for Cd, Cu, and Zn but decreased water quality for Pb for both soil and reclaimed water types. Phosphate concentrations were reduced by soil filtration, but NO3- concentrations were increased for both soils and all water types above source water concentrations. The estrogenic activity of the sand-filtered water decreased to near detection limits in the forest soil and by > 200% in the farm soil. The degradation in water quality (increased NO3-, As, and Mn) after soil filtration observed in this study would likely occur with any water type, including rainwater.

AB The present work deals with the photocatalytic degradation of Diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, using different commercial titania (P25, P90, C-TiO2) photocatalysts without and with Platinum as the co-catalyst. The photocatalysts containing Pt nanoparticles have been synthesized by the photodepositionmethod. The physico-chemical properties of as-prepared photocatalyst were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Adsorption experiments have shown the following order for DCF adsorption: C-TiO2 > P90 > P25, which corresponds nicely with the BET surface area of the catalysts. Pseudo first order rate constants for pure titania photocatalysts were as follows: C-TiO2 > P90 > P25. After immobilization of Pt, rate constants showed an optimum at 1.5 wt.%.

AB The distribution of consumed cocaine in the Brazilian Federal District (FD) was estimated using the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Sewage samples from eight wastewater treatment plants were analyzed for cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) using solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The highest per capita consumption was noticed for the northern area of the Brazilian Capital (1162 mg day' 10(X) inh(-3)) being 32% higher than the average consumption rate of the investigated region. In this area, a day-to-day investigation revealed an average cocaine consumption of 1800 mg day(-1) 1000 inh(-3) during the weekend. i.e., more than 50% higher than weekdays. An annual street-grade cocaine load of about 2 ton was estimated for the FD considering previous information on the actual purity of seized street drugs as well as consumers between 15 and 64 years old. Sample preservation strategies were also investigated in order to expand the WBE approach to other Brazilian areas. Sample acidification to pH 2.0 presented the smallest relative errors for COC (+11%) and BE (-4%) after a period of three days under typical transport conditions practiced by the Brazilian national postal service.

AB In addition to removing organics and other nutrients, the microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) biotransform many pharmaceuticals present in wastewater. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pharmaceutical biotransformation and biodiversity in WWTP bioreactor microbial communities and identify taxa and functional genes that were strongly associated with biotransformation. Dilution-to-extinction of an activated sludge microbial community was performed to establish cultures with a gradient of microbial biodiversity. Batch experiments were performed using the dilution cultures to determine biotransformation extents of several environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals. With this approach, because the communities were all established from the same original community, and using sequencing of the 16S rRNA and metatranscriptome, we identified candidate taxa and genes whose activity and transcript abundances associated with the extent of individual pharmaceutical biotransformation and were lost across the biodiversity gradient. Metabolic genes such as dehydrogenases, amidases and monooxygenases were significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation, and five genera were identified whose activity significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation. Understanding how biotransformation relates to biodiversity will inform the design of biological WWTPs for enhanced removal of chemicals that negatively impact environmental health.

AB Pharmaceuticals (PhCs) are organic contaminants that have been detected in wastewater, surface water, and soils throughout the world. The presence of 10 commonly used PhCs in Spain (azithromycin, benzylpenicillin, citalopram, fluconazole, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, irbesartan, olanzapine, telmisartan, and venlafaxine) was analysed at four wastewater treatment plants, and the changes in their concentrations during treatment were assessed. Although certain some PhCs were degraded in the treated water, their presence in sewage sludge increased in all cases. The sewage sludge was composted using rice straw to degrade the PhCs, and the composting efficiency was modified by changes in the relative C/N ratio of the composting blend. Using a simple microbiological culture process for enrichment, 11 different strains of microorganisms that degraded specific PhCs were identified. Ibuprofen and azithromycin were metabolized by one and four strains, respectively, and both PhCs were used as a carbon source; in addition, six strains used irbesartan as a nitrogen source.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely used antiepileptic drug, is refractory to biological wastewater treatment. Rapid removal of CBZ is possible using synthetic manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) but the removal mechanisms require further investigation. In this study, CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 was carried out at different pH to further explore the degradation mechanisms. Results show that CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 was highly pH dependent, and rapid degradation occurred when pH b2.8. Based on the density functional theory calculations, increasing [H+] not only increased the reactivity of delta-MnO2, but also enhanced the secondary reactions of the intermediates. During the degradation process, protonation of CBZ degradation intermediates, instead of CBZ, played an important role. The overall kinetics of CBZ degradation was then described by the retarded first-order model. The initial rate (rinit) in the model between pH 2.0 and 6.2 was determined to be r(init) = (2.41 +/- 0.51) x 10(-3)[CBZ](1.21) [MnO2](1.07)[H+](1.41). This is the first report revealing that protonation of intermediates from CBZ degradation can improve the CBZ oxidation by delta-MnO2. The pathways of CBZ degradation by delta-MnO2 were also proposed. The results of this study provide a new insight into the processing mechanism. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater have become an emerging issue due to their negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems. Two full-scale municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along the Songhua River were chosen to evaluate the intra-day dynamics, seasonal variations and removal of 12 selected PPCPs. Our results suggested that the selected PPCPs were frequently detected in the influent and effluent. Caffeine was the predominant compound in the influent; while the selected PPCPs was dominated by TCS in the effluent, suggesting the different fates of selected PPCPs in the WWTPs. The intra-day dynamics of PPCPs in the influent were evaluated, suggesting that the 12 PPCPs can be grouped into three categories because of their different use patterns. The analysis of seasonal changes of PPCPs concentrations in the WWTPs suggested that the concentrations of some PPCPs were influenced by the chemical usage, degradation and temperature. The removal efficiency for the PPCPs were very high with the values ranged from 70.0% to 99.7% for WWTP#1, and from 62.5% to 99.4% for WWTP#2. Significant seasonal variations of PPCPs removal efficiency were observed. Base on the mass loading of PPCPs in the two WWTPs, our results suggested that WWTP#1 in the urban core received much more PPCPs in comparison to WWTP#2 in the suburban regions, suggesting that influences of the service population.

AB The incomplete elimination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) during wastewater treatment has resulted in their detection in the environment. PPCP biodegradation is a potential removal mechanism; however, the microorganisms and pathways involved in soils are generally unknown. Here, the biodegradation of diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and triclocarban (TCC) in four agricultural soils at concentrations typically detected in soils and biosolids (50 ng g(-1)) was examined. Rapid DCF removal (<7 days) was observed under aerobic conditions, but only limited biodegradation was noted under other redox conditions. CBZ and TCC degradation under aerobic conditions was slow (half-lives of 128-241 days and 165-190 days for CBZ and TCC). Phylotypes in the Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadales and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant during DCF biodegradation compared to the controls (no DCF). For CBZ, those in the Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were enriched compared to the controls. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were also enriched during TCC biodegradation. Such differences could indicate these microorganisms are associated with the biodegradation of these compounds, as they appear to be benefiting from their removal. The impact of these PPCPs on the KEGG pathways associated with metabolism was also examined. Four pathways were positively impacted during DCF biodegradation (propanoate, lysine, fatty acid & benzoate metabolism). These pathways are likely common in soils, explaining the rapid removal of DCF. There was limited impact of CBZ on the metabolic pathways. TCC removal was linked to genes associated with the degradation of simple and complex substrates. The results indicate even low concentrations of PPCPs significantly affect soil communities. The recalcitrant nature of TCC and CBZ suggests soils receiving biosolids could accumulate these chemicals, representing risks concerning crop uptake. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotics have aroused increasing concerns due to their ability to enhance the resistance of pathogenic bacteria and promote the spread of antibiotic resistance. Biodegradation plays an important role in sulfonamide dissipation in both natural and engineered ecosystems. In this article, we provided an overview of sulfonamide biodegradation in different systems and summarized the relevant sulfonamide-degrading species and metabolic pathways. The removal of sulfonamides depends on a variety of factors, such as the type and initial concentration of sulfonamides, the properties of water or soil, and treatment process. The removal efficiency of sulfonamides by engineered ecosystems can be improved by optimizing their operating conditions. Much higher sulfonamide removal was also observed in upgraded or advanced treatment systems than in conventional activated sludge systems. Ammonia oxidation might promote sulfonamide biodegradation. In addition, sulfonamide-degraders from different bacterial genera have been isolated and classified, but no bioaugmentation practice has been reported. Different pathways have been detected in sulfonamide biodegradation. Further efforts-will be necessary to elucidate in-situ degraders and the metabolic pathways and functional genes of sulfonamide biodegradation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are thought to be potential incubators of antibiotic resistance. Persistence of commonly used antibiotics in wastewater may increase the potential for selection of resistance genes transferred between bacterial populations, some of which might pose a threat to human health. In this study, we measured the concentrations of ten antibiotics in wastewater plant influents and effluents, and in surface waters up- and downstream from two Charlotte area treatment facilities. We performed Illumina shotgun sequencing to assay the microbial community and resistome compositions at each site across four time points from late winter to mid-summer of 2016. Antibiotics are present throughout wastewater treatment, and elevated concentrations of multiple antibiotics are maintained in moving stream water downstream of effluent release. While some human gut and activated sludge associated taxa are detectable downstream, these seem to attenuate with distance while the core microbial community of the stream remains fairly consistent. We observe the slight suppression of functional pathways in the downstream microbial communities, including amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid metabolism, as well as nucleotide and amino acid scavenging. Nearly all antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic taxa are removed in the treatment process, though a few ARG markers are elevated downstream of effluent release. Taken together, these results represent baseline measurements that future studies can utilize to help to determine which factors control the movement of antibiotics and resistance genes through aquatic urban ecosystems before, during, and after wastewater treatment.

AB Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately, the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 degrees C) were approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined at 600 degrees C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 degrees C) and GCN (without NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (center dot O-2(-) and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of TC-HCI, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%), deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high amounts (1.428 x 10(7) P/cm(3)) restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9 and 94.3 mu mol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater, water from reservoir and tap water, respectively. This study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal efficiency of 6 micro-grain AC (mu GAC) was examined for 23 selected pharmaceutical compounds, usually found at trace level in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Two different sets of experiments were carried out using distilled water and a real WWTP secondary effluent in order to understand the adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals, including the role of the presence of background organic matter. Physical and chemical properties of mu GACs and target pollutants were checked for their potential to predict the pharmaceutical removal. Textural properties of mu GACs, and especially the mesopore volume, seemed to play the most important role during the adsorption without background organic matter whereas the chemistry of the mu GACs, such as the presence of surface oxygen groups and the point of zero charge, could have more influence in the experiments with WWTP effluent water. Positively charged molecules are better adsorbed due to the influence of the background organic matter and the presence of oxygenated groups in the surface of the mu GACs. The UV254 removal correlated well with the pharmaceutical removal and it is confirmed as an indicator to control the performance of pharmaceuticals adsorption with mu GACs in tertiary treatment.

AB The effective aridity in riparian areas is increasing from climate change and from human water consumption, which exacerbates the impacts of effluents from wastewater-treatment plants and from catchment run-off in rivers. The potential of natural riparian areas to act as 'green filters' has long been recognized, but the possible ecological benefits of natural riparian areas over large-scale environmental gradients on fish have not been explored in detail. Using an extensive data-set from northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites), ours is the first study to ask whether natural riparian vegetation can mitigate the effects of pollution on fish in rivers experiencing water scarcity. We used multimodel inference to explore the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation with nutrient pollution and water conductivity, which are among the world's worst river stressors, on multiple fish guilds, including widely distributed species and highly invasive alien fish species. Most models (54%) supported the additive effects of water-quality factors on fish, after having accounted for the influence of geography and hydrological alterations. Although many fewer models (7%) included riparian vegetation as an important predictor, riparian vegetation modulated the forms of the associations between fish and pollution. The relationship of nutrient pollution with native and alien fish richness changed from negative to positive with greater riparian structure or species richness. However, we found the opposite effect for the mean body size of sedentary fish, and only positive additive effects of riparian richness for the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish. Ammonium and nitrite concentrations adversely affected fish in these rivers up to 10 years after the enforcement of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive by the European Union. High conductivity also much affects fish, having negatives associations with migratory, pelagic, invertivorous and native fish, and positive associations with sedentary, benthic, omnivorous and alien fish. Therefore, the current status of natural riparian areas is unlikely to fully mitigate water-quality impacts on fish. The conservation of freshwater resources in semi-arid regions, such as north-eastern Spain, requires improved waste-water treatments and better agriculture practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of 11 synthetic polycyclic musks in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Jilin, China, by using a membrane bioreactor combined with anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The analysis of synthetic polycyclic musks was conducted with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. The removal efficiency of 11 synthetic polycyclic musks ranged from 65.9% (3-methylcyclopentadecanone) to 84.6% (Galoxolide) in the influent. Along the treatment process, it was observed that the anaerobic tank could remove the synthetic polycyclic musks effectively whereas the role of the membrane was to the musks, which could be ascribed to the relatively strong hydrophobic property of the musks. The sludge-water distribution coefficients (K-d values) as indicator of adsorption propensity for the sludge from anaerobic, anoxic, oxic and membrane tanks were measured. The high value of K-d, above 5.0 litres per gram of suspended solids, showed most of the musks could be removed by sludge through the adsorption process; thus the removal rate from the water phase caused by adsorption in the wastewater treatment plant can be predicted.

AB Struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) crystallisation is a promising approach for phosphorus recovery from swine wastewater. Currently, intensive pig feeding has made heavy metals (HMs) extensive in swine wastewater; therefore, significant amounts of HMs have been detected in struvite recovery products. In this study, the HM residues in the struvite products recovered from stirred and fluidised bed reactors were investigated. The results showed that Zn, Mn, and Cu were the most abundant elements in swine wastewater (1,175.3 +/- 178.0, 745.4 +/- 51.5, and 209.3 +/- 54.414 mu g L-1, respectively). The HMs, especially Zn (97.0%) and Cu (96.8%), were mainly distributed in the total suspended solids (TSS) of the swine wastewater. Redundancy analysis revealed that the HMs in the struvite products harvested from the fluidised bed reactor were mainly attributable to the aggregation of dissolved matters, because most TSS were elutriated through fluidisation. In contrast, the HMs in the struvite products harvested from the stirred reactor mainly originated from the TSS, which complexed with the HMs, and co-precipitated and settled with the struvite products. Furthermore, chemical fractionation of the HM species confirmed that the presence of HMs in the struvite products was mainly attributable to metal precipitation and organic aggregation.

AB A first review on occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is presented. The literature survey conducted here was initiated by the current Assessment of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). This first review on the occurrence and environmental profile of PPCPs in the Arctic identified the presence of 110 related substances in the Arctic environment based on the reports from scientific publications, national and regional assessments and surveys, as well as academic research studies (i.e., PhD theses). PPCP residues were reported in virtually all environmental compartments from coastal seawater to high trophic level biota. For Arctic environments, domestic and municipal wastes as well as sewage are identified as primary release sources. However, the absence of modern waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), even in larger settlements in the Arctic, is resulting in relatively high release rates for selected PPCPs into the receiving Arctic (mainly) aquatic environment. Pharmaceuticals are designed with specific biochemical functions as a part of an integrated therapeutically procedure. This biochemical effect may cause unwanted environmental toxicological effects on non-target organisms when the compound is released into the environment. In the Arctic environments, pharmaceutical residues are released into low to very low ambient temperatures mainly into aqueous environments. Low biodegradability and, thus, prolonged residence time must be expected for the majority of the pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic system. The environmental toxicological consequence of the continuous PPCP release is, thus, expected to be different in the Arctic compared to the temperate regions of the globe. Exposure risks for Arctic human populations due to consumption of contaminated local fish and invertebrates or through exposure to resistant microbial communities cannot be excluded. However, the scientific results reported and summarized here, published in 23 relevant papers and reports (see Table S1 and following references), must still be considered as indication only. Comprehensive environmental studies on the fate, environmental toxicology, and distribution profiles of pharmaceuticals applied in high volumes and released into the Nordic environment under cold Northern climate conditions should be given high priority by national and international authorities.

AB Continuous release of personal care products in environmental systems provokes adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems, as result of compound-specific biological interactions and chemical activity. Such substances are classified as organic compounds and are frequently found on consumer goods used by people in everyday activities. This study investigates the presence and risks of four parabens and triclosan on tributaries of the Iguassu River, located in the south region of Brazil. Important reservoirs used for potable water consumption are in the Upper Iguassu basin. Monitoring efforts were conducted in three rivers in the form of five campaigns along 10 control sections. Compound concentrations were determined by solid phase extraction and gas chromatography hyphenated to a mass spectrometer. Estimation of environmental risk for each compound was performed employing risk indexes, considering detected concentrations for the sections, lethal and effective median concentrations (LC and EC50) for various trophic levels reported in the literature. Concentration values show clear anthropic influence, presumably from raw domestic sewage discharges or effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Annual subtropical seasonality and low rainfall rates during winter can influence and increase the detected concentrations, also influencing the hazard quotient (HQ). The environmental risk assessment reveals that HQ tends to increase along the river course. As for the sensitivity of different trophic levels, parabens tend to affect particular trophic groups, while triclosan affects all four trophic groups.

AB With low levels of human antibiotics in the environment due to release of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, concern is rising about impacts on human health and antibiotic resistance development. Furthermore, WWTP effluent may be released into waterways used as drinking water sources. The aim of this study was to analyze three antibiotics important to human health (sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim) in soil and groundwater at a long-term wastewater reuse system that spray irrigates effluent. Soil samples were collected (i) at a site that had not received irrigation for 7 mo (approximate background concentrations), and then at the same site after (ii) one irrigation event and (iii) 10 wk of irrigation. Water samples were collected three times per year to capture seasonal variability. Sulfamethoxazole was typically at the highest concentrations in effluent (22 +/- 3.7 mu g L-1) with ofloxacin and trimethoprim at 2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.0 +/- 0.02 mu g L-1, respectively. In the soil, ofloxacin had the highest background concentrations (650 +/- 204 ng kg(-1)), whereas concentrations of sulfamethoxazole were highest after continuous effluent irrigation (730 +/- 360 ng kg(-1)). Trimethoprim was only quantified in soil after 10 wk of effluent irrigation (190 +/- 71 ng kg(-1)). Groundwater concentrations were typically <25 ng L-1 with high concentrations of 660 +/- 20 and 67 +/- 7.0 ng L-1 for sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin, respectively. Given that antibiotics interacted with the soil profile and groundwater concentrations were frequently about 1000-fold lower than effluent, soil may be an adequate tertiary treatment for WWTP effluent leading to improved water quality and protection of human health.

AB 17-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), diclofenac (DCF), and 4-nonylphenol (4NP) belong to the most common micropollutants (MPs) occurring in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The WWTPs are the primary barrier against the spread of micropollutants in the environment. The aim of this work was to study the kinetics of biological removal of the three aforementioned micropollutants from wastewater and to check whether the acclimation of biomass influenced on the kinetic parameters. In addition, the effect of MPs on the biochemical activity of microorganisms was tested. DCF inhibited the respiration activity of biomass to the highest extent, followed by 4NP and EE2, respectively. DCF occurred to be less susceptible to microbial decomposition than the other two MPs and was removed from wastewater at the lowest degree of 58%. The degrees of removal of EE2 and 4NP were higher than that of DCF and equal to 93 and 71%, respectively. The kinetic parameters determined in this work can be used in modelling and simulation of the removal of micropollutants from wastewater. They improve the predictive ability of the biokinetic models. The acclimation of the biomass to the relevant micropollutant does not influence on the kinetic parameters of biomass growth; however, it causes the increase of the yield coefficient for heterotrophic biomass.

AB The Prut River, the second longest tributary of the Danube river, was investigated for a wide range of anthropogenic organic pollutants to fill the data gap on environmental contamination in eastern European surface waters. In this study, the occurrence of a wide range of organic pollutants was measured along the transboundary Prut River, between Sculeni and Branza in 2010-2012. Using two different analytical methods, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, over 300 compounds were screened for and 88 compounds were determined in the Prut River. In general, the chemicals occurred at low levels. At the last sampling site upstream of the confluence with the Danube river at Branza, the highest average concentrations (>= 100 ng L-1) were determined for the artificial sweetener acesulfame, the pharmaceuticals metformin, 4-acetamidoantipyrene, and 4,4,5,8-tetramethylchroman-2-ol, the antioxidants 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisol, and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-toluene, the personal care products HHCB (galaxolide), 4-phenyl-benzophenone, and octyl dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid, the industrial chemical diphenylsulfone, and the sterol cholesterol. Low concentrations of agricultural pesticides occurred in the catchment. At Branza, the total accumulated load of all measured compounds was calculated to be almost 19 kg day(-1). In comparison to the Rhine River, the loads in the Prut, determined with same LC-HRMS method for the same set of analytes, were two orders of magnitude lower. Discharge of wastewater without proper treatment from the city of Iasi in the Jijia catchment (Romania) as well as from the city of Cahul (Moldova) revealed a distinct increase in concentrations and loads in the Prut at Frasinesti and Branza. Thus, an implementation of wastewater treatment capacities in the Prut River basin would considerably reduce the loads of micropollutants from urban point sources.

AB Some pharmaceutical conjugates can be excreted into wastewaters at levels rivalling those of the parent compounds; however, little is known about this potential reservoir of pharmaceuticals to aquatic systems. We evaluated the occurrence and distribution of four different classes of pharmaceuticals and their metabolite conjugates in a wastewater treatment plant over four months. Aqueous and suspended solids fractions of primary, mixed liquor, secondary, and final effluent, along with return activated sludge, and waste activated sludge were assessed. The only conjugate not found in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate. Moreover, thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were the only compounds quantified in the suspended solids in the final effluent. Propranolol, propranolol sulfate, thyroxine, and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration going through the wastewater treatment process, from primary to final effluent. However, there were significant decreases observed for acetaminophen (99.8%), sulfamethoxazole (71%), N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (59%), and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide (79%). The mean (+/- SEM) mass loadings in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound ranged from 0.84 +/- 0.2 g/d for thyroxine to 45.3 +/- 4.2 g/d for acetaminophen. At least as much conjugate was released into receiving waters, if not more: 1.6 +/- 0.2 gicl for thyroxine glucuronide to 18.5 +/- 4.5 g/d for sulfamethoxazole glucuronide, and 61.2 +/- 9.6 g/d for N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, the mean loading of thyroxine was 0.29 +/- 0.025 g/day and thyroxine glucuronide 1.8 +/- 0.59 g/day in the suspended solids. This equates to 26% of total thyroxine and 53% of total thyroxine glucuronide associated with suspended particulate matter that reaches receiving waters. This study reflects the importance of including phase Il conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters, and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg/L to mu g/L range.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are a recently identified global threat to wildlife, including birds. Like other human pharmaceuticals, the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) enters the environment via sewage and has been detected at wastewater treatment plants. Birds foraging on invertebrates at these sites can be exposed to pharmaceuticals, although the implications of exposure are poorly understood. We conducted experiments to test whether chronic exposure to a maximally environmentally relevant concentration of fluoxetine (2.7 mu g day(-1)) altered courtship behaviour and female reproductive physiology in wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a species commonly found foraging on invertebrates at wastewater treatment plants. When paired with a female over two days, males sang less and were more aggressive towards fluoxetine-treated females than controls. Fluoxetine-treated females were initially aggressive towards males, becoming significantly less aggressive by the second day. In contrast, control females expressed intermediate levels of aggression throughout. We found no effect of female treatment on female courtship behaviour. Female body condition, circulating testosterone and circulating oestradiol were unaffected by treatment and did not account for male preference. Our findings suggest that exposure to an antidepressant reduced female attractiveness, adding to growing evidence that environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics.

AB Increased consumption and improper disposal of prescription medication, such as beta (beta)-blockers, contribute to their introduction into waterways and may pose threats to non-target aquatic organisms. There has been rising concern about the impacts of these prescription drugs on coastal ecosystems, especially because wastewater treatment plants are not designed to eliminate them from the discharge. Few studies have characterized the sublethal effects of beta-blocker exposures in marine invertebrates. The overall aim of our research is to identify cellular responses of two commercially important filter-feeding marine bivalves, hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), upon exposures to two beta-blocker drugs, propranolol and metoprolol. In vitro exposures with bivalve digestive gland and gill tissues were conducted where tissues were separately exposed to each drug for 24 h. Tissue samples were analyzed for cellular damage (lysosomal membrane destabilization and lipid peroxidation), total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione-s-transferase activity. Elevated damage and changes in enzyme activities were noted in the exposed tissues at environmentally relevant concentrations. Differences in species and tissue sensitivities and responses to exposures were also observed. These studies enhance our understanding of the potential impacts of prescription medication on coastal organisms. Additionally, this work demonstrates that filter-feeders may serve as good model organisms to examine the effects of unintended environmental exposures to beta-blockers. These studies are part of our ongoing work aimed at evaluation of sublethal biomarkers of pharmaceutical exposures and identification of key events that can contribute to the development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).

AB Fluoxetine and propranolol are neuroactive human pharmaceuticals that occur frequently as pollutants in surface waters. The potential effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms have raised concern but many adverse effects are not well characterized for a broad range of concentrations and endpoints. In this study, 6 biological parameters in the freshwater Cladoceran Daphnia magna were compared for their responses to fluoxetine or propranolol exposure: mobility (dichotomous response), active swimming time, swimming distance, swimming velocity, swimming acceleration speed, and survival in the absence of food (starvation-survival). Changes in swimming behavior was quantified by video tracking followed by image analyses at six exposure concentrations between 100 ng/L and 10 mg/L. Active swimming time and swimming distance were the most responsive parameters among the behavioral traits. Sublethal exposure concentrations resulted in nonmonotonic responses and behavior profiling suggested that fluoxetine and propranolol stimulated swimming activity at 1-10 mu g/L whereas lower (0.1-1 mu g/L) and higher exposure concentrations (>100 mu g/L) inhibited swimming activity. The ability to survive in the absence of food when exposed to fluoxetine or propranolol resulted in EC50 and EC10 values that were lower than for swimming behavior (EC50 of 0.79-0.99 mg/L; EC10 of 1.4-2.9 mu g/L). Starvation-survival appeared to be a potentially simple and sensitive endpoint for adverse effects in D. magna at intermediate exposure concentrations. Nonmonotonic behavioral responses at low exposure concentrations and decreased ability to survive starvation should be considered in assessment of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals to freshwater invertebrates.

AB Methylparaben, which is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical, is added to various personal care products, including cosmetics, and is also used as a food preservative and in pharmaceuticals. However, information on the toxicity of methylparaben in soil ecosystems is limited. Furthermore, unlike other substances such as metals and pesticides, there is no regulation of levels or safe concentrations of methylparaben in soil ecosystems. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the toxicity of methylparaben on soil species and to derive hazardous concentration (HC) values with respect soil ecosystem protection. We conducted acute bioassays on eight species within six taxonomic groups and chronic bioassays on five species within four taxonomic groups. On the basis of the results obtained, we derived an acute HC5 value of 44 mg/kg soil and a corresponding chronic value of 27 mg/kg soil for methylparaben using species sensitivity distribution methodology following Australian and New Zealand guidelines. Given that there has been no proposed standard value for methylparaben in soil in any country, it was not possible to compare the HC values calculated in this study with regulation standard levels. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study is first to assess the toxicity of methylparaben against soil-inhabiting species and to estimate acute and chronic HCs for soil fauna and flora. The results of this study will provide valuable fundamental data for the establishment of acceptable levels of methylparaben in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study determined biotransformation rates (k(bio)) and sorption-distribution coefficients (K-d) for a select group of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic activated sludge collected from two different biological nutrient removal (BNR) treatment systems located in Nevada (NV) and Ohio (OH) in the United States (US). The NV and OH facilities operated at solids retention times (SRTs) of 8 and 23 days, respectively. Using microwave-assisted extraction, the biotransformation rates of the chosen TOrCs were measured in the total mixed liquor. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and atenolol biotransformed in all three redox regimes irrespective of the activated sludge source. The biotransformation of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), triclosan, and benzotriazole was observed in aerobic activated sludge from both treatment plants; however, anoxic biotransformation of these three compounds was seen only in anoxic activated sludge from NV. Carbamazepine was recalcitrant in all three redox regimes and both sources of activated sludge. Atenolol and DEET had greater biotransformation rates in activated sludge with a higher SRT (23 days), while trimethoprim had a higher biotransformation rate in activated sludge with a lower SRT (8 days). The remaining compounds did not show any dependence on SRT. Lyophilized, heat inactivated sludge solids were used to determine the sorption-distribution coefficients. Triclosan was the most sorptive compound followed by carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, DEET, and benzotriazole. The sorption-distribution coefficients were similar across redox conditions and sludge sources. The biotransformation rates and sorption-distribution coefficients determined in this study can be used to improve fate prediction of the target TOrCs in BNR treatment systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antimicrobial compounds, such as biocides and antibiotics, are widely used in society with significant quantities of these chemicals ending up in sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, mass flows and removal efficiency in different treatment steps at three Swedish STPs were evaluated for eleven different biocides and antibiotics. Mass flows were calculated at eight different locations (incoming wastewater, water after the first sedimentation step, treated effluent, primary sludge, surplus sludge, digested sludge, dewatered digested sludge and reject water). Samples were collected for a total of nine days over three weeks. The STPs were able to remove 53-> 99% of the antimicrobial compounds and 0-64% were biodegraded on average in the three STPs. Quaternary ammonium compounds were removed from the wastewater N99%, partly through biodegradation, but 38-96% remained in the digested sludge. Chlorhexidine was not biodegraded but was efficiently removed from the wastewater to the sludge. The biological treatment step was the most important step for the degradation of the studied compounds, but also removed several compounds through the surplus sludge. Compounds that were inefficiently removed included benzotriazoles, trimethoprim and fluconazole. The study provides mass flows and removal efficiencies for several compounds that have been seldom studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the removal of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a simulated managed aquifer recharge (MAR) system. The PPCPs included antibiotic, antiepileptic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and antilipidemic drugs, contrast media, herbicides, and stimulants. We first monitored the occurrence and fate of 22 PPCPs at a water reclamation facility (WRF) in Korea, and found carbamazepine and primidone were not readily removed (below 25% removal in average) by the WRF. This reclaimed water passed through a laboratory-scale soil column set-up at 0.5 m/d over one year, simulating MAR system. Atenolol, propranolol, and trimethoprim exhibited higher removal rates (> 80%) than other PPCPs through the simulated MAR, while atrazine, carbamazepine, lincomycin, primidone, and sulfamethazine were not readily removed, exhibiting removal rates below 20%. It can be efficient to monitor and manage these recalcitrant compounds at MAR systems to improve water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concentrations and fates of carbamazepine and metabolites (CBMs), nicotine and metabolites (NCTs), estrogenic compounds and metabolites (Es) in various water samples were investigated. Different concentrations were found for water from different sources. The concentrations of these pharmaceuticals and personal care products and their metabolites in human waste treatment plant (HTP) influents (0.08-173 mu g L-1) were higher than in the other influent samples and the lowest levels were observed in hospital wastewater treatment plant influents (0.03-7.33 mu g L-1). The concentrations were higher in HTP effluents (0.01-11.2 mu g L-1) than in the other effluent samples and lowest in sewage treatment plant effluents (0.003-1.26 mu g L-1). The NCTs were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (concentration range 0.05-89.6 mu g L-1) in the wastewater treatment plant influents, but the CBMs were found at the highest concentrations (0.003-6.88 mu g L-1). 10, 11-Dihydro-10, 11-dihydroxycarbamazepine was the most abundant of the CBMs in the wastewater treatment plants and water samples. Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine was dominant in the HTP and hospital wastewater treatment plant influents, whereas the parent NCT was dominant in the sewage treatment plant influents and in all the effluent and other water samples. Estriol was the dominant estrogenic compound in the HTP and hospital wastewater treatment plant influents. Estriol and estrone were found in many of the HTP influents, but estrone was dominant in the effluent and other water samples. The total removal efficiencies for the CBMs, NCTs, and estrogenic compounds for the treatment plants were -101% to 56%, 2.9%-99%, and >98%, respectively. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The accumulation of pharmaceuticals in the environment is of major concern, and efficient procedures are needed to eliminate them. Inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts, such as titanium dioxide, offer a promising solution. We compare the photocatalytic degradation of the two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX) by TiO2 nanoparticles in water. Photocatalysts synthesized using different methods were evaluated and compared with commercially available Evonik-P25 TiO2, and with direct photodegradation. The synthesized nanoparticles show high photocatalytic activity towards IBP (>97% degradation) and NPX (>90% degradation), and up to 79% mineralization is observed with NPX, and ca 50% with IBP. Major IBP photoproducts were 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanol, 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanone and 1-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-methylpropan-1-ol, while photocatalysis of NPX, showed the formation of 1-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)ethanol and 1-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone. The results were rationalized by considering one major primary pathway that involves initial decarboxylation of a chemisorbed compound followed by degradation of the radical intermediate produced. Our findings strongly suggest that with these compounds possessing carboxylic acid groups, the degradation mechanism involves competition between oxidative decarboxylation of chemisorbed compounds by semiconductor holes, and hydroxyl radical attack on physisorbed substrates.

AB A new screening method was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven acidic and basic pharmaceuticals by the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) utilising triple quadrupole mass spectrometry as a detector. The target pharmaceutical compounds of interest in this work belong to different classes of pharmaceutical group with different physico-chemical properties. Both the positive and negative ionisation modes (dual ionisation mode) in electrospray ionisation (ESI) were used simultaneously. Unlike previous studies, the performance of the dual ionisation mode was compared with the positive and negative ionisation modes individually in terms of analysis time and sensitivity. Results indicate that the developed screening method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the acidic and basic pharmaceutical compounds. Using dual ionisation mode reduced the analyses time while still maintaining sensitivity and quality of the analytical result. The new method was implemented in detecting the targeted analyte in a real sample of wastewater. The instrument detection limit (IDL) was as low as 9.7 fg, indicating a high sensitivity as compared to the corresponding methods. The precision of the instrument was calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging from 1.4 to 11.0%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for the method was over the range 0.77-177 ng L-1 and 1.05-100 ng L-1 for the influent and effluent wastewater, respectively.

AB Vancomycin is one of the most commonly used glycopeptide antiobiotics, and as such is an important emerging environmental contaminant. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), such as antibiotics, are problematic since wastewater treatment processes are not completely effective at removing these chemical compounds. Since wastewater treatment processes are not completely effective, vancomycin occurs in surface water. Vancomycin and its metabolites in vivo and degradation products in aquatic environment may lead to undesirable ecological effects that threaten the environment or cause undesirable reactions that affect human health. We aimed to study vancomycin metabolism in vitro and its natural degradation in aquatic environment, as well as explore for related metabolites and degradation products. Accordingly, we established four systems, using a constant temperature oscillator at 37 degrees C for 10 days for vancomycin in activated rat liver microsomes (experimental system), inactivated rat liver microsomes (control system), phosphate buffer saline (PBS system) and pure water (pure water system), as well as an additional system of activated rat liver microsomes without vancomycin (blank system). The metabolism and degradation of vancomycin were studied using a high resolution and high sensitivity ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Triple-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) method in positive ion mode. The compared result of activated rat liver microsomes system and inactivated rat liver microsomes system confirms that vancomycin is not metabolized in the liver. Vancomycin was degraded in the four nonblank incubation systems. The MetabolitePilot 2.0 software was used for screening the probable degradation products, as well as for establishing its associated degradation pathways. Eventually, four degradation products were identified and their chemical structures were deduced. The results of this study provide a foundation for evaluation of the effects of vancomycin and its degradation products on environmental safety and human health in the future.

AB For many polar organic micropollutants, biotransformation by activated sludge microorganisms is a major removal process during wastewater treatment. However, our current understanding of how wastewater treatment operations influence microbial communities and their micropollutant biotransformation potential is limited, leaving major parts of observed variability in biotransformation rates across treatment facilities unexplained. Here, we present biotransformation rate constants for 42 micropollutants belonging to different chemical classes along a gradient of solids retention time (SRT). The geometric mean of biomass-normalized first-order rate constants shows a clear increase between 3 and 15 d SRT by 160% and 87%, respectively, in two experiments. However, individual micropollutants show a variety of trends. Rate constants of oxidative biotransformation reactions mostly increased with SRT. Yet, nitrifying activity could be excluded as primary driver. For substances undergoing other than oxidative reactions, i.e., mostly substitution-type reactions, more diverse dependencies on SRT were observed. Most remarkably, characteristic trends were observed for groups of substances undergoing similar types of initial transformation reaction, suggesting that shared enzymes or enzyme systems that are conjointly regulated catalyze biotransformation reactions within such groups. These findings open up opportunities for correlating rate constants with measures of enzyme abundance such as genes or gene products, which in turn should help to identify enzymes associated with the respective biotransformation reactions.

AB While pharmaceuticals are now routinely detected in aquatic environments, we know little of the biological activity their presence might provoke. It is estimated that nearly 40% of all marketed pharmaceuticals are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) acting pharmaceuticals. Here, we applied an in-vitro assay, called the TGF alpha shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of GPCRs-acting pharmaceuticals present in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan from 2014 to 2016. The results indicated that compounds were present in the wastewater with antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (beta 1), acetylcholine (M1), and histamine (H1) receptors in both countries. The most consistent and powerful antagonistic activity was against the H1, D2, and AT1 receptors at up to microgram-antagonist-equivalent quantity/L. Chemical analysis of the same UK samples was also conducted in parallel. Comparing the results of the bioassay with the chemical analysis indicated (1) the existence of other D2 or M1 receptor antagonists besides sulpiride (D2 antagonist) or pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) in wastewater and (2) that there might be a mixture effect between agonist and antagonistic activities against beta 1 receptor. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be paid more attention in the environmental monitoring and toxicity testing in future studies.

AB The occurrence of various antibiotics in wastewater treatment systems continues to arouse extensive attention. However, the effects of low concentration of antibiotics on wastewater treatment performance and the related functional bacteria, especially under long-term operation, remain largely unknown. In this study, a lab-scale anaerobic-aerobic system was established to evaluate the impacts of 5 mg l(-1) tetracycline on the performance of a lab-scale wastewater treatment system and the abundance of the related functional bacteria. The results indicated that Tc exposure had little effect (p > 0.05) on the efficiency of COD removal during the whole period of 200 days, but significantly decreased ammonia removal (p <0.05) and accelerated sludge bulking deterioration. Although the core bacterial communities and the abundance of amoA genes in the activated sludge were not affected, the growth of Nitrospira was inhibited (p < 0.05), and Sphaerotilus was promoted by tetracycline exposure. The results of this study provide important references for the maintenance of wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutants escaping conventional wastewater treatment processes pose a threat to biota and the environment. Amongst micropollutants, small and ionizable organic compounds are particularly challenging, since their removal depends significantly on prevailing conditions. In this study, anionic cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) were shown to perform as promising adsorbents for an ionizable pharmaceutical, salbutamol. The adsorbents were produced from wood cellulose through succinylation pretreatment in urea-LiCl deep eutectic solvent (DES), followed by a nanofibrillation procedure. The impact of pH, contact time, salbutamol concentration, and adsorbent dose on salbutamol uptake were investigated in batch adsorption studies. Based on the results, the chemical modification of cellulose significantly enhanced the adsorption of salbutamol. The adsorption efficiency was mainly dependent on the charge and colloidal stability of the anionic nanofibril suspension rather than the charge of salbutamol, because the adsorption was considerably improved at pH > 7 due to the de-protonation of the cellulose carboxyl groups. The experimental maximum adsorption capacity was 196 mg/g. This study highlights the potential of cellulose nanomaterial adsorbents and the importance of controlling the charge of the adsorbent material when developing solutions for ionizable micropollutant removal.

AB Hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture (FeFeIII)-Fe-II layered double hydroxide (LDH) multiwall was grown on carbon-felt (CF) substrate via solvothermal process. The as-deposited FeIIFeIII LDH/CF cathode was composed of highly oriented and well crystallized interconnected nanowalls with high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity over a wide pH range (pH 3-9) for heterogeneous electro-Fenton (HEF) degradation of antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMT) in aqueous medium. Mineralization efficiencies (in terms of TOC removal) of similar to 97%, 93% and 90% was achieved at pH 3, 6 and 9 respectively for FeIIFeIII cathode during HEF treatment of 0.2mM SMT solution at applied current density of 7.5 mA cm(-2) using Ti4O7 anode. Comparative electro-Fenton (EF-Fe2+) with 0.2mM Fe2+ or electrooxidation with H2O2 production (EO-H2O2) studies using raw CF cathode at similar experimental conditions showed relatively lower mineralization with highest TOC removal efficiency of 77% and 64% obtained at pH 3 for EF-Fe2+ and EO-H2O2 respectively. Oxidative degradation of SMT in HEF system was by (i) Ti4O7(% OH) generated at anode surface at all pH studied, (ii) surface catalyzed process and (iii) contribution from homogeneous catalyzed process at pH 3 due to leached iron ions.The prepared (FeFeIII)-Fe-II LDH/CF exhibited excellent catalytic stability with good reusability up to 10 cycles of 4 h treatment at pH 6. Initial SMT solution showed relatively high toxicity but total detoxification of the solution was attained after 8 h of treatment by HEF with (FeFeLDH)-Fe-II-L-III/CF cathode. HEF with FeIIFeIII LDH/CF cathode is an exciting technique for remediation of organic contaminated wastewater.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF) in a mesocosm two-stage constructed wetland system consisting of a subsurface-flow bed (first stage; CW-1) and a surface-flow system (second stage; CW-2) with an emphasis on the effect of artificial aeration as a potential performance intensification option. Furthermore, the additional aim was to identify the transformation products of DCF and SMX along the flow path of the treatment system. This two-stage system was fed for 442 days with an artificial municipal wastewater containing DCF and SMX at a concentration of 2 mg/L each. The removal of SMX in the CW-1 was found to be significantly higher under non-aerated conditions ( > 77%) as compared to aerated conditions (26%), but the aeration of the CW-2 was insignificant for the SMX removal. In contrast, the removal of DCF was not affected by aeration in the CW-1 (removal efficiency of approximately 50%), but was significantly positively influenced by the combined effect of plants and aeration in the CW-2. The overall removal of SMX and DCF in the two-stage system was 95.8% and 77.6%, respectively. The transformation products of SMX and DCF detected in the studied system indicated the potential contribution of both oxic and anoxic transformation pathways, potentially including also abiotic reaction between SMX and Fe(II) leading to the cleavage of the isoxazole ring in this compound. Some of the transformation products found in the CW-1 were not further detected in the CW-2. Based on the literature data the antimicrobial activity and potential activity of the identified transformation products cannot be ruled out. Giant miscanthus growing in the CW-1 was unaffected by the high concentrations of DCF and SMX in contrast to the emergent macrophytes (on the floating island) or the free-floating plants present in the CW-2, which failed to adapt to the presence of the pharmaceuticals. As a result, the CW-2 was colonized by an unidentified species of a water moss and algae.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of loading frequency (1 pulse per day and 4 pulses per day) and vegetation (monoculture of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta') on the removal and transformation of a mixture of pharmaceuticals diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in lab-scale unsaturated vertical-flow constructed wetlands. Additionally, the system performance, the ecotoxicity of the wastewater (Microtox bioassay), and the microbial community structure and diversity in the top layer of the system were assessed. In the experiment, elevated concentrations of the pharmaceuticals (0.5 mg/L) were used to reflect the quality of wastewater from single houses or small settlements. The removal of DCF and SMX was deteriorated by the presence of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta'. The lower loading frequency enhanced the removal of DCF and SMX only in the planted columns, suggesting combined effect of the two factors. For the unplanted systems no significant effect of the loading frequency was observed. The observed removal efficiency of SMX and DCF in the experiment was in the range 52.8-91.2% and 47.3-74.2%, respectively. The pharmaceuticals did not affect markedly the removal of DOC, TKN and N-NH4, but they reduced the bacterial diversity within the rhizosphere and in the adjacent substrate of the systems. The main transformations of SMX were (mono-, di-, tri-)hydroxylation, demethylation, deamination and formation of glutathione conjugates, whereas for DCF only trihydroxylation was observed. The toxicity of the raw and treated wastewater containing the pharmaceuticals was at a level comparable with the control samples. This study showed that vertical-flow constructed wetlands can be efficient in the removal of DCF and SMX. Given that the constructed wetlands are inherently planted systems, it is suggested that the loading frequency is the operational variable that could be adjusted to enhance the removal of these pharmaceuticals.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation has great potential in wastewater treatment. However, the role of ozone and the contribution of photogenerated hole in this process have not been fully understood. Here three WO3 materials are synthesized and used as model catalysts in visible-light photocatalytic ozonation for the mineralization of pharmaceutical pollutants. A dual role of ozone in this process has been confirmed: (i) direct oxidation of the pollutant till formation of refractory intermediates, (ii) efficient trapping of photoelectron that cannot be captured by O-2. The latter is crucial because it not only induces the center dot O-3(-)-mediated pathway for hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) formation but also separates the hole which has proven to be capable of oxidizing water into center dot OH. Evidenced by photoluminescence results, the intrinsic charge separation ability of WO3 in photocatalytic ozonation is no more as important as that in photocatalysis with O-2. Finally, this process is more applicable under acidic condition. This work contributes to a better understanding of the significance of ozone in WO3 photo catalytic ozonation and provides us an insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic ozonation.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging membrane technology for wastewater recycling. However, its performance in removing disinfection byproducts (DBPs), a critical aspect of wastewater recycling, has not been investigated. This study systematically investigated the rejection of sixteen neutral DBP that are relevant to wastewater recycling in two commercial FO membranes (Aquaporin and CTA). Clean Aquaporin membrane displayed higher rejection for all DBPs than clean CTA membrane. For N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and haloacetonitriles (HANs), the most prevalent and toxic DBPs in wastewater recycling, the rejection by Aquaporin was 31% and 48-76%, respectively. The rejection of DBPs in FO positively correlated with their size across different DBP groups but did not correlate with their hydrophobicity. Organic fouling by alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) decreased the rejection and transmembrane fluxes of most DBPs. The DBP transport and the influence of fouling were discussed using a solution-diffusion model incorporating size exclusion, the surface interaction between the membrane and DBPs, and DBP diffusion within the membrane. Lastly, the rejection of NDMA and HANs in FO membranes determined in this study was compared with that in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes reported in the literature.

AB Pharmaceutical monitoring (37 pharmaceuticals and 3 human tracers) was conducted in a headwater streams in southwest France, an area characterized by a low population density with an elderly population (30% > 60 years old) and extensive agriculture (cow cattle breeding). Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) were exposed for 14-day consecutive periods in 2016 at three sampling points. Three human wastewater tracers and 20 pharmaceuticals commonly used for human and/or cattle were quantified in headwaters. Succession of small Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), non-collective sanitation, discharges of untreated effluents as well as the river ability to dilute discharged wastewater, mainly explain the pharmaceuticals and human tracers concentrations. Pharmaceutical loads were time-dependent and were higher during cold season due to increase of pharmaceutical consumption. In contrast, better degradation and/or sorption onto river biofflms in warm season induced the decrease of headwater pharmaceutical content. The headwaters streams were contaminated by compounds found in other type of watershed, but beta-blocker were the compounds quantified in higher concentration with frequencies of 100%, which was consistent with the elderly population living in the watershed. Specific compounds (sulfamerazine and sulfamethoxazole) used to cattle medical care were detected in waters, but at a low content.

AB Investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters at a catchment scale can be daunting. These investments are highly sensitive to the selection of environmental quality standards (EQSs) for the target micro-contaminants. Our hypothesis is that there is a balance between EQS selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision-making. We used a customized microcontaminant fate and transport model coupled to an optimization algorithm to validate this hypothesis in the Llobregat river basin and for the pharmaceutical compound diclofenac. The algorithm optimizes the number of WWTPs in this catchment requiring an upgrade to minimize the total amount of diclofenac that exceeds the EQS in every river section and the total cost. We simulated and optimized 40 scenarios representing a combination of 4 potential EQSs (10, 30, 50 and 100 ng L-1), 5 levels of uncertainty bounds in the predictions of river concentrations and 2 hydrological scenarios (average flows, flows annually exceeding 30% of the days; and environmental flows, flows annually exceeding 99% of the days). The results showthat there is a nonlinear relationship between the EQS and the required investment. The investment increases by 100% from an EQS of 100 ng L-1 to 10 ng L-1, significantly increasing (by 60%) from 30 to 10 ng L-1. Thus, establishing an EQS of 30 ng L-1 would balance environmental protection and costs. The selection of the hydrological conditions also plays a key role in the upgrade analysis because the costs for environmental flows are 50% higher than for average flows. Finally, we highlight that the investment in research would allow the reduction of uncertainties, hence allowing more qualified decisions to be made and a reduction in the WWTP upgrade costs (up to 4 (sic) household(-1) "year(-1)).

AB Pharmaceutical sludge is considered as a hazardous material with high treatment and disposal costs. In the present study, the catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) of pharmaceutical sludge by CuO-CeO2/gamma-Al2O3 as the catalyst was investigated. The catalyst was prepared by traditional wet impregnation. The catalyst was characterized using X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). CWO was performed in an experimental batch reactor. Several parameters that could affect the catalytic degradation efficiency, including catalyst dose, temperature, time, oxygen pressure and pH, were investigated. Under optimum conditions, the highest removal rate of volatile suspended solids (VSS) was 87.3% and was achieved at 260 degrees C for 60 min with an oxygen pressure of 1.0 MPa and 10 g/L of catalyst. At the same time, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate reached as high as 72.6%. This work implies that catalytic wet oxidation is a promising method for the highly efficient degradation of pharmaceutical sludge.

AB Azithromycin (AZI) has been listed as an emerging contaminant by the US EPA since 2009 because it is frequently detected in wastewater, surface water, and drinking water. In this paper, the chlorination of AZI in drinking water was simulated and studied. The results indicated that new compounds were generated in the chlorination of AZI. The byproducts were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF), and four of the byproducts were detected in real water samples. The kinetic studies demonstrated that the reaction rates of AZI chlorination were dependent on the initial concentration of free chlorine and the pH value. The potential toxicities of the byproducts were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship software and investigated by the viability of Chinese hamster lung (CHL), Jurkat T and Hep G2 cells.

AB An innovative process based on the combination of a UASB reactor and an IFAS system is proposed in order to combine different redox conditions and biomass conformations to promote a high microbial diversity. The objective of this configuration is to enhance the biological removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) as well as to achieve the abatement of nitrogen by using the dissolved methane as an inexpensive electron donor. Results showed high removals of COD (93%) and dissolved methane present in the UASB effluent (up to 85%) was biodegraded by a consortium of aerobic methanotrophs and heterotrophic denitrifiers. Total nitrogen removal decreased slightly along the operation (from 44 to 33%), depending on the availability of electron donor, biomass concentration, and configuration (floccules and biofilm). A high removal was achieved in the hybrid system (> 80%) for 6 of the studied OMPs. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, naproxen, and estradiol were readily biotransformed under anaerobic conditions, whereas ibuprofen or bisphenol A were removed in the anoxic aerobic compartment. Evidence of the cometabolic biotransformation of OMPs has been found, such as the influence of nitrification activity on the removal of bisphenol A, and of the denitrification activity on ethinylestradiol removal.

AB Occurrence of eleven pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) along Huangpu River, a representative urban river of megacity Shanghai, was investigated in four sampling campaigns. The overall concentrations of PPCPs ranged from < LOQ to 1455 ng/L, and untreated domestic wastewater was proposed as an important source of PPCPs in Huangpu River. Higher contamination levels of target PPCPs were detected in the lower reach (urban area) and dry season, compared to those in the upper reach (rural area) and wet season, respectively. The influence of rainfall on the occurrence of PPCPs was also extensively discussed in different regions along Huangpu River. At sampling sites in the rural area, similar or even lower concentrations of PPCPs were detected after rainfall; while increased concentrations of PPCPs were observed at most sampling sites, especially in the urban area, suggesting that overflow of untreated wastewater exceeding the capacity of wastewater treatment plants and leachates generated at temporary storage and transfer station of solid wastes might be the additional sources of PPCPs in the urban area in rainy days. These findings indicated that management of wastewater or/and solid wastes was more important to solve the problem of PPCPs contamination in the urban river of megacity.

AB The potential health effects associated with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have motivated regulatory initiatives and deployment of energy- and chemical-intensive advanced treatment processes for their removal. This study evaluates life cycle environmental and health impacts associated with advanced CEC removal processes, encompassing both the benefits of improved effluent quality as well as emissions from upstream activities. A total of 64 treatment configurations were designed and modeled for treating typical U.S. medium-strength wastewater, covering three policy-relevant representative levels of carbon and nutrient removal, with and without additional tertiary CEC removal. The USEtox model was used to calculate characterization factors of several CECs with missing values. Stochastic uncertainty analysis considered variability in influent water quality and uncertainty in CEC toxicity and associated characterization factors. Results show that advanced tertiary treatment can simultaneously reduce nutrients and CECs in effluents to specified limits, but these direct water quality benefits were outweighed by even greater increases in indirect impacts for the toxicity-related metrics, even when considering order-of-magnitude uncertainties for CEC characterization factors. Future work should consider water quality aspects not currently captured in life cycle impact assessment, such as endocrine disruption, in order to evaluate the full policy implications of the CEC removal.

Due to the vast amount of literature published on this topic, we have discussed only a portion of the quality research publications, due to the limitation of space. The abstract search was carried out using Web of Science, and the abstracts were selected based on their relevance. In few cases, full-text articles were referred to better understand new findings. This review is divided into the following sections: antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), disinfection by-products (DBPs), estrogens, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and microplastics, a new section added this year.

AB This review covers selected 2017 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, marine debris, dredging and disposal etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due largely to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and proliferation of data on the assimilation and effects of marine debris microparticulates. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (e.g. mass mortalities ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not on pollutant sources, chemistry, fate or transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation data may be appear in other topical categories such as effects of wastewater discharges, or biomarker studies appearing in oil toxicity literature). Therefore, we strongly urge readers to use keyword searching of the text and references to locate related but distributed information. Although nearly 400 papers are cited, these now represent a fraction of the literature on these subjects. Use this review mainly as a starting point. And please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB Emerging pollutants (EPs) are a class of chemical pollutants that have potential or substantial threats to human health and ecological environment. EPs mainly include pharmaceuticals and personal care products, endocrine disrupting chemicals, antibiotics, persistent organic pollutants, disinfection by-products and other industrial chemicals, etc. In recent years, with the improvement of environmental analysis level, these substances have been detected frequently in urban sewage, surface water and drinking water all over the world. The continuous detection of EPs brings new challenges to water pollution control, and also makes EPs treatment an international research hotspot. This paper summarizes some research results on emerging pollutants treatment published in 2017.

AB A bio-electrochemical reactor (BER) operating at different cathode potentials ranging from - 300 to -1000 mV (vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) was used to reduce adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) in pharmaceutical wastewater. Cathode polarization enriched the electron donor of the biological system. Thus, the AOX removal efficiency in the BER improved from 59.9% to 70.2%, and the AOX removal rate increased from 0.87 to 1.17 mg AOX/h when the cathode potential was reduced from - 300 to - 1000 mV with the addition of methyl viologen, a known redox mediator. The decrease of the cathode potential was also beneficial for methane production, and the inhibition of the methanogenic process enhanced the AOX removal. Additionally, cathode coulombic efficiency analysis demonstrated that the proportion of electrons used for AOX reduction decreases with decreasing potential, from 37.6% at - 300 mV to 17.3% at -1000 mV, although the AOX removal efficiency improves.

AB Under many circumstances chemical risk assessments for pharmaceuticals and other substances are required to differentiate between 'loss' of a chemical from the aqueous phase as a result of abiotic (sorption or precipitation reactions) or biotic (biodegradation) processes. To distinguish only abiotic processes, it is necessary to work under sterile conditions. Reported methods include poisoning the soil with sodium azide, irradiation and autoclaving. However, a key aspect of any testing is the representativeness of the matrix and so any sterilisation procedure needs to ensure that the integrity of the sample is maintained, in particular particle size distribution, pH and organic carbon partitioning potential. A number of controlled laboratory experiments were performed on 3 different types of soil. Results indicated that none of the methods successfully sterilised the soils and some physico-chemical changes in soils were identified post-treatment. Autoclaving destroyed the soil structure, therefore potentially affecting its sorption behaviour and sodium azide changed the pH of the loam soil solution by 0.53 pH units. Gamma irradiation exhibited least disruption to the tested soils physico-chemical properties. It was therefore concluded that gamma irradiation was the best available method for sterilising soils in preparation for sorption-desorption experiments; however care needs to be taken with this method to ensure that microbial activity is absent, or quantified if present. The changes to soils after sterilisation varied depending on the individual soil properties, indicating that soils should be studied on a case-bycase basis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The extraction and preconcentration of chiral beta-blockers in environmental water was evaluated by solidphase extraction (SPE) employing an SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silica functionalised with alkyl chains of different length. The materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements and elemental analysis. Important parameters influencing extraction efficiency, including the type and amount of sorbent and the breakthrough volume, were optimised. The results obtained showed that the organic chain length played an important role in the behaviour of these sorbents. Under optimised conditions, using 200 mg SBA-15-C8 as sorbent, a simple analytical method based on off-line SPE coupled to chiral capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection (SPE-chiral CE-DAD) was developed. Method detection and quantification limits were lower than 0.6 and 1.9 mu g L-1 respectively for all enantiomers, with a preconcentration factor of 500-fold. The method was successfully applied to the chiral analysis of atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol in river and sewage water samples. Satisfactory recoveries (between 86 +/- 2 and 98 +/- 1 %) and repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 9 %, n = 3) were obtained. Metoprolol was detected in sewage water at a concentration of 10.7 and 9.9 mu g L-1 and an enantiomeric fraction of 0.52 and 0.48 for the first- and the second-migrating enantiomers respectively. These results emphasise the importance of enantioselective analysis for environmental risk assessment.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU), as a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP), is frequently prescribed by doctors to relieve pain. It is widely released into environmental water and soil in the form of chiral enantiomers by the urination and defecation of humans or animals and by sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants. This study focused on the alteration of metabolism in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain after exposure to R-(-)-/S-(+)-/racIBU at 5 mu g L-1 for 28 days. A total of 45 potential biomarkers and related pathways, including amino acids and their derivatives, purine and its derivatives, nucleotides and other metabolites, were observed with untargeted metabolomics. To validate the metabolic disorders induced by IBU, 22 amino acids and 3 antioxidant enzymes were selected to be quantitated and determined using targeted metabolomics and enzyme assay. Stereoselective changes were observed in the 45 identified biomarkers from the untargeted metabolomics analysis. The 22 amino acids quantitated in targeted metabolomics and 3 antioxidant enzymes determined in enzyme assay also showed stereoselective changes after R-(-)-/S-(+)-/racIBU exposure. Results showed that even at a low concentration of R-(-)-/S-(+)-/rac-IBU, disorders in metabolism and antioxidant defense systems were still induced with stereoselectivity. Our study may enable a better understanding of the risks of chiral PPCPs in aquatic organisms in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac are two examples of drugs with widespread geographical and environmental media proliferation that are poorly removed by traditional wastewater treatment processes. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed as alternative methods to remove these compounds in solution. AOPs are based on a wide class of powerful technologies, including UV radiation, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, Fenton process, catalytic wet peroxide oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, electrochemical oxidation and their combinations, sonolysis, and microwaves applicable to both water and wastewater. Moreover, processes rely on the production of oxidizing radicals (center dot OH and others) in a solution to decompose present pollutants. Water radiolysis-based processes, which are an alternative to the former, involve the use of concentrated energy (beams of accelerated electrons or -rays) to split water molecules, generating strong oxidants and reductants (radicals) at the same time. In this paper, the degradation of carbamazepine and diclofenac by means of all these processes is discussed and compared. Energy and byproduct generation issues are also addressed.

AB Increasing human activities have not only substantially altered the natural material cycle but also created new synthetic chemicals flows. Some of these chemicals, which are described as micropollutants (MPs), may result in adverse effects on human health, aquatic organisms, and ecosystems. MPs can be transported to the environment and water resources in a variety ways including domestic and industrial wastewater. Unfortunately, most MPs are only partially removed in existing conventional treatment plants. Therefore, conventional treatment plants should be modernized by advanced treatment technologies to protect the environment and human health. However, there are various mysteries about best treatment techniques, evaluation criteria, and decision-making methods. In this study, it was aimed to determine the best treatment alternatives for triclosan (TCS) which is one of the priority MPs. A total of 18 evaluation criteria were identified and prioritized by employing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy methods. Treatment alternatives were identified and their performance was assessed through a comprehensive literature investigation. In decision-making processes of determining these alternatives, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), and Viekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje (VIKOR) analytical decision-making methods were employed, and priority rankings were determined according to each decision method. The final priority ranking was found as adsorption > membrane filtration > hybrid processes > advanced oxidation processes > constructed wetlands > conventional treatment processes > biological treatment > other treatment processes. Although the obtained results are specific to TCS, the employed analytical decision methods can be also used to decide the best treatment alternatives for other MPs.

AB The goal of this study is to investigate the occurrence and removal of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) during wastewater treatment processes and understand the role of enhanced nitrification treatment in removing EOCs. The influent and effluent of each treatment step at two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. A suspect screening method was applied with a comprehensive self-compiled suspect list. The list is composed of 1225 EOCs in 5 categories: pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, industrial chemicals, and metabolites. A total of 292-341 suspect hits were retrieved. The structures of 56 out of 86 selected suspect hits were further validated. The estimated influent concentrations of different EOCs varied from several ng L-1 to less than a hundred mu g L-1. Paracetamol, caffeine, benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazole, DEET, gabapentin, metformin, N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, atenolol acid, triethanolamine, and triethylphosphate were detected in the influent with high abundance. The results also revealed that many EOCs, such as fexofenadine, citalopram, flecainide, had low removal efficiencies. Seasonal effects were larger than the location influence on EOC removal. The secondary biological treatment played the most crucial role in EOC removal, whereas other steps except the enhanced nitrification step had a minor contribution. The enhanced nitrification step substantially removed a small number of EOC suspects. Notably, a reverse transformation from product to parent was also observed. This study provides systematic information on the occurrence and removal of EOCs in WWTPs and first important insights into the roles of the enhanced nitrification step in wastewater treatment.

AB The emergence of antibiotics residues in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater has been a significant environment problem. However, current methods of treating antibiotic-polluted wastewater are inefficient, of high cost and time-consuming. In this study, highly effective enzymatic Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were developed, which is extremely simple and can degrade antibiotics in a fast manner at a low cost. -Lactamase, a representative enzyme for -lactam antibiotic degradation, was covalently immobilized on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles modified with amino groups by a simple cross-linking process. The immobilized -lactamase displayed a wider pH and temperature range for penicillin G degradation than the free enzyme. Meanwhile, the thermostability and storage stability of the immobilized -lactamase were improved. Fifty milligrams magnetic nanoparticles immobilized with -lactamase can thoroughly degrade 100mL penicillin G (5-50mgL(-1)) within 5min. Even if the -lactamase immobilized on the nanoparticles was reused 35 times in the 5mgL(-1) penicillin G solution, it still kept more than 95% degradation efficiency. These suggest that magnetic nanoparticles immobilized with -lactamase have a sufficient capacity for degrading antibiotics in wastewater and will serve as a practical and economical solution to antibiotic pollution in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater treatment.

AB Porous activated carbons (ACs) prepared from a lignocellulosic waste, Caesalpinia ferrea seed pod wastes (CF) were utilised for removing captopril pharmaceutical from synthetic hospital effluents and aqueous effluents. Chemical activation using ZnCl2 was performed. It was utilised the following proportions CF-Biomass: ZnCl2 (1: 0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5, obtaining CFAC.0.5, CFAC.1.0, and CFAC.1.5 activated carbons. These mixtures were pyrolysed at 600 degrees C in a conventional furnace. The ACs were characterised by FTIR, hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio (HI), CHN/O elemental analysis, Boehm titration, surface areas (S-BET), total pore volumes, and pore size distribution. These analyses show that the ACs presents several functional groups on AC surfaces and there is a predominance of hydrophilic surfaces. All the activated carbons prepared presented surface area 1050-1480 m(2) g(-1). Regarding the adsorption process, the kinetics data were fitted to General-order kinetic model and equilibrium of adsorption data were well represented by and Liu isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity of 535.5 mg g(-1) was obtained at 25 degrees C for the sample CFAC.1.5. The thermodynamic studies have shown that the adsorption process of captopril is spontaneous and favourable. The employment of the ACs for treating simulated effluents, with different emerging contaminants, showed an excellent removal (up to 97.67%). This result is evidence that Caesalpinia ferrea seed pod wastes were a high-efficiency precursor for AC preparation and that such activated carbons could be used for treating hospital effluents containing pharmaceuticals.

AB This study examines time-varying adsorption of aqueous tetracycline (TC) by metal-organic framework, MOF-5. The employed MOF-5 is firstly synthesized under room temperature condition. Its structural, chemical, and physical features are then determined applying FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA, N-2 adsorption, and TEM characterization techniques. Cubic arrangement, 84.3% crystallinity, up to 450 degrees C thermal stability and approximately 2510 m(2)/g BET surface area with the both micro- and meso-cavities are its revealed characteristics. The impacts of the operative factors (adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial TC concentration, initial pH and temperature) on TC removal efficiency are examined following a two-step experimental design procedure (two-level categorical screening followed by response surface methodology for correlative model development). Additionally, to define the most appropriate condition/conditions, model-based optimization is implemented and verified in practice (more than %96 TC removal is achieved). Further thermodynamic and kinetic assessments respectively signify the both physisorption (Langmuir adsorption isotherm with maximum capacity of 233 mg/g) and chemisorption (pseudo-second-order model) mechanisms in this adsorption system. To sum up, MOF-5 as a suitable adsorbing agent will possibly have significant effects on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and can be considered for advanced studies as an appropriate candidate regarding practicable remediation techniques.

AB Conventional treatment processes have presented low efficiency in removing antibiotics from water and effluents, wherefore the development of processes and technologies to comply with this matter is highly important. Membrane separation processes may be applied in the obtainment of high-quality reuse water, fully or partly removing the pharmaceuticals. Thus, this paper aims to assess the performance of two nanofiltration membranes in removing norfloxacin from a synthetic effluent simulating a pharmaceutical wastewater. Different solution concentrations, transmembrane pressures and pH were evaluated. Both membranes presented high selectivity to norfloxacin, such that the rejection of this antibiotic remained between 87 and 99.5%. The pH had an effect on membranes selectivity and permeability. The highest norfloxacin rejection and the lowest permeability were reached at pH 6.5, which may be related to electrostatic interactions between membrane surface and norfloxacin ionic species. Considering the elevated rejections obtained in this study (87-99.5%), the viability of nanofiltration stands out in removing norfloxacin from effluents.

AB This research aimed at studying the degradation of benzotriazole (BT), an abundant contaminant in many natural waters, using catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation processes performed in a semi-continuous reactor. Magnetic alumina nanocomposite (MANC) was successfully synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM). The results revealed that the MANC dramatically enhanced the removal rate of BT. Experiments were evaluated at different solution pH values, catalyst doses, initial benzotriazole concentrations, and oxygen gas flow rates. The results showed that the removal rate of BT strongly influenced by the initial pH, and it increased by enhancing the pH value from 2 to 10 in both catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation. However, the catalyst showed its highest activity at pH near to its point of zero charge, indicating the critical importance of surface hydroxyl groups of alumina. Introducing tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) to the reactor highly decreased the degradation efficiency in the non-catalytic ozonation process, suggesting that the MANC catalyzes the decomposition of ozone to hydroxyl radical. The catalyst stability experiments after four successive runs showed that the catalyst was efficient and stable. Finally, the degradation of BT in secondary municipal wastewater effluent was studied under optimum operating conditions in order to examine the performance of the catalyst in the presence of components available in real streams. The results indicated no significant decrease in the performance of the catalyst. Furthermore, the catalytic ozonation process had also a great performance for removing phosphorus.

AB This study evaluated the ability of cork to adsorb a broad range of phenolic, pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds: phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol carbamazepine, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, triclosan, and methyl paraben. The effect of variables such as the compound concentrations and the amount of cork were studied resulting in a highly pH dependence in the case of phenolic compounds. Maximum removal percentages and uptake values of 75% (1.61 mg/g) for 2,4-dichlorophenol, 55% (1.25 mg/g) for 2-nitrophenol, 45% (1.47 mg/g) for 2-chlorophenol, 20% (0.63 mg/g) for phenol, and 100% for pentachlorophenol, were obtained for a 30 mg L-1 solution at pH 6, showing that the adsorption process increased with greater electronegativity of the phenolic substituting group. Removal percentages and uptakes of 82% (3.56 mg/g) for naproxen, 57% (2.31 mg/g) for ketoprofen, 50% (1.84 mg/g) for carbamazepine, 50% (1.78 mg/g) for methyl paraben, 100% for sodium diclofenac, and 100% for triclosan, were obtained using 5 mg of cork and a 1 mg L-1 solution of each compound. The adsorption process was almost complete after 30 min for all the micropollutants. Experimental equilibrium data were analysed by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models. Cork has proved to be an effective sorbent for the removal of phenols and emerging contaminants from contaminated waters and is a readily available material that can be acquired at minimal or no cost in cork-producing areas.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are thought to be a "seedbed" and reservoirs for multi-antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria which can be transmitted to the air environment through aeration. We quantified airborne multi-antibiotic resistance in a full-scale plant to treat antibiotics-producing wastewater by collecting bioaerosol samples from December 2014 to July 2015. Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (GNOPB) were isolated, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against 18 commonly used antibiotics, including 11 beta-lactam antibiotics, 3 aminoglycosides, 2 fluoroquinolones, 1 furan and 1 sulfonamide, were conducted. More than 45% of airborne bacteria isolated from the pharmaceutical WWTP were resistant to three or more antibiotics, and some opportunistic pathogenic strains were resistant to 16 antibiotics, whereas 45.3% and 50.3% of the strains isolated from residential community and municipal WWTP showed resistance to three or more antibiotics. The calculation of the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index demonstrated that the air environment in the pharmaceutical WWTP was highly impacted by antibiotic resistance, while the residential community and municipal WWTP was less impacted by antibiotic resistance. In addition, we determined that the dominant genera of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria isolated from all bioaerosol samples were Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Kiebsieiia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas. Collectively, these results indicate the proliferations and spread of antibiotic resistance through bioaerosols in WWTP treating cephalosporin-producing wastewater, which imposed a potential health risk for the staff and residents in the neighborhood, calling for administrative measures to minimize the air-transmission hazard.

AB In this study, magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method by using ferric nitrate and cobalt nitrate as raw materials. Subsequently, physicochemical properties of the resulting CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were systematically studied by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and Vibration sample magnetometer measurement. Results indicated that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with cubic spinel structure possessed an average diameter of 6.9 nm, specific surface area of 103.48 m(2) . g(-1), saturation magnetization of 54.65 A . m(2) (emu . g(-1)) and coercivity of 1.76x10(4) A . m(-1). Furthermore, scavenging experiments revealed that sulfate radicals ((SO4-)-S-center dot) was the main active species derived from persulfates, in which 72.3% of diclofenac could be degraded within 30 min treatment. This study provides a promising strategy to synthesize versatile catalyst which would be potentially applied in pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Despite the amount of treated wastewater discharged into the Southern California Bight, few studies have examined pharmaceutical compounds in local biota. The Round Stingray (Urobatis hailer was selected as a representative elasmobranch species to perform an exploratory study on environmental pharmaceutical exposure. Archived liver samples of males and females from juvenile to adult size classes from several locations (n = 53) were examined for 18 pharmaceutical and illicit drug compounds using isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS. Very few compounds were detected in stingray livers, with diphenhydramine as the only pharmaceutical above quantitation limits. Only stingrays collected from the urban site (mainland California) had detectable levels of diphenhydramine compared to no detections in reference stingrays (offshore island). Sex and sampling location substantially influenced both detection rate and concentrations. Our results suggest that aspects of species' ecology and physiology should be considered for future studies investigating pharmaceutical exposure in elasmobranchs.

AB We investigated the presence of 66 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals from seven therapeutic groups in surface waters of the Tejo estuary. Collection sites covered the entire estuary and included areas near main river inflows and wastewater treatment outfalls, traversing urban, agriculture, aquaculture, and nature reserve areas. Detection of pharmaceuticals was performed via UHPLC-TOF-MS. Pharmaceuticals were found in all sites (32 different compounds in total). Antibiotics, beta-blockers, antihypertensives and anti-inflammatories were the most frequently detected ( > 90%), with variation in concentrations reflecting the multifaceted nature of estuarine surroundings (accumulated site contamination between 15 and 351 ng L-1). Higher concentrations of antidepressant Sertraline (304 ng L-1), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Diclofenac (51.8 ng L-1), lipid regulator Gemfibrozil (77.0 ng L-1), antihypertensive Ibersartan (161.9 ng L-1) or antibiotic Doxycycline (128.0 ng L-1), among others, though localized may potentially impact key estuarine functions or services. Ultimately, results provide a baseline for regulatory information and future biota evaluations.

AB Recently, pharmaceutical compounds have been identified as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC) in wastewater due to the potential hazards to human bodies, and various methods are being developed to remove CEC from wastewater and water bodies. This research reports conversion of spent tea leaves (STL) to activated carbon (AC) for removal of acetaminophen (paracetamol) from simulated wastewater. STL-AC prepared via phosphoric acid activation (STL-ACH) showed the highest adsorption performance towards acetaminophen when compared to STL-AC activated by other chemicals. Characterizations on STL-ACH revealed that acid treatment led to dehydration and chemical reactions in the biomass precursor. The maximum removal efficiency of aspirin observed at the initial concentration of 10 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 0.5 g, pH 3 at room temperature and reaction time of 60 min. The adsorption data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model and obeyed the pseudo-second order kinetics model. The adsorption capacity of STL-ACH towards acetaminophen was found to be 59.2 mg/g. The adsorption process is exothermic, feasible and spontaneous according to the thermodynamic evaluation. This study demonstrates the feasibility to convert one common biowaste to a value-added product that removes contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) from wastewater, thus it is necessary to investigate the potential of STL-ACH in wastewater treatment application.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are an emerging concern because of the large amount of PPCPs that is discharged and its potential ecological effects on the aquatic environment. Chlorination has proven efficient for removing some aromatic PPCPs from wastewater, but the formation of by-products has not been thoroughly investigated partly because of analytical difficulties. This study developed a method for systematically screening and identifying the transformation products (TPs) of multiple aromatic PPCPs through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We spiked an environmentally relevant concentration (5000 ng/L) of three anti-inflammatory drugs, four parabens, bisphenol A, oxybenzone, and triclosan in the Milli-Q water and water containing natural organic matter (NOM). Low-dose chlorination (0.2-0.7 mg/L) was performed. We compared the chemical profiles of the chlorinated and untreated water and selected the ions to be identified based on the results of t-test and the ratio of signal intensities. Compound matching and isotopic pattern comparison were applied to characterising the molecular formulae of TPs. The fragmentation of the PPCPs and TPs was used in elucidating the structures of the TPs. The confirmation of TPs was achieved by comparing the retention time and fragment patterns of TPs with the isomer standards. In the chlorinated water, the aromatic PPCPs were substantially removed, except for the anti-inflammatory drugs (removal rates -5.2%-26%). Even with moderate chlorine dosages, all of the aromatic PPCPs, except for acetylsalicylic acid, were transformed into chlorinated derivatives in the Milli-Q water, and so were some PPCPs in the NOM-added water. The results of structure elucidation and compound confirmation as well as the increases in log K-ow suggested that chlorination could transform aromatic PPCPs into more persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic TPs. The presence of these TPs in the effluents where the PPCPs are removed through chlorination may pose increased risks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although there is increased global environmental concern about emerging organic micropollutants (EOMPs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and polar pesticides, limited information is available on their occurrence in Africa. This study presents unique data on concentrations and loads of 31 PPCPs and 10 pesticides in four wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) and receiving rivers (flowing through urban centres) in Kenya. The WSPs indicate a high potential to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) with removals by up to >4 orders of magnitude (>99.99% removal), mainly occurring at the facultative stage. However, there are large differences in removal among the different classes, and a shift in the relative PhACs occurrence is observed during wastewater treatment. Whereas the influent is dominated by high-consumption PhACs like anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. paracetamol and ibuprofen, up to 1000 mu g L-1), the most recalcitrant PhACs including mainly antibiotics (e.g. sulfadoxin and sulfamethoxazole) and antiretrovirals (e.g. lamivudine and nevirapine) are largely abundant (up to 100 mu g L-1) in treated effluent.
   Overall, concentrations of EOMPs in the Nzoia Basin rivers are the highest in dry season (except pesticides) and in small tributaries. They are of the same order of magnitude as those measured in the western world, but clearly lower than what we recently measured in the Ngong River, Nairobi region. Based on the specific consumption patterns and recalcitrant behavior, high concentrations (>1000 ng L-1) are observed in the rivers for PPCPs like lamivudine, zidovudine, sulfamethoxazole and methylparaben. Concentration levels of pesticides are in general one order of magnitude lower (<250 ng L-1). Our data suggest a continuous input of EOMPs to the rivers from both point (WSPs) and diffuse (urban centres) sources. To better understand and manage the impact of both sources, EOMP removal mechanisms in WSPs and their attenuation in rivers merit further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research investigated the micropollutant biodegradation and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration reduction in high strength wastewater treated by two-stage activated sludge (AS) systems with (bioaugmented) and without (non-bioaugmented) acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation. The bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented systems were operated in parallel for 228 days, with three levels of concentrations of organics, nitrogen, and micropollutants in the influent: conditions 1 (low), 2 (moderate), and 3 (high). The results showed that, under condition 1, both systems efficiently removed the organic and nitrogen compounds. However, the bioaugmented system was more effective in the micropollutant biodegradation and N2O concentration reduction than the non-bioaugmented one. Under condition 2, the nitrogen and micropollutant biodegradation efficiency of the non-bioaugmented system slightly decreased, while the N2O concentration declined in the bioaugmented system. Under condition 3, the treatment performance and N2O concentration abatement were substantially lowered as the compounds concentration increased. Further analysis also showed that the acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation increased the bacterial diversity in the system. In essence, the acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation strategy was highly effective for the influent with low compounds concentration, achieving the organics and nitrogen removal efficiencies of 92-97%, relative to 71-97% of the non-bioaugmented system. The micropollutant treatment efficiency of the bioaugmented system under condition 1 was 75-92%, indicating significant improvement in the treatment performance (p < 0.05), compared with 60-79% of the non-bioaugmented system.

AB The antihypertensive losartan (LOS) has been detected in wastewater and environmental matrices, however further studies focused on assessing the ecotoxicological effects on aquatic ecosystems are necessary. Considering the intensive use of this pharmaceutical and its discharges into coastal zones, our study aimed to determine the environmental concentrations of LOS in seawater, as well as to assess the biological effects of LOS on the marine bivalve Perna perna. For this purpose, fertilization rate and embryolarval development were evaluated through standardized assays. Phase I (ethoxyresorufin O deethylase EROD and dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase DBF) and II (glutathione S-transferase GST) enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Cholinesterase (ChE), lipoperoxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were used to analyze sublethal responses in gills and digestive gland of adult individuals. Lysosomal membrane stability was also assessed in hemocytes. Our results showed the occurrence of LOS in 100% of the analyzed water samples located in Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a range of 0.2 ng/L-8.7 ng/L. Effects on reproductive endpoints were observed after short-term exposure to concentrations up to 75 mg/L. Biomarker responses demonstrated the induction of CYP450 like activity and GST in mussel gills exposed to 300 and 3000 ng/L of LOS, respectively. GPx activity was also increased in concentration of exposure to 3000 ng/L of LOS. Cyto-genotoxic effects were found in gills and hemocytes exposed in concentrations up to 300 ng/L. These results highlighted the concern of introducing this class of contaminants into marine environments, and pointed out the need to include antihypertensive compounds in environmental monitoring programs.

AB It is widely believed that constructed wetlands (CWs) own great potentiality as polishing wastewater treatment methods for removing carbamazepine (CBZ). Although the typical CBZ removal efficiencies in CWs are quite low, the CBZ removal performance could be improved to some extend by optimizing the CW design parameters. A comparison of current relevant studies indicates that horizontal sub-surface flow CWs (HSSF-CWs) and hybrid wetlands are attracting more interest for the treatment of CBZ wastewater. According to CBZ's physicochemical properties, substrate adsorption (25.70-57.30%) and macrophyte uptake (22.30-51.00%) are the two main CBZ removal pathways in CWs. The CBZ removal efficiency of CWs employing light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) as a substrate could reach values higher than 90%, and the most favorable macrophyte species is Iris sibirica, which has shown the highest total CBZ assimilation capacity. Several methods for enhancement have been proposed to optimize CBZ removal in CWs, including development of hydraulic models for optimization of CW operation, introduction of extra new CBZ removal ways into CW through substrate modification, design of combined/integrated CW, etc.

AB In the present work, the adsorptive removal of diclofenac from water by biosorption onto non-living microalgae biomass was assessed. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out using biomass of two different microalgae strains, namely Synechocystis sp. and Scenedesmus sp. Also, for comparison purposes, a commercial activated carbon was used under identical experimental conditions. The kinetics of the diclofenac adsorption fitted the pseudo-second order equation, and the corresponding kinetic constants indicating that adsorption was faster onto microalgae biomass than onto the activated carbon. Regarding the equilibrium results, which mostly fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, these pointed to significant differences between the adsorbent materials. The Langmuir maximum capacity (Q(max)) of the activated carbon (232 mg.g(-1)) was higher than that of Scenedesmus sp. (28 mg.g(-1)) and of Synechocystis sp. (20 mg.g(-1)). In any case, the Qmax values determined here were within the values published in the recent scientific literature on the utilization of different adsorbents for the removal of diclofenac from water. Still, Synechocystis sp. showed the largest KL fitted values, which points to the affinity of this strain for diclofenac at relative low equilibrium concentrations in solution. Overall, the results obtained point to the possible utilization of microalgae biomass waste in the treatment of water, namely for the adsorption of pharmaceuticals.

AB Biotransformation of most organic micropollutants (OMPs) during wastewater treatment is not complete and an unexplained steady decrease of the biotransformation rate with time is reported for many OMPs in different biological processes. To minimize and accurately predict the emission of OMPs into the environment, the mechanisms and limitations behind their biotransformations should be clarified. Aiming to achieve this objective, the present study follows a mechanistic modelling approach, based on the formulation of four models according to different biotransformation hypotheses: Michaelis-Menten kinetics, chemical equilibrium between the parent compound and the transformation product (TP), enzymatic inhibition by the TP, and a limited compound bioavailability due to its sequestration in the solid phase. These models were calibrated and validated with kinetic experiments performed in two different anaerobic systems: continuous reactors enriched with methanogenic biomass and batch assays with anaerobic sludge. Model selection was conducted according to model suitability criteria (goodness of fitting the experimental data, confidence of the estimated parameters, and model parsimony) but also considering mechanistic evidences. The findings suggest that reversibility of the biological reactions and/or sequestration of compounds are likely the causes preventing the complete biotransformation of OMPs, and biotransformation is probably limited by thermodynamics rather than by kinetics. Taking into account its simplicity and broader applicability spectrum, the reversible biotransformation is the proposed model to explain the incomplete biotransformation of OMPs.

AB Heterogeneous Fenton oxidation using Fe-zeolite catalyst (of ZSM5 type) was investigated for the removal of ibuprofen (20 mg/L) in water. In particular, the effects of catalyst concentration, oxidant dosage, temperature, solution pH, and water matrix on pollutant conversion and mineralization were evaluated. The activity of lea-ched iron species in solution was also measured to determine the contribution of the homogeneous reaction.
   Oxidation rate of ibuprofen obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the pollutant concentration, and the apparent rate constant increased with catalyst and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the investigated ranges (1-5 g/L of Fe-zeolite and 0.5-7 times the stoichiometric amount of oxidant). Energy activation of 53 kJ/mol was obtained from Arrhenius plot However, the mineralization yield was not significantly improved by a too large excess of H2O2 or increase of temperature. In the selected conditions (25 degrees C, 4.8 g/L of catalyst, 2 times the stoichiometric amount of H2O2), 88% of ibuprofen and 27% of TOC were removed after 3 hours of reaction under "natural" pH conditions.
   Very low leaching (up to 0.2 mg/L) and negligible activity of leached iron in solution indicated that Fenton reaction was mainly induced by iron species on the catalyst surface.
   Degradation rate of ibuprofen was slower in wastewater effluent as compared to distilled water, mainly due to alkaline buffering and radical scavenging effects of organic and inorganic compounds present in the matrix.
   Mono- and multi-hydroxylated ibuprofen adducts were found as main oxidation intermediates -in line with free-radical mechanism- as well as 4-isobutylacetophenone from decarboxylation route.

AB Waterless urinals can save significant amounts of water but they can also be used to separate concentrated urine at source. Urine collection in established buildings is often costly because the plumbing system must be retrofitted for separate urine pipes. In addition, waterless urinals often have issues with blockages because of solids building up in the piping system.
   To solve these challenges, we have developed a fertilizer-producing urinal that uses no water and does not have to be connected to a conventional sewage line to operate. We designed and constructed the urinal using a plastic funnel and collection tank. The urinal recovered 11.23 +/- 1.3 g of solid fertilizer per kg of urine and we found that 1000 nutrient recovery urinals could produce an income of $85/day. This novel approach offers a new and easy method for collecting urine within office blocks or other commercial buildings. In addition, the recycling of nutrients at source offers a more sustainable and environmentally method for fertilizer production since minimal energy is required and "waste" streams are converted into useful products.

AB The industrial production unavoidably generates waste in many cases but that should be recycled and reused following the principle of circular economy. New waste treatment methods or green technologies with zero waste should be developed in order to solve this problem. Since zero emission technology is a difficult task, it is rather typical that waste treatment process is developed. A typical example can be found in pharmaceutical industries because these plants generate wastewaters with high organic content, so-called process wastewaters (PWWs). These waters should be definitely treated before discharging, their organic content must be removed and then the PWW may be usually allowed into the sewer. Nowadays, the physicochemical methods are increasingly used since they have a smaller footprint compared with that of the biological treatments. On the other hand, the polluting organic substances can be recovered and recycled or reused. In our novel method, distillation is applied that is based on relative volatility differences of the individual components. The more volatile organic pollutants of the treated PWWs are obtained as the top product of the distillation, preferably in reusable form. The bottom product of distillation, namely the PWW should satisfy the discharge limits. Our novel innovative method is developed to remove and reuse the organically bound halogens and to reduce the chemical oxygen demand below the emission limit of PWWs. Our method is implemented and this well-planned industrial apparatus meets the requirement of the Sustainable Water Solutions and Circular Economy, and moreover the payback time of the investment is less than 2 years.

AB The removal and transformation of clofibric acid (CA), which is a metabolite of clofibrate drugs, in aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was studied in this paper. By the analysis of CA concentration in the sewage and sludge phase, the biological removal mechanism was shown to be important, achieving 10%-12% of removal efficiency. However, the adsorption effect was relatively weak. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that CA mainly produced three biodegradation metabolites: a-hydroxyisobutyric acid, lactic acid and 4-chlorophenol. The a-hydroxyisobutyric acid was the major metabolite, and the second most important was lactic acid. The two substances accumulated for a period, and were then gradually utilised by microorganisms. These results indicated that CA can be transformed into other products during biological treatment although it is refractory. Moreover, the concentration of 4-chlorophenol was very low. Microbial community distribution was analysed by high-throughput sequencing. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. After addition of CA, the component of both Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dropped. For genus level analysis, a new Porphyromonadaceae emerged in the SBR with CA.

AB The propagation of antibiotic resistance is a challenge for human health worldwide, which has drawn much attention on the reduction of the resistance genes. To understand their occurrence during different treatment processes, in this study, four classes of antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones, and macrolides), eight antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetB, tetW, sul1, sul2, gyrA, qepA, ermB, and ermF), and two mobile elements (int1 and int2) were investigated in a typical pharmaceutical plant. The total concentrations of antibiotics were detected in the range of 2.6x10(2) to 2.5x10(3)ng/L in the treatment processes, and the high abundance of ARGs was detected in the biological treatment unit. The dynamic trend analysis showed that antibiotics were partially removed in the anaerobic/aerobic processes, where ARGs were proliferated. The abundance of tetB and gyrA genes was positively correlated with pH and EC (p<0.05), and the tetW, sul1 and sul2 genes were significantly correlated with TOC, TN, and DO (p<0.05), indicating the influence of physicochemical properties of the solution on the levels of ARG subtypes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the tetW clones had high homology with some pathogenic microorganisms, such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Neisseria meningitides, which would threaten human health. Results indicated that the horizontal transfer acted as a major driver in the ARGs evolution.

AB An easy to synthesize amphiphilic dye is developed whose sensing behavior in surfactant assemblies can be modulated through surface-charge, micropolarity, and local pH, etc. Thus, the micelle-bound probe shows remarkable ion dependent bathochromic shifts in the charge-transfer band, enabling simultaneous ratiometric detection of four different metal ions, such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+, at parts per billion (ppb) level in water. This is indeed a striking observation since naked-eye sensing of multiple metal ions at the mesoscopic interface is not known to date. Moreover, the probe even shows distinct color response against copper ion in different oxidation states, which is also unheard of. Further, the in situ formed metal complexes can be employed for naked-eye screening of three different amino acids, such as histidine, cysteine, and aspartic acid, in aqueous medium. Probes of this class, which are capable of multiplexing, offer new ways of efficiently screening multiple analytes in complex, real-life samples (e.g., wastewater management, analysis of pharmaceutical drugs, etc.). Further, low-cost reusable dye-coated paper discs were also developed as an ecofriendly method for on-site sensing of metal ions.

AB Contaminants giving rise to emerging concern like pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) have been detected in wastewaters, as reported in the literature, but little is known about their (eco)toxicological effects and consequent human health impact. The present study aimed at overcoming this lack of information through the use of in silico methods integrated with traditional toxicological risk analysis. This is part of a pilot project involving the management of wastewater treatment plants in the Ledra River basin (Daly). We obtained data to work up a global risk assessment method combining the evaluations of health risks to humans and ecological receptors from chemical contaminants found in this specific area. The (eco)toxicological risk is expressed by a single numerical value, permitting the comparison of different sampling sites and the evaluation of future environmental and technical interventions.

AB Methamphetamine (MET) is one of the most used illicit drugs in Europe and is recognized as one of the Emerging Organic Micropollutants. It is discharged into the sewerage system from different sources and then enters the wastewater treatment plants. The present study aimed at providing a better knowledge of the fate of MET through the wastewater treatment plants. The study addressed two different issues: (1) optimization of the analytical methods for MET determination in both liquid and sludge phases, focusing on the effects of potentially interfering substances and (2) investigation on the behaviour of MET in the biological treatment process, with specific concern for the biomass activity at different drug concentrations. Results of the study on issue 1 highlighted that the applied analytical method for MET determination (UPLC-MS/MS) is affected by the main components of wastewater for about 9-23%, which is comparable with the uncertainties of the method (about +/- 28%). The method showed also to be repeatable and reliable (recovery >75%; repeatability <10-15%; bias uncertainty <30%), and relatively easy-to-use. Therefore, it can be considered suitable for measurements on routine base in the WWTPs. Batch tests conducted to address issue 2 showed total removal of 84, 90, and 96% at 50, 100, and 200ng/L initial MET concentration, respectively, for a contact time of 6h. The removal process was mainly ascribed to the biological activity of both heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria. The pseudo first-order kinetic model provided the best fitting of the experimental data of the overall biological processes at all the tested concentrations. Furthermore, the respirometric tests showed that MET does not induce any inhibition. Adsorption of MET on activated sludge was always very low.

AB Prednisolone is a widely prescribed synthetic glucocorticoid and stated to be toxic to a number of non-target aquatic organisms. Its extensive consumption generates environmental concern due to its detection in wastewater samples at concentrations ranged from ng/L to g/L that requests the application of suitable degradation processes. Regarding the actual treatment options, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are presented as a viable alternative. In this work, the comparison in terms of pollutant removal and energetic efficiencies, between different AOPs such as Fenton (F), photo-Fenton (UV/F), photolysis (UV), and hydrogen peroxide/photolysis (UV/H2O2), was carried out. Light diode emission (LED) was the selected source to provide the UV radiation. The UV/F process revealed the best performance, reaching high levels of both degradation and mineralization with low energy consumption. Its optimization was conducted and the operational parameters were iron and H2O2 concentrations and the working volume. Using the response surface methodology with the Box-Behnken design, the effect of independent variables and their interactions on the process response were effectively evaluated. Different responses were analyzed taking into account the prednisolone removal (TOC and drug abatements) and the energy consumptions associated. The obtained model showed an improvement of the UV/F process when treating smaller volumes and when adding high concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+. The validation of this model was successfully carried out, having only 5% of discrepancy between the model and the experimental results. Finally, the performance of the process when having a real wastewater matrix was also tested, achieving complete mineralization and detoxification after 8h. In addition, prednisolone degradation products were identified. Finally, the obtained low energy permitted to confirm the viability of the process.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is widely used in the world as anti-inflammatory drug, which posed health risk to the environment. A bacterium capable of degrading IBU was isolated from activated sludge in a sewage treatment plant. According to its morphological, physiologic, and biochemical characteristics, as well as 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the strain was identified as Serratia marcescens BL1 (BL1). Degradation of IBU required the presence of primary substrate. After a five-day cultivation with yeast powder at 30 degrees C and pH 7, the highest degradation (93.47%+/- 2.37%) was achieved. The process of BL1 degrading IBU followed first-order reaction kinetics. The BL1 strain was applied to a small biological aerated filter (BAF) device to form a biofilm with activated sludge. IBU removal by the BAF was consistent with the results of static tests. The removal of IBU was 32.01% to 44.04% higher than for a BAF without BL1. The indigenous bacterial community was able to effectively remove CODMn (permanganate index) and ammonia nitrogen in the presence of BL1.

AB Antioxidants (melanoidins and polyphenols) present in sugarcane molasses distillery wastewater are not readily biodegradable. However, these compounds exhibit potential physiological properties which may be tapped for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Recovery of these compounds from distillery wastewater could thus lead to products of commercial interest while improving the conventional biological (anaerobic) treatment step. Three processes viz. ultrafiltration (UF), adsorption-desorption and solvent extraction were investigated for antioxidants recovery from distillery wastewater and selected fractions were subjected to biomethanation (anaerobic digestion). The effect of different adsorbents and solvents as well as operational parameters on antioxidants recovery was studied and the separated fractions were analyzed for melanoidins content, polyphenols content and antioxidant activity. UF through 100 kDa membrane resulted in an antioxidant rich retentate (245 mM TEAC) but the permeability was low. Solvent extraction with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) led to 113 mM TEAC recovery in organic phase. Adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by desorption with acidified ethanol enabled antioxidants recovery of 192 mM TEAC. Antioxidant removal from the wastewater improves biomethanation. Overall, adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by biomethanation (74% COD reduction and 71% methane in biogas within 25 days) appears to be promising for improving the existing biomethanation facility while recovering antioxidants with potential commercial value. Further analysis of the antioxidants fraction is required to ascertain the content of specific commercially viable polyphenols.

AB Although many studies have addressed the ability of subsurface filtration systems to remove emerging contaminants from wastewater at micro- and mesocosm-scale, little is known about their performance on full-scale wastewater treatment facilities. To understand better how effective these systems can be for municipal wastewater polishing, we assessed the ability of a full-scale lagoon-subsurface filter system located in Dunnottar, Manitoba, Canada, to attenuate regulatory wastewater parameters, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and toxicity over the course of the discharge periods in 2015 and 2016 (June-October). Pharmaceuticals included beta-blockers, anticonvulsant drugs, and macrolide and sulfonamide antibiotics. Out of six consistently detected pharmaceuticals, four were efficiently removed through lagoon treatment (e.g. clarithromycin, metoprolol, propranolol), while two persisted to a certain extent (e.g. carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole), even after subsurface filtration. Attenuation was observed for nutrients with averages of 40% and 60% for ammonia and total phosphorus respectively within the filter, consistent with previous pilot-scale studies at this facility. Compliance with regulations for conventional wastewater parameters at the effluent was observed, as well as reduced acute toxicity (as determined by Microtox (R)) from the primary lagoon to the effluent, and little likelihood of acute toxicity in receiving waters. Our results suggest that first, the full-scale system has an overall similar performance when compared to the previously studied pilot-scale system; second, there was no apparent effect of acclimation on the attenuation of studied contaminants or toxicity; and finally, the concentrations of contaminants do not appear to pose an acute risk for aquatic species in the receiving environment.

In this study, a series of anaerobic evaluation tests on pharmaceutical wastewater from different operating units was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion, and the results indicated that the key refractory factor for anaerobic treatment of this wastewater was the high sulfate concentration. A laboratory-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated for 195 days to investigate the effects of the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), organic loading rate (OLR), and COD/SO4 2-ratio on the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in pharmaceutical wastewater and the process performance. The electron flow indicated that methanogenesis was still the dominant reaction although sulfidogenesis was enhanced with a stepwise decrease in the influent COD/SO4 2-ratio. For the treated sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater, a COD of 4983 mg/L (diluted by 50%), OLR of 2.5 kg COD/(m 3 $ d), and COD/SO4 2-ratio of more than 5 were suitable for practical applications. The recovery performance indicated that the system could resume operation quickly even if production was halted for a few days.

AB The analytes such as ascorbic acid (AA) present in Sechium edule were extracted (294 mg AA kg(-1) fruit) in an aqueous media for its potential application for Ag-doping onto wurtzite ZnO. The bandgap of ZnO was decreased to 2.85 eV at the optimal Ag-loading of 1.18% (w/w) against 3.13 eV for the control catalyst without using the analytes and, the commercial AA only could reduce the bandgap to 2.91 eV. The saturation photo-electrochemical current density (46.68 mA cm(-2))at E-anode >= 0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl was almost double than pristine ZnO under visible light illumination (lambda(mean) = 525 nm, 18 K lux) and, the current density was insignificant in the dark. The doped catalyst exhibited the maximum 79.5% degradation (71% COD removal) of an anti-analgesic drug, dipyrone (100 mu g L-1 dipyrone, catalyst 100 mg L-1) resulted from the formation of O-2(center dot-) radical (g-factor of 2.002-2.008) and paramagnetic oxygen vacancies (g-factor of 2.020) and, no effect of dye-sensitization was noted. The highest quantum yield was found to be 34.7%. The catalyst loss was 6% after the fourth cycle and the dipyrone degradation was reduced to 70.8%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The selective extraction and concentration of salt from coal gasification brine (CGB) by nanofiltration membranes is a promising technology to achieve near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification wastewater. To investigate the feasibility of recovery of salts and the interaction of organic compounds, multivalent ions and monovalent ions on the rejection ratio, three nanofiltration membranes (OWNF1, NF270 and Desal-5 DK) with an 1812 spiral-wound module were used in crossflow filtration. The rejection mechanism was analyzed by comparing the rejection performance as a function of the operation pressure (increasing from 1.0 MPa to 2.5 MPa), the concentration (increasing from 10,000 mg/L to 25,000 mg/L) and pH values (increasing from 3.0 to 10.0). The concentrations of anions and cations were determined using an ion chromatographic analyzer and an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer, respectively. The results show that the rejection of sulfate and the chemical oxygen demand were higher than 92.12% and 78.84%, respectively, at appropriate operation, while negative rejection of chloride was observed in the CGB. The decreasing rejection of organic compounds was due to swelling of the membrane pore in high-concentration solutions. Meanwhile, the organic compounds weakened the negative charge of the membrane active layer, consequently decreasing the ion rejection. More than 85% of the sodium chloride could be recovered, indicating that this technology is suitable for resource recovery from CGB and near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification industry.

AB Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a simple yet effective treatment technology that uses the natural soil and aquifer media to remove various pollutants from river water during induced infiltration of river water to pumping wells. However, RBF may not be capable of fully removing chemicals of emerging concern such as personal care products, household chemicals, and pharmaceutically active compounds. As a result, additional treatment systems may be needed. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) may be one of the options to further improve water quality. In other instances, advanced oxidative treatment of the bank filtrate prior to ASR may also further improve quality. In RBF-ASR coupled systems, bank filtrate is again injected into the aquifer, stored, and then pumped out. A major application for coupling RBF and ASR is to store water to meet peak demands. This is applicable in developed and developing countries to cope with high demand during droughts.

AB Wastewaters are considered as a significant source of pathogenic microorganisms and wide spectrum of various compounds. In this study the capsulation of ferrate using 3D printing and its application for the degradation of selected pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and its metabolites in real wastewater from the effluent of urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Petrzalka and Psychiatric clinic was investigated.
   In the first part of the study, the stability of capsules made from various polymeric materials was tested. The best results were found in the case of the laboratory 3D-printed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) capsules where high long-term stability of ferrate was observed. In this type of capsules ferrate can be stored at ambient conditions more than one month without significant decrease of its degradation efficiency.
   In the next part of the study the ability of ferrate capsulated in 3D printed PVA capsules to oxidize various micropollutants present in real wastewater was tested. The best efficiency was achieved for clarithromycin, azithromycin, valsartan, diclofenac, atenolol and carbamazepine (over 80%). However, some of the tested compounds, such as caffeine, tramadol, and venlafaxine were only partially oxidized. It was also found that an increase of the amount of capsulated ferrate did not always lead to a significant increase of degradation efficiency. Capsulation of ferrate used in our research gives, therefore, the possibility not only to store but also to instantly apply ferrate in emergency situations and even in those environments where pure ferrate is rapidly decomposed.

ID ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES; DEGRADATION
AB The applications of novel Fe-TiO2 composite capable of incorporating in-situ dual effect (photocatalysis and photo-Fenton) have been studied for the treatment of real pharmaceutical effluent using batch and continuous reactors. The treatment time was reduced to a great extent using these novel composite beads along with significant reduction in COD (83%). Coagulation using FeCl3 as a coagulating agent was used as a pre-treatment step prior to in-situ dual process. The parametric optimization in case of in-situ dual process was carried out in batch mode under artificial UV-A irradiations. The biodegradability index (BOD5/COD) of wastewater became 0.71 from 0.172 after 5 h of treatment via in-situ dual process. The intermediates present in the real wastewater before and after the treatment process, were carefully identified through GC-MS analysis based on which a tentative degradation mechanism for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater has been proposed. The treated wastewater was found to be completely non-toxic as confirmed through cyto-toxicity as well as acute toxicity analysis. The field-scale applications of fixed-bed in-situ dual process using Fe-TiO2 composite beads were validated from successful treatment (80% COD reduction) of real wastewater (5 L) in less than 120 min in a pilot-scale once-though cascade reactor under natural solar irradiations. Moreover, Fe-TiO2 composite beads represented an outstanding recyclability efficiency (> 70 recycles) without depicting any significant reduction in their activity as confirmed through various characterization techniques.

AB TAML activators enable unprecedented, rapid, ultradilute oxidation catalysis where substrate inhibitions might seem improbable. Nevertheless, while TAML/H2O2 rapidly degrades the drug propranolol, a micropollutant (MP) of broad concern, propranolol is shown to inhibit its own destruction under concentration conditions amenable to kinetics studies ([propranolol] = 50 mu M). Substrate inhibition manifests as a decrease in the second-order rate constant k(I) for H2O2 oxidation of the resting Fe-III-TAML (RC) to the activated catalyst (AC), while the second-order rate constant k(II) for attack of AC on propranolol is unaffected. This kinetics signature has been utilized to develop a general approach for quantifying substrate inhibitions. Fragile adducts [propranolol, TAML] have been isolated and subjected to ESI-MS, florescence, UV-vis, FTIR, H-1 NMR, and IC examination and DFT calculations. Propranolol binds to Fe-III-TAMLs via combinations of noncovalent hydrophobic, coordinative, hydrogen bonding, and Coulombic interactions. Across four studied TAMLs under like conditions, propranolol reduced k(I) 4-32-fold (pH 7, 25 degrees C) indicating that substrate inhibition is controllable by TAML design. However, based on the measured k(I) and calculated equilibrium constant K for propranolol-TAML binding, it is possible to project the impact on k(I) of reducing [propranolol] from 50 mu M to the ultradilute regime typical of MP contaminated waters (<= 2 ppb, <= 7 nM for propranolol) where inhibition nearly vanishes. Projecting from 50 mu M to higher concentrations, propranolol completely inhibits its own oxidation before reaching mM concentrations. This study is consistent with prior experimental findings that substrate inhibition does not impede TAML/H2O2 destruction of propranolol in London wastewater while giving a substrate inhibition assessment tool for use in the new field of ultradilute oxidation catalysis.

AB In this work, we innovatively applied the 3D amperometry detection, coupled to liquid chromatography, for the determination of a mixture of chromatographically unresolved compounds (two herbicides-monuron and bentazon, one drug-propranolol and the main metabolite of an antiepileptic drug-5-(4MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin). Exploiting the post-chromatographic current integration, a scanning waveform was successfully applied to explore a wide range of potentials (0.0-1.3 V) to find the peculiar oxidative potential value for each compound. This approach allowed us to obtain 3D chromatograms (elution time vs potential vs current) in which coeluted species could be clearly distinguished. Quantitation was easily obtained by extraction of 2D chromatograms (elution time vs integrated current), from the 3D ones, at the optimised waveform time ranges (800-1,000 msec and 1,500-1,700 msec, corresponding to 0.6-0.8 V and 1.0-1.2, respectively). Validation of the proposed 3D amperometry method was performed in terms of linearity, limits of detection and quantitation and repeatability. Matrix effect was studied by statistical treatment on a wastewater effluent. By coupling an on-line solid phase extraction step prior to separation and detection by 3D amperometry, detection limits were significantly reduced (57 ng/L for bentazon, with recovery yields of 82.9 +/- 10.9%). It is worth mentioning that this value fully satisfies the requirements of the 98/83/CE directive for the determination of bentazon in groundwater.

AB Internal concentrations link external exposure to the potential effect, as they reflect what the organisms actually take up and experience physiologically. In this study, we investigated whether frequently detected risk-driving substances in water were found in the exposed organisms and if they are classified the same based on the whole body internal concentrations. Field gammarids were collected upstream and downstream of ten wastewater treatment plants in mixed land use catchments. The sampling was conducted in autumn and winter, during low flow conditions when diffuse agricultural input was reduced. The field study was complemented with laboratory and flume experiments to determine the bioaccumulation potentials of selected substances. For 32 substances, apparent bioaccumulation factors in gammarids were determined for the first time. With a sensitive multiresidue method based on online-solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, we detected 63 (semi-) polar organic substances in the field gammarids, showing higher concentrations downstream than upstream. Interestingly, neonicotinoids, which are particularly toxic toward invertebrates, were frequently detected and were further determined as major contributors to the toxic pressure based on the toxic unit approach integrating internal concentration and toxic potency. The total toxic pressure based on internal concentrations was substantially higher compared to when external concentrations were used. Thus, internal concentrations may add more value to the current environmental risk assessment that is typically based solely on external exposure.

AB Our research investigated the hormesis effect of cefradine on the specific growth rates (mu) of single-celled algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) from aqueous solutions. We found the specific growth rate of C. reinhardtii slightly increased with cefradine concentrations within the range 0.5-10 mg/L. Effects of algae density, initial solution pH, and temperature on the adsorption batch assays were investigated. The optimum conditions for cefradine adsorption occurred at a density of 5 x 10(6) algae cells/mL, a solution pH of 7.0, and a temperature of 25.0 degrees C. A Box-ehnken design was employed to evaluate correlations between influential factors and cefradine adsorption. The results showed a significant interaction between algae density and temperature. The maximum removal rate could reach 50.13% under the optimal conditions. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms were explored through Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamics. The results suggested that the adsorption process was monolayer, spontaneous, and endothermic with an increase in randomness at the algae solution interface, which followed a pseudo-second-order model. All the data indicated that the alga performed a better removal capacity in the antibiotic-containing wastewater treatment process. This study lays the groundwork for a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between cefradine and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in water solutions under dark condition.

AB The photodegradation and phytotoxicity of the pharmaceutical antibiotic, sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and the azo-dye reactive-red-194 (RR194) under visible-light irradiation of TiO2 nanoparticles modified by silver and zirconium was investigated. The results indicated that sulphamethoxazole and its toxic degradation by product, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole and RR-194 could be degraded efficiently by the co-doped Zr/Ag-TiO2 catalyst. PL studies and ROS generation results suggested that the effective charge separation was carried out while irradiation of the modified TiO2 nanoparticles. Phytotoxicity tests demonstrated lower percentage of germination in P. vulgaris (40%), V. radiata (30%) and P. lunatus (30%) of the seeds treated with 50 ppm of SMX, compared to the seeds treated with the degradation products (100%). The results with 50 ppm of RR-194 also showed lower percentage of germination in P. vulgaris (40%), V. radiata (50%) and P. lunatus (30%) compared to the degradation products (100%). Furthermore, significant increase in root and shoot development was observed in the seeds treated with the degraded products when compared with SMX and RR-194. Overall, this study contributes to further understanding the photodegradation mechanisms, degradation products and environmental fate of SMX and RR-194 in water which helps in the evaluation and mitigation of the environmental risk of SMX and RR-194 for water reuse and crop irrigation.

AB The extent of sulfadiazine (SDZ) removal via photo-degradation (UV-C), photocatalysis with TiO2 (UV-C/TiO2) and photo-persulfate-oxidation (UV-C/PS) was investigated in a batch reactor under different UV-C power levels (i.e. 14, 28, 42 and 56 W). Moreover, effects of suspended/immobilized catalyst, i.e. TiO2 slurry/TiO2 supported on granular activated carbon (GAC-TiO2), on SDZ removal and corresponding SDZ degradation kinetics under different catalyst loading (1-6 g/L) were explored. Around 41.7% SDZ removal was observed after 120 min in UV-C system at the highest power level, i.e. 56 W. On the other hand, photocatalysis with TiO2 and GAC-TiO2 has shown better SDZ removal than photo-degradation. In UV-C/TiO2 (4 g/L and 28 W) and UV-C/GAC-TiO2 (5 g/L and 28 W) systems, SDZ removals were 91.8% after 120 min and 100% after 60 min, respectively; however, TOC analysis has revealed that 45.4% and 60.8% SDZ was mineralized in these systems, respectively. In UV-C/PS system, near complete degradation of SDZ (99.8%) was observed within 10 min under 50 mg/L of PS and 28 W UV illumination. On the other hand, complete SDZ removal was observed in PS alone system at a dosage of 1000 mg/L but the formation of SO42- was found to be a drawback. In photolysis and photocatalysis systems, SDZ removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics whereas the kinetics followed pseudo-second-order in UV-C/PS system. The comparison of electrical energy consumed (E-EO) in different systems revealed that UV-C/ GAC-TiO2 and UV-C/PS system were energy efficient compared with other systems. The LC-MS analysis has confirmed the cleavage of C-N bonds in the pyrimidine ring followed by S-N bonds in the sulfonyl group, which was found to be the major degradation pathway of SDZ.

AB The concentration and recovery of the high-added value phenolic fraction from two-phase olive mill wastewater and the simultaneous effluent treatment by a novel micro/ultra/nanocentrifugation membrane process assessment is addressed, permitting to gather information for a correct and effective screening procedure for the adequate membrane election (MF-UF-loose NF) for the target. Phenolic compounds are the major factor of phytotoxicity of these effluents, but on the other hand they present high antioxidant properties that makes them very relevant for food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. The selection of a membrane MWCO between 100 kDa and 0.45 mu m permitted the complete transfer of the phenolic fraction to the permeate, whereas below 3 kDa they would be transferred to the concentrate stream instead, with similar to 60% COD reduction and EC lowered to 551-662 mu S cm(-1) in the final treated stream ensured, sensibly improving the effluent quality. This would provide a purified effluent with good salinity standards according to the indications given by the FAO for irrigation reuse. This procedure could be quick and reliable for the assessment of the adequate membrane needed for a particular purification process, in contrast with long-term, time consuming common bench-scale procedures.

AB The endocrine disrupting micropollutant tamoxifen can induce several effects on aquatic organisms. It is introduced into the environment mainly by wastewater treatment plant effluents. To reduce the discharge of micropollutants into surface waters, ozonation can be used as additional wastewater treatment option. For only few transformation products (TPs) formed by ozonation ecotoxicological data are available. To enable an initial estimation of ecotoxicological potentials of the TPs formed after the ozonation of tamoxifen, acute toxicity (immobilization) to Daphnia magna and green algae growth inhibition using Desmodesmus subspicatus were determined for several ozone doses spiked at pH 3 and pH 7. The initial immobilization of D. magna by tamoxifen was not further observed after ozonation. In contrast, the green algae growth inhibition increased due to ozonation of tamoxifen. Overall, five transformation products were observed. For three TPs, positive correlations of green algae growth inhibition and peak area were determined, whereas two TPs do not induce the residual effects. Based on our observations, TP 270 can be assumed as most potent of the formed TPs concerning green algae growth inhibition. Since the effect is not induced by formed N-oxides, green algae growth inhibition could be reduced by sufficient ozone exposure during wastewater treatment.

AB Through then release of effluents, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a major pollution point sources for pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in water bodies. The combination of a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter coupled with an ultrafiltration (LW unit was evaluated as an advanced treatment for PhACs removal at pilot scale. The BAC-UF pilot plant was monitored for one year. The biological activity of the biofilm that developed on the granular activated carbon (GAC) particles and the contribution of this biofilm to the overall removal of PhACs were evaluated. Two different phases were observed during the long-term monitoring of PhACs removal. During the first 9200 bed volumes (BV; i.e., before GAC saturation), 89, 78, 83 and 79% of beta-blockers, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics and a mix of other therapeutic groups were removed, respectively. The second phase was characterized by deterioration of the overall performances during the period between 9200 and 13,800 BV. To quantify the respective contribution of adsorption and biodegradation, a lab scale setup was operated for four months and highlighted the essential role played by GAC in biofiltration units. Physical adsorption was indeed the main removal mechanism. Nevertheless, a significant contribution due to biological activity was detected for some PhACs. The biofilm contributed to the removal of 22, 25, 30, 32 and 35% of ciprofloxacin, bezafibrate, ofloxacin, azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The occurrence of 36 pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water of the Xiangjiang River was investigated in twoseasons (n=38). Twenty-five of these compoundswere detected, with cefotaxime (maximum concentration 830 ng L-1) the most abundant compound followed by amoxicillin (maximum concentration 710 ng L-1). The spatiotemporal distribution was observed; indicating that pollution hotspots were mostly located in economically developed and densely populated regions such as Changsha City. Lower concentrations were found in summer than winter, which may be attributed to the dilution effect of a flood event and higher water temperatures. The distribution of pharmaceuticals was significantly correlated with temperature and ammonia nitrogen content. A principal component analysis-multiple linear regression model estimated that domestic sewage was the main source of pharmaceuticals, although the source composition varied among different sampling sites. Risk assessment was conducted using both individual and mixture models for preliminary identification of potential hazards. Sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, and azithromycin posed a high risk to algae, while sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and erythromycin-H2O showed a medium risk to invertebrates. Moreover, the mixture risk quotients calculated using a concentration additionmodel ranged from 0.31 to 9.60 in winter, and from 0.06 to 0.61 in summer, indicating a potential risk to the aquatic environment. This study provides scientific support to policy-makers to establish contaminant management priorities and enriches the global data on emerging contaminants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities (PMFs) previously have been identified as important sources of pharmaceuticals to the environment. Yet few studies are available to establish the influence of PMFs on the pharmaceutical source contribution to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and waterways at the national scale. Consequently, a national network of 13 WWTPs receiving PMF discharges, six WWTPs with no PMF input, and one WWTP that transitioned through a PMF closure were selected from across the United States to assess the influence of PMF inputs on pharmaceutical loading to WWTPs. Effluent samples were analyzed for 120 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical degradates. Of these, 33 pharmaceuticals had concentrations substantially higher in PMF-influenced effluent (maximum 555,000 ng/L) compared to effluent from control sites (maximum 175 ng/L). Concentrations in WWTP receiving PMF input are variable, as discharges from PMFs are episodic, indicating that production activities can vary substantially over relatively short (several months) periods and have the potential to rapidly transition to other pharmaceutical products. Results show that PMFs are an important, national-scale source of pharmaceuticals to the environment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), wastewater indicators (WWIs), and pesticides (herein, Contaminants of Emerging Concern [CECs]) have been documented in surface waters throughout the world and have associated risks to aquatic life. While much research has focused on temperate and urbanized watersheds, less is known about CEC presence in semi-arid landscapes, where water availability is limited and populations are low. CEC presence in water and sediment is reported tot 21 sites in eight U.S. national parks in the northern Colorado Plateau region. From 2012 to 2016, at least one PPCP and/or WWI was detected at most sites on over half of sampling visits, indicating that CECs are not uncommon even in isolated areas. CEC detections were generally fewer and at lower concentrations than in urbanized or agricultural watersheds. Consistent with studies from other U.S. regions, the most frequently detected CECs in this study include DEET, caffeine, organophosphorus flame retardants, and bisphenol A in water and fecal indicators and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediment. Maximum concentrations in this study were generally below available water quality benchmarks, sediment quality guidelines, and risk assessment thresholds associated with vertebrates. Additional work is needed to assess the potential activity of hormones, which had high reporting limits in our study, and potential bioactivity of environmental concentrations for invertebrates, microbial communities, and algae. Potential sources of CEC contamination include upstream wastewater effluent discharges and National Park Service invasive-plant-control herbicide applications. CEC occurrence patterns and similarities between continuous and isolated flow locations suggest that direct contamination from individual visitors may also occur. While our data indicate there is little aquatic health risk associated with CECs at our sites, our results demonstrate the ubiquity of CECs on the landscape and a continued need for public outreach concerning resource-use ethics and the potential effects of upstream development.

AB The present work discusses the efficiency of the electrodialytic (ED) process to remove emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) from effluent. The ED process was carried out in a cell of two-compartments (2 C-cell) with effluent in either the anode or cathode compartment, separated from the electrolyte compartment through an anion or a cation exchange membrane (AEM and CEM, respectively). As effluent destination might be soil irrigation, and having in mind the nutrient recycling, phosphorus was also monitored in the process.
   The ED removals showed to be dependent of EOCs characteristics and cell design. Removals were higher when using an AEM (60-72%) than a CEM (8-63%), except for caffeine when the effluent was placed in the cathode, that did not show any removal. When using an AEM with the effluent placed in the anode compartment, all the EOCs (including caffeine) were removed between 57-72%, mainly through electrodegradation phenomena.
   Regarding phosphorus, a polarity switch may be done to a 2 C-cell with a AEM, depending on the effluent final use. This technology is still in its first steps and, in both cases, further optimization of ED parameters is needed. Still, this technological innovation and cross-cutting research envisages the promotion of economic, social and environmental benefits.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) offers to be a very promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from contaminated wastewater, and with the recent developments in FO membranes, the effect of both a higher water flux and reverse salt flux on the rejection of TrOCs needs to be explored. In this study two novel thin-film composite (TFC) membranes with greater water permeability and selectivity than the benchmark cellulose tri-acetate (CTA) membrane were compared at bench-scale in terms of TrOCs permeability. By probing the solute-membrane interactions that dictate the transport of TrOCs through the two membranes in the absence and presence of a draw solution, several conclusions were drawn. Firstly, steric hindrance is the main TrOCs transport-limiting mechanism through TFC membranes unless the negative membrane surface charge is significant, in which case, electrostatic interactions can dominate over steric hindrance. Secondly, the increase in ionic strength induced by the draw solution in the vicinity of and perhaps inside the membrane seems to favour the rejection of TrOCs by "shrinking" the membrane pores or by "shielding" the negative surface charge. Lastly, during FO operation, solute concentration polarisation becomes detrimental when working at high water fluxes, whereas the reverse solute flux has no direct impact on the transport of TrOCs through the membrane.

AB The widely utilization of pharmaceutical and personal care products in the pharmaceutical therapies and agricultural husbandry has led to the worldwide pollution in the environment. However, effective purification of water contaminated by tetracycline (TC) remains a great challenge. Here, 2-dimensional (2D) zeolitic imidazolate framework-L (ZIF-L) nanoflakes with a leaf-like morphology, which could selectively adsorb TC, was successfully synthesized in aqueous media at room temperature. The removal efficiency of ZIF-L powder for TC from pharmaceutical wastewaters was greatly influenced by the solution pH, contact time, temperature and solution concentration. In order to solve these problems, ZIF-L nanoflakes were fabricated on the surface of polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified nylon microporous filter to form a 3-dimensional (3D) composite film by vacuum filtration. The result showed that this novel material could effectively remove about 99.0% of TC from pharmaceutical wastewater. Furthermore, ZIF-L film not only excluded the effects of solution pH, contact time, temperature and solution concentration on the adsorption capacity for TC, but also had a high flux (1639 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)), making it suitable for a large-scale application. The probable adsorption mechanism was investigated and suggested.

AB In this work, we present an integrated dynamic cross-flow electro-Fenton (DCF-EF) system for the treatment of the pharmaceutical, acetaminophen (paracetamol), in aqueous medium. A carbonaceous electrocatalytic membrane was used as cathode, allowing the continuous production of H2O2 during EF in dynamic filtration mode. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) and current were the two driving forces of the system, whose influence strongly affected the global efficiency. It was found that H2O2 production from the electrochemical reduction of dissolved O-2 was favoured at higher TMP values as a consequence of an increase of the O-2 partial pressure, and higher H2O2 amounts entailed an increase in the efficiency of the process. Current also had a positive effect on H2O2 production and acetaminophen degradation and mineralization efficiencies up to an optimal value. Complete degradation of the drug and 44% mineralization were achieved under optimal conditions (2.0 bar and 100 mA). On the other hand, the results pointed out that the use of a Ti4O7 rod as counter electrode (anode) had an important contribution to the mineralization of the acetaminophen's solutions owing to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) on its surface, which highlighted the oxidative power of this anode material. The oxidation mechanisms involved during the process were assessed by electrochemical measurements with both electrodes (carbon membrane and Ti4O7 rod), and a degradation pathway for paracetamol oxidation was proposed based on the identification of the main aromatic and aliphatic degradation by-products. This DCF-EF process is presented as a potential alternative for water treatment and reuse in which the integration of membrane and electrochemical technologies brings together separation science and advanced oxidation.

AB 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) is one of the most important phenolic compounds in various industries. Different technologies have been applied for 4-CP degradation in aquatic environment. Current study is focused on 4-CP degradation by the combination of UV and MnO2 for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to degrade 4-CP. MnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET). The effects of operational parameters were evaluated and their results indicated the highest performance in pH = 4.0, 1 mM PMS and 0.25 g/L MnO2. Complete degradation of 4-CP during 30 min was a representative of high performance of UV/MnO2/PMS. Kinetic study showed that the co-activation of PMS by MnO2 and UV had a synergistic effect on 4-CP degradation. MnO2 could keep its performance at least 4th cycle while Mn leaching was negligible. Bicarbonate and hydrogen phosphate ions suppressed the performance of the process in degradation of 4-CP whereas no change was observed in the presence of chloride ions. Quenching experiments showed that hydroxyl radical was dominant radical for 4-CP degradation. The results of toxicity and biodegradability tests indicated that treated sample by UV/MnO2/PMS process was relatively non-toxic and easy biodegradable. The function of UV/MnO2/PMS system for treatment of real industrial wastewaters (pharmaceutical and petrochemical wastewaters) was tested. Finally, it was concluded that hybrid activation of PMS can be a new perspective for PMS-based processes to treat industrial wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metoprolol (MPL) is a chiral beta-blocker ubiquitously detected in various environments due to its low to moderate removal in wastewater treatment plants. This study was conducted to test the potential of using microalgae to degrade emerging contaminant MPL and to characterize the enantiomeric enrichment during MPL degradation by microalgae. The results showed that PO43--P, NO3--N and MPL could be simultaneously removed in the synthetic effluent by the targeted microalgae species, indicating microalgae were promising in wastewater treatment. Stereoselectivity was observed during MPL degradation by microalgae, with R-form enrichment. A marginal linear relationship between MPL degradation and enantiomeric enrichment was observed, implying that the enantiomeric tool, used as a quantitative indicator of biodegradation, could possibly be applied in MPL degradation by microalgae. An efficient liquid chromatograph tandem high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) chiral analytical method was developed to identify transformation products (TPs). The results showed that MS/MS spectral similarity networking could be used as a powerful tool to quickly identify unknown TPs. A total of 6 pairs of chiral TPs were identified, among which two new TPs of MPL including hydroxy{4-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]phenyl}acetic acid (alpha-HMPLA) and 4-[2-Hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]benzaldehyde (DMPLD) were firstly reported, and proposed transformation pathways of MPL by microalgae were given. Considering the paired TPs detected and that the degradation of the two enantiomers followed first order kinetics, the two enantiomers likely had the same degradation mechanism.

AB Metal-free catalysis for green degradation of aqueous organic pollutants has caused extensive concern in recent years. In this study, hexagonally-ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) was applied to activate persulfate (PS) for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) with superior removal rate of 90% in 20 min. The high catalytic efficiency was probably ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer resulting from the large adsorption capacity of CMK-3. It was found that specific surface areas (SSA), defective sites and functional groups on the activator were highly related to its catalytic efficiency and passivadon. Compared to other nanocarbons, CMK-3 had better reusability due to its ordered mesoporous structure with large SSA and high defective degrees. For the first time, a two-pathway mechanism was proposed for metal-free activation process of PS, indicating that radical and nonradical oxidation worked together in PS activation for complete 2,4-DCP decomposition, and non-radical pathway played a dominant role while radical pathway was critical in accelerating the reaction. center dot OH, SO(4)(center dot-)and O-2(center dot)- all took part in the radical oxidation process, in which the contribution of center dot OH was dominant. Besides, high decomposition efficiency was also achieved in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by the CMK-3/PS system. This research proposed a new electron transfer mechanism for metal-free activation process of PS, which can provide a theoretical support for further studies.

AB Although Ag-containing semiconductors as effective photocatalysts have attracted significant concern because of the unique photosensitivity, their visible-light photocatalytic activities are still not satisfactory, and usually suffer from photocorrosion. In this study, cubic-like reduced graphene oxide/AgIn5S8 (rGO/AIS) nanocomposites were fabricated via a mild solvothermal method, and employed to photodegrade nitrophenols (2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol) and dispose of real pharmaceutical wastewater under visible-light illumination. All the rGO/AIS nanocomposites exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than that of pure AIS, and the photocatalytic activities of rGO/AIS is related with different rGO content. The optimized 1% rGO/AIS displayed the highest photocatalytic activities with 91% 4NP removal and 93.2% 2NP removal efficiency in 120 min, which can be ascribed to the largest specific surface area, enhanced light absorption, as well as the most efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Most importantly, H2O2 aided photocatalysis of 1% rGO/AIS can effectively deal with real pharmaceutical industry wastewater with 89% COD removal. Additionally, 1% rGO/AIS exhibits excellent reusability in four cycles due to its anti-photocorrosion ability, stable crystal structure, surface composition and chemical valence state. The above results open up new horizons for improving the photocatalytic activity and stability of AIS, providing a green method for processing actual pharmaceutical wastewater references.

AB Due to the wide use, bisphenol A (BPA) has been detected frequently in the aquatic environment. However, the information on the distribution of BPA transformation products is limited. In this study, we investigated two BPA transformation products, namely bisphenol A monomethyl ether (BPA-MME) and bisphenol A dimethyl ether (BPA-DME). This study revealed that both transformation products were widely detected in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as in surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary with higher detected concentrations and detection frequencies for BPA-DME. Temporal variations were observed in a WWTP based on a five-year sampling campaign. Mass load of BPA and its transformation products was evaluated and results indicated the generation of BPA-MME and BPA-DME during the wastewater treatment processes, which contributed for 1.95% BPA removal. BPA and its transformation products were also widely detected in the surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary. Results indicated their additional generation in the surface water, since BPA-MME and BPA-DME in the surface river water were with similar level or even higher than effluent in WWTPs.

AB In this study, conditions of solid phase extraction (SPE) for determination of some antibiotics such as trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azythromycin, doxycycline, sulfamethazine, ciprofloxacin, chlortetracycline, sulfamethoxazole in wastewaters were optimized. After the optimum volume and pH of the sample were determined, the effect of the concentration of the compounds and matrix were investigated. The highest recovery rates for antibiotic compounds were determined between 82% and 105% in 200 mL sample volume and pH 2.5. Then, antibiotic compounds were investigated in influent and effluent samples taken from Konya Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant. The concentration of the antibiotics was detected range of 0.11-101 ng/L in influent waters and <dl-288 ng/L in effluent samples in wastewater treatment plant. Hazard quotients (HQs) of antibiotic compounds determined in WWTP effluents to evaluate the risk towards different aquatic organisms (algae, Daphnia magna and fish) were determined. Azythromycin for fish and erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin for algae posed a moderate risk while azythromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, oxytetracycline posed a high risk for algae in the receiving environment.

AB Atenolol (ATL) has been widely detected in wastewater and aquatic environment. Although satisfactory removal of ATL from wastewater could be achieved, the mineralization ratio is usually low, which may result in the accumulation of its transformation products in the effluent and cause additional ecological risk to the environment. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of heat activated persulfate (PS) in the removal of ATL from wastewater. Influencing factors including temperature, PS dosage, solution pH, existence of NO3-,Cl-,HCO(3)( )(-)and Suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA) were examined. Complete removal of ATL was achieved within 40 min at pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C by using 0.5 mM PS. Inhibitive effects of HCO3- and FA had been observed on ATL oxidation, which was increased with the increase of their concentration. Sulfate radical (SO4-center dot) was determined as the main reactive species by quenching experiment. Eight intermediates produced in ATL degradation were identified, and four degradation pathways were proposed based on the analysis of mass spectrum and frontier electron densities. The distribution of major intermediates was influenced by reaction temperature. Hydroxylation intermediates and deamidation intermediate were the most prominent at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. All intermediates were completely degraded in 40 min except P134 at 70 degrees C. Effective removal of TOC (74.12%) was achieved with 0.5 mM PS, pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C after 240 min. The results proved that heat activation of PS is a promising method to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nimesulide (Nim) degradation in ultrapure water (UW) and municipal sewage (MS) via UV-ABC/H2O2 was investigated. The variables included in the experimental design were time, initial Nim, and initial H2O2 concentrations. Resulting decreases in Nim concentration (monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a photodiode array detector operating at a maximum UV absorbance of 300 nm), mineralization (from total organic carbon (TOC) measurements), and ecotoxicity (assays employing the bioindicators Daphnia similis, Artemia salina, and Allium cepa) were also studied. Degradation rates of 90% or higher were found for 15-20 min reaction times, employing combinations of [H2O2] = 50-150 mgL(-1) and [Nim] = 8.5-15 mg L-1 prepared with MS. Mineralization rates of 70% and higher were attained within 60 min of reaction for [Nim] = 15 mg L-1 prepared in MS with [H2O2] = 100mgL(-1). Nim by-products were detected and possible degradation pathways proposed. Ecotoxicity evaluation using A. salina, D. similis, and A. cepa revealed that the treated samples had significantly lower toxicity. Exposure to treated samples resulted in survival rates of 79% for A. salina and over 90% for D. similis. No root growth inhibition was observed in A. cepa exposed to treated samples, whereas exposure to untreated samples inhibited root growth by 60%. Statistical analysis revealed elimination of cytotoxicity and reduction of genotoxicity against A. cepa. The results showed that the UV-ABC/H2O2 process can be employed as a pre- or post-treatment method to remove Nim from contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Boron nitride Nanosheets (BNNSs) was fabricated with a method of heating the mixture of boric acid and urea in N-2 atmosphere and used to remove estrone (E-1) from water. The obtained BNNSs exhibited a higher surface area of 896 m(2)/g, a large pore volume of 0.76 cm(3)/g, and only few layers (0.398 nm) with the boric acid and urea ratio of 1:80. The layer number of BNNSs decreased from 15 to 4 with the mole ratio of boric acid and urea decreasing from 1:20 to 1:80, which was identified by SEM, TEM, AFM and BET measurements. More importantly, BNNSs presented an outstanding adsorption performance for estrone with the adsorption capacity of 249.15 mg E-1/g BNNSs. The adsorption process could be best fitted by pseudo second-order kinetic model and the equilibrium data at different temperatures were well fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The thermodynamics analysis revealed that E-1 adsorption on BNNSs was spontaneous (Delta G = -29.33 kJ mol(-1)), enthalpy-retarded (Delta H = 29.75 kJ mol(-1)), entropy-driven (Delta S = 198.26 J mol(-1) K-1), and mostly chemical adsorption. The adsorption rates of E-1 in water were sharply enhanced with thinner BNNSs as absorbents and removal efficiency by BN-60 regenerated after 6 times was above 95%, it was shown that the surface areas, mesopores and remarkable structure played important roles in the adsorption process. The firmness of E-1 onto BNNSs and the stability of adsorption efficiency made BNNSs as a potential absorbent for efficient removal of E-1 from wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in wastewater (WW) and the impact on the receiving river. Samples were collected once per season over one year in the WW of a hospital, in the raw and treated WW of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as upstream and downstream from the release of WWTPs effluents into the Zenne River (Belgium). Culture dependent methods were used to quantify Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were quantified in both particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. Our results showed that WWTPs efficiently removed antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) regardless of its AR profile. The ARGs levels were the highest in the hospital WW and were significantly reduced in both WWTP5. However, ARB and ARGs abundances significantly increased into the Zenne River downstream from the WWTPs outfalls. The variation in the relative abundance of ARGs through WW treatment differed depending on the WWTP, fraction, and gene considered. The sun and sul2 genes in PAB fraction showed significantly higher relative abundances in the effluent compared to the influent of both WWTP5. This study demonstrated that WWTPs could be hotspots for AR spread with significant impacts on receiving freshwater ecosystems. This was the first comprehensive study investigating at the same time antibiotics occurrence, fecal bacteria indicators, heterotrophic bacterial communities, and ARGs (distinguishing PAB and FLB) to assess AR levels in WW and impacts on the receiving river.

AB In this study, a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 80 days to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing m-cresol (MC) and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA). The aim of the study is to investigate the performance and methane fermentation characteristics of AnMBR at different hydraulic retention time (HRT) (48, 36, 24, 18 and 12 h). The average total removal efficiencies of MC and IPA were 95%, 96% during the 80 days, which demonstrated that the AnMBR system performed well in the MC and IPA removal. The major volatile fatty acid (VFA) was found to be acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, besides, the VFA accumulated apparently when HRT decreased to 12 h. The decrease of HRT led to an increase of relative abundance of methanosarcina from 13 to 33% and a decrease in biogas yield from 0.19 to 0.05 L/gCOD(removal). The biogas production was found to increase dramatically at HRT of 36 h. The trend of methane content kept stable at this stage with the average value of 78.5% which higher than other HRTs. The investigation of methanogen community showed that methanosarcinaceae was always dominant acetoclastic methanogens and methanomicrobiales was the dominant hydrogen utilizers throughout the operational period. When the HRT dropped to 12 h, the growth of the methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales was observed, the amount of the methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales sharply increased. After the overall research, HRT of 36 h was chosen as the most suitable operating condition due to the comprehensively preferable performance and more economical. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated ZYSR67-Z(T), was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater sample collected from a chemical factory in Zhejiang, China. The strain was motile by a single polar flagellum and grew at 4-42 degrees C (optimum, 35 degrees C), pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum, 6.0) and 0-5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2.0%). Based on multilocus sequence analysis using 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD, the strain ZYSR67-Z(T) formed a distinct phylogenetic group in the genus Pseudomonas. The average nucleotide identity values between strain ZYSR67-Z(T) and the closely related 10 type strains of the Pseudomonas species were 75.8-78.6%. The in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values indicated that strain ZYSR67-Z(T) and the type strains of the Pseudomonas shared 21.4-23.1% DNA relatedness. The predominant isoprenoid quinone system was ubiquinone-9 while ubiquinone-8 was present in trace amounts. The major fatty acids (> 10%) identified were C-12(.0), C-16(.0), C-18.1 (omega)7(c) and summed features 3 (C-16(.1) (omega)7(c) and/or iso-C-15.0 2OH). The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content was 62.6 mol%. On the basis of morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, together with the results of phylogenetic analysis, strain ZYSR67-Z(T) was proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, named Pseudomonas pharmafabricae sp. nov.. The type strain is ZYSR67-Z(T) (=CGMCC 1.15498(T) = JCM 31306(T)).

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) and its major metabolites, hydroxyibuprofen (OH-IBU) and carboxyibuprofen (CA-IBU) were monitored from November 2015 to March 2017 at four full-scale constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow treating municipal wastewater in the Czech Republic. During the seven sampling campaigns, all three compounds were identified in high concentrations in the inflowing raw wastewater. The average inflow concentrations of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU amounted to 14.6, 18.3 and 36.4 mu g l(-1). The ratio between IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU is in agreement with the previously published results indicating that the ibuprofen metabolites occur in higher concentration in the raw wastewater than the parent compound with CA-IBU exhibiting the highest concentrations. The outflow concentrations off studied compounds decreased and removal amounted to 44.7%, 29.3% and 47.5% for IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU, respectively. The results are in line with general fact that ibuprofen and its metabolites are not removed with high efficiency in anoxic or anaerobic conditions and that OH-IBU is the least removed compound. The areal loadings of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU averaged 0.425, 0.574 and 0.999 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The annual loads of all forms of ibuprofen varied between 458 and 958 g year(-1) among four studies constructed wetlands.

AB Due to the activities inherent to medical care units, the hospital effluent released contains diverse contaminants such as tensoactives, disinfectants, metals, pharmaceutical products and chemical reagents, which are potentially toxic to the environment since they receive no treatment or are not effectively removed by such treatment before entering the drain. They are incorporated into municipal wastewater, eventually entering water bodies where they can have harmful effects on organisms and can result in ecological damage. To determine the toxicological risk induced by this type of eflluents, eight metals and 11 pharmaceuticals were quantified, in effluent from a hospital. Developmental effects, teratogenesis and oxidative stress induction were evaluated in two bioindicator species: Xenopus laevis and Lithobates catesbeianus. FETAX (frog embryo teratogenesis assay Xenopus) was used to obtain the median lethal concentration (LC50), effective concentration inducing 50% malformation (EC50), teratogenic index (TI), minimum concentration to inhibit growth (MCIG), and the types of malformation induced. Twenty oocytes in midblastula transition were exposed to six concentrations of effluent (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1%) and negative and positive (6-aminonicotinamide) controls. After 96 h of exposure, diverse biomarkers of oxidative damage were evaluated: hydroperoxide content, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. TI was 3.8 in X. laevis and 4.0 in L. catesbeianus, both exceed the value in the FETAX protocol (1.2), indicating that this effluent is teratogenic to both species. Growth inhibition was induced as well as diverse malformation including microcephaly, cardiac and facial edema, eye malformations, and notochord, tail, fin and gut damage. Significant differences relative to the control group were observed in both species with all biomarkers. This hospital effluent contains contaminants which represents a toxic risk, since these substances are teratogenic to the bioindicators used. The mechanism of damage induction may be associated with oxidative stress. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an eco-friendly and cost-effective technology to remove organic micro pollutants (OMPs) from wastewater. The support matrix is an important component in CWs as it has a primary role in the growth and development of plants and microbes. However, the roles of the support matrix in CWs in removing OMPs have not been systematically studied. Therefore, in this study, six common materials (sand, zeolite, blast iron slag, petcoke, polonite and crushed autoclaved aerated concrete (CAAC)) as support matrixes were firstly investigated by batch tests to explore their adsorption capacities to selected OMPs (ibuprofen, iohexol, tebuconazole and imazalil). Results showed that the adsorption capacities of the materials were low (at the level of mu g/g) compared to well-known sorbents (at the level of mg/g), such as activated carbon and carbon nanotubes. Columns packed with the six materials, respectively, were then built up to study the effects of different materials on microbial community. In the medium-term study (66 days), the removal of four OMP5 in all the columns increased by 2-58% from day 25 to day 66, and was mainly attributed to microbial degradation. Furthermore, Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis indicates that material presence shaped the microbial community metabolic function not only in the interstitial water but also in the biofilm. Overall, all the findings demonstrate that although the adsorption capacities of the common materials are low, they may be a driver to improve the removal of OMPs by altering microbial community function in CWs.

The study aimed to identify the mechanisms of biodegradation and sorption in the degradation of these compounds. The inoculum was granular sludge from a laboratory-scale anaerobic reactor. The characterization results of the inoculum showed an anaerobic biomass with high activity, good sedimentation and a high percentage of organic matter. The results of the removal of the pollutants showed high degradation percentages for methylparaben (close to 99%), with negligible sorption in the sludge. The results also showed insignificant ibuprofen sorption but removal close to 0%. Triclosan showed high biomass sorption and low biodegradation. In addition, at the concentrations tested, none of the compounds had a negative or inhibitory effect on the microbial populations of the system.

AB Platinum-based cytotoxic drugs are complexes of Pt used in 50-70% of cancer patients. This study was performed during 2015, in two oncology wards of Qom hospitals in Iran. Sampling was carried out using effluent of the oncology wards for measurement of total Pt concentration. Analysis was performed by ICP-OES, and limit of detection was determined (LODs = 1 mu g/L). During the sampling days, the total Pt concentration in the wastewater effluent oncology ward ranged from 5 to 762 mu g/L at Shahid Beheshti Hospital and from 3 to 629 mu g/L at Hazrat Masoumeh Hospital. According to the results from concentration of cytotoxic drugs, the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) (ng/L) in wastewater treatment plant effluent and river for cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin were determined. Calculated RQ(hww) showed that Sigma RQ(hww) - 1.19. Thus, the total platinum compound drug could have potential toxicity effect on aquatic organisms. It was concluded that monitoring of cytotoxic drugs residue in hospital effluent must be considered because of their toxicity and impact on aquatic pollution. The results also revealed that PEC < 10 ng/L for all the platinum compound drugs and sum of the PEC calculation (Sigma PPECcis,carbo,oxali).

AB The study established an integrated view to evaluate the effect of exogenous organic carbon (EOC) on removal rate of cefradine and amoxicillin by Microcystis aeruginosa. Meanwhile, the toxicity control assessment of effluents was also investigated on the rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) during the algal treatment. The results indicated that glucose and NaAc could be consumed as EOC which enhanced the treatment efficiency of cefradine from 27.11% to 85.19% and amoxicillin from 14.70% to 58.20%, while the toxicity of the reaction products could be controlled at a similar level as the antibiotic itself. Moreover the algal treatment and nutrition regulation could also be applied for artificial wastewater and significantly promote the removal rate with respective increases of 47.04% and 48.75% for cefradine and amoxicillin, respectively.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant/bactericide that has been applied in various industries (e.g., food processing, pharmaceuticals, medical device sterilization, etc.) as a disinfectant. There is increasing interest in using PM for wastewater disinfection because it does not form halogenated byproducts, and no post-treatment quenching is required. Previous studies have demonstrated good efficiency in controlling bacteria in wastewater, but limited information is available for viruses, especially those hosted by mammals (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a study on the infectivity reduction of murine norovirus (MNV) was undertaken to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of PM or UV alone and in combination with UV irradiation in undisinfected secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility (MWW) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7. Experiments employing MS2 bacteriophage were also performed in parallel for comparison purposes. MS2 infectivity reduction was found to be lower than MNV infectivity reduction for each condition studied - PAA, PAA + UV, and UV disinfection. These data suggest that MS2 may not be an appropriate surrogate to accurately predict the reduction of MNV infectivity.
   UV irradiation, in a dose range of 5-250 mJ/cm(2), provided linear log inactivation (-log (N/N-0)) with a regression slope (cm(2)mJ(-1)) of 0.031-0.034 and 0.165-0.202 for MS2 and MNV, respectively. UV irradiation provided similar inactivation for MS2 and MNV in both suspensions (PBS or MWW). Low infectivity reduction of MS2 was observed when PM was used alone at a practical dose of 1.5 mg/L and below. A greater reduction of both MNV and MS2 was observed in PM disinfection experiments using PBS as the microbial suspension medium, than in secondary effluent. Similar results were observed in PM + UV experiments, in which greater synergistic effects were found in PBS than in MWW. Results of OH center dot radical formation experiments suggest the presence of radical scavengers in MWW, which resulted in less opportunity for MNV and MS2 to encounter OH(center dot)radicals. This study also demonstrated that the type of water can have a substantial impact on wastewater disinfection when employing PM or PM + UV treatment due to the matrix effect and the presence of radical scavengers, respectively. The results from this study could be employed to aid in the conceptual design of PM and UV disinfection facilities, especially when norovirus is the organism of concern.

AB The fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, especially in rivers and reservoirs, is receiving growing attention in South Korea because reservoirs are an important source of drinking water in this country. Seasonal changes in the abundance of 11 ARGs and a mobile genetic element (int1) in two reservoirs in South Korea, located near drinking water treatment plants in Cheonan and Cheongju cities, were monitored for 6 mo. In these drinking water sources, total ARG concentrations reached 2.5 x 10(7) copies mL(-1), which is one order of magnitude higher than in influents of some wastewater treatment plants in South Korea. During the sampling periods in August, October, and November 2016 and January 2017, sulfonamides (sul1), beta-lactam antibiotics (bla(TEM)), and tetracycline (tetA) resistance genes were the most abundant genes at the two sites. The ARG abundance consistently increased in January relative to 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) counts. General stress responses to oxidative stress and other environmental factors associated with the cold season could be significant drivers of ARG horizontal gene transfer in the environment. Accordingly, removal of ARGs as a key step in water treatment warrants more attention.

AB A priority environmental problem is pollution and disturbance of natural environments by emerging pollutants - substances of various origins and structures and with known and/or potential ecotoxic effects. One of the most dangerous groups of emerging pollutants is pharmaceutical substances due to their highly stable chemical structure and pronounced biological activity. They are found in soil, bottom sediments, surface, sewage, groundwater and drinking water. Uncontrolled release of pharmaceuticals in open ecosystems is potentially dangerous, entailing environmental consequences. Their negative impacts on living organisms are evident. This has driven the search for effective ways to neutralise persistent pollutants. In Russia, pharmaceutical pollution of the environment has commenced recently and is still presented as research with a local focus. In particular, the dynamics and metabolic mechanisms of pharma pollutants by Rhodococcus actinobacteria, outstanding among other microorganisms for their capacity to degrade a great diversity of degradable pollutants, are most intensively investigated. These studies are implemented at the junction of organic chemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, and pharmacology. They include a set of interrelated fundamental tasks, such as developing drug detection methods in the cultivation media of microorganisms, elucidating the relationships between the systematic affiliation of microorganisms and their ability to degrade chemically different drug substances, as well as studying the degree of biodegradability and toxic effects of new compounds on the degrading microorganisms, and also the features of their decomposition and co-metabolism. Solving these tasks is important to enable understanding of the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals and to create prerequisites for innovative technical solutions in the advanced treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. It is also essential for the development of environmentally safe approaches to hazardous pharmaceutical waste management.

Chemical analysis is also described as a vital point at the subsequent stages of technological processes control and sewage sludge quality assessment. It is also an instrument essential to maintaining control of processed sewage sludge introduced to the environment as ready-to-use materials. The sludge management method is conditioned by the compliance with legal acts concerning sludge management. The most important of these contain information regarding allowable concentrations of pollutants which can be released into the environment, and the most important declarations concerning sewage sludge management. Various analytical techniques and preparation methods that can be used during the monitoring of the managed and processed sewage sludge are described. The most important are chromatographic techniques, methods based on inductively coupled plasma, and mass spectrometry based methods.

AB The Red River originates in the U.S., drains into Lake Winnipeg, and is a significant pathway for nutrients. We investigate its role as a source for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and microbes bearing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). We delineate agricultural, urban, and rural land-use for organic contaminants to determine the extent of chemical transboundary riverine fluxes, and characterize levels and trends of organic contaminants and ARGs between spring and fall 2014 and 2015. The herbicide atrazine peaked at over 500 ng/L (14-day time-weighted average) near the border, indicating that the U.S. represents the major source into Canada from the Red River. Neonicotinoid insecticides had relatively constant concentrations, suggesting more widespread agricultural use in both countries. Pesticide concentrations were greatest post-application in June and July. Mass loadings of pesticides over the sampling periods, from the river to Lake Winnipeg, ranged from approximately 800 kg of atrazine, to 120 kg of thiamethoxam and clothianidin, to 40 kg of imidacloprid. Exposure distributions for atrazine exceeded benchmark water quality guidelines for protection of aquatic life (0.2% probability of exceeding chronic benchmark) with no exceedances for neonicotinoids. Seven pharmaceuticals were detected, mostly at low ng/L levels downstream of the City of Winnipeg wastewater treatment plant. Carbamazepine, the only pharmaceutical detected consistently at all sites, contributed on average 20 kg each year into Lake Winnipeg. While minor inputs were observed all along the river, city inputs represented the greatest source of pharmaceuticals to the river. Both PFASs and ARGs were observed consistently and ubiquitously, indicative of an anthropogenically-influenced system with no indications of any single point-source signature. While transboundary flux from the U.S. was an important source of pesticides to the Red River, especially for atrazine, observed concentrations of all measured contaminants suggest that known aquatic toxicological risk is minimal.

AB Lab-scale GAC sandwich slow sand filters with different GAC layer depths were evaluated for the first time to remove selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (namely DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and tri-closan, 25 mu g/L). Coarse sand (effective grain size of 0.6 mm) was used instead of conventional fine sand. In addition to single sand and GAC filters, GAC sandwich filters were assessed at three filtration rates (i.e. 5 cm/h, 10 cm/h and 20 cm/h) to compare removals. Sandwich filter with 20 cm GAC achieved the best average PPCP removal (98.2%) at 10 cm/h rate. No significant difference of average PPCP removal was found between 10 and 20 cm/h filtration rates for the three GAC sandwich filters (p > 0.05). Among the selected PPCPs, DEET, the recalcitrant compound, was most effectively removed by the GAC sandwich filters. Combining the GAC layers with the slow sand filters significantly enhanced the removal of the target PPCP compounds (p < 0.05), demonstrating that both adsorption and biodegradation contributed to the removals. Furthermore, pseudo-second-order equation (Type 1) could best represent the adsorption kinetics of the four target PPCP compounds onto GAC. In relation to other quality parameters, sandwich filter with 20 cm of GAC also showed good average removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 65.8% and total organic carbon (TOC) of 90.3%, but occurrence of ammonium up to 0.76 mg/L concentration indicated inapplicability of filtration rate of 5 cm/h. No significant difference was found between 10 cm/h and 20 cm/h filtration rates for nitrogen and phosphate removals (p > 0.05).

AB There is a growing interest in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater because pharmaceuticals have potential ecotoxicological effects. Among several removal mechanisms, the sorption of pharmaceuticals to sediment organic matter is an important mechanism related to the mobility of pharmaceuticals. This study investigated the sorption of pharmaceuticals to soil organic matter (SOM) by electrostatic interactions. SOM located on the surface of soil/sediment generally has a negative charge because of the functional groups present (i.e., carboxylic and phenolic groups). Thus, the electrical characteristics of SOM can induce electrical attraction with positively charged chemical compounds. In this study, SOM was extracted from soils under different aquatic plants (Acorus and Typha) in a constructed wetland in Korea. Experiments were carried out with the following three pharmaceuticals with different electrical characteristics at pH 7: atenolol (positive charge; pKa 9.5), carbamazepine (neutral; no pKa), and ibuprofen (negative charge; pKa 4.9). The SOM in the Acorus pond had a higher hydrophobicity and electrical charge density than that in the Typha pond. Regarding the sorption efficiency between SOM and charged pharmaceuticals, atenolol showed highest sorption efficiency (similar to 60%), followed by carbamazepine (similar to 40%) and ibuprofen (<similar to 30%). In addition, the removal efficiency of the targeted pharmaceuticals in the constructed wetland was estimated by comparing the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals at sampling points with flowing water. The results showed that the removal efficiency of atenolol and carbamazepine was almost 50%, whereas that of ibuprofen was only similar to 10%. A comparison of the results of lab-scale and field experiments showed that electrostatic interaction is one of the major pharmaceutical removal mechanisms in a constructed wetland.

AB TCAs are known to be toxicants and endocrine disrupting agents. Generally, after being used, TCAs are passed through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to be treated. However, still trace amounts (ng/L to mu g/L) of TCAs have been founded even in the treated water. Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the environmental behaviors of TCAs in the sewage water from WWTPs (Jeonju, Korea). For the experiments, seven TCAs (amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, and doxepin) were selected. Hydrolysibility, biodegradability, and adsorbability of the selected seven TCAs were evaluated. Based on the results, it was concluded that TCAs are not readily hydrolyzed in water and also not biodegraded by aerobic sludge. The 60% to 85% of TCAs were adsorbed immediately onto the activated sludge within 1 s via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It was clearly observed that adsorption affinities were dependent on the types of activated sludge (i.e. anaerobic and aerobic sludge). The affinities of aerobic and anaerobic sludge towards the TCAs at trace concentrations e.g., 1 to 10 mu g/L, were estimated to be in the range from 0.021 +/- 0.000 to 0.087 +/- 0.000 L/mu g and from 0.001 +/- 0.000 to 0.108 +/- 0.001 L/mu g, respectively.

AB Ubiquitous detection of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment around the world raises a great public concern. Aquatic residuals of pharmaceuticals have been assumed to relate to land use patterns and various human activities within a catchment or watershed. This study generated a gradient of human activity in the Jiulong River watershed, southeastern China by urban land use percentage in 20 research subwatersheds. Thirty-three compounds from three-category pharmaceuticals [ 26 compounds of 5 antibiotic groups, 6 compounds of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 1 compound of respiratory system drugs (RSDs)] were quantified in stream water before the research subwatershed confluences with two sampling events in dry and wet seasons. In total, 27 out of the 33 pharmaceutical compounds of interest were found in stream waters. Seasonality of instream pharmaceuticals was observed, with less compounds and lower concentrations in the wet season sampling event than in the dry season one. Urban land use in the research subwatershed was identified as the main factor influencing in stream pharmaceutical concentrations and composition regardless of season. Rural land uses contributed a mixture of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals possibly from agricultural application of manure and sewage sludge and aquaculture in the research subwatersheds. Erythromycin in both sampling events showed mediumto high risks to aquatic organisms. Results of this study suggest that urban pharmaceutical management, such as a strict prescription regulations and high-efficient removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment, is critical in reducing aquatic pharmaceutical loads.

AB Fish are good indicators of aquatic environment pollution because of their capability to uptake pollutants contained in water. Therefore, accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in freshwater and marine fish and other aquatic organisms has been studied extensively in the last decade. In this context, the present study investigates the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wild fish from 25 polluted river sites in the USA, downstream from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Sample sites constitute a subset of urban rivers investigated in the U.S. EPA's 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Thirteen pharmaceuticals (out of the twenty compounds analyzed) were quantified in fish fillets at concentrations commonly below 10 ng g(-1), in accordance with the findings from previous studies in the USA and Europe. The psychoactive drugs venlafaxine, carbamazepine and its metabolite 2-hydroxy carbamazepine were the most prevalent compounds (58%, 27% and 42%, respectively). This group of drugs is highly prescribed and rather resistant to degradation during conventional treatment in WWTPs as well as in natural aquatic environments. Salbutamol, a drug used to treat asthma, and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide were also frequently detected (in > 20% of the samples). Occurrence of six pharmaceutical families due to chronic exposure at environmental concentrations in water was detected in eight fish species. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acetaminophen and sulfonamides are emerging contaminants. Conventional wastewater treatment systems fail to degrade these compounds properly. Mycoremediation, is a formof novel bioremediation that uses extracellular enzymes ofwhite-rot fungi to degrade pollutants in the environment. In this study, spentmushroomcompost (SMC), which contains fungal extracellular enzymes, was tested for acetaminophen and sulfonamides removal. Among the SMCs of nine mushrooms tested in batch experiments, the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii exhibited the highest removal rate for acetaminophen and sulfonamides. Several fungal extracellular enzymes that might be involved in removal of acetaminophen and sulfonamides were identified by metaproteomic analysis. The bacterial classes, Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, were revealed by metagenomic analysis and may be assisting with acetaminophen and sulfonamide removal, respectively, in the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii. Bioreactor experimentswere used to simulate the capability of Pleurotus eryngii SMC for the removal of acetaminophen and sulfonamides from wastewater. The results of this study provide a feasible solution for acetaminophen and sulfonamide removal from wastewater using the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Ibuprofen is commonly detected in onsite wastewater systems. Such onsite systems are abundant in coastal plain areas, globally. Coastal plain soils have unique mineralogy. Rapid subsurface transport may occur in coastal plain soils due to their characteristic permeable soils and seasonally high water tables. Laboratory batch sorption studies were conducted on Norfolk, Goldsboro, and Lynchburg, three archetypical coastal plain soils, with varying physicochemical properties, to evaluate ibuprofen sorption. Sorption distribution coefficients (K (D) values) across all three soils ranged from 0.63 to 1.26 L kg(-1). Sorption of ibuprofen to Norfolk and Goldsboro soils was able to be modeled using a Freundlich isotherm; however, the Lynchburg soil, was not, likely due to soil heterogeneity. In general, sorption of ibuprofen was influenced by soil organic carbon content.

AB The aquatic environment is continually exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals, whereby effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one key source. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental risk assessments (ERAs) addressing individual substances are sufficiently protective for such coincidental mixtures. Based on a literature review of chemicals reported to occur in municipal WWTP effluents and mode-of-action considerations, four different types of mixtures were composed containing human pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and chemicals regulated under REACH. The experimentally determined chronic aquatic toxicity of these mixtures towards primary producers and the invertebrate Daphnia magna could be adequately predicted by the concept of concentration addition, with up to 5-fold overestimation and less than 3-fold underestimation of mixture toxicity. Effluents of a municipal WWTP had no impact on the predictability of mixture toxicity and showed no adverse effects on the test organisms. Predictive ERAs for the individual mixture components based on here derived predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC5) and median measured concentrations in WWTP effluents (MCeff) indicated no unacceptable risk for any of the individual chemicals, while MCeff/PNEC summation indicated a possible risk for multi-component mixtures. However, a refined mixture assessment based on the sum of toxic units at species level indicated no unacceptable risks, and allowed for a safety margin of more than factor 10, not taking into account any dilution of WWTP effluents by surface waters. Individual substances, namely climbazole, fenofibric acid and fluoxetine, were dominating the risks of the investigated mixtures, while added risk due to the mixture was found to be low with the risk quotient being increased by less than factor 2. Yet, uncertainty remains regarding chronic mixture toxicity in fish, which was not included in the present study. The number and identity of substances composing environmental mixtures such as WWTP effluents is typically unknown. Therefore, a mixture assessment factor is discussed as an option for a prospective ERA of mixtures of unknown composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) is often considered to efficiently remove polar trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from lotic systems, mitigating potential adverse effects of TrOCs on ecosystem functioning and drinking water production. Predicting the fate of TrOCs in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult as the in-situ removal rate constants are not known and the biogeochemical factors as well as hydrological conditions controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine the in-situ removal efficiency of the HZ for a variety of TrOCs as a function of the biogeochemical milieu, we conducted a field study in an urban river near Berlin, Germany. Subsurface flow was studied by time series of temperature depth profiles and the biogeochemical milieu of the HZ by concentration depth profiles. These results, in conjunction with a 1D advection-dispersion transport model, were used to calculate first-order removal rate constants of several polar TrOCs in the HZ. For the majority of TrOCs investigated, removal rate constants were strongly dependent on redox conditions, with significantly higher removal rates observed under predominantly suboxic (i.e. denitrifying) compared to anoxic (i.e. Fe and Mn reducing) conditions. Compared to previous studies on the fate of TrOCs in saturated sediments, half-lives within oxic/suboxic sections of the HZ were relatively low, attributable to the site-specific characteristics of the HZ in a stream dominated by wastewater treatment plant effluent. For nine out of thirteen investigated TrOCs, concentrations decreased significantly in the HZ with relative removal percentages ranging from 32% for primidone to 77% for gabapentin. For many TrOCs, removal efficiency decreased drastically as redox conditions became anoxic. For the majority of compounds investigated here, the HZ indeed acts as an efficient bioreactor that is capable of removing TrOCs along relatively short flow paths. Depending on the TrOC, removal capacity may be enhanced by either increasing the magnitude of groundwater-surface exchange fluxes, by increasing the total residence time in the HZ or the exposure time to suboxic zones, respectively.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are recognized as one of the most serious emerging micropollutants. Wastewater treatment plants are the major way through which such contaminants enter the environment. Therefore, an appropriate management of PhACs in these facilities can reduce their release into the environment. In particular, a proper sampling methodology is necessary to identify and quantify micropollutants in wastewater. In this study, 37 pharmaceuticals (including 23 antibiotics) are investigated in eight major wastewater treatment plants in Beijing. An optimized sampling methodology is successfully implemented to monitor bihourly variation of the contaminants, thus averting uncertainties derived from conventional sampling methods. In this way, more accurate pharmaceutical load patterns are determined and discussed. Thanks to the synchronous data on pharmaceutical concentration and wastewater flow, we also compare performances of various treatment processes and optimize different calculation methods for removal efficiency.

AB Tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand (TAML) activator is a functional analog of peroxidase enzymes, which activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high valence iron-oxo complexes that selectively degrade persistent aromatic organic contaminants (ACs) in water. Here, we develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on measured pseudo first-order kinetic rate coefficients (k(obs)) of 29 ACs (e.g., phenols and pharmaceuticals) oxidized by TAML/H2O2 at neutral and basic pH values to gain mechanistic insight on the selectivity and pH dependence of TAML/H2O2 systems. These QSAR models infer that electron donating ability (E-HOMO) is the most important AC characteristic for TAML/H2O2 oxidation, pointing to a rate-limiting single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. Oxidation rates at pH 7 also depend on AC reactive indices such as f(min)(-) and qH(+), which respectively represent propensity for electrophilic attack and the most positive net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms. At pH 10, TAML/H2O2 is more reactive towards ACs with a lower hydrogen to carbon atoms ratio (#H:C), suggesting the significance of hydrogen atom abstraction. In addition, In k(obs) of 14 monosubstituted phenols is negatively correlated with Hammett constants (sigma) and exhibits similar sensitivity to substituent effects as horseradish peroxidase. Although accurately predicting degradation rates of specific ACs in complex wastewater matrices could be difficult, these QSAR models are statistically robust and help predict both relative degradability and reaction mechanism for TAML/H2O2-based treatment processes.

AB Wastewater treatment contributes significantly to protect human health and ecological safety. With sustainable development of wastewater treatment, recovery of resources and energy from wastewater has been the focus for conventional contaminants, while reduction and control of ecological toxicity is the focus for emerging compounds. Under anaerobic conditions, especially with the enhancement of direct interspecies electron transfer, methanogenesis and/or nitrous oxide production could be achieved separately or simultaneously, and the removal efficiency of some types of emerging compounds could be improved. During nitritation, both nitrogen and emerging compounds removal could be achieved simultaneously. Therefore, a new wastewater treatment concept based on recovery of energy and control of emerging compounds was proposed, including the anaerobic treatment process by incorporating directly electron transfer enhancement and nitritation-based nitrogen removal. The proposed strategy provided a new technology concept for advancing the sustainable development of wastewater treatment through recovery of energy and control of emerging compounds.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play a crucial role in claforan bio-adsorption using activated sludge, but the interaction mechanism between claforan and EPS remains unclear. Fluorescence spectroscopy technology was employed to illuminate the mechanism in this study. Two protein-like fluorescence peaks (peak A with Ex/Em = 225 nm/337 nm and peak B with Ex/Em = 280/335 nm) and humic acid-like (peak C with Ex/Em = 350/434) were identified in loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS). Fluorescence of the peaks A and B for LB-EPS were markedly quenched by claforan at all temperatures whereas fluorescence of peak C for LB-EPS was quenched only at 288 K. Peak A and Peak B interaction with Claforan fits Stern-Volmer equation and Hill model. log K-b was 7.17 and 5.05, respectively, and the number of binding sites (n) was 1.56 and 1.19. log K-b and n for peak C were not able to fit the equation at 298 K. The fluorescence quenching of interaction between peak A and peak B and Claforan was governed a static process, whereas the interaction between peak C and Claforan may be both static and dynamic quenching. The molecular binding mechanisms obtained in this study will add fundamental knowledge of understanding the roles of EPS from activated sludge in claforan bio-adsorption in domestic wastewater.

AB Electrosorption is a novel desalination technique that has many advantages in the treatment of sewage. However, commercially available activated carbon electrodes for electrosorption commonly have low microporosity, poor moulding performance, and low adsorption and regeneration efficiency. Here, we evaluated a novel adsorbent material, activated carbon fibre felt (ACFF), for electrosorption of Chromium ions (Cr6+) in sewage treatment. The ACFF was modified with 20% nitric acid and its modified structure was characterized. The modified ACFF was used as an adsorbing electrode to investigate its desalination effect by electrosorption. Results showed that compared with those of unmodified ACFF, the modified ACFF had more carbonyl and carboxyl groups and the specific surface area, average pore size and micropore volume of the modified ACFF also improved by 32.2%, 25% and 23.1%, respectively. The kinetics of Cr6+ adsorption conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, and the adsorption isotherm conformed to the Langmuir model. In addition, the regeneration rate of the modified ACFF electrode was more than 94%. In conclusion, the modified ACFF exhibits excellent electrosorption and regeneration performance for Cr6+ removal from water and thus is of great value for promotion in sewage treatment.

AB Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate vertebrate growth, development, and metabolism. Despite their importance, there is a need for effective detection of TH-disruption by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The frog olfactory system substantially remodels during TH-dependent metamorphosis and the objective of the present study is to examine olfactory system gene expression for TH biomarkers that can evaluate the biological effects of complex mixtures such as municipal wastewater. We first examine classic TH-response gene transcripts using reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory bulb (OB) of premetamorphic Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana tadpoles after 48 h exposure to biologically-relevant concentrations of the THs, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3) and L-thyroxine (T-4), or 17-beta estradiol (E-2); a hormone that can crosstalk with THs. As the OE was particularly sensitive to THs, further RNAseq analysis found > 30,000 TH-responsive contigs. In contrast, E-2 affected 267 contigs of which only 57 overlapped with THs suggesting that E-2 has limited effect on the OE at this developmental phase. Gene ontology enrichment analyses identified sensory perception and nucleoside diphosphate phosphorylation as the top affected terms for THs and E-2, respectively. Using classic and additional RNA-seq-derived TH-response gene transcripts, we queried TH-disrupting activity in municipal wastewater effluent from two different treatment systems: anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and membrane enhanced biological phosphorous removal (MEBPR). While we observed physical EDC removal in both systems, some TH disruption activity was retained in the effluents. This work lays an important foundation for linking TH-dependent gene expression with olfactory system function in amphibians.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been found as contaminants in wastewater, causing concern for the health of aquatic life and humans. The anti-cholesterol medication bezafibrate is one such contaminant and is difficult to remove from wastewater. The lack of studies investigating the bonding behavior of bezafibrate with potential acceptor motifs prompted us to determine the types of molecules that would engage in intermolecular bonds with the drug. Although co-crystallization of bezafibrate has been previously attempted, we altered the approach by utilizing molecules containing only hydrogen-bond-acceptor sites. Here, we discuss the first successful co-crystallizations of bezafibrate, intermolecular bonding behavior, and solution-state binding studies with potential acceptor molecules. One acceptor, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, exhibits a shorter bond in the solid state, and a solution-state binding constant over 18 times higher than any other drug-acceptor pair studied here. These studies should aid in designing contaminant-removal materials that will effectively bond with the drug.

AB The increase in medicine and drug consumption have resulted in identifying these emerging pollutants in all aquatic compartments, ranging from surface water and groundwater resources to the marine environment. Pharmaceuticals are an indispensable part of life today. A large number of pharmaceuticals are used in a daily basis in the treatment, prevention, cure or diagnosis of diseases or to otherwise enhance people's physical or mental well-being. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the attitude of citizens in Cyprus regarding the disposal of pharmaceuticals as well as to identify the main reasons why pharmaceutical wastes are produced. The result indicted that in Cyprus, there is lack of data regarding the amount of pharmaceutical wastes that are discarded into household waste and sinks. The survey audit showed that 86.6% of men's and 83.3% of women's used pharmacy with or without doctor's recipe. Social behaviour is considered to be the most significant reason that pharmaceutical are produced. The results indicated that, citizens mainly keep unused medicines and drugs at home in case they are needed again as well as patients use to cut-off or to reduce their treatment in case that on the first 3-6 days they feel better. The survey indicated that the main disposal method of unused or expired medicines and drugs is in household waste followed from the sink and the toilet. Furthermore, the main disposal solution of unused or expired medicines and drugs remain the household bin as well as the sewage system (sink or toilet), while a percentage more than 55% of the participants indicated that they will follow a specific waste management program if existing in place. Moreover, in order to reduce the production of pharmaceutical wastes, specific prevention activities must be considered.

AB Naproxen (NPX) is a common PPCPs in wastewater treatment plants which is influenced by the coexistence on its photodegradation. Most research on reasons for NPX photodegradation has focused on the soluble substances in water mainly, and the adsorption effect of solid particles is less. The effects of initial concentration, temperature, and pH on the adsorption of NPX on gamma-FeOOH were studied. It was found that the equilibrium time of gamma-FeOOH adsorbed NPX was 240 min. The increase of initial concentration and temperature were favorable for the adsorption. The optimal adsorption pH was 7.0, and the adsorption capacity attained 28.05 mg.g(-1). It was learned, through model fitting, that the adsorption reaction was in accordance with the Laggenren quasi-second-order kinetic model; the internal diffusion process was the control step, where the adsorption was close to the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. The thermodynamic calculation showed that Delta G < 0, Delta H < 0, Delta S < 0, which inferred that the adsorption was a spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy increasing process, which is the common action of chemical bond forces and static electricity.

AB The primary source of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is the discharge of wastewater effluents. Pharmaceuticals are a large and diverse group of compounds. Among them, psychotropic substances are particularly interesting to study due to their specific known mode of action. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of wastewater effluents from a psychiatric hospital wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on several aquatic organisms. All the analyzed pharmaceuticals (10 compounds) were detected in WWTP effluents as well as in the receiving river. Although the environmental concentrations were generally at trace levels (ngL(-1) to gL(-1)), induce toxic effects were observed. This study showed the effects of the WWTP effluents on the oogenesis and/or embryogenesis of amphipod crustacean Gammarus fossarum, Japanese fish medaka Oryzias latipes, mollusk Radix peregra, and planarian Schmidtea polychroa. A decrease of the number of oocytes and produced embryos was observed for G. fossarum and S. polychroa. Similarly, the hatching rate of R. peregra was affected by effluents. In the receiving river, the macroinvertebrate community was affected by the wastewater effluents discharge.

AB The ability of UV/AOP to treat trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in wastewater is inhibited by (1) UV light-absorbing species and (2) hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging species. We address these challenges by investigating four diverse technologies, single-stage biofiltration, sequential biofiltration, coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation-filtration (CFSF), and nanofiltration, as options for improving water quality conditions just prior to UV treatment, with and without added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). By evaluating UV254 transmittance (UVT), OH scavengers, and OH steady-state concentrations, we found nanofiltration treatment to produce the most favorable pre-UV and UV/H2O2 water quality conditions. In comparing CFSF, single-stage biofiltration and sequential biofiltration treatment, CFSF treatment resulted in the highest increase in UVT and all three technologies reduced the scavenging capacity by approximate to 24% despite differences in removal of typical OH scavengers. UV and UV/H2O2 performance were evaluated by tracking the degradation rates of 11 targeted TOrCs for each pre-UV/H2O2 treatment scenario. Applying the additional treatment, average pseudo first-order degradation rates of TOrCs under UV/H2O2 increased by 20 to 92%, informing potential strategies to increase the oxidation potential of UV/AOP systems applied to wastewater.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be a source of environmental contamination by micropollutants, especially from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PCPs). The pathway of those compounds during sewage treatment has been investigated, but data from real-scale WWTPs is still missing (for example, the values of the solid-liquid coefficient (K-d) during treatment). This paper uses the K-d values for some pharmaceuticals and PCPs (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, propranolol, metoprolol, salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, caffeine, triclosan, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben) to describe the micropollutants' behavior in the treatment process. In order to attain this data, an aerobic wastewater treatment plant located in Brazil was studied. Six samplings were carried out and a mass balance was performed, associating the concentrations of the micropollutants in the liquid phase with the solid phase (sludge and suspended solids). Of all the compounds analyzed, caffeine was the most biodegradable pollutant, as almost 98% of its mass was biodegraded. In contrast, triclosan had the highest load in sludge (median of 163.0 mg day(-1)) and adsorbed in SS (median of 0.593 mg day(-1)) at the output. Summing up, each micropollutant had a specific way to be removed during wastewater treatment.

Depending on the mode of action of the individual contaminant within the mixture, toxicity can occur due to contaminants having similar or dissimilar modes of action. However, it is unknown how the metabolome responds to sublethal contaminant mixtures in the keystone genus Daphnia. In the present study we examined D. magna metabolic responses to acute sublethal exposure of propranolol, carbamazepine, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as well as in binary (propranolol-carbamazepine, propranolol-PFOS, carbamazepine-PFOS) and tertiary mixtures (carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS), all at 10% of the median lethal concentration of the population (LC50). The metabolome was measured using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and characterized using principal component analysis, regression analysis, and fold changes in metabolite relative to the unexposed (control) group. The averaged principal component analysis scores plots revealed that carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS exposures were significantly different from the control treatment. After normalizing the toxicity of each contaminant, we found that some metabolites responded monotonically, whereas others displayed a nonmonotonic response with increasing toxicity units. The single contaminant exposures and 2 binary mixtures (propranolol-carbamazepine, and propranolol-PFOS) resulted in minimal changes in the identified metabolites, whereas the carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS displayed increases in several amino acid metabolites and decreases in glucose. Overall, our results highlight the sensitivity of the metabolome to distinguish the composition of the contaminant mixtures, with some mixtures displaying heightened responses versus others.

AB Limited drinking water resources and water pollution are one of the main worldwide problems. To reduce the consumption of fresh water resources, the use of treated wastewater has been proposed. The farmlands have been irrigated with wastewater for centuries, but the composition of used sewage has changed over the years. Recent research has revealed the presence of hundreds of new organic contaminants in many environmental waters, including wastewaters and their receivers. For this reason, wastewater profiling and monitoring are of high importance and urgent need. In this study, the HPLC-Q-TOF-MS has been used for the profiling of wastewater composition and evaluation of the water pollution markers belonging to emerging contaminants. Three different solid-phase extraction approaches were applied to obtain the best results. Compounds such as acesulfame-K, caffeine, carbamazepine, cyclamate, ibuprofen, methyl paraben, paracetamol, or saccharin were detected in raw wastewater samples, whereas only acesulfame-K, carbamazepine, and sucralose were found in effluent samples. It seems that these particular compounds might be chosen as water pollution marker specific to Polish communal sewages.

AB There have been rising concerns about micro-pollutants that are not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants. TiO2 photocatalysis is one of the most promising methods for their removal. One of the major challenges to the widespread application of TiO2 photocatalytic treatment is the use of fine TiO2 particles in suspension.
   A tray photocatalytic reactor based on using supported TiO2 as a photocatalyst was designed and constructed. The reactor maintains a thin water film over TiO2 supported on sand grains. Reactor performance for the degradation of phenol as a model compound was evaluated using 3 different approaches: (1) direct immobilization using the sol gel technique, (2) coating with TiO2/cement grout; and (3) binding with TiO2-epoxy coating.
   The recirculating tray configuration achieved photocatalyst activation, turbulent flow, avoiding treatment dead zones, and continuous water oxygenation. The reactor performance using the epoxy TiO2 sand composite was satisfactory in terms of degradation efficiency. The water turbidity remained unchanged indicating photocatalyst resistance to abrasion. Successful operation of the tray photo-reactor in the continuous mode was also achieved. The tray reactor is suitable for scale-up and commercialization due to five distinctive features which are: modular design; integrated storage; ease of continuous mode operation; absence of need for UV transmitting components; robustness and low cost of the epoxy-TiO2-sand composite.

AB In this study we developed a systematic method for suspect screening and target quantification of the human pharmaceutical residues in water, via solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We then proceeded to study the occurrences and distribution of the pharmaceuticals in the surface waters of Wuhan, China, by analyzing water samples from lakes, rivers and municipal sewage. Initially, 33 human pharmaceuticals were identified from East Lake without using purchasing standards. Of these, 29 were later confirmed by using standards, and quantified using the aforementioned SPE pretreatment method and LC-HRMS analysis in full MS scan mode. The 29 compounds included 8 antibiotics, 9 metabolites, and 12 miscellaneous pharmaceuticals. The highest proportions of pharmaceutical residues were detected downstream of the Yangtze River and in the lakes close to the central city. Metformin, cotinine, and trans-3-hydroxy cotinine, were frequently encountered in all the surface water samples. High concentrations (>120 ng/l) of caffeine, metformin, theobromine, and valsartan were detected in the surface water samples; the removal rates of these compounds in the municipal sewage treatment plant were also high. In contrast, although the concentrations of 4-AAA and metoprolol acid in the surface water were high, the removal rates of these residues in the sewage treatment plant were low.

AB Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are one of the major source of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic environment. Generally, the effects of individual chemicals on fish are studied under laboratory conditions, which leads to results that are potentially not realistic regarding the effects of these chemicals under environmental conditions. Therefore, in this study, common carps were held in exposed pond that receive water from STP effluents for 360 days under natural conditions. Elimination of xenobiotics starts in the fish intestine, in which the microbial community strongly influences its function. Moreover, the fish intestine functions as crucial organ for absorbing lipids and fatty acids (FA), with consequent transport to the liver where their metabolism occurs. The liver is the primary organ performing xenobiotic metabolism in fish, and therefore, the presence of pollutants may interact with the metabolism of FA. The catalytic activity of CYP1A and CYP3A-like enzymes, their gene expression, FA composition and intestinal microbiome consortia were measured. The catalytic activity of enzymes and their gene and protein expression, were induced in hepatic and intestinal tissues of fish from the exposed pond. Also, fish from the exposed pond had different compositions of FA than those from the control pond: concentration of 18: 1 n-9 and 18: 2 n-6 were significantly elevated and the longer chain n-3 FA 20: 5 n-3, 22: 5 n-3 and 22: 6 n-3 were significantly lowered. There were clear differences among microbiome consortia in fish intestines across control and exposed groups. Microbiome taxa measured in exposed fish were also associated with those found in STP activated sludge. This study reveals that treated STP water, which is assumed to be clean, affected measured biomarkers in common carp. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) oxidation on the deactivation of wastewater (WW)-derived N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors was investigated under various conditions (i.e., ClO2 application pH, dose and contact time). At pH 6.0, decreases in NDMA formation potentials (FPs) or occurrences (under uniform formation conditions [UFC]) were relatively low (<25%) with ClO2 oxidation regardless of WW-impact. A negative removal was also observed after ClO2 oxidation in some of the non-impacted waters. However, NDMA FP removals were significant (up to similar to 85%) under the same oxidation conditions in WW-impacted waters at pH 7.8. This indicates that the majority of WW-derived NDMA precursors can be deactivated with ClO2 oxidation above neutral pH. This was attributed to the better oxidative reaction of ClO2 with amines that have lone pair electrons to be shared at higher oxidation pH conditions. In addition, relatively short oxidation periods with ClO2 (i.e., <= 10 min) or low Ct (concentration x time, similar to 10 mg * min/L) values were sufficient for the deactivation of WW-derived NDMA precursors. ClO2 oxidation was effective in freshlyWW-impacted waters. Natural attenuation processes (e.g., sorption, biodegradation, etc.) can change the reactivity of WW-derived NDMA precursors for oxidation with ClO2. The effect of ClO2 on the removal of THM precursors was low(<25%) and independent of oxidation conditions. Given the low formation of regulated THMs and HAAs, ClO2 oxidation presents a viable option for the simultaneous control of NDMA and regulated DBP formation during water treatment, especially for utilities treating WW-impacted water sources.

AB The occurrence of 93 pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites has been investigated in stabilized sewage sludge from five municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Slovak Republic. The total population connected to the tested WWTPs was approximately 600,000 p.e. which represents >20% of the Slovak population connected to public sewer systems. The sludge production from the five tested plants was >8100 tons in 2016, which is approximately 15% of the total Slovak sewage sludge production in 2016.
   The highest total concentration of all pharmaceuticals was found in WWTP Bratislava Devinska NovasVes (DNV) and Senec - 11,800 and 11,300 ng/g dry matter (DM), respectively. Among individual pharmaceuticals, the highest concentrations were recorded for fexofenadine (mean 2340 ng/g DM, maximum 5600 ng/g DM in Bratislava DNV) and telmisartan (mean 1170 ng/g DM, with a maximum of 3370 ng/g DM in Senec). A principal component analysis revealed differences between pharmaceutical patterns in aerobically and anaerobically stabilized sludge.
   The worst-case scenario based on no further degradation of pharmaceuticals between sludge production and field application was used to predict pharmaceutical mass loads in agriculture. For the result, we estimated an annual load to soil in the Slovak Republic of up to several hundred kilograms of pharmaceuticals and drugs, with the maximum for fexofenadine (120 kg/year) and verapamil (29 kg/year).

AB In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) as reliable and highly efficient adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals from water. CDCs were produced from titanium carbide at temperatures within the range of 800-1400 degrees C employing chlorine as extraction agent. The materials were physicochemically characterized and tested in the adsorption of two relevant pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DCF) and metronidazole (MNZ)) in aqueous solutions. We found that the specific surface area in combination with a low functionalized surface plays a key role on the adsorption capacity of the material while the average pore size determines the kinetics of the process. Notably, the CDCs showed an outstanding adsorptive behaviour compared to different conventional carbon materials under the same operating conditions, which was attributed not only to their high surface areas but mainly to their strong hydrophobic properties. The optimum material (specific surface area of 1676m(2) g(-1)) showed extremely high adsorption capacity values (551 and 410 mg g(-1) for DCF and MNZ, respectively). Remarkably, the process was very fast (10 min of equilibrium time) even using low doses of adsorbent (0.3 mg mL(-1)). The performance of the optimum CDC was also demonstrated in bi-component systems while its versatility was demonstrated in a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, obtaining a good performance in terms of adsorption capacity (up to similar to 400 mgDCF g(-1)) and kinetics (equilibrium time of 10 min). These results demonstrate the promise of CDCs for reliable, effective and fast flow-through tertiary water treatment.

AB The use of antibiotics in the dairy farming for curing and growth promotion results in the production of massive quantities of non-recyclable wastewater by the conventional purification techniques. Additionally, waste milk is produced during the drug withholding periods, which is not suitable for human or animal consumption and cause huge economic loss as well as present serious environmental waste. This study was designed to investigate the decomposition of various antibiotic compounds in un-buffered aqueous solutions and milk samples by ozonation process. Commonly administered broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and sulphadiazine were selected as model examples in the current investigation. Gradual exposure of these antibiotics to increasing ozone gas concentration induced increasing removal percentages of the antibiotics in spiked water and milk samples. The removal reached 95% across all the tested treated antibiotics with ozone dose as low as 75 mg L-1. It was noted that the removal of antibiotics in milk samples is more efficient with faster rate constants. This was attributed to the self-buffering characteristic of milk that maintains the neutral pH, keeping the amine groups un-protonated and more reactive towards the electrophilic attack by the molecular ozone. H-1 NMR as well as HPLC experiments support the near complete removal of antibiotics and indicated the break down to simpler and more soluble fragments of acidic nature. Bacterial growth experiments, conducted with E. coil, and milk ageing experiments provided clear evidences that the resulting decomposition byproducts lack both toxicity effect and antimicrobial activity. This study provides a viable route to remove hazardous materials, which contribute to a growing issue of antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria.

AB Dyes have been used for more than twenty thousand years in textile, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and photographic industries, among others. Despite their importance in these applications, dyes can be toxic and resistant to many degradation processes used in wastewater treatment plants. Although a large number of dyes have been released in the environments in high amounts, studies into the environmental toxicity of these substances are still scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxic effects of textile dyes Disperse Red 60, Disperse Red 73 and Disperse Red 78 in zebrafish early life stages. To this end, biochemical biomarkers were selected to evaluate non-enzimatic antioxidant (Total Glutathione), antioxidant enzymes (Glutathione S-transferase and Catalase), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase) and energetic metabolism parameters (energy available and energy consumed) after 96 h exposure to these dyes. Our results demonstrated that these disperse dyes induce biochemical alterations in zebrafish embryos at environmental realistic concentrations and that the discharge of these disperse dyes into water bodies should be carefully evaluated. The selected biomarkers were sensitive as early-warning endpoints of disperse dyes toxicity on zebrafish embryos. Implications for risk assessment and indications for future research are discussed.

AB The Concern on the availability of clean and safe fresh water and the quality of recycled wastewater are important issues, which require a suitable technology to restore the water quality. Pharmaceuticals in waste water are not easily degraded by conventional water treatment technology. Advanced oxidation processes have been applied to eliminate traces of these compounds from aquatic environments. This study was focused on the degradation of ibuprofen (IBU) in aqueous solutions by catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation. Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize the ozone concentration in water and to investigate other operation parameters. The operation parameters were: temperature, stirring rate, gas flow rate, pH, and use of Spinchem stirrer to reach higher concentrations of dissolved ozone. In general, the initial concentration of IBU was 10 mg/L, and about 93% of IBU was degraded after 4 h of ozonation under optimal conditions. Additional experiments were carried out to investigate the benefit of applying a solid catalyst. H-Beta and Fe-H-Beta type catalysts were immobilized in the Spinchem rotating bed device. The catalytic experiments illustrated a significant improvement in the degradation rate of IBU. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption- desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and FTIR.

AB Atorvastatin (ATV) has been widely detected in wastewater treatment plant and aquatic environment. Limited mineralization ratio of ATV in current wastewater treatment processes may result in the accumulation of its transformation intermediates in effluent and cause additional ecological risk to the environment. In this study effectiveness of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by CuFe2O4 on the degradation of ATV in water were examined. Complete removal of ATV was achieved by using 40 ppm CuFe2O4 and 25 mu mol dm(-3) PMS. Eight intermediates were identified and four degradation pathways were proposed. The distribution of major intermediates ATV lactone (P-541), hydroxylated ATV lactone (P-557) and the pyrrole ring-open intermediate (P-416) were monitored with different PMS dosages. As PMS concentration increased from 25 to 150 mu mol dm-3, the main intermediates accumulated were evolved from P-541 and P-557 to P-557 and P-416, and all intermediates were completely degraded with 750 mu mol dm(-3) PMS. 61.72% TOC removal was achieved at pH 7.0 with 100 ppm CuFe2O4 and 3 m mol dm(-3) PMS, which indicated that ATV could be well mineralized if PMS and CuFe2O4 dosages were reasonably used. Overall, this study provided practical knowledge for ATV removal by CuFe2O4/PMS at ambient temperature.

AB A promising sustainable strategy to valorize cellulose to high-value adsorbents for trace pharmaceuticals, like diclofenac sodium (DCF), in the water is demonstrated. Carbon nanospheres (CN) as the DCF adsorbent were derived from cellulose through a one-pot microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization method. CN exhibited efficient DCF removal (100% removal of 0.001 mg/mL DCF in 30 s and 59% removal of 0.01 mg/mL DCF in 1 h). The adsorption kinetics and isotherm data were well-fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous as confirmed by the thermodynamic parameters. Multiple characterization techniques including SEM/EDS, FTIR, FTIR-imaging and zeta potential were applied to qualitatively investigate the adsorption process. pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding were proposed as the dominant adsorption interactions. CN also demonstrated effective adsorption capacity towards three other commonly-detected contaminants in the wastewater including ketoprofen (KP), benzophenone (BZP), and diphenylamine (DPA), each bearing partial structural similarity with DCF. The affinity of the contaminants towards CN followed the order DPA > BZP > DCF > KP, which could be explained by the different configurations and chemical units. It was speculated that for DCF and KP, the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion produced by dissociated carboxyl groups can impede the adsorption process as compared to DPA and BZP. This methodology could offer further insights into the drug adsorption on the cellulose-derived carbon adsorbents and the use of bioderived carbons for treatment of wastewaters contaminated with pharmaceuticals.

AB Estrogens originated from humans can reach ambient water and possibly cause significant ecological risks. In this study, the quantities of human-origin estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in the influent and effluent of four sewer treatment plants (STPs) in Seoul, South Korea were estimated using a demographic model. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the quantitative uncertainty of estimated E1 and E2 concentrations. Mean concentrations of E1 and E2 estimated for STP influents ranged from 29.5 to 38.4 and 7.5 to 9.7 ng/L, respectively. Meanwhile, mean concentrations of E1 and E2 estimated for STP effluents were 4.9 to 6.6 and 0.28 to 0.36 ng/L, respectively. These estimated values are similar to measured data as reported in the literatures within the range of uncertainty based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The hazard quotient (HQ) value in the main stem of the Han River was calculated to be far less than 1 because of the dilution effect of the Han River's abundant flow, indicating that most of the Han River ecosystem will not be influenced by these endogenous estrogens. With a 95% cumulative probability, HQ values in the main stem of the Han River for the Jungrang, Nanji, Tanchun, and Seonam STPs were less than 0.18, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.15, respectively. Nevertheless, HQ values >1 were observed in the vicinity of the STP outlets when using the numerical modeling. Our results show that the endocrine disruption potential of E1 and E2 around STP outlets in the main stem of the Han River must be monitored carefully. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a cost-effective, comprehensive, and non-invasive technique capable of determining semi-real-time community usage of drugs utilizing the concentration of drug residues in wastewater, wastewater inflow, and the population size served by a wastewater treatment plant. In this study, semi-real-time consumption rates of ten illicit drugs were determined using sewage epidemiology during special events including Independence Day, the 2017 solar eclipse, and the first week of an academic semester in the Midwestern United States. The average per-capita consumption rate of amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and THC were significantly different between two similar-sized communities during Independence Day observation week (p < 0.046) and a typical week (p < 0.001). Compared to a typical day, the consumption rate of amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine, and methadone was significantly higher on Independence Day (p < 0.021) and during solar eclipse observation (p = 0.020). The estimated percentage of the population that consumed cocaine in a community is similar to the conventionally estimated consumption of cocaine; however, the combined estimated population that consumed amphetamine and methamphetamine based on sewage epidemiology was similar to 2 to 4 fold higher than the conventional estimates. This study is the first to compare community use of drugs during special events in the USA using sewage epidemiology. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals worldwide coupled with modest removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants have resulted in the presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems globally. In this study, we investigated the environmental concentrations of a selection of 93 pharmaceuticals in 43 locations in the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak. The Baltic Sea is vulnerable to anthropogenic activities due to a long turnover time and a sensitive ecosystem in the brackish water. Thirty-nine of 93 pharmaceuticals were detected in at least one sample, with concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 80 ng/L. One of the pharmaceuticals investigated, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine, was widespread in coastal and offshore seawaters (present in 37 of 43 samples). In order to predict concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, a mass balance-based grey box model was set up and the persistent, widely used carbamazepine was selected as the model substance. The model was based on hydrological and meteorological sub-basin characteristics, removal data from smaller watersheds and wastewater treatment plants, and statistics relating to population, consumption and excretion rate of carbamazepine in humans. The grey box model predicted average environmental concentrations of carbamazepine in sub-basins with no significant difference from the measured concentrations, amounting to 0.57-3.2 ng/L depending on sub-basin location. In the Baltic Sea, the removal rate of carbamazepine in seawater was estimated to be 6.2 10(-9) s(-1) based on a calculated half-life time of 3.5 years at 10 degrees C, which demonstrates the long response time of the environment to measures phasing out persistent or slowly degradable substances such as carbamazepine. Sampling, analysis and grey box modelling were all valuable in describing the presence and removal of carbamazepine in the Baltic Sea. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study aims to assess the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) levels of several typical and atypical antipsychotic (AP) drugs to evaluate their degree of biodegradabilities. In recent times, the consumption of APs has seen a marked increase, and BOD5 can be a good parameter to evaluate the relative oxygen contents of these pharmaceuticals in polluted waters, effluents and wastewater. The Winkler method was implemented and after that, an automatized sequential injection analysis (SIA) method was used, aiming to overcome some drawbacks of the Winkler method. The degradation degree of these pharmaceuticals was determined from two perspectives: by using the theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) value and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value. From the results obtained with the second perspective, we could determine the degree of biodegradability of the AP drugs. The results of the Winkler method and the SIA system were quite similar. The SIA methodology is capable of operating as a screening method in any stage of a synthetic process in addition to being more environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Overall, these studies presented promising perspectives for improvement in the removal of pharmaceuticals from waste effluents by assessing BOD values.

AB Alternative processes need to be designed for the treatment of industrial effluents containing pharmaceutical and personal care products to improve their quality, permit the reuse of water for industrial applications and meet the standards set by environmental regulations prior to discharge. This type of effluent is a major source of water pollution since conventional activated sludge-based treatments are not effective in removing micropollutants.
   Carbamazepine, caffeine and triclosan are important trace contaminants commonly found in wastewater treatment plants, and were selected as target compounds to be treated in a cyclic anoxic/aerobic membrane bioreactor. This study aims to evaluate the biomass' characteristics and activity, and its influence over membrane fouling when treating the aforementioned compounds. Caffeine is known to be partially biodegraded whereas triclosan can inhibit microorganism's activity. In order to evaluate this effect, complimentary batch experiments were set up to determine whether triclosan might inhibit nitrification.
   Low ammonia removal efficiencies were observed in both experimental systems, therefore suggesting that nitrification was being inhibited probably due to the presence of triclosan. The ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor process demonstrated to be an efficient and appropriate technology for chemical oxygen demand removal, achieving an average of 97%, for caffeine reaching up to 93.7 +/- 9.7 removal efficiencies, and 89.7 +/- 8.3% for triclosan. For carbamazepine the removal was lower (36.2 +/- 6.8%) due to its recalcitrance. Furthermore, biomass filterability indicators displayed high sludge deterioration increasing substantially the fouling. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Removal rates for pharmaceuticals and dyes have been modelled using so-called quasi-SMILES, which are representations of the above processes. Quasi-SMILES is an extend of the simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) where, in addition to information on the molecular structure, the codes of physicochemical conditions are included. In addition, these codes can be a representation for various eclectic circumstances, such as presence or absence of light, impact of x-Rays beems, as well seasons (e.g. summer-winter). Analysis of quasi-SMILES of pharmaceuticals by Monte Carlo technique, applied via the CORAL software, shows it is possible to build predictive models using a one-variable correlation between optimal (flexible) descriptors and the removal rates. Removal rates used to build the model were obtained from recent publications including seasonal differences. The statistical characteristics of the best models for removal rates of pharmaceuticals and dyes are quite good for external validation set. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The complete removal of biorecalcitrant xenobiotics, including most notably the pharmaceutical pollutants, by advanced oxidation processes is often difficult to be reached in urban or industrial wastewater because of the high concentration of organic and inorganic scavengers that compete with the xenobiotics for the oxidizing species. This work investigates a coupled treatment train in which wastewater effluents are pretreated with a negatively charged loose nanofiltration (NF) membrane (HydraCoRe70, made up of sulfonated polyethersulfone) to enhance the removal of xenobiotics with the thermal Fenton process. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug prescribed mainly for epilepsy treatment, is used here as a model xenobiotic. After optimizing the conditions for separation and degradation, the NF-Fenton approach was applied to both synthetic wastewater and real samples to assess the overall efficiency of CBZ removal. The Fenton degradation of CBZ was drastically enhanced in nanofiltered samples, thanks to the removal by the membrane of nearly all organic matter that would otherwise consume the reactive oxidizing species (e.g., the hydroxyl radical). On the basis of a preliminary treatment cost analysis, it can be concluded that the combined process is potentially applicable to the treatment of several kinds of wastewaters (e.g., industrial ones) to favor the removal of biorecalcitrant contaminants. Key cost savings of NF-Fenton concern the lower amounts of Fenton reagents needed to degrade CBZ and (even more importantly) the decreased levels of acids and bases for pH adjustment before and after the oxidative process because of the lower buffer capacity of the NF permeate compared to feed wastewater, after the removal by the NF of many inorganic ions and most organic carbon.

AB The performances of two FAU-type zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were evaluated for the removal of antibiotics of three different classes, namely azithromycin, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole, from aqueous solutions. Commercial zeolites were used, without any previous treatment. Use of a small adsorbent dosage resulted in fast antibiotic adsorption that followed pseudo-second order kinetics. The removals of azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were highly pH-dependent, with low removal percentages observed under acid (pH 2.5-4.5) and basic (pH 8.5-10.5) conditions, respectively. The Freundlich isotherm model provided the best fits to the adsorption data. The adsorption mechanisms appeared to involve both electrostatic and H-bonding interactions. Using an antibiotics mixture, percentage removals of azithromycin and ofioxacin onto the zeolites of up to 79% were obtained. Both materials presented good adsorption (>50%) of azithromycin and ofioxacin from a real sample of effluent wastewater. The results showed that zeolites with FAU structure can be used as effective adsorbents for the removal of antibiotics with different physicochemical properties, including molecules with large volumes, such as azithromycin.

AB A novel ZnIn2S4/TiO2 composite catalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in four actual water bodies was investigated through a batch experiment under the irradiation of an iodine-gallium lamp with the wavelength of 350 similar to 450 nm, and the effects of suspended solid (SS), inorganic salt (IS) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on CBZ degradation were mainly discussed. Under the optimal mass ratio and dosage of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 catalyst, the influential sequence was DOM > IS > SS for the water of Chanhe River, and IS > DOM > SS for other three water bodies from the third wastewater treatment plant of Xi'an city, China. The photocatalytic degradation of CBZ in aquatic environment followed pseudo-first-order kinetics model, and the rate constant K enhanced 2 similar to 5 times and the half-life reduced from 10 similar to 20 min to 4 similar to 5 min after the removal of SS+IS+DOM from the real water bodies.

AB A multistage countercurrent solvent extraction model was used for recovering N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) from the pharmaceutical wastewater. The theoretical stages were obtained to be five by graphical method in the light of the fitted phase equilibrium data. And then the five-stage countercurrent extraction experiments were performed in the actual and simulant effluent systems, respectively. It was found that the optimum conditions of the experiments were as follow: pH value of 8, phase ratio (O/A) of 1:1, and addition of 0.05 mass fraction of NaCl solid into wastewater at room temperature. The reliability of the theoretical stages was verified on the basis of the relative errors (<0.0641) calculated by the theoretical and experimental data, as well as the high extraction efficiency obtained by the actual and simulant wastewater systems. The results showed that the content of DMAC in the simulant wastewaters decreased to 0.0074, the actual one dropped to 0.0078, and thus the extraction efficiency of DMAC was 97.53% and 97.40%, respectively.

AB Nowadays, antibiotics are considered as stable organic chemical compounds and their presence in hospital wastewater, pharmaceutical wastewaters and surface waters has led to some concerns. This study aimed to investigate the removal of penicillin as a pharmaceutical pollutant using Spirulina platensis and Chlorella vulgaris microalgae from aqueous solution. This study was carried out on synthetic samples at laboratory scale and wastewater samples of two hospitals in Birjand city, Iran. In this research, the effect of parameters such as retention time, the effect of pH variables and initial concentration on the removal efficiency of penicillin antibiotic by two microalgae were investigated. The results of this study showed that by increasing the number and biomass of microalgae, the removal efficiency of penicillin antibiotic increases. The optimal pH for removal of penicillin was obtained for both algae as 7 or neutral. Furthermore, the contact time at 8 and 9 d were selected as optimal time for C. vulgaris and S. platensis, respectively. The use of microalgae in the main hospitals of Birjand city wastewater has been efficient in the removal of penicillin antibiotics. Therefore, this method can be effective for the removal of antibiotics with similar structure.

AB Eighteen selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), consisting of five non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (N-APs), four sulfonamides (SAs), four tetracyclines (TCs), four macrolides (MCs), and one quinolone (QN) were detected in water, pore water, and sediment samples from Baiyangdian Lake, China. A total of 31 water samples and 29 sediment samples were collected in March 2017. Caffeine was detected with 100% frequency in surface water, pore water, and sediment samples. Carbamazepine was detected with 100% frequency in surface water and sediment samples. Five N-APs were prominent, with mean concentrations of 4.90-266.24 ng/l in surface water and 5.07-14.73 mu g/kg in sediment samples. Four MCs were prominent, with mean concentrations of 0.97-29.92 ng/l in pore water samples. The total concentrations of the different classes of PPCPs followed the order: N-APs (53.26%) > MCs (25.39) > SAs (10.06%) > TCs (7.64%) > QNs (3.64%) in surface water; N-APs (42.70%) > MCs (25.43%) > TCs (14.69%) > SAs (13.90%) > QNs (3.24%) in sediment samples, and MCs (42.12%) > N-APs (34.80%) > SAs (11.71%) > TCs (7.48%) > QNs (3.88%) in pore water samples. The geographical differences of PPCP concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Baoding City and human activities around Baiyangdian Lake were the main sources of PPCPs in the lake. An environmental risk assessment for the upper quartile concentration was undertaken using calculated risk quotients and indicated a low or medium-high risk from 18 PPCPs in Baiyangdian Lake and its five upstream rivers.

AB The occurrence, eliminations, enantiomeric distribution and intra-day variations of five chiral pharmaceuticals (three beta-blockers and two antidepressants) were investigated in eight major WWTPs in Beijing, China. The results revealed that metoprolol (MTP) and venlafaxine (VFX) were of the highest concentrations among the five determined pharmaceuticals with mean concentrations of 803 ng L-1 and 408 ng L-1, respectively in influents, and 354 ng L-1 and 165 ng L-1 in effluents, respectively. Their removal efficiencies, intra-day concentration changes and enantiomeric profiles during wastewater treatment were further analyzed. Loads of these two chiral pharmaceuticals were also studied to reveal drug use pattern. A/A/O+MBR (anaerobicianoxicioxic + membrane bio-reactor) followed by joint disinfection treatment process exhibited the high removal efficiencies. No or weak enantioselectivity was observed in most WWTPs. However, obvious enantiomeric fraction (EF) changing of MTP was observed in WWTP3 employing A/A/O+MBR. Intra-day concentration fluctuations of MTP were smaller than VFX. A quick response to sudden rise influent concentration of MTP was observed in WWTP1 effluent but EF response lagged behind. Similar bihourly EF variations in influents and effluents were also observed in most WWTPs for MTP and VFX in consideration of hydraulic residence time (HRT). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination in the aquatic environment is a global issue that affects aquatic animals, microorganisms and human health. The occurrence and preliminary ecological risk of 12 (11 antibiotics and 1 antiepileptic drug) pharmaceuticals were investigated for the first time in the surface water of the old Brahmaputra River, where open-water-fed aquaculture activities are being practiced in Bangladesh. The pharmaceuticals were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), operated with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Nine pharmaceuticals were detected in the river surface water, whereas three were below the limit of detection (LOD). Metronidazole was detected in all the samples with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 13.51 ng L-1 Trimethoprim had the second highest frequency of detection (95%) with the highest concentration (17.20 ng L-1). The ranges of concentration and detection frequency of sulfonamides and macrolides were < LOD-11.35 and < LOD-16.68 ng L-1 ; 35-70 and 60-85%, respectively, whereas carbamazepine was in the range of < LOD-8.80 ng L-1 and had a detection frequency of 65%. The concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin were distinctly higher in the fed aquaculture areas. The principal component analysis confirmed that fed aquaculture activities contributed most of the pharmaceutical contamination in the river surface water. Hospitals, nursing homes, sewage wastewater or surface runoff from the surrounding areas might all contribute to the presence of metronidazole and carbamazepine. The preliminary ecological risk assessment revealed that sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin showed medium risk, and carbamazepine displayed low risk to sensitive aquatic organisms for maximum measured concentrations. Thus, this study suggests that pharmaceutical contamination in different rivers and seasons needs to be quantified, and ecological as well as human health risks need to be assessed in Bangladesh.

AB Rivers may receive pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and environment estrogens, which are emerging concerns, from various sources. Understanding the fate of these emerging contaminants (ECs) from the sources to their receiving river is important for assessing their ecosystem risk. Here, the occurrence, seasonal variation, spatial distribution, and ecological risk of 22 ECs in water and sediments from the Jilin Songhua River, as well as in the effluents from the riverside Jilin wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated. Results indicated that estriol with the highest median concentration of 21.5 ng L-1 in the river water and with the highest median concentration of 481.5 ng g(-1) in the sediments, and methylparaben with the highest concentration of 29.6 +/- 2.9 ng L-1 in the WWTP effluents were the predominant contaminants. The total concentration of ECs in the river water in the dry season was about 1.5 times higher than that in the wet season. The concentrations of these ECs close to the contaminated tributary and the WWTP were relatively high. Risk assessment showed that the maximum risk quotient value of estrone was 1.07 in the river water and estriol was 2.10 in the effluents. In addition, erythromycin posed generally medium risk in the river water and WWTP effluents. It should be paid attention to the prior control of the three contaminants in the river region.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are major sources of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and other chemicals of toxicological concern for the aquatic environment. In the present study, we used an integrated strategy combining passive sampling (Chemcatcher (R)), developmental toxicity, and mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo bioassays to monitor the impacts of a WWTP on a river. In vitro screening revealed the WWTP effluent as a source of estrogen, glucocorticoid, and aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) receptor-mediated activities impacting the downstream river site where significant activities were also measured, albeit to a lesser extent than in the effluent. Effect-directed analysis of the effluent successfully identified the presence of potent estrogens (estrone, 17-ethinylestradiol, and 17-estradiol) and glucocorticoids (clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate) as the major contributors to the observed in vitro activities, even though other unidentified active chemicals were likely present. The impact of the WWTP was also assessed using zebrafish embryo assays, highlighting its ability to induce estrogenic response through up-regulation of the aromatase promoter-dependent reporter gene in the transgenic (cyp19a1b-green fluorescent protein [GFP]) zebrafish assay and to generate teratogenic effects at nonlethal concentrations in the zebrafish embryo toxicity test. The present study argues for the use of such an integrated approach, combining passive sampling, bioassays, and effect-directed analysis, to comprehensively identify endocrine active compounds and associated hazards of WTTP effluents.

AB Pharmaceutical waste has attracted significant attention in the past two decades due to the current high consumption of pharmaceuticals together with the development of reliable detection technologies. In order to acquire better understanding on pharmaceuticals removal in biological processes, the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing diclofenac (DFN) and ibuprofen (IBU), two of the most commonly prescribed medicines worldwide, was studied using a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). An 8.5-L aerobic MBBR with Kaldnes packing filling ratio of 40% was designed. The controlled parameters were pH within neutral range, temperature of 37 degrees C, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of 2100 mg/L, and attached growth equal to 1300 mg/L. Tests were conducted for four different initial pharmaceuticals concentrations: 2, 4, 7 and 10 mg/L, two hydraulic retention times (HRT): 5 and 10 h and two chemical oxygen demands (COD): 500 and 1000 mg/L. Results demonstrated that generally, DFN had higher removal percentage than IBU in the MBBR. At HRT = 10 h, DFN removal was between 30.83 and 66.01%, while it was 11.33 and 37.33% for IBU. At HRT = 5 h, DFN and IBU removal were respectively between 31.10-65.33 and 0-35.10%. It can be concluded that HRT = 5 h is the optimal time for DFN, while 10 h HRT promises noticeably better IBU removal. Furthermore, results revealed that DFN is better removed in the lower COD, while IBU showed better removal in the higher COD. Finally, the study on their toxicity reveals that pharmaceuticals exert slightly negative effect on COD removal.

AB Wastewater samples were collected at the influent and effluent of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and then pooled to daily samples over multiple days using 6 hourly grab samples. The aim was to provide a first assessment of the occurrence, consumption, removal and release of a range of organic chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), illicit drugs, an artificial sweetener, tobacco and its metabolites and alcohol biomarkers (referred to here as DPCPBs). Nineteen DPCPBs were detected via direct measurement of filtered wastewater on LC-MS/MS with a concentration range 010.05-38 mu g/L.Caffeine and paracetamol were the most prominent compounds detected in the influent, while acesulfame was found at the highest concentration in the effluent of both WWTPs. Mean concentrations of metabolites of tobacco (nicotine: 7.6 mu g/L, cotinine: 1.4 mu g/L and hydroxycotinine: 1.7 mu g/L) and alcohol (ethyl sulphate: 33 mu g/L) were lower than those of European countries. Consumption rates based on daily mass loads and catchment population data obtained from the WWTPs were <10 g/d/1000 pp for the majority of selected PPCPs, except for caffeine (300 g/d/1000 pp) and paracetamol (320 g/d/1000 pp). Consumption rates for codeine and methamphetamine were 0.05 g/d/1000 pp and 0.17 g/d/1000 pp, respectively. Consistently across the two WWTPs most of the chemicals (10) showed >80% apparent removal rate from the wastewater, three chemicals showed apparent removal efficiency of approximately 50%; and the removal efficiency could not be assessed for 5 compounds due to their low concentrations in the influent. Based on the fraction of treated and untreated wastewater (10:90) that is released into the receiving environment we estimated a total discharge of approximately 170 kg per day of DPCPBs in Ho Chi Minh City.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical and steroid compounds in groundwater due to wastewater reuse has been reported and is of concern in tropical islands which primarily rely on groundwater. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and removal of 43 pharmaceutical and steroid compounds detected in wastewater at four different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Hawaii and to understand their environmental behavior through tropical soils as the treated effluents are used in landscapes for irrigation. Eight soil sampling locations, collected at three different depths, representing the most common soil types in Hawaii and four WWTPs located across the major Hawaiian Islands were used. Disturbed soil samples were used to conduct the soil sorption and degradation studies and to estimate the leaching risk associated to the identified compounds. Quantification of selected compounds was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   Among the investigated compounds, only ten were detected in the treated effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 0.900 mu g L-1. Caffeine (64 mu g L-1) and ibuprofen (96.5 mu g L-1) showed the highest concentration in raw samples, while diphenhydramine (0.9 mu g L-1) showed the highest concentration in treated effluent samples. Sulfamethoxazole showed the lowest removal (0-75%). Several pharmaceuticals showed consistently higher sorption capacity and longer persistency compared with steroids regardless of soil types and depths. Poamoho (Oxisol soil) and Waimanalo (Mollisol soil) showed the highest sorption capacity, while Waimea (Entisol soil) showed the lowest sorption capacity. Soil physico-chemical properties (i.e., day content, level of organic carbon, and presence of metal oxide) and soil depth highly impacted the sorption behavior of the selected pharmaceutical compounds. In particular, the sorption capacity decreased with soil depth due to the higher level of organic carbon present in the first 30 cm compared with the deeper depths (60-90 cm). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, residues of the neuropsychiatric and illicit drugs including stimulants, opioids, hallucinogens, anti-schizophrenics, sedatives, and antidepressants were determined in influent and effluent samples from a small wastewater treatment plant, a receiving creek, and river waters in the Four Rivers region of the Midwestern United States. Nineteen neuropsychiatric drugs, eight illicit drugs, and three metabolites of illicit drugs were detected and quantitated in the water samples using HPLC-MS/MS. Residual concentrations of the drugs varied from below the detection limit to sub-mu g/L levels. The source of residual cocaine and benzoylecgonine in wastewater is primarily from human consumption of cocaine rather than direct disposal. Wastewater based epidemiology is utilized to estimate the community usage of drugs based on the concentration of drug residues in wastewater, wastewater inflow, and the population served by the centralized wastewater treatment plant. The per-capita consumption rate of methamphetamine (1740 mg/d/1000 people) and amphetamine (970 mg/d/ 1000 people) found in this study were the highest reported per-capita consumption rates in the USA. Antidepressant venlafaxine found to have the highest environmental emission from the WWTP (333 +/- 160 mg/d/1000 people) followed by citalopram (132 +/- 60.2 mg/d/1000 people), methamphetamine (111 +/- 43.6 mg/d/1000 people), and hydrocodone (108 +/- 90.1 mg/d/1000 people). Bee Creek, an immediate receiving water body, is found to be a source of several neuropsychiatric and illicit drugs including methamphetamine, methadone, alprazolam, oxazepam, temazepam, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram, sertraline, oxycodone, and hydrocodone (p < 0.036) in the Clarks River.

AB The performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is generally evaluated on the basis of chemical analysis. In this work, we used a combination of chemical, toxicological, and molecular analyses to assess the attenuation of PhACs, toxic potency and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a field study of three CWs serving as tertiary treatment of wastewater treatment plants. First, 17 PhACs were analysed chemically, of which 14 were detected and seven at concentrations >0.1 mu g/l. Even though some of the individual PhACs were moderately or highly removed in the CWs investigated, median removal of overall PhACs was approximately 50% in the vertical subsurface flow CW (VSF-CW) with a lower hydraulic loading rate while the removal in the other two free water surface flow CWs (SF-CWs) was negligible. Second, toxic potency of wastewater extracts was assessed in a range of bioassays. Estrogenicity was overall attenuated in CWs, while the neurotoxic potency of wastewater extracts did not decrease after passage through the two CWs investigated. Third, the VSF-CW and one of the SF-CW showed a positive removal of an integrase gene and three ARGs tested. The increased concentrations of ARGs in the other SF-CW, as well as the increase of total bacteria in all CWs, may relate to regrowth of resistance-carrying bacteria. Finally, multivariate analysis shows that most PhACs are positively correlated to the observed toxic potency. Additionally, low removal of organics and nutrients seems to parallel with low removal of PhACs. ARGs positively correlated with organics, nutrients and some PhACs, and the integrase gene but not to the respective antibiotics. The insufficient removal of PhACs, toxic po- tency, and ARGs indicates the need of an optimal design of CWs as tertiary treatment facilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of 4 typical pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in sewage sludge, i.e. diclofenac (DCF), clofibric acid (CFA), carbamazepine (CBM), and triclosan (TCS), was evaluated during 3 integrated processes of anaerobic digestions (ADs). The integrated processes included ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses (MEADS), ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses together with ultrasonic irradiation pre-treatment (MEUADs), and ADs integrated with mixed enzymolyses together with mechanical rotary disc post-treatment (MEADRDs). The SRTs were set at 15 d. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) following solid-phase extraction was used to analyze and detect the target compounds. Under the mesophilic condition, the highest removal during MEAD and MEUAD was 67.6% and 77.1% of CFA, and 78.1% of CBZ during MEADRD. There was little differences between the removals of 4 PhAC5 during MEADRD, and all the removal rates were higher than 70%. Especially the removal of DCF increased from 40.6% during MEAD to 71.7% during MEADRD. The overall removal during MEADRD was highest with the increase by about 20.9% from that during MEAD. The highest removal during MEAD, MEUAD and MEADRD was 81.1%, 70.7% and 71.8%, respectively, of CFA under the thermophilic condition. MEADRD could realize the highest overall removal, up to 69.4% with the increase by 11.0% compared with MEUAD. The results showed that the integrated process, MEADRD, under both mesophilic and thermophilic condition was suitable for the effective removal of PhACs, and MEADRD under the mesophilic condition was a preferable choice from the energy-saving perspective.

AB The aquatic environment can contain numerous micropollutants and there are concerns about endocrine activity in environmental waters and the potential impacts on human and ecosystem health. In this study a complementary chemical analysis and in vitro bioassay approach was applied to evaluate endocrine activity in treated wastewater, surface water and drinking water samples from six countries (Germany, Australia, France, South Africa, the Netherlands and Spain). The bioassay test battery included assays indicative of seven endocrine pathways, while 58 different chemicals, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds, were analysed by targeted chemical analysis. Endocrine activity was below the limit of quantification for most water samples, with only two of six treated wastewater samples and two of six surface water samples exhibiting estrogenic, glucocorticoid, progestagenic and/or anti-mineralocorticoid activity above the limit of quantification. Based on available effect-based trigger values (EBT) for estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity, some of the wastewater and surface water samples were found to exceed the EBT, suggesting these environmental waters may pose a potential risk to ecosystem health. In contrast, the lack of bioassay activity and low detected chemical concentrations in the drinking water samples do not suggest a risk to human endocrine health, with all samples below the relevant EBTs.

AB Fungi are known to be more resistant to toxic compounds and more effective in removing recalcitrant organics such as phenols than bacteria. Here we examined the removal of phenols (as a component of Zopliclone drugs), added to non-sterile pharmaceutical wastewater with continuous treatment fungal bioreactor by its augmentation with mono-species of white-rot fungi (WRF) Trametes versicolor. Results showed that WRF in a sterile reactor (a batch mode) were moderately effective for removal of phenols (40% in seven days); however, native wastewater microbes at optimal conditions for fungi (pH 5.5, 25 degrees C) were more effective (90%, both in batch and continuous flow modes). In continuous flow mode, addition of WRF was an effective way to mitigate high loads of phenols (up to 400 mg/L), by both fungal enzymes (growth rate 0.075 h(-1), laccase enzymatic activity 4 nkat/mL) and biosorption. The study confirmed that naturaly occuring fungi in combination with fungus-augmentation is an effective approach for treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Monitoring pharmaceuticals throughout the water cycle is becoming increasingly important for the aquatic environment and eventually for human health. Targeted and non-targeted analysis are today's means of choice. Although targeted analysis usually conducted with the help of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer may be more sensitive, only compounds previously selected can be identified. The most powerful non-targeted analysis is performed through time of flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) extended by a quadrupole mass analyzer (Q), as used in this study. Preceded by solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the non-targeted approach allows to detect all ionizable substances with high sensitivity and selectivity. Taking full advantage of the Q-TOF-MS instrument, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments accelerate and facilitate the identification while a targeted MS method enhances the sensitivity but relies on reference standards for identification purposes. The identification of four pharmaceuticals from Rhine river water is demonstrated. The Rhine river originates in Tomasee, Graubunden, Switzerland and flows into the North Sea, near Southern Bight, The Netherlands. Its length amounts to 1232.7 km. Since it is of prime interest to effectively eliminate pharmaceuticals from the water cycle, the effect UV-C irradiation is demonstrated on a laboratory scale. This method allows fast degradation of pharmaceuticals, which is exemplarily shown for the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin. Using the above HPLC-Q-TOF-MS method, concentration-time diagrams are obtained for the parent drug and their photodegradation products. After establishing the equations for first-order sequential reactions, computational fitting allows the determination of kinetic parameters, which might help to predict irradiation times and conditions when potentially considered as fourth stage within wastewater treatment.

AB This work evaluates the Fenton process in the removal of eight pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, nimesulide, furosemide, paracetamol, propranolol, dipyrone, fluoxetine, and diazepam), present at an initial concentration of 500 mu g L-1 for each compound, from three different water matrixes (distilled water, simulated wastewater, and hospital wastewater). The Fenton process conditions (iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations, and pH) were optimized for the distilled water matrix by Doehlert design associated with response surface methodology. These corresponded to initial Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 12.5 and 533 mg L-1, respectively, and pH 5.0. Mineralization rates and pharmaceutical degradation were monitored for all water matrixes and different experimental conditions employed. Unique iron addition, using low (12.5 mg L-1) and increased concentrations (37.5 mg L-1) were evaluated. These preliminary results motivated the study of the Fenton process employing successive iron additions and using an excess of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction medium. Multiple iron addition favored higher oxidation of the initial contaminants. Finally, the most persistent transformation products generated during the Fenton process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) using a purpose-built database that allowed monitoring 97 transformation products in a single injection. In this study, 12 transformation products (TPs) were tentatively identified employing this purpose-built database. Most TPs generated were classified as of high toxicity (Cramer rules) and showed ready biodegradability (START biodegradability).

AB Water contamination by the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) is a consequence of its incomplete removal in wastewater and sewage treatment plants, which is potentialized by interactions with other pharmaceutical contaminants. In this context, electron beam irradiation (EBI) has been considered a clean technology for degrading pharmaceutical compounds in water. Nevertheless, the identification of DCF by-products and their correlation with biological recalcitrance and acute toxicity are poorly understood. In this study, the V. fischeri test was used to characterize DCF toxicity in the absence and presence of fluoxetine (FLX), prior and after irradiation. The results showed complete DCF degradation at low dose (5 kGy). DCF concentration followed pseudo first-order decay with respect to the absorbed, with k(0) = (1.33 +/- 0.10) kGy(-1) (DCF) and k(0) = (0.90 +/- 0.12) kGy(-1) (DCF + FLX). In contrast, negligible TOC removal was observed even at 7.5 kGy, with the formation of recalcitrant, non-biodegradable by-products, as also suggested by the respirometry test. Despite that, the toxicity of the DCF solution diminished from (19.6 +/- 1.6) TU to (6.2 +/- 2.3) TU, and from (6.8 +/- 0.9) TU to (3.1 +/- 0.2) TU, in the absence and presence of FLX, respectively, after irradiation up to 5 kGy. Four of the eleven by-products identified by direct-injection MS were easily degraded by EBI, and one (C13H14ClNO5) was considered the least recalcitrant but the most toxic. Based on these results, a possible DCF degradation pathway is proposed, involving hydroxylation and oxidation of aromatic rings, dehalogenation and C - N bond cleavage.

AB The assessment of vulnerability in karst systems reveals to be extremely challenging since it varies significantly with time and highly depends on the identification of diffuse and concentrated infiltration from surface karst features. The origin, consumed loads, and transport mode of selected micropollutants (MPs) including two artificial sweeteners (ASWs) Sucralose (SUC) and Acesulfame-K (ACE-K), in addition to other less investigated pharmaceuticals such as the lipid regulator Gemfibrozil (GEM), and the contrast media Iohexol (IOX) were investigated in a karst system under dynamic conditions. A detailed analysis of selected spring responses' chemograph and hydrograph following a multi precipitation event shows that three of the tracked MPs, especially ACE-K, and to the exception of IOX, can be used as specific indicators for point source domestic wastewater in karst systems. They have revealed to be persistent, source specific, conservative, and highly correlated with in situ parameters easily measurable at the spring (chloride and turbidity). Even if the selected MPs are found in the system during low flow periods, they are mostly transported to the spring through fast flow pathways from flushed wastewater with surface water or flood rainwater. The highest mass inflow of ACE-K, IOX and GEM originated from a sinking stream, while SUC infiltrated exclusively through fast infiltration points (dolines). Their breakthrough curves coincide with the arrival of new waters and turbidity peaks. Unlike IOX, the mass fluxes of ASWs, and GEM to a lesser extent, can be linearly correlated with chloride mass fluxes and turbidity flux. Moreover, the variance of the normalized breakthrough curves of the MPs with respect to a mean transit time, increases in that order IOX < GEM < Turbidity < SUC < ACE-K indicating a higher restitution time for ACE-K with respect to other spring signals.

AB Environmental occurrence of CECs poses a great threat to both aquatic life and human health. The aim of this study was to optimize and validate SPE/LC-(ESI) MS-MS method for simultaneous quantitative monitoring of two sub-classes of CECs (pharmaceuticals and hormones) and to estimate the concentrations of select CECs in environmental water samples. For all the tested analytes, recoveries in laboratory reagent water were greater than 81%. Average percent (relative standard deviation) RSD of the analytes in recovery, repeatability, and reproducibility experiments were <= 10%. Determination coefficients (r(2)) of primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were estimated to be 0.9979, 0.9972, 0.9968, and 0.9962, respectively. Limits of detection (LOD) for primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were 4.63 ng/L, 5.36 ng/L, 0.55 ng/L, and 0.88 ng/L, respectively. Limits of quantification (LOQ) for primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were 14.72 ng/L, 17.06 ng/L, 1.766 ng/L, and 2.813 ng/L, respectively. Average recoveries in environmental water and wastewater samples were greater than 74% and RSD were <= 7%. Trace levels (68.33-125.70 ng/L) of primidone were detected in four environmental water samples, whereas diclofenac was not detected in any of the tested sample. Trace levels of progesterone were observed in two environmental samples (16.64-203.73 ng/L), whereas testosterone was detected in STP inlet sample (178.16 ng/L).

AB Recently scientific community has turned its attention to the organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and hormones, because the ecotoxicological effects of chronic exposure are uncertain. These substances are neither completely degraded nor monitored in sewage treatment, which makes the aquatic environment the main disseminant, due to the usual discharge of domestic and industrial sewage. Therefore, the current work aims to develop quantitative method using HPLC-UV-DAD-FLD detection in order to determine the psychoactive drugs fluoxetine and haloperidol, potential environmental contaminants in surface water. The solid phase extraction was performed to preconcentrate of the analytes of interest in aqueous matrices, in which it was evaluated univariate for reconstitution volume and pH, and via factorial planning 2(3) for the other variables. The best conditions were obtained by conditioning with 5 mL of acetonitrile and 5 mL of water pH 4.0, 100 mL of sample (pH 4.0), eluting with 5 mL of acetonitrile and reconstitution with 1 mL of water. The recovery rate was 73.7% and 87.2% for haloperidol and fluoxetine, respectively. The method was developed in real samples fortified with standards and real samples from three different points of the Belem river in Curitiba-PR.

AB Over-the-counter pharmaceutical compounds can serve as microbial substrates in wastewater treatment processes as well as in the environment. The metabolic pathways and intermediates produced during their degradation, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate an anaerobic wastewater community that metabolizes naproxen via demethylation. Enriched cultures, established from anaerobic digester inocula receiving naproxen as the sole carbon source, transformed naproxen to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen (DMN) within 22 days. Continual enrichment and culture transfer resulted in consistent demethylation of naproxen with no loss of DMN observed. Methane was generated at 0.83 mmol per 1 mmol transformed naproxen. In addition to naproxen, the consortium readily demethylated syringic acid and vanillic acid. DNA analysis revealed a community of acetogenic bacteria and syntrophic acetate oxidizing archaea. Combined with the biotransformation data, this suggests the enriched consortium performs aromatic O-demethylation through a syntrophic relationship between specific acetogens, acetate oxidizers, and methanogens. The proposed model of carbon transfer through the anaerobic food web highlights the significance of linked community interactions in the anaerobic transformation of aromatic O-methyl compounds such as naproxen.

AB BACKGROUNDAzithromycin (AZM), a 15-member macrolide antibiotic, has caused widespread pollution in China, where anaerobic digestion is the predominant wastewater treatment technology. However, the type of anaerobic sludge most suitable for treating antibiotic wastewater is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the response of anaerobic flocculent and granular sludge to AZM wastewater, and, using a high-throughput sequencing technique, to explain the diverse microbial community structures.
   RESULTSAnaerobic granular sludge provided better resistance to the decline of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal caused by AZM and greater biodegradation efficiency than flocculent sludge. Furthermore, there was stronger resistance to AZM-induced reactive oxygen species in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge. The granular sludge exhibited richer microbial communities than the flocculent sludge after AZM exposure to the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.
   CONCLUSIONAt high AZM concentration, anaerobic granular sludge was superior to flocculent sludge in COD removal and AZM degradation. This is attributed to less cell death and greater microbial diversity and richness in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge following exposure to AZM. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed to the resistance to AZM in the granular sludge. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Carbendazim is a fungicide commonly used as active substance in plant protection products and biocidal products, for instance to protect facades of buildings against fungi. However, the subsequent occurrence of this fungicide and potential endocrine disruptor in the aqueous environment is a major concern. In this study, high resolution mass spectrometry shows that carbendazim can be detected with an increasing abundance from the source to the mouth of the River Rhine. Unexpectedly, the abundance of carbendazim correlates poorly with that of other fungicides used as active ingredients in plant protection products (r(2) of 0.32 for cyproconazole and r(2) of 0.57 for propiconazole) but it correlates linearly with that of pharmaceuticals (r(2) of 0.86 for carbamazepine and r(2) of 0.89 for lamotrigine). These results suggest that the occurrence of carbendazim in surface water comes mainly from the discharge of treated domestic wastewater. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the detection of carbendazim in wastewater effluents (n = 22). In fact, bench -scale leaching tests of textiles and papers revealed that these materials commonly found in households could be a source of carbendazim in domestic wastewater. Moreover, additional river samples collected nearby two paper industries indicate that the discharge of their treated process effluents is also a source of carbendazim in the environment. While characterizing paper and textile as overlooked sources of carbendazim, this study also shows the biocide as a possible ubiquitous wastewater contaminant that would require further systematic and worldwide monitoring due to its toxicological properties.

AB The treatment performance and bacterial community structure of conventional activated sludge and aerobic granules exposed to antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was studied. For three months, two sets of sequencing batch reactors inoculated with conventional and granular biomass were fed with a synthetic municipal wastewater containing 2 mu g/L SMX. The presence of SMX had no significant impacts on treatment performance of the reactors as well as stability of the granules. Results confirmed different bacterial community structure of flocs and granules. During the operation, variations in bacterial community structure of suspended and granular sludge were observed in all reactors. The variations in bacterial community composition due to the exposure to 2 mu g/L SMX were found after two months in both suspended and granular biomass. Nitrosomonas, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were detected as the genes capable of degrading SMX in both biomass types. Also, Rikenellaceae, Oscillospira, Rhodocyclaceae, Zoogloea, and Shewanella varied in abundance over the operation time. Rikenellaceae and Oscillospira were vulnerable to SMX and decreased in abundance the operation time; while Rhodocyclaceae, Zoogloea, Shewanella, and Aeromonas were found as SMX resistance genes.

AB Microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications, including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from wastewater. In this work, we measured the removal efficiency of two wastewater treatment processes: an activated-sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs). The latter was tested using two different configurations. In the first one, HRAPs were placed after an UASB reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients. In the second, the UASB reactor was disconnected so the HRAPs were directly fed with pretreated wastewater. Additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation (DAF). The performances of both configurations (UASB-HRAP and HRAP-DAF) were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sixty-four out of 81 target PhACs were detected in the influent of the WWTP, at an average concentration of 223 mu g L-1, whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional (14 mu g L-1) and non-conventional (17 mu g L-1) effluents. Average removal efficiencies were similar (94 vs. 92%) for both treatment lines when comparing total PhACs concentrations. The compositional patterns of the resulting effluents, however, were not, suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered. Highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non conventional effluent (>1 mu g L-1), denoting lower removal than in the conventional line. On the other hand, elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) was between 15 and 50% higher using HRAPs. Overall, the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing PhACs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional WWTP5. This, combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients, shows the potential of HRAP technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative (or addition as tertiary treatment) to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge.

AB High electrical energy is required for the electro-Fenton process to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater. The aim of this study was to develop a novel and more cost-effective process, specifically a microbial electro-Fenton cell (MeFC), for treating PPCPs in wastewater. Acetylene black was selected as the catalyst for H2O2 electrogeneration and Fe-Mn binary oxide for hydroxyl radical production. In addition to lowering energy needs, the MeFC produced a maximum power density of 112 +/- 11 mW/m(2) with 1 g/L acetate as a representative substrate and 10 mg/L carbamazepine (CBZ) as a typical PPCP. Comparing with electro-Fenton process, the CBZ removal in the MeFC was 38% higher within 24 h operation (90% vs. 62%). Furthermore, the CBZ removal rate in the MeFC was 10-100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes. Such enhanced degradation of CBZ in the MeFC was attributed to the synergistic reactions between radical oxidation of CBZ and biodegradation of degradative intermediates. The MeFC provides a promising method to remove PPCPs from wastewater coupling with efficient removal of other biodegradable organics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, two pulps, bleached (BP) and raw pulp (RP), derived from the paper production process, were used as precursors of non-activated and activated carbons (ACs). In the case of non-ACs, the production involved either pyrolysis or pyrolysis followed by acid washing. For ACs production, the pulps were impregnated with K2CO3 or H3PO4, and then pyrolysed and acid washed. After production, the materials were physically and chemically characterized. Then, batch adsorption tests on the removal of two pharmaceuticals (the anti-epileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX)) from ultra-pure water and from Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) effluents were performed. In ultra-pure water, non-ACs were not able to adsorb CBZ or SMX while ACs showed good adsorption capacities. In WWTP effluents, although ACs satisfactorily adsorbed CBZ and SMX, they showed lower adsorption capacities for the latter. Tests with WWTP effluents revealed that the best adsorption capacities were achieved by carbons produced from BP and activated with H3PO4: 92 +/- 19 mg g(-1) for CBZ and 13.0 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1) for SMX. These results indicate the potential of paper pulps as precursors for ACs that can be applied in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the occurrence, removal and mass balance of 8 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethinylestradiol (EE2), triclosan (TCS), triclocarbon (TCC), 4-n-nonyl phenol (NP) and 4 n octyl phenol (OP), along with 5 of their transformation products (TPs), including 4-hydroxy estrone (4-OH El), 4-hydroxy estradiol (4-OH E2), methyl triclosan (MeTCS), carbanilide (NCC), dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) in a wastewater treatment plant. Generally, E3 showed the highest concentrations in wastewater with median value of 514 ng/L in influent, while TCS and TCC showed highest level in sludge and suspended solids (SS) with median value of 960 and 724 mu g/kg, respectively. Spatial variations were observed along each unit of the wastewater treatment processes for dissolved analytes in wastewater and adsorbed analytes in suspended solids and sludge. Special emphasis was placed to understand the mass load of EDCs and their TPs to the wastewater treatment unit and mass loss during the wastewater treatment processes. Mass loss based on both aqueous and suspended phase concentration revealed that majority of these chemicals were significantly removed during the treatment process except for TCS, TCC, and three of their TPs (MeTCS, NCC, DCC), which were released or generated during the treatment process. Mass load results showed that 42.4 g of these EDCs and their TPs entered this wastewater treatment system daily via influent, whereas 6.15 g and 7.60 g were discharged through effluent and sludge.

AB Granular activated carbon (GAC) is applied as post-treatment technology in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in order to increase the elimination of organic micropollutants (OMPs). However, the efficiency and life-time of GAC depend on several parameters, such as the quality of the effluent to be treated or the type of GAC. In the present paper, two types of GAC, based on bituminous carbon (BC-GAC) and coconut shell (CS-GAC), were assessed from a technical, economic and environmental point of view to further remove OMPs present in two secondary effluents, coming from integrated biological systems with a membrane or a settler, respectively. Although all GAC filters were efficient in removing selected OMPs, the quality of the secondary effluent had a strong influence on the lifespan of adsorbent material and the technical operability of the filtration systems. While GAC filters treating membrane effluent were highly effective to remove recalcitrant compounds, such as carbamazepine and diazepam (> 80%), even after 430 d of operation (> 30,800 BV), the efficiency of GAC filters treating settler effluent quickly lowered to 50% after 100 d of operation (< 7200 BV). Both types of GAC showed similar adsorption capacities and only slight differences were found in terms of costs ( 2.4  pound/kg vs 2.7  pound/kg). However, CS-GAC has a lower carbon footprint than BC-GAC, mainly due to the more environmentally friendly production process of CS-GAC.

AB Due to current water shortages, the use of water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for horticultural crop irrigation is becoming increasingly common. This practice implies the risk of introducing pharmaceutical compounds into the food chain. The main aim of this work was to study the accumulation of two drugs in lettuces and their subsequent transfer into the food chain. The study focused on two widely used drugs, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ) and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac (DCF), with different physicochemical properties in terms of their hydrophobicity and solubility in water. Three varieties of lettuce were selected and irrigated with water containing a mixture of the two pharmaceutical compounds at different concentrations. The results show the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bioconcentration factors in the case of CBZ; however, in the case of DCF, by contrast, the highest uptake levels and greatest bioconcentration factors were observed in the roots. For CBZ, the C-leaf/C-root ratio was greater than 1, indicating good root-to-leaf drug translocation, whereas all C-leaf/C-root ratios were less than 1 for DCF. From the data acquired, our evaluation suggests that the concentrations of CBZ and DCF detected in the edible part of the lettuces do not imply any risk to human health.

AB Parabens are preservatives widely used in foodstuffs, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, which have led to elevated paraben concentrations in wastewater and receiving waters. Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption and degradation of parabens in an aerobic activated sludge system. Results show that biodegradation plays a key role in removing parabens from the aerobic system of wastewater treatment plants, while adsorption on the sludge is not significant. The effects of parent paraben concentration, concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MISS), initial pH and temperature on degradation were investigated using kinetic models. The data shows that the degradation of parabens could be described by the first order kinetic model with the rate constant ranging from 0.10 to 0.88 h(-1) at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0. Paraben degradation can be enhanced by increasing the MISS concentration and temperature, or by decreasing the parent paraben concentration. Furthermore, the pH of the incubation system should be lower than 8.0. The half-lives of the parabens were estimated to range between 0.79 and 6.9 h, with methylparaben exhibiting the slowest degradation rate. During degradation in the present system, transesterification occurred, with methylparaben being the major transformation product in the incubation systems of ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben. These results were confirmed by mass spectrometry and aliphatic alcohol additive experiments. This is the first discovery of paraben transesterification in an activated sludge system, and it is associated with trace methanol in the system.

AB Background: In situ exposure of rainbow trout up-and downstream of differently equipped wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and subsequent analyses of micronuclei frequencies and hepatic EROD activities were used to evaluate the impact of the effluents on fish health. Two of the facilities (WWTPs A and B) were conventional treatment plants. WWTP C has been equipped with a powdered activated carbon stage. Here, analyses were conducted prior and subsequent to this upgrade.
   Results: Differences did not only occur when comparing conventional (WWTPs A, B and C prior to the upgrade) and advanced treatment (WWTP C after the upgrade), but also between the conventionally equipped WWTPs. There was no indication for genotoxic effects or pollution-related EROD induction in fish exposed at WWTP A. In contrast, trout exposed at WWTP B expressed strong reactions. However, here, adverse reactions were also observed in fish kept upstream. Similar observations were made for EROD activities in fish exposed at WWTP C prior to the upgrade, whereas genotoxic effects could only be seen in trout kept downstream of this effluent. Upgrading of WWTP C resulted in a significant reduction of both genotoxic effects and EROD levels.
   Conclusions: The results show financial investments in advanced wastewater treatment to be beneficial for aquatic ecosystems, especially when conventional technologies do not sufficiently remove pollutants. Yet, negative impacts of effluents on aquatic organisms can, under certain conditions, also be avoided by conventional treatment. Therefore, we recommend deciding on the necessity and the type of WWTP upgrading on a case-by-case basis.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) was investigated in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Xiamen City, China. Special emphasis was placed on their co-occurrence and the mass balances of both dissolved and adsorbed PPCPs in influent, effluent, and sludge samples. Results showed that PPCPs were widely detected and their co-occurrence was observed both in the wastewater and sludge that can be attributed to either their similar usage or similar physicochemical properties. These results further emphasize that some specific PPCPs have the potential as indicators or surrogate compounds to reduce the number of targeted PPCPs. The occurrence and distribution of PPCPs also showed strong spatial variations, as the PPCP mass loads per inhabitant were positively correlated with the urbanization levels. Both the removal efficiencies of dissolved PPCPs from the aqueous phase and mass loss proportion of the total PPCPs were evaluated and compared. Overall, a measured total amount of 8500 g PPCPs entered the seven WWTPs daily via influent with 6640 g in the dissolved form, while 3450 g left the WWTPs. The large mass loads of antibiotics in the sludge and effluents indicated their potential adverse effects to the receiving environment.

AB The distribution of micropollutants in biotic phases of horizontal sub-surface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands was investigated. 88 diverse micropollutants (personal care products, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs) were monitored for in full-scale HSSF steel slag and gravel beds to assess their fate and behaviour during tertiary wastewater treatment. Of the studied micropollutants 54 were found in receiving and treated wastewaters. Treatment reduced concentrations of several micropollutants by >50% (removal range -112% to 98%) and resulted in changes to the stereo-isomeric composition of chiral species. For example, stereo-selective changes were observed for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and atenolol during HSSF constructed wetland treatment for the first time. Analysis of sludge present within the HSSF beds found 37 micropollutants to be present. However, concentrations for the majority of these micropollutants were not considered high enough to suggest partitioning into sludge was a contributing mechanism of removal. Nevertheless the preservative methylparaben was found at 2772 mg bed(-1). Its daily removal from wastewater of 3.4 mg d(-1) indicates partitioning and accumulation in sludge contributes to its removal. Other micropollutants found at high levels in sludge (relative to their overall removals) were the antidepressants sertraline and fluoxetine, and the metabolite desmethylcitalopram. Furthermore, process balances indicated uptake and metabolism by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud did not contribute significantly to micropollutant removal. However analysis of plant tissues evidenced uptake, metabolism and accumulation of recalcitrant micropollutants such as ketamine and carbamazepine. It is considered that the rate of uptake was too slow to have a notable impact on removal at the 14 h hydraulic retention time. Despite evidence of other removal mechanisms at play (e.g., partitioning into sludge and plant uptake), findings indicate biodegradation is the dominant mechanism of micropollutant removal in HSSF constructed wetlands.

AB Micropollutants of emerging concern such as pharmaceuticals can significantly affect the performance of secondary biological processes in wastewater treatment plants. The present study is aimed to evaluate the toxicity and inhibition of three pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) on two cultures of microbial consortia enriched from wastewater aerobic activated sludge. One of them was acclimated to pharmaceuticals and the other was non-acclimated as control bioassay. The toxic and inhibitory effects on these cultures were assessed by respirometric tests through the oxygen uptake rate as an indicator of their capacity to degrade a readily available carbon source. Higher values of toxicity and inhibition of pharmaceutical compounds were observed for the control culture as compared to the acclimated one. Sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine exhibited higher toxicity and inhibition effects than caffeine in both acclimated and control cultures. The microbial diversity of the two cultures was also studied. The composition of microbial community of acclimated and control cultures, was determined by targeting the 165 ribosomal RNA gene. It was observed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, with Gammaproteobacteria dominating both cultures. Control culture was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and mostly by the genera Pseudomonas and Sodatis, which belong to common families present in wastewater. Results suggested that the acclimated culture to the three pharmaceuticals was mostly comprised of the extremely multiresistant genera Escherichia-Shigella (38%) of Gammaproteobacteria, resulting to higher resistance as compared to the control culture (Escherichia-Shigella, 7%). Finally, the microbial structure of the microorganisms present in a real bioreactor, which was initially seeded with the acclimated culture and fed in a continuous mode with the selected pharmaceuticals, was also analyzed. The continuous loading of pharmaceuticals in the bioreactor affected its microbial diversity, leading to the dominance of wetaproteobacteria and to the resistant genus Rhizobium of Alphaproteobacteria.

AB The high chemical stability and the low biodegradability of a vast number of micropollutants (MPs) impede their correct treatment in urban wastewater treatment plants. In most cases, the chemical oxidation is the only way to abate them. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been experimentally proved as efficient in the removal of different micropollutants at lab-scale. However, there is not enough information about their application at fullscale. This manuscript reports the application of three different AOPs based on the addition of homogeneous oxidants [hydrogen peroxide, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate anions (PS)1, in the UV-C tertiary treatment of Estiviel wastewater treatment plant (Toledo, Spain) previously designed and installed in the facility for disinfection.
   AOPs based on the photolytic decomposition of oxidants have been demonstrated as more efficient than UV-C radiation alone on the removal of 25 different MPs using low dosages (0.05-0.5 mM) and very low UV-C contact time (4-18 s). Photolysis of PMS and H2O2 reached similar average MPs removal in all the range of oxidant dosages, obtaining the highest efficiency with 0.5 mM and 18 s of contact time (48 and 55% respectively). Nevertheless, PMS/UV-C reached slightly higher removal than H2O2/UV-C at low dosages. So, these treatments are selective to degrade the target compounds, obtaining different removal efficiencies for each compound regarding the oxidizing agent, dosages and UV-C contact time.
   In all the cases, H2O2/UV-C is more efficient than PMS/UV-C, comparing the ratio cost:efficienc-y (/m(3). order). Even H2O2, UV-C treatments are more efficient than UV-C alone. Thus, the addition of 0.5 mM of H2O2 compensates the increased of UV-C contact time and therefore the increase of electrical consumption, that it should be need to increase the removal of MPs by UV-C treatments alone.

AB The present study aimed to assess removal potential of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total phosphorus (TP) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in synthetic wastewater simulating low-strength sewage by sequencing-batch mode constructed wetlands (CVVs). Six CWs with three substrates (gravel, light expanded clay and clay bricks) and one CW of each substrate was planted with E. crassipes to verify the feasibility of using a floating macrophyte in CWs and verify the best optimized substrate. Results showed that the presence of E. crassipes enhanced the removal of COD for systems with gravel, increasing the removal efficiency from 37% in the unplanted system (CW G u) to 60% in the planted system (CWGP). The vegetated CW with clay bricks (CW B p) presented the best performance for both TKN and TAN removal, with maximum removal efficiencies of 68% and 35%, respectively. Phosphorus was observed to be efficiently removed in systems with clay bricks, both planted (CWBU) and unplanted (CWBP), with mean removal efficiencies of 82% and 87%, respectively, probably via adsorption. It was also observed that after 296 days of operation, no desorption or increase on phosphorus in effluent samples were observed, thus indicating that the material was not yet saturated and phosphorus probably presents a strong binding to the media. ASA removal efficiency varied from 34% to 92% in CWs, probably due to plant uptake through roots and microbial biodegradation. Plant direct uptake varied from 4 to 74% of the total nitrogen and from 26 to 71% of the total phosphorus removed in CVVG_B, CWC-P and CVVB-P. E. crassipes was able to uptake up to 4.19 g of phosphorus in CWC-P and 11.84 g of nitrogen in CWB-P The findings on this study suggest that E. crassipes could be used in CWs and clay bricks could significantly enhance phosphorus removal capacity in CWs.

AB The treatment of oil refinery wastewater has attracted a significant attention for containing hazardous pollutants and causing adverse impacts on the environment. Three submerged membrane bioreactors (MBRs) treating synthetic oil refinery wastewater containing aromatic hydrocarbons including toluene and anthracene were operated at the different solids retention times (SRT) (10, 30 and 60 days) to investigate pollutants removals and membrane fouling characteristics. Mycobacterium and Sphingomonas capable of degrading aromatic compounds found in MBRs may contribute to high removal efficiencies (> 99%) of aromatic hydrocarbons at three SRTs. It is observed that nitrifying bacteria at short SRT of 10 days was in low abundance, and the resulting removal efficiency of NH4+-N was only 79%, which is much lower than those in MBRs at the SRTs of 30 and 60 days (> 97%). Severe membrane fouling and the minimal membrane fouling was observed at the SRT of 10 and 30 days respectively. Additionally, the investigation of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) content including the protein and polysaccharide induced by SRT indicated that high LB-EPS concentration at the SRT of 10 days caused severe membrane fouling. The relative abundances of the biofilm-forming bacteria Deinococcus and the bulking and foaming bacteria Caldilineaceae found in three MBRs correlated well with membrane fouling rate.

AB Background: The overall aim of the interdisciplinary research project "PharmCycle" is to reduce the contamination of the aquatic environment with antibiotics by developing sustainable antibiotics, improving the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics, and reducing the discharges of antibiotics in the wastewater outlet. An overview of the holistic approach and first results are given.
   Results: The first step is to design sustainable antibiotics, which are effective against target organisms but, after their use, are less toxic, and are rapidly and completely degradable. To develop sustainable antibiotics, two different approaches (subprojects) are applied within PharmCycle: First, a re-design of the existing antibiotics with chemical and in silico methods ("Benign by Design"). Second, sustainable peptide-based antibiotics are produced with biotechnological methods. In the second step, the environmental risk assessment for antibiotics in the framework of the authorization process and for monitoring purposes is improved. There is a lack of data for the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics on the European market. With more transparency of these data, the environmental risk assessment for active substances and for the class of antibiotics can be improved. The aim is to increase the data availability by applying the Aarhus convention and by providing legal access to environmental information. Beside other shortages in the environmental risk assessment required by the European legislation, the effects of antibiotics directly applied in marine aquacultures are not assessed by marine prokaryotic test systems. Therefore, a marine cyanobacteria test was developed, which is more sensitive to selected priority antibiotics than the marine eukaryotic algae test (DIN EN ISO 10253) required by the European Medicines Agency. Marine cyanobacteria are of high importance for the nitrogen cycle and primary production. Moreover, they seem to play an important role with respect to climate change. To reduce the emission of antibiotics used as human pharmaceutical products to the aquatic environment, the third step focusses on the main pathway, the wastewater. Investigations to improve the wastewater treatment of priority antibiotics and sustainable antibiotics are conducted by a combination of methods: activated sludge units, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration systems.
   Conclusions: With the aim of improving the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics and to reduce the emission of antibiotics to the aquatic environment, an interdisciplinary approach is applied which includes the analysis of the German, European, and international law and the development of new legal instruments.

AB Ketoprofen, 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is considered as an important water pollutant. Kinetics and mechanism of its photolytic transformation in aqueous solutions was studied experimentally and partial reaction steps were modelled by means of quantum chemistry methods. While the rate of ketoprofen photolysis was not significantly affected by its acid-base equilibrium, a marked influence of pH on the subsequent degradation reactions was observed. At pH 1.3, two oxygenated primary products were identified, that underwent fast photolysis. Deprotonated form of ketoprofen was transformed preferentially to ethylbenzophenone and further degradation proceeded substantially slower. Oxygen participated on photolytic processes both as a reactant and the triplet state quencher. The active involvement of water molecules in the reaction mechanism was investigated by comparative experiments in acetonitrile. The phototransformation mechanism proposed based on the experimental data corresponded well with the theoretical results.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals have been proposed as potential markers of human fecal contamination in recreational water. However, to date, there are no published studies describing their relationships with illness risks. Using a cohort of swimmers at seven U.S. beaches, we examined potential associations between the presence of chemical markers of human fecal pollution and self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) illness, diarrhea, and respiratory illness. Swimmers were surveyed about their beach activities, water exposure, and baseline symptoms on the day of their beach visit, and about any illness experienced 10-12 days later. Risk differences were estimated using model based standardization and adjusted for the swimmer's age, beach site, sand contact, rainfall, and water temperature. Sixty-two chemical markers were analyzed from daily water samples at freshwater and marine beaches. Of those, 20 were found consistently. With the possible exception of bisphenol A and cholesterol, no chemicals were consistently associated with increased risks of illness. These two chemicals were suggestively associated with 2% and 1% increased risks of GI illness and diarrhea in both freshwater and marine beaches. Additional research using the more sensitive analytic methods currently available for a wider suite of analytes is needed to support the use of chemical biomarkers to quantify illness risk and identify fecal pollution sources.

AB Pharmaceutical residues and other micro-contaminants may enter aquatic environments through effluent from sewage treatment plants (STPs) and could cause adverse effects in wild fish. One strategy to alleviate this situation is to improve wastewater treatment by ozonation. To test the effectiveness of full-scale wastewater effluent ozonation at a Swedish municipal STP, the added removal efficiency was measured for 105 pharmaceuticals. In addition, gene expression, reproductive and behavioral endpoints were analyzed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed on-site over 21 days to ozonated or non-ozonated effluents as well as to tap water. Ozone treatment (7 g O-3/m(3)) removed pharmaceuticals by an average efficiency of 77% in addition to the conventional treatment, leaving 11 screened pharmaceuticals above detection limits. Differences in biological responses of the exposure treatments were recorded in gene expression, reproduction and behavior. Hepatic vitellogenin gene expression was higher in male zebrafish exposed to the ozonated effluent compared to the non-ozonated effluent and tap water treatments. The reproductive success was higher in fish exposed to ozonated effluent compared to non-ozonated effluent and to tap water. The behavioral measurements showed that fish exposed to the ozonated STP effluent were less active in swimming the first minute after placed in a novel vessel. Ozonation is a capable method for removing pharmaceuticals in effluents. However, its implementation should be thoroughly evaluated for any potential biological impact. Future research is needed for uncovering the factors which produced the in vivo responses in fish.

AB There have been few reports in the peer-reviewed literature on the levels of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in municipal wastewater from the Caribbean region. In this study of wastewater collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Barbados, caffeine and ibuprofen were detected at A mu g/L concentrations, whereas two steroid hormones (i.e. androstenedione, estrone) and several prescription pharmaceuticals were detected at ng/L concentrations. Among drugs of abuse, benzoylecgonine (i.e. metabolite of cocaine), MDMA (i.e. Ecstasy) and MDA (i.e. 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) were present at the highest concentrations in untreated wastewater. Overall, these data show that there is potential impact in the marine environment in Barbados from CECs discharged into the coastal zone.

AB Oxalate-adsorbed TiO2 shows visible activity for the oxidation of ranitidine, although neither oxalate nor pure TiO2 alone absorbs visible light. The formation of an oxalate-TiO2 complex facilitates electron transfer from oxalate to the TiO2 conduction band (CB) (i.e., a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)) and generates superoxide/hydroperoxyl radicals (O-2(center dot-)/HO2 center dot), which are primarily responsible for ranitidine oxidation, under visible light. The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of oxalate-adsorbed TiO2 indicates that the formation of a LMCT complex between oxalate and TiO2 occurs through bidentate carboxylate linkages. The visible light-induced generation of photocurrent (I-ph) on the TiO2/FTO electrode in the presence of oxalate confirms the LMCT mechanism in the oxalate-TiO2 complex under visible light. Kinetic studies with varying oxalate concentrations, initial pH values, and TiO2 types demonstrate that the oxidation efficiency increases as the adsorption of oxalate and the molar fraction of O-2(center dot-) increase. Not only ranitidine but also other pharmaceutical pollutants, such as cimetidine, propranolol, imidazole, and nizatidine, were oxidized in the pure TiO2/oxalate/visible light system. The oxidation efficiency of the oxalate-TiO2 complex was higher than that of other organic ligand-TiO2 complexes (i.e., citrate-, EDTA-, malonate-, acetate-, and glucose-TiO2 complexes). In this regard, the pure TiO2/oxalate/visible light system can be proposed as a practical method for the treatment of pharmaceutical-contaminated water and wastewater.

AB Wastewater treatment cannot effectively remove tetracycline contained in wastewater, and environmental residues accumulate as a result of this condition. Existing methods use to address the high cost of wastewater treatment and other economic and effective means have been explored. Aerobic granular sludge technology is a newly developed potential biological wastewater treatment method, but the removal of tetracycline through this process is limited. Therefore, the collection of tetracycline-degrading bacteria as a biological fortifier is vital. In this experiment, 20 and 24 tetracycline-degrading bacteria are isolated from granular and activated sludge samples, respectively. Highly efficient tetracycline-degrading strains are selected. The effect of these strains on the degradation rate is investigated under the influence of different factors, namely, time, pH, extra carbon source, inoculum concentration of extra nitrogen source, and substrate concentration. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding for 16S rRNA and physiological and biochemical identification shows that two strains belonged to Achromobacter species.

AB The efficiency of five organic and five inorganic sorbents in removing 19 organic micropollutants (MPs), phosphorus, nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was tested in a two-week column experiment using household wastewater spiked with pharmaceuticals (n = 6), biocides/pesticides (n = 4), organophosphates (n = 3), a fragrance, a UV-stablizer, a food additive, a rubber additive, a plasticizer and a surfactant. Two types of granular activated carbon (GAC), two types of lignite, a pine bark product, and five mineral-based sorbents were tested. All the organic sorbents except pine bark achieved better removal efficiencies of DOC (on average, 70 +/- 27%) and MPs (93 +/- 11%) than the inorganic materials (DOC: 44 +/- 7% and MPs: 66 +/- 38%). However, the organic sorbents (i.e. GAC and xyloid lignite) removed less phosphorus (46 +/- 18%), while sorbents with a high calcium or iron content (i.e. Polonite (R) and lignite) generally removed phosphorus more efficiently (93 +/- 3%). Ammonium- nitrogen was well removed by sorbents with a pH between 7 and 9, with an average removal of 87%, whereas lignite (pH 4) showed the lowest removal efficiency (50%). Some MPs were well removed by all sorbents (>= 97%) including biocides (hexachlorobenzene, triclosan and terbutryn), organophosphates (tributylphosphate, tris-(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and triphenylphosphate) and one fragrance (galaxolide). The pesticide 2,6-dichlorobenzamide and the pharmaceutical diclofenac were poorly removed by the pine bark and inorganic sorbents (on average, 4%), while organic sorbents achieved high removal of these chemicals (87%).

AB Pharmaceutically active substances (PhACs ) and drugs of abuse (DAs) are two classes of contaminants of emerging concern that have attracted great concern and interest by the scientific community during the last two decades. Numerous studies have revealed their presence in treated urban wastewaters. This is mainly due to the fact that some compounds are not efficiently removed during wastewater treatment processes, and are thus able to reach the aquatic environment through wastewater discharge and reuse practices. The application of an optimized multi-residue method for the simultaneous confirmation and quantification of licit and illicit drugs has been investigated in influent and effluent wastewater samples from seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in north-eastern Tunisia. Analysis was performed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Out of 12 pharmaceutical compounds analyzed, 11 of them were detected mainly in effluent wastewaters. In both matrices, antibiotics and beta-blockers were the most detected groups. This suggests that these compounds show noticeable resistance against biological treatment in WWTPs. The estimated concentrations of antibiotics in effluents ranged from ca. 35 ng/L to 1.2 mu g/L. However, all five studied illicit drugs were detected, mainly in influent wastewaters. Forensic investigation performed on people suspected to be drug abusers covering all Tunisian cities was conducted by monitoring an epidemiological study of human urine samples surveying rate of consumption for illicit drugs. Hence, these preliminary results confirmed the presence of illicit drugs in the influent wastewater samples. For example, quantification ranges for cocaine were found to be 25-450 ng/L in influent wastewater samples. Significant differences for cocaine consumption across the two sampling methods were observed. Consequently, we conclude that the analyses in wastewater are more reflective of the real levels of illicit drug consumption. Moreover, the cost for chromatographic analysis is lower than the screening test methods for human biological specimen, particularly staffing. which are likely to be much lower.

AB Electro-Fenton (EF), an advanced oxidation process, can be combined with a biological process for efficient treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants such as pharmaceuticals. In this study, a biological process was implemented in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), which was either preceded or followed by EF treatment. The main goal was to evaluate the potential of two sequences of a combined electrochemical-biological process: EF/SBR and SBR/EF for the treatment of real wastewater spiked with 0.1 mM of caffeine and 5-fluorouracil. The biological removal of COD and pharmaceuticals was improved by extending the acclimation time and increasing concentration of biomass in the SBR. Hardly biodegradable caffeine and COD were completely removed during the EF post-treatment (SBR/EF). During the EF/SBR sequence, complete removal of pharmaceuticals was achieved by EF within 30 min at applied current 800 mA. With a current of 500 and 800 mA, the initially very low BOD5/COD ratio increased up to 0.38 and 0.58, respectively, after 30 min. The efficiency of the biological post-treatment was influenced by the biodegradability enhancement after EF pre-treatment. The choice of an adequate sequence of such a combined process is significantly related to the wastewater characteristics as well as the treatment objectives.

AB A simple method for the preparation of a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 (3D-rGO/Fe3O4) hybrid hydrogel was developed via the reduction of graphene oxide by ferrous ions and in situ simultaneous generation of tunable Fe3O4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets. After drying at 50 degrees C for 1 h, its mechanical strength was enhanced according to elastic modulus analysis. The hydrophilic and strength-enhanced hybrid was suitable for the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals including ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TC). Their adsorption kinetics, isotherms, pH and cation effects on 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 were studied. The adsorption capacities of 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 were 2.78 mmol g(-1) for CIP and 4.76 mmol g(-1) for TC according to the Langmuir fitting results, which are much higher than those of commercial granular activated carbons and other graphene-based hydrogels. Moreover, the spent 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 can be easily regenerated by Fenton-like catalytic oxidation with little loss of adsorption capacity after ten adsorption-oxidation cycles. The textural structure and surface functional groups on the adsorbent were hardly changed during the oxidative regeneration process. Benefiting from its superiority, both enhanced adsorption and catalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals were simultaneously achieved using this novel hybrid hydrogel, making it competitive in the removal of micropollutants from water or wastewater.
   Environmental significance A hydrophilic and strengthened 3D reduced graphene oxide/nano-Fe3O4 hybrid hydrogel was successfully prepared and it exhibited enhanced adsorption and catalytic oxidation of typical pharmaceuticals in water. This study provided a new strategy for the preparation of a graphene oxide-based granular adsorbent with high adsorption of micropollutants in water, and in particular, the loaded nano-Fe3O4 nanoparticles may catalytically oxidize the adsorbed pollutants in the regeneration process, achieving a combination of enhanced adsorption and in situ catalytic degradation of micropollutants on the hybrid adsorbent. This 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 adsorbent shows promising application for the removal of micropollutants from water or wastewater.

AB Seven commonly utilized antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion) and three of their metabolites were detected in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and corresponding receiving waters including the mainstream and three of the tributaries of Huangpu River, Shanghai. The concentration levels of selected antidepressants in wastewater and receiving water were both at ng L-1 level, but those antidepressants that were found in wastewater were typically in a range of one and even two orders of magnitude higher than those that were present in the receiving water except for the concentration levels of paroxetine, norfluoxetine, and nortriptyline. Venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine were the primary compounds (reaching up to 132.04 and 173.68 ng L-1 as well as 3.03 and 4.53 ng L-1 in wastewater and receiving water, respectively). Based on the mass loadings of selected antidepressants in four WWTPs, the mass loading of sertraline in effluent for this study was at the highest level when compared to other countries. The important finding was that the sampling sites H11 and H13 were much more likely to be polluted by side-pollution sources (the accumulation areas of Grade A of Class-three hospitals and pharmaceutical factories) than point pollution sources (WWTP 1 and WWTP2) through analysis of Spearman correlation. The results have shown that the RQs for these antidepressants were less than 0.1 except for the RQ of venlafaxine in an effluent for mollusks, which was less than 1. This indicated that the concentration levels of antidepressants would not pose a high risk for aquatic organisms, but sustained attention should still be paid.

AB PPCPs and pesticides have been documented throughout the world over the years, yet relatively little is known about the factors affecting their spatial distribution and temporal change in order to know their potential risk to the ecosystem or human health in the future. In our study, 5 PPCPs and 9 pesticides were selected to study their occurrence, impact variables and potential risk in a drinking water reservoir in Yangtze Estuary and related drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in China. The detection results showed the presence of PPCPs and pesticides reflected in a large part of croplands and urban and built-up land in the adjacent basin. The discrepancy of concentration among the different PPCPs and pesticides was mainly decided by their application amount or daily usage. Then, the major factors regulating the occurrence of these contaminants in the surface water were found as the living expenditure attributed to food and medicine based on a correlation analysis. Also, the PPCPs were found to negatively correlate to the effectiveness of sewage management. The detection of the PPCPs and pesticides in DWTPs indicated that, except for atrazine and simazine, the removal percentages were increased significantly in advanced DWTPs. Moreover, risk assessment estimated by a Risk Quotient and Hazard Quotient showed that while caffeine, bisphenol A, estrone and simazine were at a high-risk level in the reservoir water, all of the contaminants detected posed no risk to human health through drinking water. It's possible that atrazine could pose a high risk to the ecosystem while simazine could pose a risk to human health in the future considering the increasing expenditure attributed to food.

AB In Nigeria, pharmaceutical wastewaters are routinely disseminated in river waters; this could be associated with public health risk to humans and animals. In this study, we characterized antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and their antibiotic resistance profile as well as screening for sul1 and sul2 genes in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. Bacterial composition of the wastewater sources was isolated on non-selective media and characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA genes, with subsequent grouping using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. The antibiotics sensitivity profiles were investigated using the standard disk diffusion plate method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antibiotics on the bacterial isolates. A total of 254 bacterial strains were isolated, and majority of the isolates were identified as Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. A total of 218 (85.8%) of the bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. High MICs values were observed for all antibiotics used in the study. The result showed that 31.7%, 21.7% and 43.3% of the bacterial isolates harbored sul1, sul2, and Intl1 genes, respectively. Pharmaceuticals wastewaters are potential reservoirs of ARBs which may harbor resistance genes with possible risk to public health.

AB Reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation of crops is growing in arid and semi-arid regions, whilst increasing amounts of biosolids are being applied to fields to improve agricultural outputs. Due to incomplete removal in the wastewater treatment processes, pharmaceuticals present in treated wastewater and biosolids can contaminate soil systems. Benzodiazepines are a widely used class of pharmaceuticals that are released following wastewater treatment. Benzodiazepines are represented by a class of compounds with a range of physicochemical properties and this study was therefore designed to evaluate the influence of soil properties on the sorption behaviour and subsequent uptake of seven benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam. flurazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam) in two plant species. The sorption and desorption behaviour of benzodiazepines was strongly influenced by soil type and hydrophobicity of the chemical. The partitioning behaviour of these chemicals in soil was a key controller of the uptake and accumulation of benzodiazepines by radish (Raphanus sativus) and silverbeet (Beta vulgaris). Benzodiazepines such as oxazepam that were neutral, had low sorption coefficients (K-d) or had pH-adjusted log octanol-water partition coefficients (log D-ow, pH 6.3) values close to 2 had the greatest extent of uptake. Conversely, benzodiazepines such as flurazepam that had an ionised functional groups and greater K-d values had comparatively limited accumulation in the selected plant species. Results also revealed active in-plant metabolism of benzodiazepines, potentially analogous to the known metabolic transformation pathway of benzodiazepines in humans. Along with this observed biological transformation of benzodiazepines in exposed plants, previously work has established the widespread presence of the plant signalling molecule-y-amino butyric acid (GABA), which is specifically modulated by benzodiazepines in humans. This highlights the need for further assessment of the potential for biological activity of benzodiazepines following their plant uptake. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Some refractory organic matters or soluble microbial products remained in the effluents of refractory organic wastewater after biological secondary treatment and need an advanced treatment before final disposal. Graphene oxide (GO) was known to have potential to be the next generation membrane material. The functional organics/inorganic salts separation GO membrane preparation and application in wastewater advanced treatment could reduce energy or chemicals consumption and avoid organics/inorganic salts mixed concentrate waste problems after nanofiltration or reverse osmosis. In this study, we developed a novelty GO membrane aiming at advanced purification of organic matters in the secondary effluents of refractory organic wastewater and avoiding the organics/inorganic salts mixed concentrate waste problem. The influence of preparation conditions including pore size of support membrane, the number of GO layers and the applied pressure was investigated. It was found that for organics/inorganic salts mixture separation membrane preparation, the rejection and flux would achieve balance for the support membrane at a pore size of similar to 0.1 mu m and the number of GO layers of has an optimization value (similar to 10 layers). A higher assemble pressure (similar to 10 bar) contributed to the acquisition of a higher rejection efficiency and lower roughness membrane. This as prepared GO membrane was applied to practical secondary effluent of a chemical synthesis pharmaceuticals wastewater. A good organic matter rejection efficiency (76%) and limited salt separation ( <14%) was finally obtained. These results can promote the practical application of GO membrane and the resourcelized treatment of industrial wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory tests were conducted with five endocrine disruptors (bishenol A, triclosan. nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate and nonylphenol diethoxylate) under different redox conditions (aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic and sulfate-reducing conditions) to assess abiotic and biotic degradation in a river water/sediment system. The river water sample was collected from Spercheios River while the sediment was collected from the banks of a tributary of the river at the point where the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant is located. To describe quantitatively elimination kinetics of the target compounds, pseudo first-order kinetics were adopted. According to the results from the microcosms studies, it can be stated that the substances are eliminated from the aqueous phase with relatively high rates under aerobic conditions due to both sorption and biotransformation processes. However, when reduced oxygen conditions were established in the microcosms incubations, biotransformation decreased, indicating the almost complete cease of the EDCs microbial degradation, while substances' sorption onto sediments showed no significant differences. All compounds were found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions, and the low to high order of the calculated dissipation rate constants was 0.064 +/- 0.004 d(-1) (TCS) -> 0.067 +/- 0.006 d(-1) (NP) -> 0.076 +/- 0.009 d(-1) (Spercheios) -> 0.081 +/- 0.007 d(-1) (NP1EO) - 0.103 = 0.011 d -1 ( BPA). Finally, regarding the biotransformation experiments, the elimination of the compounds limited in the absence of oxygen as compared to aerobic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing were used to simultaneously examine both bacteria and fungi across temporal and spatial scales in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The ratio of fungi to bacteria was 0.43% on average after accounting for the multicopies in 16S rRNA gene (54.63%), indicating the number of fungi was far lower than bacteria in active sludge. The Miseq sequencing results revealed obvious seasonal and spatial variations in bacterial and fungal distribution patterns in WWTPs. Compared to bacteria, fungi showed a lower divergence in alpha and beta diversity, and exhibited less taxonomic diversity in both abundant and rare subcommunities at the class level, suggesting that the fungal community was less variable in this artificial ecosystem. Such variation of microbial communities was significantly correlated with geographical distance, DO, temperature, HRT, SRT, COD. TN and TP. In activated sludge, the main function of bacteria was chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, and nitrogen cycling processes, while the dominant functional guilds of fungi were saprotroph, animal pathogen, and animal endosymbiont. Moreover, both bacteria and fungi could play important roles in the degradation of toxicants, like hydrocarbon and aromatic compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate the occurrence and fate of the antidiabetic metformin (MF) and its transformation products (TPs) in wastewater and surface water samples. New TPs of MF were approached by electrochemical degradation with a boron-doped-diamond electrode (at 15 V for 10 min). 2,4-Diamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-DAT), methylbiguanide (MBG), 2-amino-4-methylamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-AMT) and 4-amino-2-iminol-methyl-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine (4,2,1-AIMT) were identified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) and accurate mass fragmentation. However, the well-known transformation product guanyl urea (GU) could not be formed electrochemically. In samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), 2,4-AMT and 2,4-DAT showed an increasing trend from influents to effluents, which implies formation of the TPs during WWT. MBG is also formed by hydrolysis of MF and therefore didn't show this trend in WWTPs. Compared to GU, the concentrations of other TPs are generally three orders of magnitude lower. MBG and 2,4-DAT were also detected in surface water which was impacted by waste water, while 4,2,1-AIMT could not be detected in any sample. The concentrations of MF were in an expected range for influent (14 to 95 mu g/l), effluent (0.7 to 6.5 mu g/l), surface water (up to 234 ng/l) and tap water (34 ng/l). GU concentrations, however, were in one of the two investigated WWTP much higher in the influent (between 158 mu g/l and 2100 mu g/l) than in the effluent (between 26 and 810 mu g/l). This is a rather unexpected result which has not been reported yet. Obviously, GU has been already formed in parts of the sewer system from MF or from other biguanide compounds like antidiabetics or disinfection chemicals. Furthermore, lower concentrations of GU in the effluents than in the influents indicate degradation processes of guanyl urea in the waste water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the effect of magnetic adsorbent prepared from Olive kernel (MA-OK) was studied in the Amoxicillin (AMX) removal. The synthesized adsorbent, under a sonochemical method, were characterized using Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorption functions in the batch experiments were studied using the expected parameters for the maximum absorption capacities (q(m),) such as pH, contact time, the dosage adsorbent, and the initial concentration of AMX. The residual amount of AMX were recorded after injection into the HPLC. The proportion of the mobile phase was methanol to water (40:60) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Adsorption experimental results indicated that the removal efficiency reaches its maximum using 0.5 g/L of the adsorbent, concentration of AMX (200 mg/L) at contact time of 90 min and pH of 6. The kinetics of the reaction and the adsorption isotherm could be well described by the pseudo-second order equation and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a regression coefficient of 0.9981 and 0.9979, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model was to be 238.1 mg/g. The ionic strength of the solution has no significant effect on increasing the AMX removal efficiency. Eventually, application of this adsorbent was successfully performed for removing AMX from aqueous and hospital wastewater solutions.

AB In the current study, sequential nitrification and anoxic experiments in synthetic municipal wastewater were exposed to 0.5 to 100 mg/L of chlortetracycline for 24 h to evaluate acute impact on the nitrification, and denitrification processes of biological treatment. Both processes were significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited at >50 mg/L of chlortetracycline, and the results revealed that nitrification was adversely affected by chlortetracycline compared with the anoxic process. In nitrification, chemical oxygen removal (COD) and ammonia oxidation kinetics were 50% inhibited at 10 mg chlortetracycline/L, and nitrite oxidation kinetics at 0.5 mg chlortetracycline/L. Likewise, in the anoxic process, 14 and 10 mg/L of chlortetracycline inhibited 50% of COD removal and nitrate reduction kinetics, respectively. in nitrification and denitrification, 90% of chlortetracycline was removed by adsorbing onto sludge suspended solids. In addition, a higher chlortetracycline concentration in anoxic effluent, compared with aerobic effluents, indicated a dissimilarity in the composition of sludge solids, pH, and biomass production for both processes.

AB Wastewater effluents increase the nutrient load of receiving streams while introducing a myriad of anthropogenic chemical pollutants that challenge the resident aquatic (micro)biota. Disentangling the effects of both kind of stressors and their potential interaction on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities requires highly controlled manipulative experiments. In this work, we investigated the effects of a combined regime of nutrients (at low, medium and high concentrations) and a mixture of emerging contaminants (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, and methylparaben) on the bacterial composition, abundance and antibiotic resistance profile of biofilms grown in artificial streams. In particular, we investigated the effect of this combined stress on genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnrS), erythromycin (ermB), sulfamethoxazole (sul1 and sul2) as well as the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1). Only genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and intI1 gene were detected in all treatments during the study period. Besides, bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants showed higher copy numbers of sul1 and intI1 genes than those not exposed, whereas nutrient amendments did not affect their abundance. However, bacterial communities exposed to both emerging contaminants and a high nutrient concentration (1, 25 and 1 mg L-1 of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, respectively) showed the highest increase on the abundance of sul1 and intI1 genes thus suggesting a factors synergistic effect of both stressors. Since none of the treatments caused a significant change on the composition of bacterial communities, the enrichment of sul1 and intI1 genes within the community was caused by their dissemination under the combined pressure exerted by nutrients and emerging contaminants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the contribution of nutrients on the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in streambed biofilms under controlled conditions. Our results also highlight that nutrients could enhance the effect of emerging contaminants on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Individual treatment processes like biological treatment or ozonation have their limitations for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents with high organic matter concentrations (i.e. 17 mg TOC/L). These limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost-effective pharmaceutical removal. A three-step biological-ozone-biological (BO3B) treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent. The first biological step removed 38% of ozone scavenging TOC, thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation. Complementariness between biological and ozone treatment, i.e. targeting different pharmaceuticals, resulted in cost-effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall BO3B process. At a low ozone dose of 0.2 g O-3/g TOC and an HRT of 1.46 h in the biological reactors, the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85%, except for metoprolol (60%). Testing various ozone doses and HRTs revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0.1 g O3/g TOC and an HRT of 0.3 h. At HRTs of 0.47 and 1.46 h easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95% removed by biological treatment. The biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0.4 g O-3/g TOC. Ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17% TOC removal was found. No appreciable acute toxicity towards D. magna, P. subcapitata and Vi fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual BO3B reactors. The BO3B process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the Netherlands by less than 10%. Overall, the BO3B process is a cost-effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging ozone-based advanced oxidation process (AOP) that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement in water treatment. To evaluate its performance under more realistic conditions of water treatment, a continuous-flow pilot E-peroxone system was developed and compared with conventional ozonation and a UV/O-3 process for micropollutant abatements in various water matrices (groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent) in this study. With a specific ozone dose of 1.5 mg o(3)/mg DOC, micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with ozone (O-3) (diclofenac, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate) could be sufficiently abated (>90% abatement) in the various waters by all three processes. However, ozoneresistant micropollutants (ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and chloramphenicol) were abated only by similar to 32 -68%, 68-91%, and 73-90% during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. By electro-generating H2O2 or applying UV irradiation to enhance o(3) transformation to center dot OH during ozonation, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant micropollutants by similar to 15-43%, similar to 5-15%, and similar to 5 -10% in the groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. In addition, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. Due to its higher efficiency, the E-peroxone process reduced similar to 10-53% of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol (the most ozone-resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters) by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, the UV/O-3 process consumed approximately 4 -10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation. This pilot-scale study demonstrates that the E-peroxone process can provide a feasible, effective, and energy-efficient alternative for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water and wastewater treatment.

AB As reclaimed water use is increasing, its safety attracts growing attention, particularly with respect to the health risks associated with the wide range of micropollutants found in the reclaimed water. In this study, sophisticated analysis was conducted for water samples from a water reclamation and ecological reuse system where domestic wastewater was treated using an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic unit followed by a membrane bioreactor (A(2)O-MBR), and the reclaimed water was used for replenishing a landscape lake. A total of 58 organic micropollutants were detected in the system, consisting of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 16 phenols, 3 pesticides, and 26 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). After treatment by the A(2)O-MBR process, effective removal of pesticides and phenols was achieved, while when the reclaimed water entered the landscape lake, PPCPs were further removed. From the physicochemical properties of micropollutants, it could be inferred that phenols and dichlorphos (the only pesticide with considerable concentration in the influent) would have been mainly removed by biodegradation and/or volatilization in the biological treatment process. Additionally, it is probable that sludge adsorption also contributed to the removal of dichlorphos. For the predominant PPCP removal in the landscape lake, various actions, such as adsorption, biodegradation, photolysis, and ecologically mediated processes (via aquatic plants and animals), would have played significant roles. However, according to their logK(oc), logK(ow) and logD (pH = 8) values, it could be concluded that adsorption by suspended solids might be an important action. Although carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks associated with all the detected micropollutants were at negligible levels, the hazard quotients (HQs) of PPCPs accounted for 92.03%-97.23% of the HQ(Total). With the significant removal of PPCPs through the ecological processes in the landscape lake, the safety of reclaimed water use could be improved. Therefore, the introduction of ecological unit into the water reclamation and reuse system could be an effective measure for health risk reduction posed by micropollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) that is selective to ketoprofen was synthesized and applied in the adsorption of the target compound from water. The MIP was synthesized using a bulk polymerization method at high temperatures (60-80 degrees C), where ketoprofen, 2-vinylpyridine, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, toluene and 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) were used as template, functional monomer, cross-linker, porogen and initiator, respectively. Non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized similarly to the MIP but in the absence of ketoprofen. From molecular dynamics simulation, the nature of interactions that occurred between the template and the functional monomer were found to be based on hydrogen bonding. This was confirmed experimentally, where a high extraction efficiency of >= 90% was obtained at acidic conditions (pH 5) due to the protonation of ketoprofen. A contact time of 45 min was sufficient for the maximum adsorption of ketoprofen from 10 mL spiked water using 8 mg of the adsorbent. MIP showed greater selectivity than NIP by achieving a relative selectivity coefficient of 7.7 towards ketoprofen in the presence of structurally related pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the order of sorption onto the MIPs from water was ketoprofen > fenoprofen > gemfibrozil. From a modelling perspective, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model gave the best fit, with maximum adsorption capacity of 8.24 mg.g(-1) and sorption rate constant of 0.25 mg.g(-1).min(-1) for MIP. This was translated to chemisorption of ketoprofen onto the homogeneous MIP binding sites. This work demonstrated the great potential of MIP in selective recognition of ketoprofen from wastewater relative to closely related compounds.

AB Catalytic wet oxidation of high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater with Fe3+ as catalyst was carried out in a batch reactor. Results showed that the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater was enhanced significantly by Fe3+. The effects of reaction parameters, such as the catalyst dose, reaction temperature, time, and initial oxygen pressure, were discussed. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal increased with the increases of catalyst dose, temperature, time and oxygen supply. With the initial COD 34,000-35,000 mg/L, approximately 70% COD removal can be achieved under the conditions of catalyst 1.0 g and oxygen pressure 1.0 MPa at 250 degrees C after 60 min. The results of kinetic studies showed that two reaction steps existed in this oxidation process, which followed an apparent first-order rate law. This process provides an effective approach for the pretreatment of high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Ozone aeration may significantly change nitrogen form and availability in anaerobic swine wastewater, hence it is important to characterize the effect of ozone on nitrogen. In order to study the influences of ozone and aeration time on the nitrogen transformation and availability in anaerobic swine wastewater, an indoor experiment was conducted with self-designed ozone producer apparatus under five different durations of ozone aeration, 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively. Water samples were collected in different aeration time and different nitrogen forms were determined. The results showed that different durations of ozone aeration remarkably affected nitrogen contents and formations in wastewater system. Specifically, the content of total nitrogen, soluble Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) significantly declined by 10.11%, 6.75%, 17.90%, 98.81% and 89.33% (p < 0.05), respectively. On the contrary, the content of nitrate nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen increased by 613.85% and 459.85% at the end of 60 min (p < 0.05), respectively. The results suggested nitrogen form transformation and nutrient concentration change should be taken into consideration before reusing swine wastewater in irrigation.

AB This study aimed to investigate the dual role of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode and electrooxidation process in the electrochemical degradation of tetracycline (TC) - as model of antibiotics considered emergent pollutants in water - and also in the electrochemical detection based process control. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the operating parameters for both TC degradation/mineralization and its electrochemical detection in the process control. The operating parameters such as current density, pH and TC concentration range were set to achieve the best process performance. The mechanism and kinetics of TC electrodegradation are also discussed. A current density of 50 Am-2 and pH 5 were found to be optimum for TC degradation and mineralization in a concentration range between 25 and 100 mg L-1. Furthermore, these conditions enhanced the biodegradability character of TC during a subsequent biological treatment step in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The versatility of the BDD electrode also made possibile for it to be used for the electrochemical detection of TC using CV, allowing the process control with the same electrode, hence confirming the dual role of the electrode material.

AB Nursing home (NH) wastewater was pretreated in an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor (MBR) and subsequently ozonated in a pilot plant in order to evaluate the elimination of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Dosing of the pre-treated wastewater with 5 mg ozone (O-3) L-1 led to the elimination of >50% for nearly all investigated PhACs in the ozonation plant, whereas dosing 10 mg O-3 L-1 increased elimination to >80%. A total hydraulic retention time of 12.8 min proved sufficient for PhAC elimination. Specific ozone consumption and influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (8.2-9.5 mg L-1) were in similar ranges for all three performed trials. Combining the MBR with subsequent ozonation at a dosage of 5 mg O-3 L-1 achieved elimination of >90% and effluent concentrations below 250 ng L-1 for nearly all the investigated PhACs. Influent concentrations of the MBR were comparable to those found in municipal wastewater. Thus, the recommended dosage for PhAC elimination of 5 mg O-3 L-1 (i.e. a specific consumption of 0.6 g O-3 *(g DOC)(-1)) is in the same range as for municipal wastewater. However, due to a smaller plant size, the specific costs for treating NH wastewater would significantly exceed those of treating municipal wastewater.

The recovery is investigated at two spiking levels, 10 and 1 ng/mL; the mean recovery is higher than 77, 84, and 93% in sewage treatment plants (STP) influent, STP effluent, and surface water, respectively. The limit of quantification (LOQ) averages 29, 16, 7, and 2 ng/L in STP influent, STP effluent, surface water, and drinking water, respectively. The matrix effect is also evaluated in STP influent and effluent. It is observed that sulfamethoxazole, prednisolone, ketoprofen, and glibenclamide are highly impacted compared to other compounds, -99, -110, 77, and 91%, respectively. The results show that six out of nine pharmaceuticals, namely atenolol, acetaminophen, theophylline, caffeine, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole are detected in STP influent, STP effluent, and surface water. However, the means of concentration are 561, 3305, 1805, 3900, 78, and 308 ng/L for atenolol, acetaminophen, theophylline, caffeine, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, in STP influent. Caffeine and acetaminophen are detected with the highest concentration, reaching up to 8700 and 4919 ng/L, respectively, in STP influent.

AB A simple, accurate, precise, rapid, economical and sensitive ultraviolet method has been developed for the estimation of guaiphenesin in pharmaceutical preparations and environmental wastewater samples, which shows maximum absorbance at 275 nm in 20:80 ethanol-water. Beer's law was obeyed in the range of 0.5-6 mu g/ml, with molar absorptivity of 2.457 x10(4) L.mol(-1).cm(-1), relative standard deviation of the method was less than 1.7%, and accuracy (average recovery %) was 100 +/- 1.0. No interference was observed from common excipients and additives often accompany with guaiphenesin in pharmaceutical preparations .The method was successfully applied to the determination of guaiphenesin in some pharmaceutical formulations (syrups) and industrial wastewater samples. The proposed method was validated by sensitivity and precision which proves suitability for the routine analysis of guaiphenesin in true samples.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been proposed to act as point sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Hospital sewage may contribute to the spread of ARB and ARGs as it contains the feces and urine of hospitalized patients, who are more frequently colonized with multi-drug resistant bacteria than the general population. However, whether hospital sewage noticeably contributes to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the general sewerage system has not yet been determined.
   Here, we employed culture-independent techniques, namely 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nanolitre-scale quantitative PCRs, to assess the role of hospital effluent as a point source of ARGs in the sewerage system, through comparing microbiota composition and levels of ARGs in hospital sewage with WWTP influent with and without hospital sewage. Compared to other sites, hospital sewage was richest in human-associated bacteria and contained the highest relative levels of ARGs. Yet, the relative abundance of ARGs was comparable in the influent of WWTPs with and without hospital sewage, suggesting that hospitals do not contribute importantly to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the investigated sewerage system.

AB Polyvinyl chloride/polycarbonate hollow fiber membranes incorporated with modified silver nanoparticles were prepared by wet spinning method. Fabricated membranes were then characterized by FESEM, EDX, TGA, contact angle, pure water flux and mechanical tests. It was found that the addition of modified silver nanoparticles changed the structure of hollow fiber membranes and the size of macrovoids in the middle layer decreased whereas the thickness of sponge-like outer layer increased. The results of EDX analysis showed that the modified silver nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly throughout the membranes. In addition, degradation temperature of the membranes increased as the content of nanoparticles increased which shows that thermal resistance of membranes was improved. The number of pores on the membrane surface increased due to the presence of nanoparticles but mean pore radius decreased. Addition of modified nanoparticles also improved hydrophilicity, tensile strength and elongation of hollow fiber membranes. The membranes were finally used in a membrane bioreactor system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed during 28 days and the results revealed that incorporation of modified silver nanoparticles enhanced antifouling properties of hollow fiber membranes. Moreover, pure water flux and COD removal as the criteria of membrane performance increased simultaneously. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The North American Great Lakes are a vital natural resource that provide fish and wildlife habitat, as well as drinking water and waste assimilation services for millions of people. Tributaries to the Great Lakes receive chemical inputs from various point and nonpoint sources, and thus are expected to have complex mixtures of chemicals. However, our understanding of the co-occurrence of specific chemicals in complex mixtures is limited. To better understand the occurrence of specific chemical mixtures in the US Great Lakes Basin, surface water from 24 US tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes was collected and analyzed for diverse suites of organic chemicals, primarily focused on chemicals of concern (e.g., pharmaceuticals, personal care products, fragrances). A total of 181 samples and 21 chemical classes were assessed for mixture compositions. Basin wide, 1664 mixtures occurred in at least 25% of sites. The most complex mixtures identified comprised 9 chemical classes and occurred in 58% of sampled tributaries. Pharmaceuticals typically occurred in complex mixtures, reflecting pharmaceutical-use patterns and wastewater facility outfall influences. Fewer mixtures were identified at lake or lake-influenced sites than at riverine sites. As mixture complexity increased, the probability of a specific mixture occurring more often than by chance greatly increased, highlighting the importance of understanding source contributions to the environment. This empirically based analysis of mixture composition and occurrence may be used to focus future sampling efforts or mixture toxicity assessments. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB The indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics and their introduction into the environment have caused global concerns. Typically, following consumption, these compounds are introduced into the environment after incomplete metabolism, and a large portion of them are impossible to remove using conventional wastewater treatment systems. The main aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a TiO2/UV-C nanophotocatalyst doped with trivalent iron for the removal of amoxicillin from aquatic solutions. The nanophotocatalyst was prepared and characterized by SEM, XRD, EDX, DRS, and photoluminescence spectrum. The influences of different parameters, including nanocatalyst concentration (30-90 mg/L), initial concentration of amoxicillin (10-45 mg/L), and pH (3-11) at different time intervals (30-120 min) on antibiotic removal efficiency were investigated. Antibiotic concentration was measured with an HPLC device. All experiments were replicated three times according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20(th) edition. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 and the ANOVA statistical test. Optimal conditions for removing amoxicillin from a synthetic solution were as follows: pH 11, initial concentration of antibiotic = 10 mg/L, nanocatalyst = 90 mg/L, and contact time = 120 min. The optimal conditions were also used to remove amoxicillin from Dana Pharmaceutical Company wastewater. The removal efficiencies of antibiotic for synthetic and pharmaceutical wastewater were 99.14 and 88.92%, respectively. According to the results, the nanophotocatalyst TiO2/UV-C may be used for the removal of significant amounts of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater.

ID PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION
AB Pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites raise worrying questions because of their continuous release and lack of efficient removal by conventional wastewater treatments; therefore, they are being detected in groundwater, surface water and drinking water in increasing concentrations. Paracetamol and aspirin are two of the most commonly used drugs employed as fever reducer, analgesic and anti-inflammatory. They and their metabolites are very often found in river water, so their degradation is necessary in order to render water suitable for human consumption. The present work is focused on the comparison of the photocatalytic performance of industrial active gr,s porcelain tiles covered with a commercial micro-sized TiO2 by industrial process using either conventional spray deposition or innovative digital printing methods. The photodegradation of two commonly used drugs, namely aspirin and paracetamol, was investigated both individually and as a mixture, in both deionized and tap water. The results reveal the full conversion of the drugs and the significant role of the photocatalytic tiles in the mineralization processes leading to harmless inorganic species. In particular, the digitally printed tiles exhibited better photodegradation performance for both drugs compared to the spray deposited tiles. No deactivation was observed on both photocatalytic tiles.

AB The toxic action of graphene oxide (GO) and the micropollutants contained in a biologically-treated wastewater were studied alone and in combination. For the toxicity assays, the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was used and the toxic mechanism was assessed by studying changes in esterase activity, cytoplasmic membrane potential, membrane integrity, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in intracellular calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial ROS formation. The joint toxic effect was quantified using the combination index (CI)-isobologram method using 72 h growth rate data. The pollutants monitored were polar pharmaceuticals, metabolites and artificial sweeteners with concentrations from tens of ng L-1 to several g L-1. The amount of compounds adsorbed on GO reached 89.5 g g(-1) with preferential adsorption for the more hydrophilic. The most adsorbed compounds were azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, metoclopramide, ofloxacin, and ranitidine. GO induced cell damage due to oxidative stress. Short-term defence response was observed consisting of an increase in intracellular calcium levels and higher metabolic activity. Long-term damage was evidenced by mitochondrial ROS increase and strong depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane. Cells exposed to GO-wastewater mixtures were considerably less affected with lower or non-significant damage in comparison with GO or wastewater alone. GO-wastewater mixtures displayed considerable antagonism for the lower values of assayed concentrations. The antagonism was attributed to the adsorption of toxic chemicals on the surface of GO nanoparticles and to the higher aggregation of GO in wastewater. The results show that non-additive interactions at low effect levels cannot be generally neglected.

AB Anchovies are filter-feeding fish that inhabit nearshore environments worldwide. With increasing human pharmaceutical use, drugs that alter neurological functioning are becoming more prevalent in aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluent, creating the need for tests that can reliably determine sublethal effects of these drugs on coastal fish populations. In this study, we used Caribbean anchovies (Anchoa spp.) as a tropical marine fish model to test drug-induced alterations of locomotion and shoaling behaviour with a video-based analysis system. Consistent with its anxiolytic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio), ethanol decreased shoal cohesion in anchovies. We also characterized the effects of drugs known to modulate the dopaminergic system in zebrafish and rodents. A D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) and a D1 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390) increased the time anchovy spent in the center of the arena, but neither drug had an impact on shoal cohesion. Finally, the D1 receptor agonist caused significantly lower meandering compared with fish treated with the D1 receptor antagonist and ethanol. This study suggests that anchovy is a suitable Caribbean marine model for toxicology studies.

AB Current wastewater treatment technologies do not remove many unregulated hydrophilic compounds, and there is growing interest that low levels of these compounds, referred to as emerging contaminants, may impact human health and the environment. A probabilistic-designed monitoring network was employed to infer the extent of Florida's ambient freshwaters containing the wastewater (Includes reuse water, septic systems leachate, and wastewater treatment effluent.) indicators sucralose, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and primidone and those containing the widely used pesticide imidacloprid. Extent estimates with 95% confidence bounds are provided for canals, rivers, streams, small and large lakes, and unconfined aquifers containing ultra-trace concentrations of these compounds as based on analyses of 2015 sample surveys utilizing 528 sites. Sucralose is estimated to occur in greater than 50% of the canal, river, stream, and large lake resource extents. The pharmaceuticals acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and primidone are most prevalent in rivers, with approximately 30% of river kilometers estimated to contain at least one of these compounds. Imidacloprid is estimated to occur in 50% or greater of the canal and river resource extents, and it is the only compound found to exceed published toxicity or environmental effects standards. Geospatial analyses show sucralose detection frequencies within Florida's drainage basins to be significantly related to the percentage of urban land use (R (2) = 0.36, p < 0.001), and imidacloprid detection frequencies to be significantly related to the percentage of urban and agricultural land use (R (2) = 0.47, p < 0.001). The extent of the presence of these compounds highlights the need for additional emerging contaminant studies especially those examining effects on aquatic biota.

AB We analyzed the conjoint effects of sewage inputs and hydrological alteration on the occurrence of teratological forms and on the assemblage composition of stream benthic diatoms. The study was performed in 11 Mediterranean streams which received treated or untreated urban sewage (Impact sites, I), whose composition and morphological anomalies were compared to upstream unaffected (Control, C) sites. The impact sites had high concentrations of ammonium, phosphorus, and pharmaceutical compounds (antibiotics, analgesics, and anti-inflammatories), particularly in those receiving untreated sewage. Impact sites had a higher proportion of teratological forms as well as a prevalence of diatom taxa tolerant to pollution. The differences in the diatom assemblage composition between the paired C and I sites were the largest in the impacted sites that received untreated sewage inputs as well as in the systems with lower dilution capacity. In these sites, the diatom assemblage was composed by a few pollution-tolerant species. Mediterranean river systems facing hydrological stress are highly sensitive to chemical contamination, leading to the homogenization of their diatom assemblages. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Re-thinking our approach to dealing with waste is one of the major challenges in achieving a more sustainable society. However, it could also generate numerous opportunities. Specifically, in the context of wastewater, nutrients, energy and water could be mined from it. Because of its exceptionally high nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentration, human urine is particularly suitable to be processed for fertiliser production. In the present study, forward osmosis (FO) was employed to mine the P and N from human urine. Two Mg2+-fertilisers, i.e. MgSO4 and Mg(NO3)(2) were selected as draw solution (DS) to dewater synthetic non-hydrolysed urine. In this process, the Mg2+ reverse salt flux (RSF) were used to recover P as struvite. Simultaneously, the urea was recovered in the DS as it is poorly rejected by the FO membrane. The results showed that, after concentrating the urine by 60%, about 40% of the P and 50% of the N were recovered. XRD and SEM EDX analysis confirmed that P was precipitated as mineral struvite. If successfully tested on real urine, this process could be applied to treat the urine collected in urban areas e.g., high-rise building. After the filtration, the solid struvite could be sold for inland applications whereas the diluted fertiliser used for direct fertigation of green walls, parks or for urban farming. Finally, reduction in the load of N, P to the downstream wastewater treatment plant would also ensure a more sustainable urban water cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a direct contact membrane distillation (MD) unit was integrated with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) to simultaneously recover energy and produce high quality water for reuse from wastewater. Results show that AnMBR could produce 03-0.5 L/g CODadded biogas with a stable methane content of approximately 65%. By integrating MD with AnMBR, bulk organic matter and phosphate were almost completely removed. The removal of the 26 selected trace organic contaminants by AnMBR was compound specific, but the MD process could complement AnMBR removal, leading to an overall efficiency from 76% to complete removal by the integrated system. The results also show that, due to complete retention, organic matter (such as humic-like and protein-like substances) and inorganic salts accumulated in the MD feed solution and therefore resulted in significant fouling of the MD unit. As a result, the water flux of the MD process decreased continuously. Nevertheless, membrane pore wetting was not observed throughout the operation.

AB This research investigates the toxic organic compounds biodegradation efficiency of two-stage activated sludge systems with (bioaugmented) and without aged sludge bioaugmentation (non-bioaugmented). The influent was a mixture of leachate and agriculture wastewater (1:1, v/v), used as the representative high strength wastewater. The bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented systems were operated in parallel, with three levels (low, moderate, and high) of concentrations of organics, nitrogen, and toxic organic compounds in the influent (conditions 1, 2, and 3). The results showed that both systems could efficiently degrade the organic compounds. Nevertheless, the toxic organic compounds biodegradation efficiency of the bioaugmented system was higher than that of the non-bioaugmented one. The bioaugmentation enhanced the overall removal efficiency under conditions 1 and 2. However, the bioaugmented system became less effective under condition 3. Further analysis indicated that the bacterial groups essential to the toxic organic compounds biodegradation were abundant in the aged sludge, including heterotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria, and nitrifying bacteria. The abundance of the effective bacteria improved the biodegradation and wastewater treatment performance of the bioaugmented system. In essence, the aged sludge bioaugmentation is a viable and eco-friendly solution to improving the treatment efficiency of the biological activated sludge system, despite limited biodegradation efficiency in an elevated compounds-concentration environment.

AB While emerging pharmaceutical contaminants are monitored in wastewater treatment and the environment, there is little information concerning their microbial metabolites. The transformation of diphenhydramine by microorganisms in anaerobic digester sludge was investigated using anaerobic cultures amended with 1 mM diphenhydramine as the sole carbon source. Complete transformation of the parent compound to a persistent metabolite occurred within 191 days. Using GC/MS analysis, the metabolite was identified as N-desmethyl diphenhydramine. Loss of the parent compound diphenhydramine followed a first order rate constant of 0.013 day(-1). There was no observed decrease in metabolite concentration even after a further 12 months of incubation, suggesting that the metabolite resists further degradation during wastewater treatment. Bacterial community diversity in the diphenhydramine transforming assay cultures showed enrichment in Comamonadaceae, Symbiobacteriaceae, Anaerolineaceae, and Prevotellaceae relative to unamended background controls. An anaerobic toxicity assay demonstrated that diphenhydramine has an inhibitory effect on both fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the wastewater community. In contrast, the metabolite N-desmethyl diphenhydramine partially suppressed methanogens but did not impact the fermenting community. To our knowledge, this is the first report of diphenhydramine metabolism by a bacterial community. The limited transformation of diphenhydramine by wastewater microorganisms indicates that N-desmethyl diphenhydramine will enter the environment along with unmetabolized diphenhydramine.

AB The effect of different membranes, membrane modules, feed temperatures, flow rates and solute concentrations on the permeate flux and salt rejection in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was first studied with synthetic seawater and compared to distilled water. After optimizing these operating conditions, DCMD was tested with real feed samples, namely river water (RW-R), seawater (SW-R), and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MW-R). The permeate flux achieved with MW-R was significantly lower than those obtained with the other feed samples. Two membrane module configurations (H-cell and W-cell) were then studied using SW-S, spiking diphenhydramine (DP) as model organic pollutant in some experiments. The H-cell performed better in terms of permeate quality for the same volume of permeate collected. A long experiment (500 h) was conducted with SW-R employing a larger H-cell. Severe fouling was observed, but high rejections of ion species (> 99%) were recorded together with complete rejections of pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin) detected in SW-R at 9.53-73.53 ng L-1 (detection limits < 0.16 ng L-1). Colonies of Escherichia colt or enterococci were not detected in 100 mL of permeate (distillate) solution, complying with the European Directive for drinking water.

AB Recently, lincomycin has been detected frequently in aquatic environment, especially in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. Public concerns have been raised due to its adverse bio-effect and potential of inducing resistance genes. In this study, hydrothermal treatment (HT) was applied to remove lincomycin from high-concentrated pharmaceutical waste water. Influence factors (e.g., temperature, initial concentration and pH) were investigated from kinetics perspective. Meanwhile, degradation byproducts were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), based on that transformation pathways were proposed. Finally, the toxicity of lincomycin degradation intermediates were evaluated by Microcystis cells. The results showed that lincomycin was eliminated efficiently via HT and an obvious lag time existed in its degradation process. An autocatalytic model was developed successfully based on the degradation kinetics analysis. The model showed good fitness with experiments data (R-2 > 0.99). Observed reaction constant (k) increased when reaction temperature varied from 110 to 160 degrees C; it decreased from 0.034 to 0.015 min(-1) as pH ranged from 2.0 to 6.0. Additionally, increasing initial concentration of lincomycin promoted its degradation, while it showed a different trend once the concentration exceeded 300 mg L-1. A total of 7 major intermediates were identified, based on which hydrolysis, hydroxylation and desulfuration were inferred as the mainly evolution processes. Finally, toxicity evaluation indicated that both lincomycin and its degradation byproducts have no inhibition on algal strains. Thus, it is concluded that HT is an efficient method for removing lincomycin.

AB To date, the utilization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is found from numerous fields of applications including separation, storage, sensing, and many other miscellaneous ones. Their feasibility toward wastewater treatment (WWT) for several pollutants (e.g., heavy metal ions, pesticides, volatile organic pollutants (VOCs), and other hazardous chemicals) has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we attempted to provide the current technical advances associated with MOF-based WWT in reference to conventional materials. Our review emphasized current perspectives on contamination processes in water systems and performance of MOF in diverse WWT applications.

AB Changes in the characteristics, removal efficiency, and toxicity of pharmaceutical effluent organic matter (EfOM) after catalytic ozonation were investigated in this study. After a 90-min treatment with a catalytic ozonation process (COP) in the presence of MnO2 ceramsite, the total organic carbon (TOC), UV254, colority, protein, and humic acid removal rates were 13.24%, 60.83%, 85.42%, 29.36% and 74.19%, respectively. The polysaccharide content increased by 12.73 mg/L during the COP for reaction times between 0 and similar to 50 min and decreased by 6.97 mg/L between 50 and similar to 90 min. Furthermore, 64.44% of the total colority was detected in the hydrophobic organic matter (HOM) fraction, and after the COP, and 88.69% of the colority in the HOM was eliminated. Meanwhile, only 59.18% of the colority in the hydrophilic organic matter (HIM) fraction was removed. GC-MS analysis showed that 38 organic pollutant species were completely removed, 8 were partially removed, and 7 were generated. After 90 min of COP treatment, the pharmaceutical EfOM toxicity was effectively reduced based on the higher incubation and lower mortality rates.

AB We examined whether exposure to municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) compromised the stress performance of laboratory-reared fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in a field setting. Adult minnows were caged at two sites upstream and three sites downstream of wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) discharging MWWE into the Bow River, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. At each site one group of fish was sampled after a 26 day exposure to MWWE, while another group was subjected to 1-min air exposure followed by 60-min confinement and then sampled. Fish morphometrics and proximate composition were measured, and whole-body cortisol, glucose and lactate levels assessed as markers of the stress response. The whole-body protein, glycogen and lipid content were higher at the site closest to a WWTP outfall relative to the other downstream and upstream sites. There were no significant differences in whole-body cortisol levels in minnows sampled at sites either upstream or downstream of WWTPs. Acute stressor exposure significantly elevated whole-body cortisol levels in all groups, and this response was not modified by the location of the sampling sites. The whole-body metabolite profile, including glucose and lactate levels, were significantly higher in fish caged immediately downstream from WWTP inputs relative to upstream sites. There was an acute-stressor-mediated increase in whole-body lactate, but not glucose, levels and this response was independent of sampling site. The results reveal that the capacity to evoke an acute stress response was not compromised in fathead minnows caged for 26 days downstream of WWTPs in the Bow River. However, there were changes in the whole-body proximate composition and metabolite levels immediately downstream from the WWTP outfall suggesting greater accumulation of energy stores in these fish. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental factors in addition to contaminants, including higher water temperature and nutrient availability, influence the impact of MWWEs on fish stress performance.

AB Paracetamol and its toxic transformation products have been found in surface water, wastewater, and drinking water. Effective methods to degrade these products must be found to reduce their detrimental effects on microorganisms in aquatic systems and minimize the concern on human health. Thus, this study looked into the electrochemical oxidation of paracetamol and its oxidation products on surface water, and results were compared with those of paracetamol synthetic solution oxidation. Degradation of paracetamol was conducted using a stainless steel electrode cell, a pH of 3, and direct current densities of 5.7mA/cm(2) (6V) and 7.6mA/cm(2) (12V). For both current densities applied, the pharmaceutical and its oxidation products observed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) at 254nm were totally degraded. Faster degradation of paracetamol was observed at a higher current density. Indeed, 95% of paracetamol was oxidized in only 15min at the 7.6mA/cm(2) current density. In comparison to the paracetamol synthetic solution's oxidation, degradation of paracetamol was faster in the surface water than the synthetic solution, at 5.7mA/cm(2). Nevertheless, at 7.6mA/cm(2), total degradation of paracetamol in surface water was delayed up to 40min, versus 7.5min in the synthetic solution. Three oxidation products, observed by HPLC-DAD at 254nm, were fully oxidized. In comparison with the paracetamol synthetic solution, degradation of the oxidation products in surface water was faster than in synthetic solutions for both current densities. Furthermore, the 7.6mA/cm(2) current density resulted in faster degradation of oxidation products. Results obtained from this work are promising for practical applications because short reaction times and low current densities are needed for degradation of paracetamol and its oxidation products. These densities can be potentially supplied by photovoltaic cells.

AB Carbama/epine and lamotrigine prescribed antiepileptic drugs are highly persistent in the environment and were detected in crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater. This study reports pharmacokinetics of the two drugs and their metabolites in cucumber plants under hydroponic culture, testing their uptake, translocation, and transformation over 96 h in single and bisolute systems at varying pH, Ruling out root adsorption and transformations in the nutrient solution, we demonstrate that carbamazepine root uptake is largely affected by the concentration gradient across the membrane. Unlike carbamazepine, lamotrigine is adsorbed to the root and undergoes ion trapping in root cells thus its translocation to the shoots is limited. On the basts of that, carbamazepine uptake was not affected by the presence of lamotrigine. while lamotrigine uptake was enhanced in the presence of carbamazepine. Transformation of carbamazepine in the roots was slightly reduced in the presence of lamotrigine. Carbamazepine metabolism was far more pronounced in the shoots than in the roots, indicating that most ot the metabolism occurs in the leaves, probably due to higher concentration and longer residence time. This study indicates that the uptake of small nonionic pharmaceuticals is passive and governed bv diffusion across the root membrane.

AB Background: Rivers receive water and associated organic micropollutants from their entire catchment, including from urban, agricultural and natural sources, and constitute an important environmental component for catalyzing pollutant turnover. Environmental removal processes were extensively investigated under laboratory conditions in the past but there is still a lack of information on how organic micropollutants attenuate on the catchment scale. The aim of this study was to describe the chemical and toxicological profile of a 4th order river and to characterize in-stream processes. We propose indicator chemicals and indicator in vitro bioassays as screening methods to evaluate micropollutant input and transport and transformation processes of the chemical burden in a river. Carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were selected as indicators for dilution processes and the moderately degradable chemicals tramadol and sotalol as indicators for potential in-stream attenuation processes. The battery of bioassays covers seven environmentally relevant modes of action, namely estrogenicity, glucocorticogenic activity, androgenicity progestagenic activity and oxidative stress response, as well as activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, using the GeneBLAzer test battery and the AhR-CALUX and AREc32 assays.
   Results: Both approaches, targeted chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays, identified a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as a major input source of organic micropollutants that dominantly influenced the water quality of the river. Downstream of the WWTP the amount of detected chemicals and biological effects decreased along the river flow. The organic indicator chemicals of known degradability uncovered dilution and potential loss processes in certain river stretches. The average cytotoxic potency of the river water decreased in a similar fashion as compounds of medium degradability such as the pharmaceutical sotalol.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the indicator chemical/indicator bioassay approach is suitable for identifying input sources of a mixture of organic micropollutants and to trace changes in the water quality along small rivers. This method forms the necessary basis for evaluating the natural attenuation processes of organic micropollutants on a catchment scale, especially when combined with enhanced sampling strategies in future studies.

AB Background. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is one of the most common ingredients of the disinfectants. It is commonly detected in surface and wastewaters where it can interact with the residues of pharmaceuticals that are also common wastewater pollutants. Among the latter, the residues of antineoplastic drugs are of particular concern as recent studies showed that they can induce adverse effect in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.
   Methods. Ecotoxicity of BAC as an individual compound and in a binary mixture with an antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was determined towards alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a representative of primary producers. The toxicity of the BAC C 5-FU binary mixture was predicted by the two basic models: concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and compared to the experimentally determined toxicity. Additionally combination index (CI) was calculated to determine the type of interaction.
   Results. After 72 h exposure to BAC a concentration dependent growth inhibition of P. subcapitata was observed with an EC50 0.255 mg/L. Comparing the predicted no effect concentration to the measured concentrations in the surface waters indicate that BAC at current applications and occurrence in aquatic environment may affect algal populations. The measured toxicity of the mixture was higher from the predicted and calculated CI confirmed synergistic effect on the inhibition of algal growth, at least at EC50 concentration. The observed synergism may have impact on the overall toxicity of wastewaters, whereas it is less likely for general environments because the concentrations of 5-FU are several orders of magnitude lower from its predicted no effect concentration.
   Discussion. These results indicate that combined effects of mixtures of disinfectants and antineoplastic drugs should be considered in particular when dealing with environmental risk assessment as well as the management of municipal and hospital wastewaters.

AB Understanding removal mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in conventional activated sludge systems is of fundamental and engineering importance. In this study, we selected six environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals as target organic contaminants, namely, metronidazole (MTZ), bezafibrate (BZF), ibuprofen (IBP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) for the mechanistic investigation for their removal. We demonstrated that sorption and biodegradation were the dominant pathways for contaminant removal, while volatilization and hydrolysis were negligible. The sorption removal process varied for the selected pharmaceuticals in the batch system. Then, first-order rate model was used to fit the biodegradation kinetics, and their first-order rate constants (k(bio)) were ranged from 3.67x10(-3) to 10.2 L g(-1) d(-1), in order of CBZ < CIP < SMX < MTZ < BZF < IBP. In order to elucidate the biodegradation mechanism, we calculated a total of twelve geometrical, electrostatic, and quantum chemical descriptors with density functional theory (DFT) approach. Then, correlation analysis was conducted to investigate kbio with these theoretical descriptors. Our results indicate that electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, influences the biodegradation kinetics to the greatest extent. The omega corresponds to the process where the pharmaceutical molecule acts as an electrophile, adding electron density from a nucleophile. The combined experimental and theoretical results provide insight into the intrinsic nature of biodegradation of organic contaminants of emerging concern during conventional activated sludge treatment.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) recently have been recognized to constitute a health risk for aquatic ecosystems. The major pathways of PhACs to enter the aquatic environment are excretion and discharge of effluents through sewage treatment plants (STPs). The occurrence, bioaccumulation and risk assessment of lipophilic PhACs, including erythromycin, ketoconazole, indomethacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, propranolol, carbamazepine, sertraline and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were investigated in a river that receives effluents from STP. The results indicate that the PhACs were extensively existed in fish, sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloidal phase (5 kDa to 1 gm) and truly dissolved phase (< 5 kDa) water, with total concentration of ten PhACs (Sigma(10)PhACs) of ND-19.6 ng/g, 7.3-11.2 ng/g, 25.3-101.5 ng/g, 10.1-27.7 ng/L and 67.0-107.6 ng/L, respectively. The Sigma(10)PhACs for particulate and water samples collected from STP's outfall site were higher than those collected from upstream and downstream, indicating that the STP is an important PhACs source of river. However, the Sigma(10)PhACs in sediment showed no significant statistical differences in the sampling area, and which was 3.5-9.5 times lower than those in SPM samples. The colloidal phase contributed 2.5-28.5% of erythromycin, 5.8-45.6% of ketoconazole, 8.4-32.2% of indomethacin, 7.0-21.4% of diclofenac, 11.6-36.9% of gemfibrozil, 10.2-45.9% of bezafibrate, 5.9-16.8% of propranolol, 1.9-11.1% of carbamazepine and 1.1-23.8% of sertraline in the aquatic environment. This suggests that aquatic particulates (e.g., colloids and SPM) maybe an important carrier for PhACs in the aquatic system. In general, the Sigma(10)PhACs in the tissues of fish were in order as follows: kidney > brain > liver > gill > muscle. Based on truly dissolved concentrations of PhACs in the water, bioaccumulation factors were between 3.7 and 2727.3 in the fish tissues, sertraline exhibited bioaccumulation potential. In all the risk assessments, erythromycin could cause most harmful adverse health effects for the most sensitive algae group based on the acute and chronic data. In addition, the risk quotient values for diclofenac toward fish were higher than 1. These results indicate that the PhACs pose a potential risk to the aquatic organisms, especially for chronic risk.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products and drugs of abuse (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) indicates discharge of the effluent may not be suitable for the ecological balance of water ecosystems, such as wetlands. These PPCPs degrade water quality, considered as an ecosystem service (ES), provoking serious environmental impacts. Assessing the monetary value of PPCPs can be used as a proxy for environmental status of the ES of water quality (ESWQ). Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs of WWTPs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using directional distance function to measure the environmental avoided cost of removing salicylic acid (SA), methylparaben (MP), and THCOOH from WWTPs effluents discharged to Albufera Natural Park (Spain). The SA shows the highest shadow price (138.16 (sic)/mu g), followed by THCOOH (48.15 (sic)/mu g), and MP (30.66 (sic)/mu g). These values are interpreted as the environmental cost that would be avoided if SA, MP, and THCOOH were removed from WWTPs effluents. The non-parametric tests show that wastewater treatment technology, together with population equivalent (as a proxy of the size of urban areas) and seasonality are factors that influence shadow prices obtained. The approach used in this study highlights the use of PPCPs as status indicators of ESWQ quantified in monetary units. As a way to synthesize the essential concepts to implement the shadow prices approach, this study proposes a flow diagram to represent the relationship between all the factors involved in this work. The use of shadow prices methodology proves that removing SA, MP, and THCOOH is associated with a measurable improvement in the ESWQ of Albufera Natural Park. The findings of this study will be useful for plant managers in order to make decisions about the removal of PPCPs in WWTPs effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are known for their ability to enhance the removal rate of toxins while generating power. This research presents a performance assessment of MFCs for power generation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation using SMX acclimatized cultures. Experiments were performed in MFC batch mode using different SMX concentrations in synthetic wastewater. The experimental results showed that voltage generation was >400 mV up to the SMX concentration of 0.20mM (at 400 Omega external resistance). Control experiments supported the inference that biodegradation was the main process for SMX removal compared to sorption by SMX acclimatized cultures and that the process results in efficient removal of SMX in MFC mode. The specific removal rates of SMX in MFC with SMX acclimatized sludgewere 0.67, 1.37, 3.43, 7.32, and 13.36 mu m/h at initial SMX concentrations of 0.04, 0.08, 0.20, 0.39, and 0.79 mM, respectively. Moreover, the MFC was able to remove >90% of the TOC from the wastewater up to SMX concentrations of 0.08 mM. However, this TOC removal produces negative effects at higher SMX concentrations due to toxic intermediates. Microbial community analysis revealed large changes in bacterial communities at the phylum, class, and genus levels after SMX acclimatization and MFC operation. Thauera, a well-known aromatic-degrading bacteria, was the most dominant genus present in post-acclimatized conditions. In summary, this study showed that acclimatized sludge can play an important role in the biodegradation of SMX in MFCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-residue screening method for simultaneous measurement of a wide range of micropollutants in drinking water (DW) resources was developed. The method was applied in a field study in central Sweden on water from source to tap, including samples of surface water (upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, WVVTP), intake water before and after a DW treatment plant (DWTP, pilot and full-scale), treated DW leaving the plant and tap water at end users. Low detection limits (low ng L-1 levels) were achieved by using large sample volumes (5 L) combined with ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). In total, 134 different micropollutants were analyzed, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), drug-related compounds, food additives, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Of these 134 micropollutants, 41 were detected in at least one sample, with individual concentrations ranging from sub ng L-1 levels to similar to 80 ng L-1. Two solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis HLB and Bond-Elut ENV) were shown to be complementary in the field study, with three compounds detected exclusively using HLB. The total concentration in treated drinking water (56-57 ng L-1) was at a similar level as upstream from the VVWTP (79-90 ng L-1). The composition of micropollutants changed along the water path, to a higher fraction of food additives and PFASs. Median treatment efficiency in the full-scale DWTP was close to 0%, but with high variability for individual compounds. In contrast, median treatment efficiency in the pilot-scale DVVTP was similar to 90% when using nanofiltration followed by a freshly installed granulated active carbon (GAC) filter.

Here, we target 33 physico-chemically diverse pharmaceuticals in a spatiotemporal exposure study into the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater system and the Rivers Ouse and Foss (two diverse river systems) in the city of York, UK. Removal rates in two of the WWTPs sampled (a conventional activated sludge (CAS) and trickling filter plant) ranged from not eliminated (carbamazepine) to >99% (paracetamol). Data comparisons indicate that pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally, in part due to variability in prescribing practices, hydrology, wastewater management, and urbanisation and that select annual median pharmaceutical concentrations observed in this study were higher than those previously observed in the European Union and Asia thus far. Significant spatial variability was found between all sites in both river systems, while seasonal variability was significant for 86% and 50% of compounds in the River Foss and Ouse, respectively. Seasonal variations in flow, in-stream attenuation, usage and septic effluent releases are suspected drivers behind some of the observed temporal exposure variability. When the data were used to evaluate a simple environmental exposure model for pharmaceuticals, mean ratios of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), obtained using the model, to measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were 0.51 and 0.04 for the River Foss and River Ouse, respectively. Such PEC/MEC ratios indicate that the model underestimates actual concentrations in both river systems, but to a much greater extent in the larger River Ouse. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study evaluated the performance of five different sorbents (granular activated carbon (GAC), GAC + Polonite((R)) (GAC + P), Xylit, lignite and sand) for a set of 83 micropollutants (MPs) (pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), personal care products, artificial sweeteners, parabens, pesticide, stimulants), together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties. Treatment with GAC and GAC + P provided the highest removal efficiencies, with average values above 97%. Removal rates were generally lower for Xylit (on average 74%) and lignite (on average 68%), although they proved to be highly efficient for a few individual MPs. The average removal efficiency for sand was only 47%. It was observed that the MPs behaved differently depending on their physicochemical properties. The physicochemical properties of PFASs (i.e. molecular weight, topological molecular surface area, log octanol water partition coefficient (K-ow) and distribution coefficient between octanol and water (log D)) were positively correlated to observed removal efficiency for the sorbents Xylit, lignite and sand (p <0.05), indicating a strong influence of perfluorocarbon chain length and associated hydrophobic characteristics. In contrast, for the other MPs the ratio between apolar and polar surface area (SA/SP) was positively correlated with the removal efficiency, indicating that hydrophobic adsorption may be a key feature of their sorption mechanisms. GAC showed to be the most promising filter medium to improve the removal of MPs in on-site sewage treatment facilities. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of MPs in field trials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A passive water sampler based on the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique was developed and tested for 3 groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs, including oestrogens, alkyl-phenols and bisphenols). Three different resins (hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB), XAD18 and Strata-XL-A (SXLA)) were investigated for their suitability as the binding phase for DGT devices. Laboratory tests across a range of pH (3.5-9.5), ionic strength (0.001-0.5 M) and dissolved organic matter concentration (0-20 mg L-1) showed HLB and XAD18-DGT devices were more stable compared to SXLA-DGT. HLB-DGT and XAD18-DGT accumulated test chemicals with time consistent with theoretical predictions, while SXLA-DGT accumulated reduced amounts of chemical. DGT performance was also compared in field deployments up to 28 days, alongside conventional active sampling at a wastewater treatment plant Uptake was linear to the samplers over 18 days, and then began to plateau/decline, indicating the maximum deployment time in those conditions. Concentrations provided by the DGT samplers compared well with those provided by auto-samplers. DGT integrated concentrations over the deployment period in a way that grab-sampling cannot. The advantages of the DGT sampler over active sampling include: low cost, ease of simultaneous multi-site deployment, in situ analyte pre-concentration and reduction of matrix interferences compared with conventional methods. Compared to other passive sampler designs, DGT uptake is independent of flow rate and therefore allows direct derivation of field concentrations from measured compound diffusion coefficients. This passive DGT sampler therefore constitutes a viable and attractive alternative to conventional grab and active water sampling for routine monitoring of selected EDCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan (TCS); a widely used antimicrobial biocide, exists in several pharmaceutical and personal care products. Due to its wide usage, TCS is detected in wastewater at varying concentrations. Biological treatability of TCS and its effect on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency were investigated running laboratory-scale pulse-fed sequencing batch reactors with acclimated and non-acclimated cultures. The culture was acclimatized to TCS by gradually increasing its concentration in the synthetic feed wastewater from 100 ng/L to 100 mg/L. There were no effects of TCS on COD removal efficiency up to the TCS concentration of 500 ng/L for both acclimatized and non-acclimatized cases. However, starting from a concentration of 1 mg/L, TCS affected the COD removal efficiency adversely. This effect was more pronounced with non-acclimatized culture. The decrease in the COD removal efficiency reached to 47% and 42% at the TCS concentration of 100 mg/L, under acclimation and non-acclimation conditions respectively. Adsorption of TCS into biomass was evidenced at higher TCS concentrations especially with non-acclimated cultures. 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloroanisole were identified as biodegradation by-products. The occurrence and distribution of these metabolites in the effluent and sludge matrices were found to be highly variable depending, especially, on the culture acclimation conditions.

AB The widespread use of pharmaceuticals by human populations results in their sustained discharge to surface waters via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, 16 highly prescribed pharmaceuticals were quantified along a 250 km transect of the Hudson River Estuary and New York Harbor to describe their sources and spatial patterns. Sampling was conducted over two dry weather periods in May and July 2016, at 72 sites which included mid-channel and nearshore sites, as well as locations influenced by tributaries and WWTP outfalls. The detection frequency of the study pharmaceuticals was almost identical between the May and July sampling periods at 55% and 52%, respectively. Six pharmaceuticals were measurable at 92% or more of the sites during both sampling periods, illustrating their ubiquitous presence throughout the study area. Individual pharmaceutical concentrations were highly variable spatially, ranging from non-detect to 3810 ng/L. during the study. Major factors controlling concentrations were proximity and magnitude of WWTP discharges, inputs from tributaries and tidal mixing. Two compounds, sucralose and caffeine, were evaluated as tracers to identify wastewater sources and assess pharmaceutical behavior. Sucralose was useful in identifying wastewater inputs to the river and concentrations showed excellent correlations with numerous pharmaceuticals in the study. Caffeine-sucralose ratios showed potential in identifying discharges of untreated wastewater occurring during a combined sewage overflow event Many of the study pharmaceuticals were present throughout the Hudson River Estuary as a consequence of sustained wastewater discharge. Whereas some concentrations were above published effects levels, a more complete risk assessment is needed to understand the potential for ecological impacts due to pharmaceuticals in the Hudson River Estuary.

AB A quantitative assessment of pollutants of emerging concern in the Hartbeespoort Damcatchment area was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS) to establish the occurrence, source and distribution of 15 environmental pollutants, including 10 pharmaceuticals, 1 pesticide and 4 steroid hormones. Seasonal sampling was conducted in the Hartbeespoort Lake using sub-surface grab sampling to determine the lake's ecological status and obtain data for establishment of progressive operational monitoring. The Jukskei River, which lies upstream of the Hartbeespoort Dam, was sampled in the winter season. Five year old carp Cyprinus carpio) and catfish Clarias gariepinus) were also sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam to study bioaccumulation in biota as well as to estimate risk associated with fish consumption. In the Jukskei River, the main source of 11 emerging pollutants EPs) was identified as raw sewage overflow, with the highest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 593 ng L-1 being recorded at the Midrand point and the lowest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 164 ng L-1 at the N14 site located 1 km downstream of a large wastewater treatment plant. The Jukskei River was found to be the largest contributor of the emerging contaminants detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam. In the Hartbeespoort Dam EP concentrations were generally in the order efavirenz > nevirapine > carbamazepine > methocarbamol > bromacil > venlafaxine. Water and sediment were sampled from the uMngeni River estuary within 24 h after large volumes of an assortment of pharmaceuticalwaste had been discovered to bewashed into the river estuary after flash rainfall on 18 May 2016. Analytical results revealed high levels of some emerging pollutants in sediment samples, up to 81 ng g(-1) for nevirapine and 4 ng g(-1) for etilefrine HCL. This study shows that efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, methocarbamol, bromacil and venlafaxine are contaminants that require operational monitoring in South African urban waters.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of pulsed corona discharge (PCD) oxidation for treatment of the nanofiltration concentrate from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The concentrate studied contained high concentrations of micropollutants, since it was produced in the two stage nanofiltration process and filtered to a very high volume reduction factor of 300. The goal of the PCD treatment was to decrease the amount of micropollutants and to increase biodegradability of the concentrate. The energy dose (10 kWh/m(3)) used in the PCD treatment was sufficient to reduce 21% of organic carbon present in the concentrate. However, the PCD treatment degraded efficiently some of the target micropollutants: higher than 92% degradation of diclofenac, carbamazepine, citalopram and furosemide was reached. Degradation rate of the beta-blockers (bisoprolol, sotalol, metoprolol) as well as ketoprofen and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) was lower: 82, 51, 33, 44 and 50% respectively. The BOD7/COD ratio of the NF concentrate was also increased 3.7 times due to the oxidation.
   Based on a linear regression analysis, molecular weight of the micropollutants, the amount of double bonds in their structure and the hydroxyl radical degradation constant were identified as the determining parameters for the degradation rate of the micropollutant in the PCD oxidation. This lead to a conclusion that presence of hydroxyl radicals was more critical for the degradation of the micropollutants than the presence of ozone under the examined conditions.

AB Reduced graphene oxide hybridized with zero-valent silver and magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) (rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 nanohybrids) prepared via in situ nucleation and crystallization was used to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for degradation of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (phenol, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, bisphenol A, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol). The deposition of Ag-0 and Fe3O4 in rGO nanosheet enhanced the catalytic removal of phenol in the heterogeneous activation of PDS. The adsorption capacities of rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 for 10 mu M phenol were 1.76, 1.33, and 2.04 mu mol g(-1)-adsorbent at pH 4, 7, and 10, respectively, which are much higher than those of single NPs studied (Ag-0, nanoscale zero-valent iron, and rGO). The rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 effectively activated PDS to produce strong oxidizing SO4 center dot(-) and facilitate an electron transfer on the surface of the nanohybrid. The initial pseudo-first-order rate (k(ini)) constant for phenol degradation in PDS/rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 system was 0.46 h(-1) at pH 7, which is approximately eight times higher than that in the presence of single NPs (k(ini) = 0.04-0.06 h(-1)) due to the synergistic effects between adsorption and catalytic oxidation. Among various organic contaminants tested, the simultaneous use of rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 (0.1 g/L) and PDS (1 mM) achieved more than 99% degradation of acetaminophen and 17 beta-estradiol at pH 7. The radical scavenging studies with methanol and natural organic matter indicated that phenol was more likely to be degraded via free SO4 center dot(-) and center dot OH formation or a non-radical oxidative pathway. Our findings indicate that the rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 nanohybrids can be used as an efficient magnetically-separable nanocatalyst for removal of organic compounds in water and wastewater treatment.

AB The objective of this study was to identify sources of micropollutants in the Hudson River Estuary (HRE). We collected 127 grab samples at 17 sites along the HRE over 2 years and screened for up to 200 micropollutants. We quantified 168 of the micropollutants in at least one of the samples. Atrazine, gabapentin, metolachlor, and sucralose were measured in every sample. We used data-driven unsupervised methods to cluster the micropollutants on the basis of their spatiotemporal occurrence and normalized-concentration patterns. Three major clusters of micropollutants were identified: ubiquitous and mixed-use (core micropollutants), sourced from sewage treatment plant outfalls (STP micropollutants), and derived from diffuse upstream sources (diffuse micropollutants). Each of these clusters was further refined into subclusters that were linked to specific sources on the basis of relationships identified through geospatial analysis of watershed features. Evaluation of cumulative loadings of each subcluster revealed that the Mohawk River and Rondout Creek are major contributors of most core micropollutants and STP micropollutants and the upper HRE is a major contributor of diffuse micropollutants. These data provide the first comprehensive evaluation of micropollutants in the HRE and define distinct spatiotemporal micropollutant clusters that are linked to sources and conserved across surface water systems around the world.

AB The presence of antibiotics in treated wastewater and consequently in surface and groundwater resources raises concerns about the formation and spread of antibiotic resistance. Improving the removal of antibiotics during wastewater treatment therefore is a prime objective of environmental engineering. Here we obtained a detailed picture of the fate of sulfonamide antibiotics during activated sludge treatment using a combination of analytical methods. We show that pterin-sulfonamide conjugates, which are formed when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis, represent a major biotransformation route for sulfonamides in laboratory batch experiments with activated sludge. The same major conjugates were also present in the effluents of nine Swiss wastewater treatment plants. The demonstration of this biotransformation route, which is removal. related to bacterial growth, helps explain seemingly contradictory views on optimal conditions for sulfonamide More importantly, since pterin-sulfonamide conjugates show retained antibiotic activity, our findings suggest that risk from exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics may be less reduced during wastewater treatment than previously assumed. Our results thus further emphasize the inadequacy of focusing on parent compound removal and the importance of investigating biotransformation pathways and removal of bioactivity to properly assess contaminant removal in both engineered and natural systems.

AB The increasing availability of antibiotics in wastewater has created a serious threat to non-target organisms in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity of amoxicillin on duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza during a short-term exposure (7 d). The duckweed was exposed to a range of environmentally relevant (0.0001-0.01 mg L-1) and high (0.1 and 1 mg L-1) concentrations of amoxicillin. Subsequently, biomarkers of toxicity such as growth, pigments (Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids), antioxidative enzyme activity (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; and ascorbate peroxidases, APX), and biochemical content (protein, lipid and starch) were analysed in their fronds. The high dose (1 mg L-1) of amoxicillin caused a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in photopigments, protein, starch and lipid content and an increase in carotenoids/total Chl and Chl a/Chl b ratios in fronds of Spirodela polyrhiza. The results showed a shift in biomarkers: a decrease in frond growth and relative growth rate (RGR) (16.2-53.8%) and an increase in the activities (mmol mg protein(-1)) of CAT (0.021-0.041), APX (0.84-2A9) and SOD (0.12-0.23) in fronds. The significantly (p <0.05) greater reduction in amoxicillin content in duckweed setups (84.6-100%) than in the control (62.1-73%) suggested that phytodegradation is an important mechanism in removing antibiotics from water, apart from hydrolysis and photodegradation, which occur in control setups. Overall, the results suggested a toxic effect of amoxicillin on Spirodela polyrhiza, even at low concentrations, and nonetheless, the duckweed contributed directly to the degradation of antibiotics in the water and throughout the phytoremediation process.

AB The widespread occurrence of natural and synthetic organic chemicals in surface waters can cause ecological risks and human health concerns. This study measured a suite of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 8 around the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area. The results showed that 109 of 144 analyzed pharmaceutical compounds, 42 of 55 analyzed waste-indicator compounds (e.g., flame retardants, hormones, and personal care products), and 39 of 72 analyzed pesticides were detected in the water samples collected monthly between April and November in both 2014 and 2015. Pharmaceutical compounds were most abundant in the surface waters and their median concentrations were measured up to a few hundred nanograms per liter. The CEC concentrations varied depending on sampling locations and seasons. The primary source of CECs was speculated to be wastewater effluent. The CEC concentrations were correlated to streamflow volume and showed significant seasonal effects. The CECs were less persistent during spring runoff season compared with baseflow season at most sampling sites. These results are useful for providing baseline data for surface CEC monitoring and assessing the environmental risks and potential human exposure to CECs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work a step forward in investigating the use of prescription drugs, namely erectile dysfunction products, at European level was taken by applying the wastewater-based epidemiology approach. 24-h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected at the entrance of eight wastewater treatment plants serving the catchment within the cities of Bristol, Brussels, Castellon, Copenhagen, Milan, Oslo, Utrecht and Zurich. A validated analytical procedure with direct injection of filtered aliquots by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was applied. The target list included the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) together with (bio) transformation products and other analogues. Only sildenafil and its two human urinary metabolites desmethyl- and desethylsildenafil were detected in the samples with concentrations reaching 60 ng L-1. The concentrations were transformed into normalized measured loads and the estimated actual consumption of sildenafil was back-calculated from these loads. In addition, national prescription data from five countries was gathered in the form of the number of prescribed daily doses and transformed into predicted loads for comparison. This comparison resulted in the evidence of a different spatial trend across Europe. In Utrecht and Brussels, prescription data could only partly explain the total amount found in wastewater; whereas in Bristol, the comparison was in agreement; and in Milan and Oslo a lower amount was found in wastewater than expected from the prescription data. This study illustrates the potential of wastewaterbased epidemiology to investigate the use of counterfeit medication and rogue online pharmacy sales.

AB As a famous project in China, the water diversion from Yangtze River to Taihu Lake Project has impacts on the water quality of Taihu Lake, especially Gonghu Bay, which is the entrance of the diversion water and the drinking water source for Wuxi and Suzhou. To investigate contamination of the antibiotics in Gonghu Bay in the period of water diversion, 16 antibiotics in 14 water samples collected from Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay in China were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the concentration of total antibiotics in Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay ranged from 1320 to 17,209 ng/L (mean: 3920 +/- 3841 ng/L). The average level of different antibiotics was tetracyclines (range 1082-15,310 ng/L, mean 3161 +/- 3479 ng/L) > quinolones (range 225-1325 ng/L, mean 463 +/- 276 ng/L) > sulfonamides (range n.d.-888 ng/L, mean 402 +/- 248 ng/L) > macrolides (range 12-17 ng/L, mean 14 +/- 2 ng/L), and levels of the detected antibiotics in Gonghu Bay were higher than that in Wangyu River, indicating that the antibiotics pollution in Gonghu Bay were much severer than Wangyu River. Ecological risk evaluation showed that in the Wangyu and Gonghu water, trimethoprim (TMP), sulfacetamide (SAAM), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), and sulfamerazine (SMRZ) presented low ecological risk levels, chlortetracycline (CTC), tetracycline (TC), roxithromycin (ROM), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) had medium level of risk, and oxytetracycline (OTC), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enrofloxacin (ENR) had high level of ecological risk. The total hazard quotient of antibiotic mixtures for each sample site indicated high risk of antibiotics in Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay. In summary, the water diversion could mitigate antibiotic pollution in Gonghu Bay to a certain degree. However, the risk of antibiotics in the Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay is still high.

AB Micropollutants, including antibiotics, hormones, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, are discharged into the environment with liquid and solid effluent streams from water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). The objective of this research was to determine whether biosolids-derived biochar (BS-biochar) could be used as a sorbent in continuous flow-through columns to remove micropollutants as a polishing step for wastewater treatment. Triclosan (TCS) was selected as a representative micropollutant due to frequent detection in liquid effluents, residual biosolids, and surface waters. Bench-scale column experiments were conducted to determine the effect of flow rate and competition due to the presence of other organic micropollutants and inorganic nutrients on TCS adsorption to BS-biochar. TCS removal efficiency was compared in Milli-Q water and secondary wastewater effluent by using two commercial adsorbents: a granular activated carbon and a wood-based biochar. Increased removal of TCS was observed at lower flow rates (2.6gpm/ft(2)) compared with higher flow rates (10.3gpm/ft(2)). Presence of inorganic nutrients (NH4+ and PO43-) and organic micropollutants 17-estradiol and sulfamethoxazole decreased adsorption of TCS to BS-biochar. TCS was sorbed to BS-biochar in wastewater, but percent removal decreased in wastewater relative to Milli-Q water. This study demonstrated that BS-biochar can remove TCS from wastewater in continuous flow-through columns, although to a lesser extent than activated carbon. An additional benefit of using BS-biochar is that WRRFs could re-activate biochar on-site by using a pyrolysis reactor.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in different aquatic systems may contribute to hazardous effects on aquatic organisms and subsequently on human health. In the present work, liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (LC-Q-ToF-MS) was used to identify and quantify a series of ECs in Periyar River in Aluva region, Kerala, India. The water samples were pre concentrated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to analysis. The compounds were probed in both positive and negative ionization mode using electro spray ionization (ESI). Method validations were performed for linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, and precision (intraday and inter day). The ECs were quantified using standard calibration curve. The identified nine ECs include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroids, surfactants, and phthalate. A relatively high concentration was observed in the case of 2-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (1012 ng/l) and low concentration was observed for lignocaine (4.3 ng/l; since this is below LOQ, the value is only approximate). In addition, we have identified another 28 organic compounds using the technique of non-target analysis out of which seven compounds fall in the category of surfactants. Being the first report on ECs in Periyar River, the data is very important as this river is one of the biggest and important rivers of Kerala having several purification units for drinking water in the province.

AB Organic cyanide are widely used as an ingredient in the production of plastics, synthetic rubbers, polymers, pharmaceuticals and pesticides or used in laboratories and industries as solvents. Although nitrile-containing wastewater is subjected to primary and secondary treatments, residual nitriles may slowly seep and further migrate through groundwater, resulting in the micropollution of groundwater by organic pollutants. In this study, water samples were collected from different study areas in North China during a period of 3y (from 2013 to 2015) and analyzed to evaluate organic cyanide (CN-) contamination in groundwater. Three parallel lab-scale fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) were tested for their ability to remove organic cyanide from groundwater. The organic cyanide concentration in groundwater increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 2013 to 2015. With an optimal hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 54 min, reactor R3 (inoculated with a nitrile-degrading bacterium, BX2, and a biofilm-forming bacterium, M1) effectively removed 99.8% of CN- under steady operation, which was better than that of other reactors. Short-term shutdowns of FBRs had no serious effects on the efficiency of treating organic cyanide. This work demonstrated that the biofilm-forming bacterium could facilitate the fixation of nitrile-degrading bacterium and enhance the efficiency of removing organic cyanide from groundwater.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are of increasing interest because of their ecotoxicological properties and environmental impacts. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the main pathway for their release into freshwaters due to the inefficiency of conventional WWTPs in removing many of these contaminants from effluents. Therefore, different advanced effluent treatment techniques have been proposed for their treatment. However, it is not known at present how effective these treatment methods are and whether on a life cycle basis they cause other environmental impacts which may outweigh the benefits of the treatment. In an effort to provide an insight into this question, this paper considers life cycle environmental impacts of the following advanced treatment techniques aimed at reducing freshwater ecotoxicity potential of PPCPs: granular activated carbon (GAC), nanofiltration (NF), solar photo-Fenton (SPF) and ozonation. The results suggest that on average NF has the lowest impacts for 13 out of 18 categories considered. GAC is the best alternative for five impacts, including metals and water depletion, but it has the highest marine eutrophication. SPF and ozonation are the least sustainable for eight impacts, including ecotoxicity and climate change. GAC and NF are also more efficient in treating heavy metals while avoiding generation of harmful by-products during the treatment, thus being more suitable for potable reuse of wastewater. However, releasing the effluent without advanced treatment to agricultural land achieves a much higher reduction of freshwater ecotoxicity than treating it by any of the advanced treatments and releasing to the environment. Therefore, the use of advanced effluent treatment for agricultural purposes is not recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and cinoxacin (CINO) antibiotics from wastewater was investigated using V2O5-ZnO coated carbon nanofibers (V2O5-ZnO@CNF) as an adsorbent. The V2O5-ZnO@CNF nanocomposite was characterized using characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersion x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The characterization results revealed that the V2O5-ZnO nanoparticles were incorporated on the surface of carbon nanofibers. The effects of different experimental parameters such as adsorbent amounts, contact time, initial pH, that affect the removal process were optimized using response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions were found to be 018 g, 6.5 and 20 min for the adsorbent amount, sample pH and contact time, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 71.4 and 87.7 mg g( -1) for cinoxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. In addition, the adsorption isotherms and kinetics were used to investigate the adsorption mechanism. The data followed the order: Langmuir (R-2 = 0.09942-0.9996) > Dubinin-Radushkevich (R-2 = 0.9257-0.9557 > Temkin (R-2 = 0.79991-0.9132), > Flory-Huggins (R-2 = 0.7432-0.8813) > Freundlich (R-2 = 0.7057-0.7808). Furthermore, the data was better described by pseudo- second-order kinetics, this implied that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption process as the rate-limiting mechanism through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and CIPRO or CINO.

AB A 5-week mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) to periphytic algae in an environmentally-realistic scenario. We used outdoor experimental streams to simulate the characteristics of central Texas streams receiving large discharges of wastewater treatment plant effluent during prolonged periods of drought. The streams were continually dosed and maintained at two concentrations. The first represents an environmentally relevant concentration of 0.05 mg L-1 (low concentration). The second treatment of 5 mg L-1 (high concentration) was selected to represent a scenario where TiO(2)NPs are used for photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Algal cell density, chlorophyll- a, ash-free dry mass, algal assemblage composition, and Ti accumulation were determined for the periphyton in the riffle sections of each stream. The high concentration treatment of TiO(2)NPs significantly decreased algal cell density, ash-free dry mass, and chlorophyll-a, and altered algal assemblage composition. Decreased abundance of three typically pollution-sensitive taxa and increased abundance of two genera associated with heavy metal sorption and organic pollution significantly contributed to algal assemblage composition changes in response to TiO(2)NPs. Benefits of the use of TiO(2)NPs in wastewater treatment plants will need to be carefully weighed against the demonstrated ability of these NPs to cause large changes in periphyton that would likely propagate significant effects throughout the stream ecosystem, even in the absence of direct toxicity to higher trophic level organisms.

AB Groundwater pollution by emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), has caused increasing concerns around the world. The vadose zone is an active zone where lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere interact. It is an important medium for PPCPs removal and entry into groundwater from irrigation using wastewater or polluted surface water. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of eleven PPCPs in areas with a vadose zone (up to 16 m) was investigated from wastewater irrigated farmland, groundwater irrigated farmland and a seasonal river course in Beijing (China). Nine out of eleven PPCPs were detectable, and carbamazepine and caffeine had the highest detection frequencies, above 50%. The PPCPs were detectable deep in 16 m below ground level (bgl), and their concentrations ranged from bLOD (limit of detection) to 12.5 mu g/kg. Compared to the vadose zone soils irrigated with groundwater, wastewater-irrigated vadose zone soils had significantly higher PPCPs detection frequencies and contamination levels, suggesting the important roles of irrigation water sources on PPCPs accumulation and transport in the vadose zone. Additionally, PPCPs vertical distribution presented a bell-shape pattern in the vadose zone soils with wastewater irrigation, peaking at 3-6 m bgl. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated a significant correlation between PPCPs concentrations in the vadose zone soils and geochemical variables, including available potassium and silt content. This study provides important evidence on the influential factors of PPCPs accumulation and migration in the vadose zone soils resulted from wastewater irrigation. The incomplete removal of PPCPs poses certain risks in subsurface environment, potentially challenging groundwater quality and drinking water safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition bioassay (VFBIA) has been widely applied for the monitoring of toxicity on account of multiple advantages encompassing shorter test duration, sensitive, cost-effective and ease of operation. Moreover, this bioassay found to be equally applicable to all types of matrices (organic & inorganic compounds, metals, wastewater, river water, sewage sludge, landfill leachate, herbicides, treated wastewater etc.) for toxicity monitoring. This review highlights the apparent significance of Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay for ecotoxicological screening and evaluation of diverse chemical substances toxicity profile. The biochemical and genetic basis of the bioluminescence assay and its regulatory mechanism have been concisely discussed. The basic test protocol with ongoing improvements, widespread applications, typical advantages and probable limitations of the assay have been overviewed. The sensitivity of VFBIA and toxicity bioassays has also been compared. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The current study is aimed to introduce a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach for the first time on the African continent where substance abuse data is limited. The study included the quantification of several drugs of abuse (DOA) in raw wastewater samples. Quantification of urinary metabolites as drug target residues (DTR), as well as enantiomeric profiling of chiral DOA was performed to distinguish between consumption and direct disposal into sewage. Monitoring campaigns were undertaken at two South African wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) located within two provinces of the country. The presence of non-racemic 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine, as well as the metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BEG), confirmed their consumption within the areas investigated. Enantiomeric profiling further pointed to the abuse of methamphetamine as the primary DOA with use estimates calculated between 181.9 and 1184.8 mg "day i" 1000 inhabitants(-1). Population-normalised mass loads for MDMA and cocaine confirmed their status as secondary DOA within the study sites. Use estimates for the new psychoactive substance (NPS) mephedrone were performed for one WWTVV. The minor metabolite of heroin, 0-6-monoacetylmorphine (06-MAM), was also detected at one VVWT1N and served as a qualitative indicator for heroin abuse within the area. These findings provide a novel comparison of the WBE approach in a developing-country with other global studies, with the aim to strengthen this approach as a tool to inform drug prevention strategies in countries where substance abuse data is limited due to financial constraints and lack of government structures to facilitate conventional monitoring.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the performance of mixed microalgal bioreactors in treating three different types of wastewaters-kitchen wastewater (KWW), palm oil mill effluent (POME), and pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) in semi-continuous mode and to analyze the lipid content in the harvested algal biomass. The reactors were monitored for total nitrogen and phosphate removal at eight solid retention times (SRTs): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days. The nutrient uptake kinetic parameters were quantified using linearized Michaelis-Menten and Monod models at steady-state conditions. The nutrient removal efficiency and lipid production were found to be higher in KWW when compared with the other wastewaters. Saturated fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1) accounted for more than 60% of the algal fatty acids for all the wastewaters. The lipid is, therefore, considered suitable for synthesizing biodiesel.

AB Processes for the removal of organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) from wastewater treatment plant's (WWTPs) effluents have been tested over decades, and have recently found their way into practice. Operators of WWTPs are confronted with the question of efficiency and the choice of economical process (combination). So far, a systematic approach regarding the selection of the appropriate process (combinations) is missing. There is no information available which technology is best suited for removal of OMPs and other conventional pollutants for good conditions in waterbodies. This study evaluates 52 pilot and full-scale studies regarding their removal efficiencies of various OMPs by advanced processes (adsorption and ozonation) in combination with/without filtration. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the complex state of knowledge and show that technical synergy effects enable the reduction of a wide range of OMP in combination with other conventional parameters, e.g. solids and phosphorous.

AB Pharmaceutical products, particularly antibiotics, due to their cumulative characteristics, undesirable effects and creating drug resistances, as inevitably pollutants, poses a major concern in environmental issues. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been considerably used for degradation of new and emerging pollutants such as residual medications and resistant compounds in water and wastewater. Present investigation evaluates the removal of metronidazole from aqueous solution by electro coagulation and photoelectrophenton processes. The data will be informative for environmental agencies, pharmaceutical companies and wastewater treatment companies for choosing it as a practical oxidation advance process for treatment of water polluted by resistant material (drugs and pesticides).

AB The aim of this study is the assessment of the impact of mixture of three pharmaceutical substances (ciprofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 5-fluorouracil) on aquatic animals, cyanobacteria and plants. Based on previous work and literature data, three concentrations of each substance were used to prepare mixtures: predicted or measured environmental concentrations (PEC/MEC), predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC), concentrations that induced a response of 10% in bioindicators (EC10). Immobilization tests with crustaceans (Daphnia magna and Artemia salina), growth tests with cyanobacteria (Cyanosarcina sp.), algae (Desmodesmus quadricauda, Raphidocelis subcapitata) and plants (Lemna minor), enzymatic test Fluotox and reproduction test with D. magna were performed. The results of this work confirm the importance of low concentration mixture exposure. Effect in PEC/MEC concentrations of the mixture of tested compounds was equal 15% in R. subcapitata growth test. As expected, effects obtained for mixtures of pharmaceuticals in their EC10 concentrations were frequently higher than 10%. The obtained results were compared with the concept of independent action, which either underestimated or overestimated the effects in concentrations used. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exposure to tested mixtures of pharmaceuticals even in low concentrations of components, that individually cause no harm to organisms, may trigger adverse effects in aquatic environment.

AB Dendrimers are branched molecules that have medical, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications. Dendrimers of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) with functional groups of hydroxyl and amine are useful for making complex of heavy metals. The aim of this experimental study is to utilize dendrimer PAMAM G4 in removing nickel. FTIR and DLS analyses were conducted for determining the structure of the dendrimer. The efficiency of the process was examined under different conditions including different pH values, namely, 3, 7, and 11, the concentration of the dendrimer adsorbent (0.5 - 2.5 g/L), the nickel concentration (5 - 25 mg/L), and different reaction times (5 - 60 min). The data analysis was carried out using with SPSS. With the increase in the reaction time at constant values of the dendrimer (mg/L), the nickel removal (C=20 mg/L), at the pH values of 3, 7, and 11, increased from 7 to 18.5, from 45 to 69, and from 54 to 73, respectively. With the increase in the concentration of nickel from 5 to 25 mg/L, the removal efficiency at pH=11 decreased from 97 to 59%. The optimal value of the dendrimer for removing nickel was obtained as 1.5 g/L. The adsorption reaction followed Freundlich isotherm (R-2=0.95). Through optimizing different conditions, it is possible to use this adsorbent as a method with suitable effectiveness in removing heavy metals including nickel from industrial wastewaters.

AB Pharmaceutical pollutants have been detected in many countries in surface and ground water after treatment in wastewater treatment plants. The presented studies concern the photocatalytic removal of one of SSRI antide-pressants - sertraline from water using TiO2 photocatalyst. The process was conducted using two laboratory installations with periodic and flow reactors. Two forms of TiO2 was used in the photocatalytic reactions: suspended and supported onto a glass fabric. The studies shown that with increasing initial concentration of pharmaceutical, photoactivity decreases. For the initial concentration of 0.025 g/dm(3), the best results - 94% removal - was achieved for the process conducted in the periodic reactor with TiO2 supported onto a glass fabric.

AB This baseline assessment reports on the occurrence, distribution, and sources of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in tropical coastal sediments of anthropogenically impacted Klang River estuary, Malaysia. Bisphenol A was the highest concentration detected at 16.84 ng g(-1) dry weight, followed by diclofenac (13.88 ng g(-1) dry weight) and El (12.47 ng g(-1) dry weight). Five compounds, namely, amoxicillin, progesterone, diazinon, bisphenol A, and El, were found in all sampling stations assessed, and other compounds such as primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, E2, and EE2 were ubiquitously present in sediment samples, with percentage of detection range from 89.04% to 98.38%. Organic carbon content and pH were the important factors controlling the fate of targeted compounds in the tropical estuarine sediment. On the basis of the literature from other studies, the sources of EOCs are thought to be from wastewater treatment plants, domestic/medical waste discharge, livestock activities, industrial waste discharge, and agricultural activities.

AB Adsorption on low-cost biochars would increase the affordability and availability of water treatment in, for example, developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the precursor materials and hydrochar surface properties that yield efficient removal of compounds of environmental concern (CEC). We determined the adsorption kinetics of a mixture containing ten CECs (octhilinone, triclosan, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxasole, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, paracetamol, diphenhydramine, fluconazole, and bisphenol A) to hydrochars prepared from agricultural waste (including tomato- and olive-press wastes, rice husks, and horse manure). The surface characteristics of the hydrochars were evaluated via diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2-adsorption. Kinetic adsorption tests revealed that removal efficiencies varied substantially among different materials. Similarly, surface analysis revealed differences among the studied hydrochars and the degree of changes that the materials undergo during carbonization. According to the DRIFTS data, compared with the least efficient adsorbent materials, the most efficient hydrochars underwent more substantial changes during carbonization.

AB This study presents a novel spinel-type zinc aluminate nanometer catalyst and is applied in catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment. The zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4) catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal, sol-gel, and coprecipitation methods, and their characteristics were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. 5-Sulfosalicylic acid (SSal) was selected as the typical pharmaceutical and personal care product and used to evaluate the catalytic activity of ZnAl2O4. Compared to ozonation, an obviously higher removal efficiency for the SSal degradation was achieved with the nanocatalyst addition in catalytic ozonation. The removal of SSal and chemical oxygen demand reached 64.8 and 46.2%, respectively, after 60 min in the presence of ZnAl2O4, whereas it was only 49.4 and 33.2%, respectively, in ozonation. The comparison of catalysts showed that the ZnAl2O4 prepared by the hydrothermal method presented a better catalytic activity in ozonation. The effect of radical scavenger experiment results and the characterization of XPS implied that (OH)-O-center dot was the main active oxidative species in catalytic ozonation. The reusability results showed that the ZnAl2O4 catalyst possessed a high stability and could be widely used in catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment.

AB The bulk manufacturing of carbamazepine (CBZ) by pharmaceutical manufacturing industries leads to generation of huge amount of wastewater containing this recalcitrant compound. This necessitates the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as a pretreatment strategy for the treatment of such complex industrial wastewaters. Therefore, in the present study, effect of Fenton treatment was investigated for removal of CBZ from real wastewater containing higher CBZ concentrations. The preliminary studies were conducted to assess the significant factors in Fenton treatment and pH, Fenton dose and time were found to be statistically significant parameters affecting the Fenton process. Based on these results, further experimental trials were designed statistically using Central Composite Design in MINITAB 16 software. The process conditions were optimized using Response Surface Optimizer Tool in MINITAB 16 and pH = 3.5 and H2O2 concentration of 8.5 g/L was obtained as optimum condition leading to 49.39 +/- 0.93% CBZ removal from pharmaceutical wastewater containing higher CBZ concentrations. The detoxification of Fenton-treated wastewater through granulated activated carbon (GAC) column resulted in an overall CBZ removal of 99.51 +/- 0.02%. The detoxification was further corroborated through seed germination test which demonstrated a potential reduction in toxicity post-detoxification using GACs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current study evaluated the removal of six micropollutants (estrone (E1); 17 beta-estradiol (E2); 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2); ibuprofen (IBP), diclofenac (DCF), and paracetamol (PCT)) from the final effluent of an activated sludge domestic sewage treatment plant using polishing filters. Four polishing filters were assembled as columns and filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite, sand and charcoal, sand and granulated activated carbon (9:1 by volume), and sand only. The column filters were placed near the outlet of a full-scale activated sludge treatment plant and were fed with a treated effluent containing from 4.71 to 28.93 ng L-1 of the target compounds at a hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 50 m(3) m(-2) day(-1). Samples were collected periodically from the influent (biologically treated sewage) and effluent of the four columns and analyzed for estrogens, anti-inflammatories, and analgesic compounds. Liquid samples were submitted to a solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry after their derivatization. Among the compounds found, diclofenac was distinguished by the high occurrence of detection in the samples (85%) and higher mean concentration ( 17 ng L-1). High removal efficiency (> 90%) of the estrogens was observed in the polishing systems studied, while for the other targets, the removal efficiency varied from 10 to 30%. The concentration values of some compounds were low, probably due to rainfall during the sampling period.

AB Paracetamol, the most widely and globally used analgesic and antipyretic, is easily accumulated in aquatic environments. In the present study, the biodegradation of paracetamol in different media (one for general growth, one specific for sulfate reducing bacteria, a mineral salts medium and municipal wastewater) inoculated with two types of sludge (from anaerobic lagoon and from oxidation ditch) under different oxygenic conditions (anoxic; moderate oxygenation in open flasks and high oxygenation by aeration) was investigated. In addition, bacteria with relative abundances increasing simultaneously with paracetamol degradation, when this drug was the only carbon source, thus with a putative role in its degradation, were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences. The results show that aerobic microorganisms had a major role in the degradation of paracetamol, with 50 mg/L totally removed from municipal wastewater after 2 days incubation with aeration, and that the metabolites 4-aminophenol and hydroquinone plus one compound not identified in this work were produced in the process. The identification of bacteria with a role in the degradation of paracetamol revealed a strain from genus Pseudomonas with the highest final relative abundance of 21.2%, confirming previous works reporting strains of this genus as paracetamol decomposers. Besides, genera Flavobacterium, Dokdonella and Methylophilus were also in evidence, with initial relative abundances of 1.66%, 1.48 and 0.00% (not detected) in the inoculum and 6.91%, 3.80 and 3.83% after incubation, respectively. Therefore, a putative role of these genera in paracetamol biodegradation is suggested for the first time.

AB Wastewater treatment plant effluents from urban area are a well-known source of chronic multiple micropollution to the downstream living organisms. In this study, ecologically relevant laboratory-bred freshwater gastropods, Lymnaea stagnalis, were exposed for 29 days to raw effluents of a wastewater treatment plant in Lyon area (France). A time-course analysis of individual markers of immunocompetence (hemocyte density and viability, hemocyte NADPH activity, phenol oxidase activity, and capacity of phagocytosis) has shown slight trends of inflammatory-like responses induced by the 100% effluents. So far, no short-term hazard for L. stagnalis can be revealed. However, over the long term, such environmental stress-stimulating immune responses could provoke deleterious life history trade-offs because the immune system is known to be highly energy-consuming.

AB Removal of emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, from wastewater is a challenge. Adsorption is a simple and efficient process that can be applied. Clays, which are natural and low-cost materials, have been investigated as adsorbent. In this work, raw vermiculite and its three modified forms (expanded, base, and acid/base treated) were tested for removal of a widely used antidepressant, venlafaxine. Adsorption kinetics followed Elovich's model for raw vermiculite while the pseudo-2nd order model was a better fit in the case of other materials. Equilibrium followed Langmuir's model for the raw and the acid/base-treated vermiculite, while Redlich-Peterson's model fitted better the expanded and the base-treated materials. The adsorption capacity of vermiculite was significantly influenced by the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the materials caused by the treatments. The base-treated, raw, and expanded vermiculites showed lower maximum adsorption capacities (i.e., 6.3 +/- 0.5, 5.8 +/- 0.7, 3.9 +/- 0.2 mg g(-1), respectively) than the acid/base-treated material (33 +/- 4 mg g(-1)). The acid/base-treated vermiculite exhibited good properties as a potential adsorbent for tertiary treatment of wastewater in treatment plants, in particular for cationic species as venlafaxine due to facilitation of diffusion of the species to the interlayer gallery upon such treatment.

AB Many ionizable organic contaminants (IOCs) are present in treated wastewater used to irrigate edible crops and accumulate in plants under field conditions. Phytoavailability of IOCs with pKa values between 4 and 9 may be affected by the pH of the rhizosphere (the water and soil within 2-3 mm of the root surface). Plants can alter rhizosphere pH by 2-3 units in either direction in response to nutrient availability. The effects of plant modulation of rhizosphere pH on IOC accumulation have not been previously reported. Here we provide direct evidence that plant-driven changes in rhizosphere pH impact accumulation of an IOC in plant leaves. Using a modified hydroponic system, we found that rhizosphere pH was higher by 1.5-2.4 units when plants received only nitrate rather than a combination of nitrate and ammonium. Plant-driven changes to rhizosphere pH altered accumulation of lamotrigine (pKa = 5.7) but not carbamazepine, a non-ionizable contaminant. Lamotrigine accumulation in leaves correlated strongly with the concentration of the neutral species available in porewater. We expect plant-driven changes in rhizosphere pH to be important across a wide range of plant species and IOCs. Consideration of plant modulation of rhizosphere pH may be necessary to accurately predict IOC bioaccumulation.

AB Recovering phosphorus from livestock wastewater has gained extensive attention. The residue of veterinary antibiotics in the wastewater may be present in the recovered products, thereby posing pharmacological threats to the agricultural planting and human health. This study investigated antibiotic occurrence in the struvite particles recovered from swine wastewater by using a fluidized bed. Results revealed that tetracyclines possessed significant residues in the struvite granules, with the values ranging from 195.2 mu g.kg(-1) to 1995.0 mu g.kg(-1). As for fluoroquinolones, their concentrations varied from 0.4 mu g.kg(-1) to 1104.0 mu g.kg(-1). Struvite particles were of various sizes and shapes and displayed different antibiotic adsorption capacities. The data also showed that the smaller granules contained much more antibiotics than the larger ones, indicating that the fluidized granulation process of struvite crystals plays an important role on the accumulation of antibiotics. For tetracyclines, organic matters and struvite adsorption exerted significant impacts on tetracyclines migration. The outcomes underscore the need to consider the residues of antibiotics in resource recovery from wastewater because they exert pharmacological impacts on the utilization of recovered products.

AB The effects of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals on sexual differentiation in F1 offspring were examined in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 or 10g/L of carbamazepine or gemfibrozil for 6 wk and bred in pairwise crosses to generate 7 distinct lineages. Lineages were formed with both parents from the same treatment group or with only one parent exposed, to delineate between maternal and paternal effects. The F1 offspring from each lineage were reared in clean water and sampled at 45 and 60 d post fertilization (dpf). Gonadal differentiation was assessed by histology. The morphological stages of the gonads were converted to a quantitative day-equivalent based on data from offspring of untreated parents sampled from 15 to 75 dpf, which enabled a quantitative statistical analysis on the timing of sexual differentiation. Paternal, but not maternal, exposure to carbamazepine resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation and a male-biased sex ratio; these effects were not observed when both parents were exposed. Combined paternal and maternal exposure to gemfibrozil resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation, and paternal, but not maternal, exposure to gemfibrozil led to male-biased sex ratios. The present study demonstrates the ability of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals to disrupt sexual differentiation in the F1 offspring and also shows that effects may be uniquely influenced by which parent was exposed.

AB The reduction of commonly used X-ray contrast iohexol (IOX) by the electrooxidation process is presented in this study. To begin with, the effect of anode material was examined, and different mixed metal oxide electrodes (MMOs) such as Ti/RuO2, Ti/Pt, Ti/IrO2-RuO2, Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5, Ti/Ta2O5-SnO2-IrO2, and Pt/SnO2 were used. To assess experimental conditions at Ti/RuO2 anode, provided the highest removal efficiency, the response surface method was applied and the key influencing parameter was the process time. The determined optimal conditions were triplicated with real wastewater samples, and the average degradation efficiency of IOX was found to be 99%. By-products of the IOX degradation on the Ti/RuO2 anode have been identified using density functional theory and LC/MS-MS analysis. The results showed that IOX degradation opened with OH group detachment and resulted in the formation of a by-product with a molecular mass of 804 g mol(-1). Further degradation mechanism took place due to the breakup of C-4-C-10 and C-5-I-7 bonds with a by-product formed as 603 g mol(-1). Iodide atom replacement by OH groups caused the formation of a molecular fragment with 375 g mol(-1) molecular weight. The further disintegration of C-2-C-11 and C-6-N-16 sigma- bonds led to the formation of molecular masses of 133, 126, and 119 g mol(-1), respectively.

AB Due to ineffective wastewater treatment technologies, pharmaceuticals such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)-a common class of antidepressants which inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT)-can be found in surface waters and marine receiving waters near wastewater effluents. Understanding how exposure to these chemicals might impact non-target organisms, especially combined with other environmental stressors like hypoxia, is essential in order to thoroughly evaluate environmental risk. It was hypothesized that both acute and chronic exposure to the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX) would interfere with the metabolic hypoxia response of the Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta. Here we demonstrate that acute intraperitoneal treatment with 50 mu g g(-1) FLX significantly reduces the regulation index, or degree of metabolic regulation, in toadfish. Acute FLX exposure significantly reduced SERT mRNA expression in the first and third gill arches, but mRNA expression was not affected in heart tissues or in the second gill arch. In contrast, the regulation index was unaffected by 14-17 day waterborne FLX exposure to environmentally relevant (0.01 mu g L-1) and approximately 1000-fold higher (8.5 mu g L-1) concentrations. However, the higher concentration was sufficient to induce a systemic elevation in plasma serotonin concentrations. Chronic FLX exposure did not alter SERT mRNA expression in heart or gill tissues. The results of this study implicate the involvement of 5-HT pathways in hypoxia tolerance but demonstrate that current environmental levels of FLX are insufficient to impair the metabolic hypoxia response in marine fish.

AB The emission sources of biocidal active substances in households have been under discussion since these substances have been detected frequently in municipal wastewater and receiving surface water bodies. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the products responsible for the emission of these substances to wastewater.
   We analysed the wastewater of two streets for a set of biocidal active substances. Time-proportional sampling was conducted for one week of each season during one year in each street. The 14 substances analysed with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (BIT), C-12-benzalkonium chloride, carbendazim, 5-chloro-2-methyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one (CMIT), dichlorooctylisothiazolinone (DCOIT), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), diuron, icaridine, 2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one (OIT), piperonyl butoxide (PBO), triclosan, tebuconazole, terbutryn and tetramethrin. Using data available from household product inventories of the two streets, we searched the lists of ingredients for the products possibly being responsible for the emissions.
   Except for four substances, all substances have been detected in at least 10% of the samples. Highest concentrations were measured for C-12-benzalkonium chloride with an average concentration in the daily samples of 7.7 mu g/L in one of the streets. Next to C-12-benzalkonium chloride, BIT, DEET and icaridine were detected in all samples in average concentrations above 1 mu g/L in at least one street. The results show that washing and cleaning agents were important sources for preservatives such as BIT and OIT, while triclosan was apparently mainly emitted through personal care products. The mosquito repelling substances DEET and icaridine were found throughout the year, with highest emissions in summer and autumn.
   In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the sources of biocidal active substances in municipal wastewater are complex and that measures for the prevention of the emission of biocidal active substances into the aquatic environment have to be carried out under different legislations. This has to be taken into account discussing emission reduction at the source.

AB A 180 L anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 253 days to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater, which mainly composed of beta-lactams antibiotics (BLAs) including amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and ampicillin. The operation was divided into three stages with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 48 h, 36 h and 24 h, respectively, the corresponding average organic loading rates (OLRs) and antibiotics loading rates (ALRs) increased from 2.37 +/- 0.28 to 4.46 +/- 0.87 kg-CODm(3).d(-1), and from 19.06 +/- 0.67 to 37.91 +/- 3.57 g-BLAsm(-3).d(-1), respectively. The highest removal efficiencies of amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and ampicillin were 73.2 +/- 4.3%, 47.7 +/- 2.2%, 79.4 +/- 4.1% and 34.6 +/- 3.3%, respectively. The obtained total COD removal efficiency was as high as 94.0% and accompanied with VFA accumulation (249 +/- 25 to 375 +/- 61 mg.L-1) as well as biogas generation (0.195 +/- 0.017 to 0.291 +/- 0.032 L.gCOD(removal)(-1)), > 66% of which was methane (0.135 +/- 0.011 to 0.196 +/- 0.021 L.gCOD(removal)(-1)). Moreover, basing on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory, the mathematical models were developed and well calibrated for simulating the AnMBR performance in the biodegradation of COD and antibiotics.

AB The present study deals with the assessment of the fate of an emerging contaminant (diclofenac), present in the subsurface environment at specific concentration levels, and its biodegradation potential under different environmental configurations. Diclofenac is a widely consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used as a painkiller prescribed as pills or ointments and among the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants' effluents. Fermentative/methanogenic cultures were enriched from previously contaminated sediment samples. Although partial biodegradation was achieved in all enrichment cultures, complete degradation was not observed. The results reflected that less than 6% of the diclofenac sorbed on the solid phase and the rest was either biotransformed (25-40%) or remained in the liquid phase (55-70%) at the end of 45-day incubation period. Although partial cometabolic degradation of diclofenac occurred in the presence of glucose, biodegradation was not observed in the presence of readily biodegradable carbon source (i.e., acetate). Diclofenac concentration up to 1000 mu g/L did not affect the methanogenic activity of the enriched culture. The results of this study will have a significant impact in the designation of the permitted concentration limits of diclofenac before the discharge through wastewater treatment plants.

AB BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutically active compounds, emerging extensively in ecosystems as pollutants, have become an important environmental and public health issue, since they can contaminate drinking water and pose threats to wildlife and human health. As a result, efforts should be made to develop methods to inactivate or eliminate this class of substance in the environment.
   RESULTS: The photocatalytic degradation of psychoactive drug Fluvoxamine has been investigated. In the case of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation, the effect of TiO2 P25 concentration (0.1-1 g L-1), initial concentration of H2O2 (0.25-0.2 g L-1) and Fe3+ (0.00175-0.014 g L-1) and pH of the solution on initial reaction rates were evaluated, while for homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation the effect of the amount of H2O2 (0.25-0.2 g L-1) and Fe3+ (0.00175-0.014 g L-1) were investigated. In addition, the conversion of the heteroatoms in the FVX molecule to inorganic ions (NO3-, NH4+, F-) during the photocatalytic process has been observed and phytotoxicity testing, using three plant species, was carried out in order to examine the effect of photocatalytic oxidation on the toxicity of FVX.
   CONCLUSION: According to the results presented in this study, both heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation is an efficient methodology for FVX degradation. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This study investigated the occurrence of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and four benzodiazepines/anti-depressants (ADs) in municipal wastewater in Mardan city, Pakistan, and in River Kabul and River Indus receiving untreated sewage. Liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for the analysis of paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and codeine (NSAIDs) and diazepam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam (ADs). Except codeine and lorazepam, all the target compounds were observed in sewage and surface water in various concentrations. In sewage, paracetamol was found at the higher end (32.4 mu g/L) of the reported ranges in literature for other countries. Results of river samples showed that the target compounds were usually lower in concentration than the respective EC50 values for aquatic organisms. However, the levels for paracetamol and ibuprofen were critical depicting the consequence of untreated disposal. Environmental risk assessment by estimating the risk quotient (RQ) as the ratio of measured environmental concentration and predicted no-effect concentration showed medium to high (RQ > 1 and 0.1 < RQ < 1) risk from paracetamol and ibuprofen to aquatic organisms in River Kabul and Kalpani stream, Pakistan.

AB With increasing problems of drug abuse worldwide, aquatic ecosystems are contaminated by human pharmaceuticals from the discharge of hospital or municipal effluent. However, ecotoxicity data and related toxic mechanism for neuroactive controlled or illicit drugs are still lacking, so assessing the associated hazardous risk is difficult. This study aims to investigate the behavioral changes, oxidative stress, gene expression and neurotoxic or apoptosis effect(s) in larvae of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) with environmentally relevant exposures of ketamine (KET) solutions for 1-14 days. KET exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (0.004 mu M) to 40 mu M conferred specific patterns in larval swimming behavior during 24 h. At 14 days, such exposure induced dose- and/or time-dependent alteration on reactive oxygen species induction, the activity of antioxidants catalase and superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and malondialdehyde contents in fish bodies. KET-induced oxidative stress disrupted the expression of acetylcholinesterase and p53-regulated apoptosis pathways and increased caspase expression in medaka larvae. The toxic responses of medaka larvae, in terms of chemical effects, were qualitatively analogous to those of zebrafish and mammals. Our results implicate a toxicological impact of waterborne KET on fish development and human health, for potential ecological risks of directly releasing neuroactive drugs-containing wastewater into the aquatic environment.

AB The increasing presence of pharmaceutical products (PPs) and other organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic systems has become one of the major global environmental contamination concerns. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are one of the major sources of PPs discharge into natural waters due to the deficiencies of conventional treatment processes to deal with these micropollutants. Numerous new treatment processes and technologies have been investigated for the removals of CECs in wastewaters with more or less success. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of a hybrid bioreactor (HBR) of a combined crosslinked tyrosinase and laccase aggregates and hollow fiber micro filtration (MF) membrane to remove a mixture of 14 PPs from municipal wastewater at environmentally relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L. After a 5 -day continuous operation, the HBR achieved complete removal of all tested PPs. Results also highlight that these high performances result from a synergistic action of the MF membrane and the insoluble enzymes. The biocatalyst retained nearly 70% of its initial enzymatic activity over the treatment period. The removal of PPs is unlikely to result from their sole sorption on the membrane. Overall, the results suggest that the HBR is well suited to the biocatalysts (i.e. insolubilized tyrosinase and laccase). The results invite to further investigate how the HBR can be tailored with various types of enzymes and membranes for either specific or non-specific target substrates and to further explore the applicability of this technology for the continuous treatment of wastewater at environmentally relevant concentration of PPs.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can be released to coastal waters and affect the endocrine system of marine organisms. To monitor their levels in seawaters, a simple, robust passive sampling method, the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique, was developed with XDA-1 resin as a binding agent. Six EDCs (including three estrogens, two pesticides and bisphenol A) were used to assess the performance of the DGT. The XDA-1 binding gel showed adequate ability for adsorbing EDCs in seawaters. The DGT sampler exhibited linear accumulation for the EDCs during a 15-day deployment and diffusion coefficients and sampling rates were calculated. The DGT measurement was independent of pH in the range 7.0-9.0 and ionic strength in the range 0.4-0.8 M. Field applications of this DGT in a coast of Dalian (China) showed comparable results to those from grab sampling. Five EDCs were detected with concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 19.4 ng L-1. This study is a first attempt to apply DGT sampler for determining EDCs in seawaters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB South Africa has the largest occurrence of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the world but has also implemented the largest antiretroviral (ARV) treatment programme. It was therefore of interest to determine the presence and concentrations of commonly used antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) and, also, to determine the capabilities of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for removing ARVDs. To this end, a surrogate standard based LC-MS/MS method was optimized and applied for the detection of thirteen ARVDs used in the treatment and management of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in two major and one modular WWTP in the eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The method was validated and the detection limits fell within the range of 2-20 ng L-1. The analytical recoveries for the ARVDs were mainly greater than 50% with acceptable relative standard deviations. The concentration values ranged from < LOD - 53000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 34000 ng L-1 (effluent) in a decentralized wastewater treatment facility (DEWATS); < LOD - 24000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 33000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Northern WWTP and 61-34000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 20000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Phoenix WWTP. Whilst abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine were almost completely removed from the effluents, atazanavir, efavirenz, lopinavir and nevirapine persisted in the effluents from all three WWTPs. To estimate the ecotoxicological risks associated with the discharge of ARVDs, a countrywide survey focussing on the occurrence of ARVDs in WWTPs, surface and fresh water bodies, and aquatic organisms, is necessary.

AB On-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs) are an international wastewater management strategy for rural and semi-rural communities without access to centralized sewage treatment. These systems are a suspected source of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) that may be responsible for endocrine disrupting effects to resident fish species in Minnesota Lakes. This study assessed localized pore water concentrations of TOrCs in near-shore environments across five Minnesota Lakes. Sampling sites were designated as either likely (HOME) or unlikely (REF) to receive OWTS discharges based on their proximity to shoreline households. Sampling sites also served as sunfish spawning habitats concurrently studied for biological impacts to resident adult males. Two-group hypothesis tests demonstrated significantly (p = .02) higher total TOrC concentrations in HOME (Mean = 841 ng/L) versus REF (Mean = 222 ng/L) sites. HOME sites also contained a wider suite of TOrC detections relative to REF sites. The distance to the nearest household (most proximal distance; MPD) negatively correlated (r = -0.62) with total TOrC concentrations. However, 2,4-D and DEET were major contributors to these total concentrations, suggesting that anthropogenic influence from households may not be exclusively attributed to OWTS discharges. Further, TOrC presence and elevated nitrogen concentrations in REF site pore water suggest additional, non-household TOrC discharges to these lakes. Significantly higher blood concentrations of vitellogenin (p = .03) and 11-ketotestosterone (p = .01) were observed in adultmale sunfish captured from HOME versus REF sites. Comparisons between chemical and biological data indicate enhanced bioactive effects of co-contaminants. The findings from this study demonstrate multiple diffuse transport pathways contribute to the presence of biologically active TOrC mixtures in Minnesota Lakes, and mitigation efforts should consider minimizing residential inputs of chemicals associated with both outdoor and OWTS activity.

AB Concerns about the effect of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent on he health of freshwater ecosystems have increased. In this sludy, a unique approach was designed to show the effect of an STP effluent-dominaled stream on naive wild brown Luna (Sohn trultu L.) exposed under fully natural conditions. Zivny stream is located in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The downstream site of Zivny stream is an STP-affecled sire, which receives 25% of is wafer from Prachalice STP effluent.. Upsffeam, however, is a minimally polluted water site and i is considered Lo be the control sire. Native fish were collected from the upstream site, Lagged, and distributed W both upstream and downstream sites. After 30, 90, and 180 days, fish were recaptured from both sites to determine whether the downstream site of the Zivny stream is associated with the effects of environmental pollution. Several biomarkers indicating the oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities, cytochrome P450 activity, xenoestrogenic effects, bacterial composition, and lipid composition were investigated. Additionally, polar chemical contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)) were quantified using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Fifty-three PPCPs were detected in the downstream site; 36 of those were constantly present during the 180-day investigation period. Elevated hepatic 7-benzyloxy-4trifluoromethylcoumarin-0-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) (alter 90 days) and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations in males were detected in fish downstream of the SIP effluent during all sampling events. An increase in the fishes' total fat content was also observed, but with low levels of omega-3 fatty acid in muscle tissue. Two bacterial taxa related to activated sludge were found in the intestines of fish from downstream. Our results show that Prachatice STP is a major source of PPCPs in the Zivny stream, which has biological consequences on fish physiology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaculture, which is growing 3-5 times faster than terrestrial agriculture, will play an important role to meet future global food production needs. However, over 80% of global sewage production is returned to the environment untreated or poorly treated. In developing nations, these nontraditional waters of diverse quality are being recycled for aquaculture, yet chemical residues are differentially studied. Here, we examined pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and flame retardants in marine bivalves using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and low-pressure gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LP GC-MS/MS). Green-lipped mussels from the field and oysters from aquaculture net pens, which are harvested as food products, were collected adjacent to point source municipal wastewater and landfill leachate effluent discharges, respectively, in Hong Kong, the fourth most densely populated country in the world. Multiple classes of pharmaceutical, pesticides, PAHs, and phosphorus-based flame retardants were detected at low mu g/kg levels. Acceptable servings per week indicated minimal risk for a number of chemicals; however, such calculations could not be performed for other contaminants of emerging concern. Future efforts are needed to better understand contaminant influences on marine bivalve populations and aquaculture product safety, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions of developing countries with limited wastewater infrastructure.

AB This study offers insight into the roles anodic and cathodic processes play in electrochemically activated persulfate (EAP) and screens EAP as a viable technique for ciprofloxacin degradation in wastewater. Sulfate radical formation at a boron doped diamond (BDD) anode and persulfate activation at a graphite cathode were experimentally elucidated using different electrolytes and electrochemical setups. Rapid ciprofloxacin transformation occurred via pseudo-first-order mechanisms with respect to ciprofloxacin in persulfate electrolyte, reaching 84% removal in 120 min using EAP. Transformation pathways were compared to those in nitrate and sulfate electrolytes. Ciprofloxacin removal rates in the electrochemical system were 88% and 33% faster in persulfate than nitrate and sulfate electrolytes, respectively. Total organic carbon removal rates were 93% and 48% faster in persulfate than nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Use of sulfate electrolyte resulted in removal rates 6-7 times faster than those in nitrate solution. Accelerated removal in sulfate was attributed to anodic sulfate radical formation, while enhanced removal in persulfate was associated with cathodic persulfate activation and nonradical persulfate activation at the BDD anode. Quenching experiments indicated both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals contributed to degradation. Comparisons between platinum and graphite cathodes showed similar cathodic persulfate activation and ciprofloxacin degradation.

AB Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 mu g/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male Betta splendens. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 mu g/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.

AB The occurrence and distribution of tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), and the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated in six agricultural sites in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in southern China. Irrigation water and irrigated soils at two different depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed. The total concentrations of TC and SMZ in irrigation water ranged from 69.3 to 234 ng/L and from 4.00 to 58.2 ng/L, respectively, while the total concentrations of TC and SMZ in irrigated soils ranged from 5.00 to 21.9 mu g/kg and from 1.30 to 4.20 mu g/kg, respectively. After long-term irrigation with domestic and fishpond wastewater in the field, the residual TC and SMZ and their corresponding ARGs in soils were significantly higher in fishpond-irrigated soils (Dongguan and Shenzhen) than in domestic wastewater-irrigated soils (Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou and Zhongshan). The concentrations of antibiotics and their ARGs were significantly higher in irrigation water than in irrigated soils, which indicated that wastewater was the primary source of antibiotics in the soil environments. The domestic and fishpond wastewater were important repositories of antibiotics and their ARGs, which require effective treatment before their discharge into the environment. Other factors such as soil physicochemical properties, manure application, irrigation water sources and (Topping patterns also affect the antibiotic concentrations and ARG abundances. The residual antibiotic concentrations statistically correlated with the corresponding ARGs in irrigation water and irrigated soils, both of which decreased with increasing soil depth, indicating that the concentration of antibiotics in the environment exerted a selection pressure on the microorganisms in the environment.

AB Laccase from Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 was cross-linked to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by electron beam irradiation. Immobilised laccase displayed a higher stability than the non-immobilised enzyme with respect to typical wastewater temperatures, and pH at a range of 5 to 9. Batch tests addressed the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs; applied as a mixture of acetaminophen, bezafibrate, indometacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and naproxen) by both immobilised and non-immobilised laccase in municipal wastewater. High removal rates (>85%) of the most efficiently oxidised PhACs (acetaminophen and mefenamic add) indicated a high efficiency of the immobilised laccase in wastewater. Continuous elimination of the aforementioned PhACs by the immobilised enzyme in a continuously operated diffusion basket reactor yielded a PhAC removal pattern qualitatively similar to those observed in batch tests. Clearly higher apparent V-max values and catalytic efficiencies (in terms of both V-max/S-0.5 as well as V-max/K-m values obtained from data fitting according to the Hill and the Michaelis-Menten model, respectively) observed for acetaminophen oxidation by the immobilised compared to the non-immobilised enzyme are in support of a considerably higher functional stability of the immobilised laccase especially in wastewater. The potential influence of acetaminophen on the removal of comparatively less laccase-oxidisable water pollutants such as the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) was investigated. TCS was increasingly removed upon increasing the initial acetaminophen concentration in immobilised as well as non-immobilised laccase reaction systems until saturation became evident. Acetaminophen was consumed and not recycled during laccase reactions, which was accompanied by the formation of various acetaminophen-TCS cross-coupling products. Nevertheless, the simultaneous presence of acetaminophen (and potentially even more pollutant removal-enhancing laccase substrates) and more recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater represents an interesting option for the efficiency enhancement of enzyme-based wastewater treatment approaches.

AB Evidence of ecotoxicological effects of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) has increased research into their environmental fate. In low and low-middle income countries (LLMICs) the main source of APIs to surface waters is from discharge of untreated wastewater. Consequently, concentrations of APIs can be relatively high in the "impact zone" downstream of a discharge point. Little is known about the fate of APIs in these impact zones. In this laboratory scale investigation, the effect of successive dilution of synthetic untreated wastewater (dilution factor 1 to 10) on the distribution of APIs was studied. The sorption was consistent with the chemical properties of each compound: charge, lipophilicity, and structure. Dilution increased desorption of the basic and neutral APIs (up to 27.7%) and correlated with their lipophilicity (R-2 > 0.980); the positive charge was of secondary importance. Anions did not significantly desorb (< 10% loss). Increased concentrations of dissolved organic matter at dilutions of 8 and 10 times that of untreated wastewater coincided with lower dissolved API concentrations. The data showed a dear trend in the desorption process of APIs that may lead to higher exposure risk than anticipated. Therefore, it is suggested that these aspects should be accounted for in the development of dedicated environmental risk assessment approach for APIs in riverine impact zones of LLMICs countries.

AB This study assessed the effects and removal options of the macrolide spiramycin, currently used for both in human and veterinary medicine- with a special focus on advanced oxidation processes based on heterogeneous TiO(2)(- )assisted photocatalysis. spiramycin real concentrations were investigated on a seasonal basis in a municipal waste-water treatment plant (up to 35 mu g L-1), while its removal kinetics were studied considering both aqueous solutions and real wastewater samples, including by-products toxicity assessment. High variability of spiramycin removal by activated sludge treatments (from 9% (wintertime) to >99.9% (summertime)) was observed on a seasonal basis. Preliminary results showed that a total spiramycin removal (>99.9%) is achieved with 0.1 g L-1 of TiO2 in aqueous solution after 80 min. Integrated toxicity showed residual slight acute effects in the photocatalytic treated solutions, independently from the amount of TiO2 used, and could be linked to the presence of intermediate compounds. Photolysis of wastewater samples collected after activated sludge treatment during summer season (SPY 5 mu g L-1) allowed a full SPY removal after 80 min. When photocatalysis with 0.1 g L-1 of TiO2 was carried out in wastewater samples collected in winter season (SPY 30 mu g L-1) after AS treatment, SPY removal was up to 91% after 80 min.

AB In the past few years, anaerobic ammonium oxidation-based processes have attracted a lot of attention for their implementation at the mainstream line of wastewater treatment plants, due to the possibility of leading to energy autarky if combined with anaerobic digestion. However, little is known about the potential degradation of micropollutants by the microbial groups responsible of these processes and the few results available are inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the degradation capability of biomass withdrawn from a combined nitritation/anaerobic ammonium oxidation (combined N/A) pilot plant towards five pharmaceutically active compounds (ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, venlafaxine and carbamazepine). Batch experiments were performed under different conditions by selectively activating or inhibiting different microbial groups: i) regular combined N/A operation, ii) aerobic (optimal for nitrifying bacteria), aerobic with allylthiourea (an inhibitor of ammonia monooxygenase, enzyme of ammonia oxidizing bacteria), iv) anoxic (optimal for anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria), v) aerobic with acetate (optimal for heterotrophic bacteria) and vi) anoxic with acetate (optimal for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria). Ibuprofen was the most biodegradable compound being significantly degraded (49-100%) under any condition except heterotrophic denitrification. Sulfamethoxazole, exhibited the highest removal (70%) under optimal conditions for nitrifying bacteria but in the rest of the experiments anoxic conditions were found to be slightly more favorable (up to 58%). For metoprolol the highest performance was obtained under anoxic conditions favoring anammox bacteria (62%). Finally, carbamazepine and venlafaxine were hardly removed (<= 10% in the majority of cases). Taken together, these results suggest the specificity of different microbial groups that in combination with alternating operational parameters can lead to enhanced removal of some micropollutants.

AB Lime amendment of biosolids can produce large quantities of hydroxyl ions and increase biosolids pH. The mobility of some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) is closely correlated with the pH of biosolids. In this study the mobility of six PPCPs: erythromycin, fluoxetine, carbamazepine, naproxen, gemfibrozil and triclosan, was measured in unamended and lime-amended biosolids over 63 days. Biosolids were equilibrated either a at pH range of 5.5-11.5 or cured over a time period up to 63 days. The mobility was calculated as the proportion of PPCPs associated with the soluble phase after a given equilibrium time or a curing period. In unamended biosolids the mobility of erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil and triclosan decreased, the mobility of naproxen increased and the mobility of carbamazepine was almost unchanged over 63 days of curing. Compared to unamended biosolids, lime addition increased the mobility of erythromycin and naproxen by 21.7% and 33.8% respectively, but suppressed the mobility of carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil and triclosan by up to 100% after 63 days. The pH influence on hydrophobicity and speciation of PPCPs correlated well with the mobility of erythromycin and fluoxetine, but only partially correlated with the mobility of the other 4 compounds over the pH of 5.5-11.5. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) and emission-excitation matrices (EEMs) provided spectroscopic evidences showing that the increases in amide and carboxylic groups, the decrease in polysaccharides, and the increases in humic substances in dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be responsible for the changes in the PPCPs' mobility. The effects of lime amendment lasted for approximately a month. The results of this work suggest that lime amendment prevents some PPCPs from being dissolved in biosolids soluble phases, but may not "lock" all PPCPs into biosolids. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sites of wastewater discharge are hotspots for pollution of freshwaters with organic micropollutants and are often associated with adverse effects to aquatic organisms. The assessment, monitoring and managment of these hotspots is challenged by variations in the pollutant mixture composition due to season, weather conditions and random spills. In this study, we unraveled temporal exposure patterns in organic micropollutant mixtures from wastewater discharge and analyzed respective acute and sublethal risks for aquatic organisms. Samples were taken from two components of a separate sewer system i) a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and ii) a rain sewer of a medium size town as well as from the receiving river in different seasons. Rain sewer samples were separately collected for rain and dry-weather conditions. We analyzed 149 compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By considering the pollution dynamics in the point sources, we reduced the complexity of pollutant mixtures by k-means clustering to a few emission groups representing temporal and weather-related pollution patterns. From these groups, we derived biological quality element (BQE) - specific risk patterns. In most cases, one main risk driving emission group and a few individual risk driving compounds were identified for each BQE. While acute risk for fish was quite low, algae were exposed to seasonally emitted herbicides (terbuthylazine, spiroxamine) and crustaceans to randomly spilled insecticides (diazinon, dimethoate). Sublethal risks for all BQE were strongly influenced by constantly emitted pollutants, above all, pharmaceuticals. Variability of risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events. Overall, the studied WWTP represented the major pollution source with a specific emission of agricultural compounds. However, the investigated rain sewer showed to be a constant pollution source due to illicit connections and was an important entry route for high loads of insecticides and biocides due to spills or incorrect disposal. By considering these pollution and risk dynamics, monitoring strategies may be optimized with a special focus on times of low flow conditions in the river, rain events and seasonally emitted risk drivers.

AB Sulfate radical (SO4(center dot-))-induced oxidation is an important technology in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of pollutants. To date, few studies have assessed the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the SO4 center dot(-)induced oxidation of organic micro-pollutants. In the present work, a quantum chemical calculation was used to investigate the influence of the external oxygen molecule on the Gibbs free energy (G(pollutant)) and HOMO-LUMO gap (Delta E) of 15 organic micro-pollutants representing four chemical categories. Several thermodynamic and statistical models were combined with the data from the quantum chemical calculation to illustrate the impact of DO on the oxidation of organic micropollutants by SO4(center dot-). Results indicated that the external oxygen molecule increased G(pollutant) of all studied chemicals, which implies DO has the potential to decrease the energy barrier of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation and shift the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products. From the perspective of kinetics, DO can accelerate the oxidation by decreasing Delta E of organic micro-pollutants. In addition, changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation were both significantly different between open-chain and aromatic chemicals, and these differences were partially attributed to the difference of polarizability of these two types of chemicals. Furthermore, we revealed that all changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E induced by DO were dependent on the DO content. Our study emphasizes the significance of DO on the oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by SO4(center dot-), and also provides a theoretical method to study the effect of components in wastewater on removal of organic pollutants in AOPs.

AB Emerging pollutants, including pharmaceutical compounds, are producing water pollution problems around the world. Some pharmaceutical pollutants, which mainly reach ecosystems within wastewater discharges, are persistent in the water cycle and can also reach the food chain. This work addresses this issue, accounting the grey component of the water footprint (GWF(P)) for four of the most common pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KTP) and naproxen (NPX)). In addition, the GWF(C) for the main conventional pollutants is also accounted (nitrate, phosphates and organic matter). The case study is the Murcia Region of southeastern Spain, where wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) purify 99.1% of the wastewater discharges and there is an important direct reuse of the treated wastewater in irrigation. Thus, the influence of WWTPs and reuse on the GWF is analysed. The results reveal that GWF B only taking into account pharmaceutical pollutants, has a value of 301 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) considering only conventional pollutants (GWF(C)), this value increases to 4718 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) . So, the difference between these values is such that in other areas with consumption habits similar to those of the Murcia Region, and without wastewater purification, conventional pollutants may well establish the value of the GWF. On average, the WWTPs reduce the GWF(C) by 90% and the GWF(P) by 26%. These different reductions of the pollutant concentrations in the treated effluents show that the GWF is not only due to conventional pollutants, and other contaminants can became critical, such as the pharmaceutical pollutants. The reuse further reduces the value of the GWF for the Murcia Region, by around 43.6%. However, the reuse of treated wastewater is controversial, considering the pharmaceutical contaminants and their possible consequences in the food chain. In these cases, the GWF of pharmaceutical pollutants can be used to provide a first approximation of the dilution that should be applied to the treated wastewater discharges when they are reused for another economic activity that imposes quality restrictions. For the case of agriculture in the Murcia Region, the dilution required is 2 (fresh water) to 1 (treated wastewater), taking into account the pollution thresholds established in this work.

AB N-nitrosamines are a group of potent human carcinogens that can be formed during oxidative treatment of drinking water and wastewater. Many tertiary and quaternary amines present in consumer products (e.g., pharmaceuticals, personal care and household products) are known to be N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors during chloramination, but the formation of other N-nitrosamines has been rarely studied. This study investigates the specific and total N-nitrosamine (TONO) formation potential (FP) of various precursors from nitrogen-containing micropollutants (chlorhexidine, metformin, benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) and tertiary and quaternary model amines (trimethyl amine, N,N-dimethylbutyl amine, N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine and tetramethyl ammonium). All the studied nitrogenous micropollutants displayed quantifiable TONO FP, with molar yields in the range 0.04-11.92%. However, the observed TONO pools constituted mostly of uncharacterized species, not included in US-EPA 8270 N-nitrosamines standard mix. Only the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride showed quantifiable NDMA FP (0.56% molar yield), however, explaining only a minor fraction of the observed TONO FP. The studied model amines showed molar NDMA yields from 0.10% (trimethyl amine) to 5.05% (N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine), very similar to the molar TONO yields. The comparison of the FPs of micropollutants and model compounds showed that the presence of electron donating functional groups (such as a benzyl group) in tertiary and quaternary amine precursors leads to a higher formation of NDMA and uncharacterized N-nitrosamines, respectively. LC-qTOF screening of a list of proposed N-nitrosamine structures has enabled to identify a novel N-nitrosamine (N-nitroso-N-methyldodecylamine) from the chloramination of benzalkonium chloride. This finding supports the hypothesis that different functional groups in quaternary amines can act as leaving groups during chloramination and form differing N-nitrosamine structures at significant yield. Molar TONO yields determined for micropollutants were finally validated under experimental conditions closer to real water matrices, confirming their representativeness also for lower concentration ranges.

AB The concentration of antiretroviral drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) effluents and surface waters of many countries has increased significantly due to their widespread use for HIV treatment. In this study, the removal of stavudine and zidovudine under UV254 photolysis or UV254/H2O2 was investigated in a micro capillary film (MCF) photoreactor, using minimal water samples quantities. The UV254 quantum yield of zidovudine, (2.357 +/- 0.0589).10(-2) mol ein(-1) (pH 4.0-8.0), was 28-fold higher that the yield of stavudine (8.34 +/- 0.334).10(-4) mol ein(-1) (pH 6.0-8.0). The second -order rate constant k(OH,i) of reaction of hydroxyl radical with the antiretrovirals (UV254/H2O2 process) were determined by kinetics modeling: (9.98 +/- 0.68).10(8) M-1 s(-1) (pH 4.0-8.0) for zidovudine and (2.03 +/- 0.18).10(9) M-1 s(-1) (pH 6.0-8.0) for stavudine. A battery of ecotoxicological tests (i.e. inhibition growth, bioluminescence, mutagenic and genotoxic activity) using bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri, Salmonella typhimurium), crustacean (Daphnia magna) and algae (Raphidocelis subcapitata) revealed a marked influence of the UV dose on the ecotoxicological activity. The UV254/H2O2 treatment process reduced the ecotoxicological risk associated to direct photolysis of the anti-retrovirals aqueous solutions, but required significantly higher UV254 doses (>= 2000 mJ cm(-2)) in comparison to common water UV disinfection processes.

AB Antibiotics are entrained in agricultural soil through the application of manures from medicated animals. In the present study, a series of small field plots was established in 1999 that receive annual spring applications of a mixture of tylosin, sulfa-methazine, and chlortetracycline at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg.kg(-1) soil. These antibiotics are commonly used in commercial swine production. The field plots were cropped continuously for soybeans, and in 2012, after 14 annual antibiotic applications, the nodules from soybean roots were sampled and the occupying brady-rhizobia were characterized. Nodules and isolates were serotyped, and isolates were distinguished using 16S rRNA gene and 16S to 23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region sequencing, multilocus sequence typing, and RS alpha fingerprinting. Treatment with the antibiotic mixture skewed the population of bradyrhizobia dominating the nodule occupancy, with a significantly larger proportion of Bradyrhizobium liaoningense organisms even at the lowest dose of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) soil. Likewise, all doses of antibiotics altered the distribution of RS alpha fingerprint types. Bradyrhizobia were phenotypically evaluated for their sensitivity to the antibiotics, and there was no association between in situ treatment and a decreased sensitivity to the drugs. Overall, long-term exposure to the antibiotic mixture altered the composition of bradyrhizobial populations occupying nitrogen-fixing nodules, apparently through an indirect effect not associated with the sensitivity to the drugs. Further work evaluating agronomic impacts is warranted.
   IMPORTANCE Antibiotics are entrained in agricultural soil through the application of animal or human waste or by irrigation with reused wastewater. Soybeans obtain nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Here, we evaluated the impact of 14 annual exposures to antibiotics commonly used in swine production on the distribution of bradyrhizobia occupying nitrogen-fixing nodules on soybean roots in a long-term field experiment. By means of various sequencing and genomic fingerprinting techniques, the repeated exposure to a mixture of tylosin, sulfamethazine, and chlortetracycline each at a nominal soil concentration of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) soil was found to modify the diversity and identity of bradyrhizobia occupying the nodules. Nodule occupancy was not associated with the level of sensitivity to the antibiotics, indicating that the observed effects were not due to the direct toxicity of the antibiotics on bradyrhizobia. Altogether, these results indicate the potential for long-term impacts of antibiotics on this agronomically important symbiosis.

AB A UVC-assisted photo-Fenton process was applied to hospital wastewater that had been submitted to anaerobic treatment. Low iron (10 mu M; 0.56 mg L-1) and H2O2 (500 mu M; 17 mg L-1) concentrations were used at the natural pH of the effluent (pH approximate to 7.4). Citric acid was employed as a complexation agent, at a 1:1 ratio, in order to maintain Fe3+ soluble at this pH, avoiding extra procedures and costs associated with acidification/basification of the final effluent. The anaerobic process quantitatively reduced the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC), with low removal of antibiotics present in the wastewater. Degradation of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, sulfathiazole, and sulfamethazine was studied by spiking the anaerobic effluent at initial concentrations of 200 mu g L-1. The antibiotics were efficiently degraded (80-95%) using UVC radiation alone, although under this condition, no DOC removal was observed after 90 min. Further additions of H2O2 and iron citrate increased the degradation rate constant (k(obs)), and 8% of DOC was removed. A lower pH resulted in higher k(obs), although this was not essential for application of the photo-Fenton process. Irradiation with a germicidal lamp resulted in greater degradation of the antibiotics, compared to use of a black light lamp or sunlight, since the overall degradation was influenced by photolysis of the antibiotics, photolysis of H2O2, and the Fenton reaction. The photo-Fenton treatment could also be applied directly to the raw hospital wastewater, since no significant difference in degradation of the antibiotics was observed, compared to the anaerobic effluent. The photo-Fenton process under UVA and solar radiation reduced total coliforms and E. coli after 90 min. However, quantitative disinfection of these bacteria present in the Hospital effluent was only accomplished under UVC radiation.

AB In the aquatic environment, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of contaminants which may alter the toxicity profile of each compound, compared to its toxicity alone. Pharmaceutical drugs (e.g. carbamazepine (CBZ) and cetirizine (CTZ)) and metals (e.g. cadmium (Cd)) are among those contaminants that co-occur in the environment. However, most studies concerning their toxicity towards aquatic species are based on single exposure experiments. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate single and combined effects of Cd and CBZ or CTZ (single conditions: Cd, CTZ, CBZ; combined conditions: CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) on biomarkers related to oxidative stress and energy metabolism in the edible clam Ruditapes philippinarum, by exposing the organisms for 28 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of these contaminants. The biomarkers studied were: i) the electron transport system activity, protein and glycogen contents (indicators of organisms' metabolic status and energy reserves); ii) lipid peroxidation and the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (indicators of oxidative stress); iii) superoxide dismutase and catalase activities (enzymes indicators of antioxidant defence) and iv) activity of glutathione S-transferases (family of enzymes indicators of biotransformation capacity). Results obtained showed that the uptake of Cd and CBZ was not affected by the combined presence of the contaminants. However, for CTZ, the uptake was higher in the presence than in the absence of Cd. Concerning toxicity data, in general, the combined exposures (CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) had lower biological effects than the contaminants alone. Nevertheless, our data showed that despite the low concentrations tested, they were enough to exert biological effects that differed between single and combined treatments, evidencing the need to conduct more co-exposure studies to increase the environmental relevance of the gathered data.

AB A pilot-scale study was conducted to investigate the fate of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge. Of the 44 TrOCs monitored, 24 were detected in all primary sludge samples. Phase distribution of TrOCs was correlated well with their hydrophobicity (> 67% mass in the solid phase when LogD > 1.5). The pilot-scale anaerobic digester achieved a steady performance with a specific methane yield of 0.39-0.92 L/gVS(removed) and methane composition of 63-65% despite considerable variation in the primary sludge. The fate of TrOCs in the aqueous and solid phases was governed by their physicochemical properties. Biotransformation was significant (> 83%) for five TrOCs with logD < 1.5 and electron donating functional groups in molecular structure. The remaining TrOCs with logD < 1.5 were persistent and thus accumulated in the aqueous phase. Most TrOCs with logD > 1.5 were poorly removed under anaerobic conditions. Sorption onto the solid phase appears to impede the biodegradation of these TrOCs.

AB Cytostatic drugs, mainly used as chemotherapy compounds, can pose serious threats to aqueous ecosystem and human health once released into the natural environment. We investigated the use of an anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) for removing cytostatic drugs from wastewater. The AnOMBR utilizes a dense forward osmosis (FO) membrane in an anaerobic digester with prolonged sludge retention time (60 days). The high rejection of the FO membrane combined with the extended organic retention time in the reactor ensured high removal rates (more than 95.6%) for all the eight cytostatic drugs investigated. With regard to their removal routes in the AnOMBR, the eight cytostatic drugs can be divided into several groups. Doxorubicin, Epirubicin and Tamoxifen were nearly completely removed through the adsorption of anaerobic sludge, while Methotrexate and Cyclophosphamide were mainly removed by biodegradation and FO rejection, respectively. In addition, Mitotane, Azathioprine and Flutamide were removed by both biodegradation and adsorption. This work provides critical insights into the removal mechanisms of high-retention AnOMBRs.

AB We predicted the possible direct and indirect phototransformation kinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBU) and diclofenac (DIC) in river water, based on data of water chemistry obtained for the Guadiana River near Badajoz (Southwestern Spain) during a year-round sampling campaign. The three compounds were chosen, (i) because they occurred at the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Badajoz, as well as in river water sampled 1 km downstream of the WWTP, and (ii) because their photochemical fate in surface waters is known well enough to be modelled. The predicted phototransformation kinetics would be negligible in winter and fastest in April-August, with comparable rate constants in April through August despite differences in sunlight irradiance. Favourable water chemistry would in fact offset the lower irradiance, and vice versa. Half-life times of at least three weeks - one month are predicted for CBZ and IBU. Photodegradation may be an important attenuation pathway for biorecalcitrant CBZ, while IBU photochemistry is unlikely to be competitive with other processes including biodegradation. The predicted DIC photochemical half-life times of 7-10 days in April-August would be comparable with the biodegradation kinetics data reported in the literature. Photochemistry might not induce extensive phototransformation of xenobiotics in the Guadiana River under normal flow conditions, but it could become important in the case of low flow produced by water scarcity.

AB The emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals posed high risk and much uncertainty to eco-environment and human health. An analytical method, developed for the simultaneous determination of five steroid estrogens in groundwater and soil based upon solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was applied to investigate the distribution of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol around Shenyang City with particular focus on penetrating from surface to groundwater in this study. Mean concentrations of the estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were 55.1 ng L-1 and 56.1 ng L-1 in groundwater, 32.5 ng g(-1) and 23.1 ng g(-1) in soil, respectively. The distribution of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were similar in groundwater, the concentration in the west of the site center was relatively low, and the surroundings were relatively high. The concentration of estrone was changed less, but 17 beta-estradiol was significantly increased in silt and silty sand layers in vadose zone profiles. Both estrone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations changed abruptly at the interface of layers. Incorporating the temporal and spatial evolution of physical-chemical-biological environmental parameters at the sites, sorption and biodegradation were suggested the controlling roles in the fate and transport of SEs in the soil-groundwater system. The Ecological risk quotients values of both soil and groundwater indicated a very high ecological risk associated with SEs, but the non-carcinogenic harm quotients did not exceed the acceptable level of non-carcinogenic human health risk.

AB The current study was carried out to investigate the efficiency of using magnetic mesoporous of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized silica-coated magnetite for removing amoxicillin (AMX) and tetracycline (TC) from tap water, river water, and medical wastewater as real samples. The properties of the synthesized adsorbent were characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, pH(pzc), and also Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) methods. The BET surface area and the average diameter of mesoporous Fe3O4/SiO2/CTAB-SiO2 in accordance with TEM were 157.8 m(2) g(-1) and around 55 nm, respectively. In batch tests, the adsorption parameters, including the initial concentration, contact time, pH of solution, ionic strength, and adsorbent dose, were analysed. The experimental adsorption data were modelled using different classical and recently developed models. According to the results, the maximum adsorption capacities of AMX and TC on mesoporous Fe3O4/SiO2/CTAB-SiO2 were found to be 362.66 and 220.70 mg g(-1), respectively. Also, the results indicated that AMX and TC loaded on the adsorbent could be easily desorbed with 0.1 mol L-1 HNO3 (+) acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) and the adsorbent showed good reusability for the adsorption of the drugs studied.

AB This study explores the feasibility of durian seed as an alternative precursor for the preparation of eco-friendly activated carbon (DSAC) via physiochemical activation. The porosity, functionality, and surface chemistry of DSAC were featured by means of low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, evaluation of surface acidity/basicity, and zeta potential measurement. The adsorption behavior was examined by performing batch adsorption experiments using acetaminophen (ACT) as the model pollutant. Experimental data were simulated using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. Kinetic modeling was fitted to the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations. Results illustrated an encouraging performance toward the removal of ACT, with a monolayer adsorption capacity of 304.48 mg/g. The adsorption equilibrium was best confronted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while the adsorptive removal of ACT onto DSAC was satisfactorily described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The findings demonstrated the applicability of DSAC as a promising adsorbent for the adsorptive treatment of analgesic ACT from the pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater.

AB Recent studies have highlighted that antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) entering aquatic systems through wastewater discharges might impact organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, two snail species (Gibbula unbilicalis and Lymnea stagnalis) representing the marine and freshwater environments were exposed to a large range of fluoxetine concentrations (1 ng L-1-1 mg L-1) and two distinct behaviours (foot detachment and righting time) were recorded. Fluoxetine significantly caused foot detachment only at the higher of the concentrations (1 mg L-1) in both species during the course of this short term 1.5 h and 4 h exposures. In this study, lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) for foot detachment fell repeatedly within the range for other gastropod snails exposed to fluoxetine. Fluoxetine effected righting times in a concentration dependant manner but only significantly within G. unbilicalis in the highest concentration. Reviewing existing data on the effects of antidepressants on a range of endpoints in gastropod molluscs reveals wide variability of results. The importance of publishing 'negative' and/or non-dramatic results to aid risk assessment are discussed along with the variability between antidepressants, model species, experimental designs and endpoints.

AB This study examined functional bentonite-supported nanoscale Fe/Ni (B-Fe/Ni) for the simultaneous removal of beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin (AMX), ampicillin (AMP) and penicillin (PEN). The results show only 94.6% of AMX, 80.6% of AMP and 53.7% of PEN were removed in the mixed antibiotic solution, while 97.5% of AMX, 85.1% of AMP and 74.5% of PEN were removed in individual antibiotic solution. The decreased removal in a mixed antibiotic solution was attributed to competition between antibiotics for: firstly, active sites of iron oxide for the adsorption; and secondly, accepted electrons for the degradation in passivation of the nZVI surface. These were confirmed by various characterization techniques. Kinetics studies of mixed antibiotics using B-Fe/Ni confirmed that adsorption and degradation occurred simultaneously as removing of antibiotics in the presence of particles. Furthermore, the stability and durability of B-Fe/Ni applied to remove beta-lactam antibiotics was demonstrated. Finally, B-Fe/Ni was used to reduce the concentration of mixed antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater, which indicated B-Fe/Ni is a promising material for antibiotics wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are excreted by humans and animals and released into the aquatic environment through wastewater, which can have potential negative impacts on ecological systems. To conduct a nationwide investigation of the occurrence of PhACs in water resources in China, an analytical procedure based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and LC-MS/MS was used to measure 45 PhACs in surface water samples from a network of 29 rivers across 31 provinces in China in 2014 and 2015. PhACs were prevalent in all sampled streams. The concentrations of commonly detected PhACs were comparable to those detected in other countries. High total concentrations (mean > 1 mu g L-1) of all tested PhACs were primarily detected in areas under extreme water stress, specifically northern and eastern coastal areas. Source apportionment based on the profiles of the target compounds found that 54% of the PhACs in China originated from freshly discharged untreated sewage. Metformin (MET) and its biodegradation product, guanylurea (GUL), were used as a pair of indicators to predict PhAC contamination levels and differentiate between biotreated and unbiotreated wastewater. High MET/GUL can be used to indicate untreated wastewater, whereas low MET/GUL values are a strong indicator of treated wastewater. Furthermore, wastewater biotreatment ratios were calculated. We estimated that the bio-treatment ratios of most of the provinces in China were less than 50%. We conclude that more attention should be paid to untreated sewage water, especially water in rural areas rather than the existing concentration on urban sewage treatment-oriented management.

AB Forest-water reuse (FWR) systems treat municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters via land application to forest soils. Previous studies have shown that both large-scale conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and FWR systems do not completely remove many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) before release of treated wastewater. To better characterize CECs and potential for increased implementation of FWR systems, FWR systems need to be directly compared to conventional WWTPs. In this study, both a quantitative, targeted analysis and a nontargeted analysis were utilized to better understand how CECs release to waterways from an FWR system compared to a conventional treatment system. Quantitatively, greater concentrations and total mass load of CECs was exhibited downstream of the conventional WWTP compared to the FWR. Average summed concentrations of 33 targeted CECs downstream of the conventional system were similar to 1000 ng/L and downstream of the FWR were similar to 30 ng/L. From a nontargeted chemical standpoint, more tentatively identified chemicals were present, and at a greater relative abundance, downstream of the conventional system as well. Frequently occurring contaminants included phthalates, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. These data indicate that FWR systems represent a sustainable wastewater treatment alternative and that emerging contaminant release to waterways was lower at a FWR system than a conventional WWTP.

AB Parabens have been widely used as antimicrobial agents, mainly in food products, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Although they are known as safe preservatives, they also cause some harm to human health, which has been discussed lately. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of nine parabens (including isomers) in mineral and drinking waters, besides in drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) samples with determination by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both methods solid phase extraction (SPE) and QuEChERS were validated. Calibration curves showed a correlation coefficient of 0.99 for all compounds. LOQ values ranged from 0.04 to 4 mu g L-1 in aqueous matrices and from 5 to 500 ng g(-1) in DWTS. Recoveries between 70 and 115% were reached with RSD below 20% for all compounds in SPE whereas recoveries between 62 and 119% were found with RSD below 20% for almost all compounds in QuEChERS. Matrix effect had low values (< 20%); it was only above 20% for methylparaben in the SPE and for pentylparaben in the QuEChERS. Using a quick and simple extraction procedures with SPE, QuEChERS, and LC-MS/MS analyses, these methods proved to be selective and sensitive. They were successfully applied to real samples (treated water, mineral water, and sludge), and methylparaben was detected at concentration levels below 0.242 mu g L-1 in mineral and treated water samples and 10 ng g(-1) in DWTS samples.

AB In the current study a high sensitive analytical method was developed for the determination of 60 steroids including glucocorticoids (GC), mineralocorticoids (MC), and progestogens (PG) in WWTP effluents and surface water using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). The limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 0.02 ng/L (cortisone) to 0.5 ng/L (drospirenone) in surface water and from 0.05 ng/L (betamethasone) to 5 ng/L (chlormadinone) in treated wastewater. After optimization, the developed method was applied to WWTP effluents, rivers, and streams around Germany. Numerous steroids have been detected during the sampling campaign and predominant analytes from all steroid types were determined. Moreover, the occurrence of dienogest, mometasone furoate, flumethasone pivalate, and the metabolites 6 beta-hydroxy dienogest, 6 beta-hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide, 7 alpha-thiomethyl spironolactone, and 11 alpha-hydroxy canrenone is reported for the first time. In addition, this study revealed the ubiquitous presence of topically applied GC monoesters betamethasone propionate, betamethasone valerate, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone propionate in WWTP effluents and surface water.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been suggested as reservoirs and sources of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. In a WWTP ecosystem, human enteric and environmental bacteria are mixed and exposed to pharmaceutical residues, potentially favoring genetic exchange and thus ARG transmission. However, the contribution of microbial communities in WWTPs to ARG dissemination remains poorly understood. Here, we examined for the first time plasmid permissiveness of an activated sludge microbial community by utilizing an established fluorescent bioreporter system. The activated sludge microbial community was challenged in standardized filter matings with one of three multidrug resistance plasmids (pKJKS, pB10, and RP4) harbored by Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida. Different donor-plasmid combinations had distinct transfer frequencies, ranging from 3 to SO conjugation events per 100000 cells of the WWTP microbial community. In addition, transfer was observed to a broad phylogenetic range of 13 bacterial phyla with several taxa containing potentially pathogenic species. Preferential transfer to taxa belonging to the predicted evolutionary host range of the plasmids was not observed. Overall, the ARG dissemination potential uncovered in WWTP communities calls for a thorough risk assessment of ARG transmission across the wastewater system, before identification of possible mitigation strategies.

AB Effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was treated on-site with the UV/chlorine (UV/HOCl) advanced oxidation process (AOP) using a pilot plant equipped with a medium pressure UV lamp with an adjustable performance of up to 1 kW. Results obtained from parallel experiments with the same pilot plant, where the state of the art UV/H2O2 AOP was applied, were compared regarding the removal of emerging contaminants (EC) and the formation of adsorbable organohalogens (AOX). Furthermore, the total estrogenic activity was measured in samples treated with the UV/chlorine AOP. At an energy consumption of 0.4 kWh/m(3) (0.4 kW, 1 m(3)/h) and in a range of oxidant concentrations from 1 to 6 mg/L, the UV/chlorine AOP had a significantly higher EC removal yield than the UV/H2O2 AOP. With free available chlorine concentrations (FAC) in the UV chamber influent of at least 5 mg/L (11 mg/L of dosed Cl-2), the total estrogenic activity could be reduced by at least 97%. To achieve a certain concentration of FAC in the UV chamber influent, double to triple the amount of dosed Cl-2 was needed, resulting in AOX concentrations of up to 520 mu g/L.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the changes in microbiological communities present in sewage sludge (SS) when subjected to an electric field. The establishment of these relations is important to design and optimize an electrotechnology that not only promotes a direct degradation of the emerging organic contaminants, through electrodegradation, but also stimulates their biodegradation. Different current intensities were used continuously or by steps, in a two compartment electrodialytic (ED) cell. Samples collected between May and July of 2015 were analysed, prior to ED treatment, and the 35 Taxa identified were divided in 12 groups. Initial samples, collected on May, were mainly constituted by stalked ciliates (86%), followed by shelled amoebae (8%), whereas the samples collected between June and July presented higher number of shelled amoebae, between 52 and 92%. Epistylis, Vorticella and Arcella gibbosa were the most frequent protozoa identified. Samples richness (R) was between 7 and 14, Simpson's biodiversity index (D) between 0.45 and 0.69, and evenness between 0.42 and 0.65. At the end of the ED experiments, a decrease in the number of identified Taxa and individuals was observed and, consequently, SS biodiversity also decreased. This decline was more pronounced in the ED experiments conducted with currents above 50 mA (0.10 mA cm(-2)). In terms of abundance, the final SS was mainly constituted by shelled amoebae that showed to be the most resistant to the conditions within the ED cell. The obtained results showed that the studied conditions within the ED cell were not appropriate to the microbiological communities, which influenced the final SS quality.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical industrial wastewater contains a high amount of suspended solids and alkaline (pH > 8); therefore it requires approprite coagulant and flocculant compounds for its wastewater treatment. The most widely used flocculant is a synthetic that has certain problems such as non-biodegradability and releases of toxic residual monomers. The use of eco-friendly flocculants as alternative materials for conventional flocculant in water and wastewater treatments is increasing. Numerous factors influence the performance of coagulation-flocculation process, such as coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage, initial potential of hydrogen (pH) and velocity gradient of coagulation-flocculation. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the capability and effectiveness of Moringa oleifera extract for removal of suspended solid in herbal pharmaceutical industry. A coagulation-flocculation test was done by performing jar test at various speeds, according to the variation of the conducted treatment research. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) approach was used to optimize the concentration of coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage and flocculation velocity gradient (G), and the results were measured as maximum percentage of suspended solid removal. The wastewater used in this research originally came from the inlet of herbal pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant, which was collected over 3 days. The wastewater has a total suspended solids of more than 1250 mg/L, and was alkaline (pH 9-10). The moringa extract was made from the extraction of a fat free moringa powder with a salt solution in a certain ratio. The percentage removal of suspended solid was 93.42-99.54%. The final results of the analysis of response surface showed that the variables of flocculant dosage and the flocculation velocity gradient (G) have a huge impact on the amount of suspended solid removal, compared with the coagulant dosage. The model generated from the response analysis is a quadratic model. The optimum point of the removal suspended solid quadratic model is at 10.6566 mg/L alum dosage, 13.8185 ml/L Moringa oleifera extract dosage, and G velocity of flocculation 84.845 sec(-1).

AB This research was aimed to prepare a magnetically photocatalyst enabling to degrade pharmaceutical wastewater and detoxification of pollutant such as naproxen, by visible light irradiation. The nano-sized NiS and NiO photocatalysts exhibit higher reactivity than their microsized counterparts, but separation of the used photocatalyst from the degradation solution is hard and imperfect. To remove this difficulty, magnetic polypyrrole core-shell (Fe3O4@PPY) was synthesized and employed as catalyst support. The magnetization property of the synthesized photocatalysts measured by VSM technique indicated that the photocatalysts were sufficiently magnetized to be readily separated from degradation solution by use of external magnetic field. The DRS study showed that the band gap of the photocatalysts shifted to lower energy after immobilization on the support materials leading to higher degradation efficiency. The optimal efficiency was obtained with the catalysts loaded with 50% of NiO and 50% of NiS. The augmenting effect of H2O2 and the inhibition influence of some organic and inorganic compounds on the degradation process were studied. Regeneration of the used photocatalyst was performed by heat treatment, and the catalyst treated at 400 degrees C retained most of its initial capacity. The degradation capacity was kinetically fast, and the equilibrium was attained within 30min.

AB Water pollution is a global health and environmental issue affecting all life forms. The treatment of water polluted by dyes, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals is a major challenge to operators of wastewater treatment facilities. Adsorption technology functions effectively in removing these pollutants using specific adsorbents. Graphene oxide (GO) and its three dimensional (3D) configurations are new carbon-based adsorbents. With superiorly large surface area, high porosity and large variety of functional groups, these materials have been tested for their potential application in wastewater treatment. This review focuses on the synthesis methods of 3D graphene-based structures and their adsorption performance of dyes, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals. Various synthesis methods have been successfully developed demonstrating the feasibility of configuring graphene into porous 3D networks. These methods can be categorised into direct synthesis and solution-based methods. The 3D graphene structures portrayed relatively high adsorption capacities for the three pollutant groups. Their adsorptive properties were influenced by characteristics of pollutant, adsorbent surface and process parameters. The major adsorption mechanisms of the 3D graphene-based structures were identified to be hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, pi-pi and hydrophobic interactions. This review indicated that 3D graphene configurations are promising solutions for practical application of carbon nanomaterials in wastewater treatment. 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Hospital wastewater and effluents from waste stabilization ponds in Kumasi, Ghana, are directly discharged as low quality water into nearby streams which are eventually used to irrigate vegetables. The presence of 12 commonly used antibiotics in Ghana (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, ampicillin, cefuroxime, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline) were investigated in water and lettuce samples collected in three different areas in Kumasi, Ghana. The water samples were from hospital wastewater, wastewater stabilization ponds, rivers and irrigation water, while the lettuce samples were from vegetable farms and market vendors. Antibiotics in water samples were extracted using SPE while antibiotics in lettuce samples were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction followed by SPE. All extracted antibiotics samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. All studied compounds were detected in concentrations significantly higher (p = 0.01) in hospital wastewater than in the other water sources. The highest concentration found in the present study was 15 mu g/L for ciprofloxacin in hospital wastewater. Irrigation water samples analyzed had concentrations of antibiotics up to 0.2 mu g/L. Wastewater stabilization ponds are low technology but effective means of removing antibiotics with removal efficiency up to 95% recorded in this study. However, some chemicals are still found in levels indicating medium to high risk of antibiotics resistance development in the environment. The total concentrations of antibiotics detected in edible lettuce tissues from vegetable farms and vegetable sellers at the markets were in the range of 12.0-104 and 11.0-41.4 ng/kg (fresh weight) respectively. The antibiotics found with high concentrations in all the samples were sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim. Furthermore, our study confirms the presence of seven antibiotics in lettuce from irrigation farms and markets, suggesting an indirect exposure of humans to antibiotics through vegetable consumption and drinking water in Ghana. However, estimated daily intake for a standard 60 kg woman was 0.3 ng/day, indicating low risk for human health. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Best results were obtained using microwave assisted extraction of 1.0 g of homogeneous lyophilized samples and 5 mL of a mixture ACN: H2O (1: 1 v/v) as extracting solvent. Analytical recoveries ranged from 60 to 107% with relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 15%. Limits of quantitation (LOQ) for the 6 pharmaceuticals flumequine (FLM), carbamazepine (CBZ), ciprofloxacin (CPR), enrofloxacin (ENR), diclofenac (DCL), and ibuprofen (IBU) were in the range 20.8-125 ng g(-1). The method was satisfactory applied for an uptake study in Lavandula dentata samples finding quantifying concentrations of FLM and CBZ in roots, leaf and stem. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite an increasing number of studies on pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), data on their concentrations in the environment are still scant. This is due to many factors, including great variability in usage and physicochemical properties of these compounds, which contribute to their widespread presence and complex behaviour, particularly in the aquatic environment. The main pathway for their discharge into the waterways is through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are inefficient in removing many of PPCP compounds. Therefore, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the role that WWTPs play in the presence of PPCPs in the environment, this paper proposes a new method for estimating the expected concentrations of these compounds in WWTP influents, effluents and sludge, as well as their expected discharge and related concentrations in freshwaters. The proposed method can assist with future eco-toxicological and environmental risk assessments as well as the development of policies and regulation related to PPCP compounds. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4 graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized by chemical coprecipitation method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction. A simple, rapid, convenient and environmentally friendly method was developed for separation and pre-concentration of trace amounts of bisphenol A, naproxen and triclosan in wastewater samples by high performance liquid chromatography with magnetic Fe3O4 graphene oxide nanocomposite as the adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction. Various parameters possibly influencing the extraction performance such as amount of the adsorbent, extraction time, sample pH and elution conditions were optimized. Under the optimal working conditions, the developed method showed good linearity (R>0.9997) in the range of 1-200 mu g/L, and the limits of detection are between 0.5 and 0.8 mu g/L. The enrichment factors are in the range of 81-89. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, is 3.36-4.26%.

AB The thermal reactivation of granular activated carbon is a substantial ecological and economic benefit in the process of drinking water treatment. A significant amount of abraded carbon, which is similar to powdered activated carbon (PAC), is produced that can be brought to application at wastewater treatment plant level for the removal of micropollutants in a powdered activated carbon-activated sludge (PAC-AS) system. This excess carbon derived as a by-product from the reactivation process in a waterworks was applied directly into the activated sludge tank and has been elevated in this study by monitoring the removal efficiencies for benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole in the effluent of a semi-technical wastewater treatment plant of 39 m(3). A simulation-derived sampling strategy was applied to optimize the recovery rates of the micropollutants. Flow-proportional, 72-hour composite sampling was considered best. The elimination rates obtained for a 10 g PAC.m(-3) dosage were 73% for benzotriazole, 59% for carbamazepine, 60% for diclofenac, 67% for metoprolol and 48% for sulfamethoxazole. The obtained results underline the importance of appropriate sampling strategies, which can be derived from hydraulic modeling.

AB The study aims to simultaneously control micropollutants and bromate formations by using ozonation and peroxone process. The batch experiments were run with variations in specific ozone dose (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-to-ozone (H2O2/O-3) ratio. Based on the removal by ozonation and peroxone, micropollutants were categorized into three groups: non-reactive compounds (i.e. amidotrizoate), moderately reactive compounds (i.e. metoprolol, acesulfame potassium, bezafibrate, and benzotriazole), and highly reactive compounds (i.e. carbamazepine and diclofenac). For ozonation and peroxone process, the removals for highly reactive compounds and moderately reactive compounds were 82-99% and 29-99%, respectively. The removal of amidotrizoate was not observed in this study. The effect of ozonation on micropollutant removals was similar to the peroxone process. However, differences in bromate formation were observed. Bromate formation depended on the SOD, while addition of hydrogen peroxide suppressed the bromate formation. The peroxone process at the H2O2/O-3 ratio of 0.3 was recommended to bromide-containing water below 100 mu g.L-1 for simultaneous control of micropollutants and bromate. Enhancement in micropollutant removals, except for the non-reactive groups, was achieved with either higher SOD or the addition of hydrogen peroxide to ozonation. The micropollutant removal predicted from the second-order kinetic reaction with ozone and center dot OH exposures was higher than the observed data.

AB Anaerobic biodegradability of wastewater discharged from a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical company was evaluated using two up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors with or without activated carbon addition to the seeding sludge. The wastewater had an anaerobic biodegradability of 86.1% and biogas yield of 52.9%. The addition of activated carbon improved the quality of the granular sludge, resulting in a strong anti-strike performance and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of around 75% at the organic loading rate of 7 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1). MiSeq PE300 analysis showed both reactors were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Microbial diversity was reduced in the pharmaceutical wastewater compared to the seeding sludge. The abundance of dominant Levilinea, Desulfovibrio, and Methanosaeta, which are the functional microorganism in treating this chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, significantly increased with the addition of activated carbon.

AB Human activities have contaminated water sources with pharmaceutical compounds by the improper disposal of unwanted medicine or through sewage waste. The search for the most effective water treatment processes has been ongoing for decades. In the current paper, by exposing water to non-thermal plasma in a floating electrode streamer corona discharge (FESCD) system, both the antidepressant compound fluoxetine and the antihypertensive compound propranolol are eliminated. After 3 h of plasma treatment, more than 99% of each contaminant was degraded. The energy yield, which is the amount of contaminants degraded using 1 kWh of energy, was in the range of 0.12-0.13 g/kWh. The degree of mineralization calculated from total organic carbon (TOC) measurements was 60% and 17% for fluoxetine and propranolol, respectively. Reaction with hydroxyl radicals was the only degradation pathway for fluoxetine and its byproducts. For propranolol, hydroxyl radicals primarily caused the degradation butoxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones suggested the possible role of ozone molecules.

AB Medicininal compounds and their metabolites are known to end up in sewerage and may slip through the cleaning process. Azole antimycotics are frequently used in hospitals, in particular for patients with cancer or immunosuppression. The aim of the study was to determine whether measurable azole antimycotic concentrations were introducted in the sewarage drain of an acute care hospital with special interest in oncology and hematology and the extent of removal of antimycotics by the sewerage treatment plant. For this, the concentrations of three commonly used azole antimycotics were measured in the effluent of the sewerage drain at the University Hospital Dresden, as well as in the influent and effluent of the main sewerage treatment plant of the city. To extrapolate the theoretical influent to the sewerage treatment plant, prescription from the region's main health insurance the AOK Sachsen and the hospital consumption data were used. Measurable concentrations were obtained for fluconazole and ketoconazole in the influent and effluent of the sewerage treatment plant. Voriconazole's concentrations were under the lower limit of quantification. To determine the azole clearance of the treatment plant a sludge sample was investigated. Sufficient clearance was detected for ketoconazole but not for fluconazole. The consumption and prescription rates were collected and correlated with the measured concentrations. In result, only fluconazole's concentrations provided a good match with the prescription and consumption data.

AB Over the past few years, the presence of steroid estrogens in the environment has become a major concern. In this study, the concentrations of estrone (E1 ), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) were measured in some wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Iran. These samples were collected from the municipal, rural, livestock, commercial, and hospital WWTPs, extracted by dispersive liquid-liquid micro extraction (DLLME) technique, derivatized, and detected by GC/MS. In these treatment plants, various processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS), aerated lagoon (AL), moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), and activated sludge with wetland (AS + WL) are used. The highest concentration of hormones was observed in the influents and effluents of livestock, municipal, commercial, and hospital WWTPs, respectively. The maximum elimination rate was obtained in MBBR followed by AS + WL, CAS and AL. The biodegradation and adsorption rates along with adsorption coefficients of lg k(d) and lg k(oc) were measured for all target compounds.

AB The influence of antibiotics, namely doxycycline, gentamicin, penicillin, nitrofurantoin, and rifampicin, on wastewater treatment was assessed. The presence of 100-300 mu g/L of antibiotics (63.52-134.41 mg/g.d.w.d) marginally influenced organic matter degradation, without impacting nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations. However, a significant increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was observed, which varied with different antibiotics. The largest number of bacteria became resistant to nitrofurantoin and penicillin. After the process, some multi-resistant strains were isolated from the sludge. Two of them revealed the activity of carbapenamase, the enzyme directly related to resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB Endotoxins are potential toxics impacting human health through respiration derived in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), yet the formation of endotoxins during wastewater treatment processes is still lacking research. In our study, the distribution of endotoxins and bacterial community structure in the wastewater of three full scale pharmaceutical WWTPs were explored using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test and MiSeq technique. Results showed that higher endotoxin activities in the influent of Plant A and Plant C (560 and 1140 EU/mL), stemming from the fermentation process, were found compared to that of Plant B (135 EU/mL), coming from the process of chemical synthesis. During the anaerobic treatment and the cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) in the three WWTPs, the endotoxin activity increased, while it declined in the aerobic treatment system. In all bioreactors, the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50.0-94.6%. Bacteria with high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in LAL assay were found at the genus level of Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Desulfovibrio, and Megasphaera.

AB Simultaneous application of solar photo-Fenton and ozonation (SPFO) for the efficient treatment of real wastewaters was studied. Four different industrial effluents were selected for the study: landfill leachate, pharmaceutical effluent and two textile wastewaters, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed technology. SPFO performance was compared with individual processes (either solar photo-Fenton or ozonation), as well as the hybrid Fenton and ozonation treatment. In highly polluted wastewaters, combined strategies led to higher organic matter removal than O-3 and photo-Fenton processes applied individually. Solar light favoured catalyst regeneration, allowing removal efficiencies up to 67% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 62% of total organic carbon (TOC) (in the case of textile wastewaters) using an initial concentration of only 10 mg Fe2+ L-1. The reduction of catalyst consumption, along with the absence of sludge production (since Fe2+ removal from the effluent is not required), led to a significant decrease in operational costs (up to 1.22 (sic) kg(-1) COD removed) when combined Fenton and ozonation was applied under solar light. SPFO results in a versatile, effective and economically efficient technology, thus postulating as a promising alternative for reducing the organic load of highly polluted industrial effluents prior to biological treatment.

AB The valorification of the marine biomass is an important resource for many industries like pharmaceutical, supplying raw material for the extraction of bioactive substances (vitamins, sterols and collagen), cosmetics, biofertilizers and wastewater treatment. In the last years a special attention has been given to the use of macroalgae. The aim of this study was to emphasize the capacity of two representative green algae species frequent presents on the Romanian shore, Ulva lactuca (L.) and Cladophora vagabunda (L.) Hoek, to remove two usual detergents from wastewater. The green algae washed, dried at room temperature, macerated to powder were introduced into different filter paper for comparison, then immersed in waste water treated with different concentrations of detergents. Tap water was used for the experiment. The results show that Ulva lactuca (L.) species is suitable than Cladophora vagabunda (L.) Hoek species, for wastewater treatment.

AB The activated sludge process in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) relies on the activity of microbes to reduce the organic and inorganic matter and produce effluent that is safe to discharge into receiving waters. This research examined the effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen and the antibiotic tetracycline on the relative abundance and composition of eukaryotes and bacteria in the microbial population present in activated sludge from a WWTP. The current investigation was designed to observe the impact of these contaminants, at low (environmentally relevant concentrations) as well as high concentrations of the drugs. Using 16S and 18S rRNA gene primer sets and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the abundance of each population was monitored as well as the relative ratio of the two populations under the various conditions. It was found that current environmentally relevant concentrations of ibuprofen (100 ng/mL) stimulated eukaryotic growth but higher concentrations (2,000 ng/mL, 100,000 ng/mL) reduced their numbers significantly especially in the presence of tetracycline. Finally using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, some of the more abundant eukaryotes were identified and it was noted that high ibuprofen and tetracycline concentrations favoured the abundance of some genera.

AB Olfaction is critical for survival, facilitating predator avoidance and food location. The nature of the olfactory system changes during amphibian metamorphosis as the aquatic herbivorous tadpole transitions to a terrestrial, carnivorous frog. Metamorphosis is principally dependent on the action of thyroid hormones (THs), L-thyroxine (T-4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3), yet little is known about their influence on olfaction during this phase of postembryonic development. We exposed Taylor Kollros stage I-XIII Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana tadpoles to physiological concentrations of Teb T-3, or 17-beta-estradiol (E-2) for 48 h and evaluated a predator cue avoidance response. The avoidance response in T-3-exposed tadpoles was abolished while T-4- or E-2-exposed tadpoles were unaffected compared to control tadpoles. qPCR analyses on classic TH-response gene transcripts (thra, thrb, and thibz) in the olfactory epithelium demonstrated that, while both THs produced molecular responses, T-3 elicited greater responses than T-4. Municipal wastewater feed stock was spiked with a defined pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) cocktail and treated with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). Despite substantially reduced PPCP levels, exposure to this effluent abolished avoidance behavior relative to AnMBR effluent whose feed stock was spiked with vehicle. Thibz transcript levels increased upon exposure to either effluent indicating TH mimic activity. The present work is the first to demonstrate differential TH responsiveness of the frog tadpole olfactory system with both behavioral and molecular alterations. A systems-based analysis is warranted to further elucidate the mechanism of action on the olfactory epithelium and identify further molecular bioindicators linked to behavioral response disruption.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals after discharged from hospital into wastewater was clarified experimentally by using a new lab-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment reactor. The 43 target compounds belong to nine therapeutic classes (antivirals, antibacterials, anticancer drugs, psychotropics, antihypertensives, analgesic-antipyretics, contrast media, herbal medicines, and phytoestrogens) were selected with inclusion of 16 newly estimated compounds. The efficiency of the present reactor was estimated by comparing the reaction rate constant of the solid-water partition coefficients (log K-d) between liquid and solid samples and half-life during 48-h experiment obtained by using hospital effluents with those obtained by using STP wastewater. The results that no significant difference in removal efficiency was observed between both water samples (P > 0.05) indicate high reliability of the present lab-scale reactor. The actual rates of removal when hospital effluent was applied varied widely (mean, 59 +/- 40%) independent of type of the pharmaceuticals. More than 90% of 17 compounds were removed after 8 h of treatment. However, the values for psychotropics (mean, 19 +/- 26%) and contrast media (mean, 24 +/- 17%) were generally low, indicating high stability. The log K (d) values ranged from 1.3 to 4.8. Notably, clarithromycin, acridine, and glycitein could be removed in both liquid and solid phases. The dominant removal mechanisms were found to be different for individual pharmaceutical. These results suggest the effectiveness of introduction of the lab-scale biological treatment system for development of a new solution for discharge of pharmaceuticals from hospital.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR), an antibiotic widely used in livestock and poultry production, has become ubiquitous in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as a result of veterinary excretion of the parent compound or its active metabolites. The sorption of NOR onto humic acid (HA) may influence the fate of NOR in the environment. In the present study, HA was extracted from sewage sludge in different composting stages of days 0, 10, 30, and 70 to investigate the sorption of NOR onto HA as affected by the humification degree of HA. The results of elemental and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum analyses showed that the contents of aromatic and carboxylic groups in HA increased with composting time, indicating an increase of humification degree. The result of sorption experiments demonstrated that the HA had a high sorption capacity for NOR with strong nonlinearity. A two-stage sorption was observed in the sorption process with an equilibration time of 48 h. Both the Freundlich model (Adj. R (2) range 0.988-0.994) and Langmuir model (Adj. R (2) range 0.917-0.928) fitted well with all sorption isotherms of the HA samples of different humification degrees. Moreover, the increase of sorption distribution coefficient (K (d) ) value with composting time indicated that the sorption affinity of HA for NOR increased with increasing humification degree of HA. The major sorption mechanism was the interaction between NOR and rich aromatic moieties and carboxylic group in the HA.

AB The occurrence of specific micropollutants (MPs), indicators of domestic and hospital wastewater, was investigated in a river connected to a karst spring based on two sampling campaigns under varying flow conditions. The MPs characterized by a high frequency of occurrence (acesulfame-K, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, nonylphenol, and iohexol) were highly reflective of wastewater discharged in ephemeral streams and tributaries, as well as specific point sources such as farms and hospital effluents. A mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes allows the quantification of the percentage of untreated wastewater effluents in inflowing water from river tributaries, which varied between 0.7-99% and 5.0-10% in low flow and high flow, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of MPs is related to the volume of wastewater input, extent of river dilution, persistence of the MPs, and type of point source contamination on the river. Relationships were established between MPs such as ibuprofen and acesulfame-K (ACE-K), indicating their co-existence in highly consumed generic medicine and their suitability as wastewater co-tracers. Additionally, the number of consumers of gemfibrozil (GEM) and acesulfame-K were estimated based on mass loads in the river tributaries for management purposes. Groundwater contamination is mostly due to diffuse and point sources infiltration occurring on the spring catchment, including the sinking stream that could contribute up to 17% to the mass loads of some micropollutants (e.g., ACE-K and GEM) at the spring. Nevertheless, the increase of MPs use with growing urbanization is expected to have a much significant impact on the groundwater quality in the future.

AB In this study, an integrated approach named the '333' strategy was applied to pollution control in the Jialu River, in northern China, which is heavily burdened with anthropogenic pollution. Due to a deficiency of the natural ecological inflow, the Jialu River receives predominantly industrial and municipal effluent. The '333' strategy is composed of three steps of pollution control including industrial point-source pollution control, advanced treatment of municipal wastewater, and ecological restoration; three increased stringency emission standards; and three stages of reclamation. Phase 1 of the '333' strategy focuses on industrial point-source pollution control; phase 2 aims to harness municipal wastewater and minimize sewage effluents using novel techniques for advanced water purification; phase 3 of the '333' strategy focuses on the further purification of effluents flowing into Jialu River with the employment of an engineering-based ecological restoration project. The application of the '333' strategy resulted in the development of novel techniques for water purification including modified magnetic resins (NDMP resin), a two-stage internal circulation anaerobic reactor (IC reactor) and an ecological restoration system. The results indicate that water quality in the river was significantly improved, with increased concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), as well as reduction of COD by 42.8% and NH3-N by 61.4%. In addition, it was observed that the total population of phytoplankton in treated river water notably increased from only one prior to restoration to 8 following restoration. This system also provides a tool for pollution control of other similar industrial and anthropogenic source polluted rivers.

AB Antibiotics are widely used, and there is a serious concern about its adverse impacts on the environment and human health. To our knowledge, prior to this work, there was no evidence of the potential presence of antibiotics in groundwater in China, despite populous speculations. This study reported the detection of 35 target antibiotics of 6 groups (chloramphenicois, lincosamides, marcrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines), in shallow groundwater samples collected in northern and southwestern China. Thirty-four of thirty-five target antibiotics were detected in the groundwater samples; 73 of 74 monitoring wells contained at least one antibiotic; and at least two antibiotics were detected in 72 of the 74 wells. Ofloxacin (1199.7 ng/L), lincomycin (860.7 ng/L), and norfloxacin (441.9 ng/L) as well as antibiotics with the highest detection frequency such as sulfapyridine (70%), norfloxacin (69%), and lincomycin (64%) were detected at elevated concentrations. The highest detection frequency and concentration of lincosamides were observed in those groundwater samples, but no clear distribution patterns were observed for the six antibiotic groups. Moreover, shallow groundwater in southwestern China seemed to contain most antibiotics, likely due to the high antibiotics discharge and frequent exchange of groundwater with surface matrices. The findings from this work suggest that groundwater in China has been widely contaminated by antibiotics, and presumably other pharmaceutical compounds that have not been investigated to date.

AB Herein we report on the interactions between two common pharmaceuticals and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) enter wastewater treatment plants from industrial and household sewers. These chemicals are not completely removed during wastewater processing, and in many countries, are being found in drinking water sources and in surface waters downstream of wastewater treatment plants. If treated wastewater effluent is re-used to irrigate crops, the potential adverse interactions between PPCPs and plants needs to be understood. beta-estradiol and gemfibrozil appeared to affect wheat seedlings through oxidative stress, as indicated by increases in lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide, carotenoid, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, plant cell damage in wheat seedlings was indicated by an increase in electrolyte leakage. Although our study was not designed to elucidate possible mechanisms, the changes in activity of plant enzymes in response to some pharmaceuticals is likely the consequence of oxidative stress and the initiation of pathways to protect the plant from further cell damage.

AB The UPLC MS/MS analysis showed the presence of the two antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry discharges during 3 months; norfloxacin and spiramycin which were quantified with the mean concentrations of 226.7 and 84.2 ng mL(-1), respectively. Sixteen resistant isolates were obtained from the pharmaceutical effluent and identified by sequencing. These isolates belong to different genera, namely Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Delftia, Shewanella, and Rheinheimera. The antibiotic resistance phenotypes of these isolates were determined (27 tested antibiotics-discs). All the studied isolates were found resistant to amoxicillin and gentamicin, and 83.33% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Multiple antibiotic resistances were revealed against beta-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides families. Our overall results suggest that the obtained bacterial isolates may constitute potential candidates for bioremediation and can be useful for biotechnological applications. Genotoxic effects were assessed by a battery of biotests; the pharmaceutical wastewater was genotoxic according to the bacterial Vitotox test and micronuclei test. Genotoxicity was also evaluated by the comet test; the tail DNA damages reached 38 and 22% for concentrated sample (10x) and non-concentrated sample (1x), respectively. However, the histological sections of kidney and liver's mice treated by pharmaceutical effluent showed normal histology and no visible structural effects or alterations as cytolysis, edema, or ulcerative necrosis were observed. Residual antibiotics can reach water environment through wastewater and provoke dissemination of the antibiotics resistance and induce genotoxic effects.

AB TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation of a mixture of four pharmaceutical emerging contaminants (ECs): caffeine, flumequine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, has been studied both in ultrapure and municipal wastewater with the main aim of checking the direct and indirect transfer mechanism of this process. Also, given the high importance of knowing the volumetric rate of photon absorption (VRPA) for the kinetics of the process, actinometrical results have been compared to those from the six flux model (SFM) application. Finally, kinetic equations derived from the direct and indirect transfer mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation have been deduced to fit experimental results and conclude about the possible removal way of ECs in water when this advanced oxidation process is applied.

The whole process was divided into five stages in terms of the variation of OLR ranging from 3.9 to 12.7 kg COD/(m(3).d). During 249 days of operating time, the average DMF, MC, IPA removal efficiency were 96.9%,98.2% and 96.4%, respectively. Cake layer was accumulated on the membrane surface acted as a dynamic secondary biofilm which lead to the increase of physical removal rate. In addition, mathematical statistical models was built on the linear regression techniques for exploring the inner relationship between EPS and the performance of the AnMBR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study the occurrence and the behavior of illicit drugs and their metabolites have been investigated for two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (namely, WWTP-1 and WWTP-2) located in Sicily (island of Italy). Samples were analyzed for methamphetamine, cocaine (COC), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methadone (METH), 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine (MDA); 3,4-methylenedioxy ethyl amphetamine (MDEA), 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and Benzoylecgonine (BEG). The BEG, COC, MOR and THC-COOH were found at the highest concentration in both WWTPs. The Wastewater-based epidemiology calculation for BEG, COC, cannabinoids and THC-COOH was performed. On average, for both plants, population consumes 1.6 and 23.4 dose 1000 inh(-1) day(-1) of cocaine and cannabis, respectively. For WWTP-1 negative removals of illicit drugs were observed. For WWTP-2 the following average removal efficiencies were obtained: BEG (77.85%), COC (92.34%), CODEINE (64.75%), MOR (90.16%) and THC-COOH (68.64%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Mezquital Valley system is the world's oldest and largest example with regard to use of untreated wastewater for agricultural irrigation. Because of the artificial high recharge associated with the Mezquital Valley aquifers, groundwater is extracted for human consumption, and there are plans to use this groundwater as a water resource for Mexico City. Thus, this study analyzed 218 organic micro-contaminants in wastewater, springs, and groundwater from Mezquital Valley. Five volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nine semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were detected in the wastewater used for irrigation. Only two SVOCs [bis-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate] were detected in all the wastewater canals and groundwater sources, whereas no VOCs were detected in groundwater and springs. Of the 118 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and 7 reproductive hormones measured, 65 PhACs and 3 hormones were detected in the wastewater. Of these, metformin, caffeine, and acetaminophen account for almost sixty percent of the total PhACs in wastewater. Nevertheless, 23 PhACs were detected in groundwater sources, where the majority of these compounds have low detection frequencies. The PhACs sulfamethoxazole, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, carbamazepine, and benzoylecgonine (primary cocaine metabolite) were frequently detected in groundwater, suggesting that although the soils act as a filter adsorbing and degrading the majority of the organic pollutant content in wastewater, these PhACs still reach the aquifer. Therefore, the presence of these PhACs, together with the high levels of the endocrine disruptor bis-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate, indicate that water sources derived from the recharge of the studied aquifers may pose a risk to consumer health.

AB Ozonation is used as additional wastewater treatment option to remove recalcitrant micropollutants. It also removes the estrogenic activity found in wastewater but not always the anti-estrogenic activity. This can be explained by an incomplete removal of anti-estrogenic micropollutants or by formation of transformation products (TPs) which retain the activity. The present study investigates the degradation of the anti-estrogenic pharmaceutical tamoxifen in pure water, regarding TP formation and related anti-estrogenic effect using Arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (A-YES). In total, five transformation products were detected: three N-oxides and two further products (TP 270 and TP 388). For the transformation product TP 270 a correlation of the extent of formation with an increase of the anti-estrogenic activity was determined, demonstrating that transformation products from ozonation can be more active in a bioassay than the parent compounds. Our study shows also that the transformation of tamoxifen to N-oxides reduces the anti-estrogenic activity. The reactivity of amines towards ozone typically increases with pH, since only deprotonated amines react with ozone. Hence, removal of the endocrine activity by N-oxide formation may be disfavored at low pH. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies showed that some organic micropollutants (OMPs) are biotransformed during anaerobic digestion (AD). Yet, most of them aim at reporting removal efficiencies instead of understanding the biotransformation process. Indeed, how each of the main AD stages (i.e., hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis) contribute to OMP biotransformation remains unknown. This study focuses on investigating the role of methanogenesis, the most characteristic step of AD, to OMP removal. More specifically, the sorption and the biotransformation of 20 OMPs by methanogenic biomass were analyzed determining their concentrations in both liquid and solid phases. Sorption onto methanogenic biomass displayed a similar behavior as reported for digested sludge. Most of the OMPs were biotransformed to a medium extent (35-70%) and only sulfamethoxazole was completely removed. Comparing these results with those reported for the complete AD process, methanogenesis was proven to play a key role, accounting for more than 50% of the OMP biotransformation (except for roxithromycin) during AD. An increase in the organic loading rate from 1 to 2 g COD/L d, typical loads employed in sewage sludge anaerobic digesters, did not exert a clear cometabolic effect on the OMPs biotransformation. It is hypothesized that biotransformation occurs in both liquid and solid phases because no link between the partition coefficient (Kd) and the overall biotransformation efficiency was found. These findings allow a better understanding of the OMPs fate under anaerobic conditions, which is necessary to design efficient biological mitigation strategies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dynamic influent models, which have been proposed to test control strategies using virtual wastewater treatment plants, should be as realistic as possible. The number of inhabitants in the catchment at any given time and their ways of life are among the parameters affecting the quality of these models. Census data related to work and school commutes were used to evaluate the number of people present in a given urban area. Based on the example of a large urban catchment (Grand Nancy, France), the results show that a population increase of 30% could occur during working hours resulting from the imbalance between workers leaving and coming into the catchment. Combined with information related to the local way of life, variation in the population helps to explain changes in wastewater flow rate and pollution (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals), which present several maxima reflecting daily activities, such as bladder voiding, meals, the use of washrooms, etc. However, no well-defined variation patterns for pH and conductivity, which are linked to the concentrations of anions and cations in the wastewater, were observed. Slight reductions (up to 10% on Sundays) in the flow and pollution load were observed on weekends as the commuter flow decreased. Census data proved to be efficient in helping to understand the daily pattern of urban wastewater characteristics. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The role of microbial communities in the degradation of trace organic contaminants in the environment is little understood. In this study, the biotransformation potential of 27 pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds was examined in parallel with a characterization of the native microbial community in water samples fromfour sites variously impacted by urban run-off andwastewater discharge in LakeMead, Nevada and Arizona, USA. Samples included relatively pristine Colorado River water at the upper end of the lake, nearly pure tertiarytreated municipal wastewater entering via the Las Vegas Wash, and waters of mixed influence (Las Vegas Bay and Boulder Basin), which represented a gradient of treatedwastewater effluent impact. Microbial diversity analysis based on 16S rRNA gene censuses revealed the community at this site to be distinct from the less urbanimpacted locations, although all sites were similar in overall diversity and richness. Similarly, Biolog EcoPlate assays demonstrated that the microbial community at Las Vegas Wash was the most metabolically versatile and active. Organic contaminants added as a mixture to laboratory microcosms were more rapidly and completely degraded in the most wastewater-impacted sites (Las Vegas Wash and Las Vegas Bay), with the majority exhibiting shorter half-lives than at the other sites or in a bacteriostatic control. Although the reasons for enhanced degradation capacity in the wastewater-impacted sites remain to be established, these data are consistent with the acclimatization of native microorganisms (either through changes in community structure or metabolic regulation) to effluent-derived trace contaminants. This study suggests that in urban, wastewaterimpacted watersheds, prior exposure to organic contaminants fundamentally alters the structure and function of microbial communities, which in turn translates into greater potential for the natural attenuation of these compounds compared to more pristine sites.

AB We present a second-generation wastewater treatment inventory model, WWLCI 2.0, which on many fronts represents considerable advances compared to its previous version WWLCI 1.0. WWLCI 2.0 is a novel and complete wastewater inventory model integratingWWLCI 1.0, i.e. a complete life cycle inventory, including infrastructure requirement, energy consumption and auxiliary materials applied for the treatment of wastewater and disposal of sludge and SewageLCI, i.e. fatemodelling of chemicals released to the sewer. The model is expanded to account for different wastewater treatment levels, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary treatment, independent treatment by septic tanks and also direct discharge to natural waters. Sludge disposal by means of composting is added as a new option. The model also includes a database containing statistics on wastewater treatment levels and sludge disposal patterns in 56 countries. The application of the new model is demonstrated using five chemicals assumed discharged to wastewater systems in four different countries. WW LCI 2.0 model results shows that chemicals such as diethylenetriamine penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP) and Diclofenac, exhibit lower climate change (CC) and freshwater ecotoxicity (FET) burdens upon wastewater treatment compared to direct discharge in all country scenarios. Results for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen (more readily degradable) show that the CC burden depends on the country-specific levels of wastewater treatment. Higher treatment levels lead to lower CC and FET burden compared to direct discharge. WWLCI 2.0 makes it possible to generate complete detailed life cycle inventories and fate analyses for chemicals released to wastewater systems. Our test of the WWLCI 2.0 model with five chemicals illustrates how the model can provide substantially different outcomes, compared to conventional wastewater inventory models, making the inventory dependent upon the atomic composition of the molecules undergoing treatment as well as the country specific wastewater treatment levels.

AB A combination of thermophilic aerobic membrane reactor (TAMR) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) was studied by means of two pilot plants at semi-industrial scale in order to simulate the new configuration adopted in a full-scale facility for the treatment of high strength aqueous wastes. Aqueous wastes with high contents of organic pollutants were treated by means of the TAMR technology, progressively increasing the organic load (3-12 kg(COD)m(-3) d(-1)). A mixture of municipal wastewater and thermophilic permeate was fed to the CAS plant. The main results are the following: achievement of a high COD removal yield by both the TAMR (78%) and the CAS (85%) plants; ammonification of the organic nitrogen under thermophilic conditions and subsequent mesophilic nitrification; capacity of the downstream mesophilic process to complete the degradation of the organic matter partially obtained by the TAMR process and precipitation of phosphorus as vivianite and carbonatehy-droxylapatite in the TAMR plant.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are considered emerging environmental pollutants that have a potential harmful impact on environment and human health. In this study, the biomass of alga (Scenedesmus obliquus) was modified using alkaline solution, and used for the biosorption of tramadol (TRAM) and other pharmaceuticals. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated. The obtained results reveal high adsorption capacity of tramadol over modified algal biomass (MAB) after 45 min with removal percentage of 91%. Pseudo-second order model was well fitted with the experimental data with correlation coefficient (0.999). Biosorption of tramadol on modified algal biomass proceeds with Freundlich isotherm model with correlation coefficient (0.942) that emphasized uptake of TRAM by MAB is driven by chemisorption. FTIR spectra of MAB before and after the adsorption were analyzed; some IR bands were detected with slight shift and low intensity suggesting their involving in adsorption. The tramadol biosorption by MAB is a chemical process as confirmed by Dubinin-Radushkevich. The adsorption of pharmaceutical over MAB is mainly preceded by hydrophilic interactions between amino and carbonyl groups in pharmaceutical molecules and hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups on surface of biosorbent. It was emphasized by disappearance O-H and C-O from biomass IR spectra after adsorption. In matrix of pharmaceutical, the recorded adsorption capacities for CEFA, PARA, IBU, TRAM and CIP are 68, 58, 42, 42 and 39 mg/g over MAB at natural pH and MAB dose of 0.5 g/L. Furthermore, oxygen uptake by bacteria was applied for estimate the toxicity of pharmaceutical. The recorded result concluded the efficient reusability of modified algal biomass for biosorption of pharmaceuticals, as well only the adsorption efficiency decreased by 4.5% after three runs. Subsequently, the modified algal biomass is a promising reusable adsorbent for decontamination of wastewater from pharmaceuticals.

AB Olive oil is produced by a technological procedure based on physical operations, without use of chemicals. This industry is concerned to make the whole process environmentally friendly, which includes the treatment of the wastewater produced in the mills. In the present work, the isolation, purification and recovery of high-added value phenolic compounds from two-phase olive-oil washing wastewater (OOWW) and the simultaneous effluent treatment by a 'green process' based on resins adsorption/ion exchange (strong-base anionic Amberlyst A26 (R), weak-base anionic. Dowex 66 (R) and non-ionic macroreticular Amberlite XAD4 (R)) was studied. Results showed the resins performances were optimal at the raw effluent pH and ambient temperature conditions, thus no acidification or basification, nor cooling or heating, would be necessary: the effluent could be directly driven from the exit of the vertical centrifuges at the outlet temperature and raw pH to the proposed resins process, boosting the economic feasibility. The strong anionic resin ensured optimum results: upon 150 min maximum contact time and 60-80 g resin/L, a final treated effluent containing only 8.7 mg/L total phenolic compounds was obtained. The effluent could be partially discharged on suitable terrains or disposed to biological treatments, avoiding phytotoxicity or inhibition due to the phenolic content. The obtention of this concentrated pool of added-value antioxidant compounds for food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biotechnological industrial sectors could help counter-balance the economic feasibility of the reclamation process.

AB This study assesses the degradation by electrochemical oxidation via boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes of the selected pharmaceutical compounds iopromide (IOP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and diclofenac (DCF) in simulated wastewater and real hospital effluent wastewater. The influence of the flow rate in the electrochemical cell, applied current, initial compound concentration and wastewater matrix (simulated (SWW) versus real effluent (RWW) wastewater) was evaluated. A kinetic evaluation confirmed that the degradation can be described via pseudo first-order reaction kinetics for all experimental conditions tested. It was shown that SMX, EE2 and DCF degraded readily in SWW and RWW. The degradation of IOP was significantly slower, which is in agreement with previously reported slow degradation kinetics using typical advanced oxidation processes. Activation energies for the degradation reactions were calculated. The flow rate in the electrochemical cell had only a moderate effect on the degradation rate of EE2 and DCF. The applied current, however, had a major effect. The BDD electrochemical oxidation was shown to be an effective technique for removing pharmaceutical components from the effluent of a biological hospital wastewater treatment plant. However, the slower degradation of transformation products should be taken into account, when a full mineralization of the pharmaceuticals is pursued.

AB Membrane-based liquid filtration systems have been highlighted as a key green process engineering platform for process intensification. While these systems have been successfully commercialized in desalination and micro/ultra/nanofiltration, it is yet challenging to expand the limited operating conditions (ambient temperature in an aqueous environment) of the currently available membranes, and to solve the exacerbating environmental burden during the fabrication of polymeric membranes. Herein, a new green and compact fabrication method is proposed for both (i) fabricating a robust membrane that can function beyond the typical operating conditions of conventional membranes and (ii) minimizing waste creation and production time. In this work, contrary to the conventional phase inversion method, a spray-coating technique was employed to fabricate a thin composite membrane with high temperature stability and fast solvent permeability. The proposed compact fabrication method can reduce the carbon footprint and the usage of polymers and solvents more than twofold, and eliminate the time-consuming coagulation and washing steps, both of which generate an enormous amount of solvent-contaminated wastewater (up to 50 billion liters per year). Furthermore, the process used dimethyl sulfoxide to bypass conventional N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a green solvent, and can simultaneously fabricate a membrane ready to use within a half-day. The resulting membrane exhibited remarkable stability and performance for the separation of solutes in N,N-dimethylformamide, even at elevated temperatures not feasible with conventional polymeric membranes, and so it is a candidate for potential use in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment has been considered an emerging concern. Diclofenac has the highest acute toxicity among the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and it has been frequently detected in surface waters and wastewater treatment plants. Adsorption has been widely used to remove emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds from water sources and wastewaters. In this work, diclofenac adsorption was studied using activated carbon as adsorbent in batch process and fixed-bed column. Adsorption isotherms were determined through batch adsorption experiments, while fixed-bed adsorption was evaluated through a full factorial two-level experimental design involving three variables: initial pollutant concentration (20 - 100 mg L-1), weight of adsorbent (0.5 - 1.0 g) and volumetric feed flow rate (3 - 5 mL min(-1)). Adsorption equilibrium was investigated in different temperatures revealed that the Freundlich equation is suitable to describe the isotherms behavior in 298, 308 and 318 K. Thermodynamic analysis revealed negative Delta G(0) and both positive Delta H-0 and Delta S-0, which indicated that diclofenac adsorption onto activated carbon is higher at higher temperatures and it is a spontaneous process. Breakthrough time, the time when 5% of initial concentration is detected in the effluent, was at higher initial concentration and lower flow rate. Fractional bed utilization increased with the increase of the initial concentration and flow rate, but decreased with higher amount of activated carbon. Breakthrough curves experimental data were fitted using Thomas, Bohart-Adams and Yan analytical models. Yan model showed the highest average of the determination coefficients (R-2 = 0.9842) of all experiments while the amounts adsorbed by the packed column were better predicted by Thomas equation.

AB Emerging contaminants (EC's) are pollutants of growing concern. They are mainly organic compounds such as: pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, hormones, plasticizers, food additives, wood preservatives, laundry detergents, surfactants, disinfectants, flame retardants, and other organic compounds that were found recently in natural wastewater stream generated by human and industrial activities. A majority of ECs does not have standard regulations and could lead to lethal effects on human and aquatic life even at small concentrations. The conventional primary and secondary water treatment plants do not remove or degrade these toxic pollutants efficiently and hence need cost effective tertiary treatment method. Adsorption is a promising method worldwide for EC removal since it is low initial cost for implementation, highly-efficient and has simple operating design. Research has shown that the application of different adsorbents such as, activated carbons (ACs), modified biochars (BCs), nanoadsorbents (carbon nanotubes and graphene), composite adsorbents, and other are being used for EC's removal from water and wastewater. The current review intends to investigate adsorption process as an efficient method for the treatment of ECs. The mechanism of adsorption has also been discussed.

AB In this study, a lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (AnSBR) was used for the acidification of a pharmaceutical wastewater sourced from etodolac chemical synthesis tanks. The effects of the organic loading rate (OLR), and etodolac and sulfate concentrations on the acidification rate and microbial community in AnSBR were investigated at 35 degrees C with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 37 h, a pH of 5, and OLRs up to 5.2 kgCOD/m(3). day. The AnSBR accomplished a 60% acidification ratio and 50-60% etodolac removal at OLRs up to 2.6 kgCOD/m(3).day. However, at OLR = 3.9 kgCOD/m(3).clay, acidification was not achieved due to sulfite inhibition; pre-ozonation was applied to overcome this sulfite inhibition. Although etodolac and COD removals were improved, the wastewater was not successfully acidified. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that acidification was inhibited by the dominance of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) over acidification bacteria in the AnSBR. However, increasing the OLR to 5.2 kgCOD/m(3).day led to toxicity stress in the SRB due to increased sulfite concentrations. Sulfate load fundamentally affected acidification process and microbial community composition. The presence of etodolac with concentration up to 56 mg/L did not have a significant effect on VFA production and the microbial community. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds, present at high concentration in hospital wastewater (HWW), pose both environmental and human health challenges. Fungal reactors can effectively remove such contaminants and produce non-toxic effluents, but their ability to operate for a long period of time is yet to be demonstrated in real hospital wastewater. Several process variables need to be studied beforehand. Here, variables: pellet size, aeration and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio are studied in continuous operations with real HWW. Moreover, a novel strategy for inoculum production that could reduce economical and operational costs is proposed and tested. Optimum pellet size was found to be 2 mm and an aeration of 0.8 L min(-1) was needed to maintain fungal viability. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 7.5 was selected and the pellet production time was reduced from 6 to 3 days. The novel low-cost inoculum preparation produced pellets with the same characteristics as the traditionally prepared ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of drugs and pharmaceuticals in the environment is typically performed with non-chiral chromatographic techniques. The environmental risks posed by chiral compounds analysed in this way must therefore be assumed to be independent of chirality, meaning that each enantiomer is equally potent in toxicity and long-lived in stability. This manuscript examines the degradation of each of the four isomers of ephedrine in river simulating microcosms and links this to toxicity data obtained by exposing three different organisms (D. magna, P. subcapitata and T. thermophila) to each of the isomers individually. Microcosms showed that significant degradation only occurred in biotic conditions and that only two isomers (1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine, 1S,2S-(+)-pseudoephedrine) degraded significantly over a period of fourteen days. This is concerning because at least one of the non-degraded isomers (1S,2R-( +)-ephedrine) has been observed in wastewater effluent, which discharges directly into rivers, meaning these isomers could be persistent in the environment. We also observed formation of 1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine in single isomer 1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine river simulating microcosms. Human liver microsome assays and mass spectrometry based data mining revealed that 1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine is not human derived but it could be formed as a results of microbial metabolic processes. Across all three organisms tested the persistent isomers (1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine and 1R,2R-(-)-pseudoephedrine) were more toxic than those that undergo degradation; meaning that if these isomers are entering or formed in the environment they might represent a potentially hazardous contaminant.

AB As a result of the widespread use of antibiotics, a large amount of excretion from human and animals containing antibiotic residues was discharged into the environment with wastewaters and manures, leading to potential adverse effects on ecosystem health. To understand the environmental fate of antibiotics, a dynamic level IV fugacity model was established here by introducing the novel process of nondiffusive wastewater irrigation from water to soil, and applied to a large-scale water-scarce region, the megacity Beijing. Furthermore, a Monte-Carlo based risk assessment approach was employed to evaluate the potential risks posed by antibiotics in water, sediment and soil, combined with the soil-water equilibrium partitioning method. Model validation, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis suggests that the fugacity model can successfully simulate the reported concentration data within an average difference of 0.2 logarithmic units. Results showed that more than one hundred tonnes of antibiotics were estimated to be discharged into the environment of Beijing in 2013, and, resulted in high antibiotics levels and posed high potential risks on the aquatic environment. On the other hand, although wastewater irrigation increased the antibiotics concentrations in soil and even dominated the total transfer fluxes, the overall risk levels of antibiotics in the soil were acceptable.

AB The occurrence of PPCPs in macroalgae, barnacle and fish samples fromcontaminated coastalwaters of the Saudi Red Sea is reported. Solvent extraction followed by solid phase extraction was applied to isolate the compounds, and their quantification was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Atenolol, ranitidine, chlorpheniramine, DEET, and atrazinewere detected in one ormore macroalgae at bLOQ concentration, whereas caffeine, methylparaben, and carbamazepine were present atmaximum concentrations of 41.3, 44.3, and 1.7 ng/g (on a dryweight basis= dw), respectively. Eleven PPCPswere detected in the barnacle samples at concentrations between < LOQ and maximum concentration of 17.9 ng/g dw for amitriptyline. Furthermore, 17 compoundswere detected in several or all of the five fish species studied with amaximumconcentration of 82.1 ng/g dw for metronidazole in Silver Biddy. The bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for selected PPCPs were determined and compared. The occurrence and enrichment of PPCPs inmacroalgae and barnaclesmight indicate that a newroute for uptake of such chemicals bymarine biota is available, specifically in contaminatedwaters where a continuous supply of non-persistent contaminants such as PPCPs is available for long-termexposure of local benthic organisms.

AB The widespread detection of antibiotics in the environment is concerning because antibiotics are designed to be effective at small doses. The objective of this work was to quantify the accumulation rates of antibiotics used by humans and animals, spanning several major antibiotic classes (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides), in Minnesota lake-sediment cores. Our goal was to determine temporal trends, the major anthropogenic source to these lacustrine systems, and the importance of natural production. A historical record of usage trends for ten human and/or animal-use antibiotics (four sulfonamides, three fluoroquinolones, one macrolide, trimethoprim, and lincomycin) was faithfully captured in the sediment cores. Nine other antibiotics were not detected. Ofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfapyridine, and sulfamethazine were detected in all of the anthropogenically-impacted studied lakes. Maximum sediment fluxes reached 20.5 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (concentration 66.1 ng/g) for ofloxacin, 1.2 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (1.2 ng/g) for trimethoprim, 3.3 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (11.3 ng/g) for sulfapyridine, and 1.0 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (1.6 ng/g) for sulfamethazine, respectively. Natural production of lincomycin may have occurred in one lake at fluxes ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (0.1 to 5.8 ng/g). Wastewater effluent appears to be the primary source of antibiotics in the studied lakes, with lesser inputs from agricultural activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics and high salinity can damage traditional biological treatment and result in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. However, the fate of ARGs in BES and their correlations with microbial communities and horizontal genes transfer are unknown. In this study, we investigated the response of ARGs to bio-electrochemical treatment of chloramphenicol wastewater and their potential hosts under different salinities. Three ARGs encoding efflux pump (cmlA, floR and tetC), one class 1 integron integrase encoding gene (intl1), and sul1 gene (associate with intl1) were analyzed. Correlation analysis between microbial community and ARGs revealed that the abundances of potential hosts of ARGs were strongly affected by salinity, which further determined the alteration in ARGs abundances under different salinities. There were no significant correlations between ARGs and intl1, indicating that horizontal gene transfer was not related to the important changes in ARGs. Moreover, the chloramphenicol removal efficiency was enhanced under a moderate salinity, attributed to the altered microbial community driven by salinity. Therefore, microbial community shift is the major factor for the changes of ARGs and chloramphenicol removal efficiency in BES under different salinities. This study provides new insights on the mechanisms underlying the alteration of ARGs in BES treating high-salinity pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nano-sized CuInS2 was evenly anchored on the thin film of reduced graphene oxide (rGO/CuInS2) by a simple one-step solvothermal method. The photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 was much higher than that of pure CuInS2, and was highly dependant on rGO amount with results revealing an optimal rGO content of 1 wt%. The 1% rGO/CuInS2 composite demonstrated the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with almost 90% 2-nitrophenol removal, which was almost two times of pure CuInS2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 is ascribed to that the ultrathin film structure of rGO endows rGO/CuInS2 composites with a large density of exposed active sites to reactants, short transport distances of photogenerated charges and the efficient separation of charge carriers. Of special significance is that 1% rGO/CuInS2 composite can effectively treat real pharmaceutical wastewater with 86.5% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency in 11 h. Moreover, there was no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 composites after four photocatalytic cycles. The high COD removal efficiency of pharmaceutical wastewater and reusability indicate the great potential of rGO/CuInS2 in environmental purification of organic pollutants.

AB The widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is hindered by uncertainties in system reliability, resilience and management associated with coupled biological and physical processes. To better understand how shallow unit process open-water wetlands self-colonize and evolve, we analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation. Our analysis was conducted across three parallel demonstration-scale (7500 m(2)) cells located within the Prado Constructed Wetlands in Southern California. They received water from the Santa Ana River (5.9 +/- 0.2 mg/L NO3-N), a water body where the flow is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from May to November. Phylogenetic inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial community facilitated early colonization. After approximately nine months of operation, coinciding with late summer, an anaerobic community emerged with the capability for nitrate attenuation. Varying the hydraulic residence time (HRT) from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the cells. The community that established at this time was comparatively stable for the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously formed approximately 550 km (350 miles) away in a pilot-scale (400 m(2)) wetland in Northern California. That system received denitrified (20.7 +/- 0.7 mg/L NO3-N), secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation. Establishment of a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50% of the analyzed bacterial sequences shared between the two sites. Additionally the same species of diatom, Stauirsa construens var. venter, was prolific in both systems as the putative dominant primary producer. Our results indicate that despite differences in scale, geographic location and source waters, the shallow open water wetland design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and functionality associated with the self-colonizing benthic biomat This resulting biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as HRT further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession.

AB Fish can be exposed to a variety of neuroactive pharmaceuticals via the effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants and concerns have arisen regarding their potential impacts on fish behaviour and ecology. In this study, we investigated the uptake of 14 neuroactive pharmaceuticals from a treated wastewater effluent into blood plasma and brain regions of roach (Rutilus rutilus) after exposure for 15 days. We show that a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals including, 6 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, 3 atypical antipsychotics, 2 tricyclic antidepressants and a benzodiazepine, concentrate in different regions of the brain including the telencephalon, hypothalamus, optic tectum and hindbrain of effluent-exposed fish. Pharmaceuticals, with the exception of nordiazepam, were between 3-40 fold higher in brain compared with blood plasma, showing these neuroactive drugs are readily uptaken, into brain tissues in fish. To assess for the potential for any adverse ecotoxicological effects, the effect ratio was calculated from human therapeutic plasma concentrations (HtPCs) and the measured or predicted fish plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals. After accounting for a safety factor of 1000, the effect ratios indicated that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, and amitriptyline warrant prioritisation for risk assessment studies. Furthermore, although plasma concentrations of all the pharmaceuticals were between 33 and 5714-fold below HtPCs, alterations in serotonin, glutamate, acetylcholine and tryptophan concentrations were observed in different brain regions of effluent-exposed fish. This study highlights the importance of determining the potential health effects arising from the concentration of complex environmental mixtures in risk assessment studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The river Yamuna is a major tributary of river Ganges and is a major source of freshwater in the National Capital Territory (NCT) catering 16.8 million people. This is the first report on occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk assessment of various pharmaceuticals active compounds (PhACs) in the Yamuna river. In this study, spatial and temporal distribution of nine PhACs "aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, caffeine, ranitidine, diclofenac, carbamazepine, codeine, and diazepam", belonging to different therapeutic groups have been reported. Nine PhACs were analyzed in all the samples collected from the NCT stretch of river Yamuna. No specific trend in the distribution of the pharmaceutical residues was observed, however, the results revealed comparably higher PhACs contamination at YMN-2 (downstream Wazirabad, at this point, Najafgarh drain joins river Yamuna). Ecotoxicological risk assessment was carried out using Hazard quotients (HQ) for normal and worst case scenarios. The HQ showed that the levels of PhACs present in the samples were insufficient to cause acute toxicity to the flora and fauna of the river Yamuna. However, such residues could possibly cause chronic toxicity to the aquatic life and human beings as a huge amount of water of the river Yamuna is used for the drinking purposes in the NCT Delhi, the state capital of India.

AB To address the issue of global freshwater shortages, wastewater has become an increasingly valuable alternative for crop irrigation. As a result, trace levels of emerging contaminants, including antibiotics, may occur in water used for food production. The objective of this study was to investigate how soil texture affected the availability and uptake of three chemically diverse antibiotics (lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole) by lettuce grown in soils comprised of silt clay and increasing percentages of sand. Lettuce was irrigated routinely with antibiotic-amended water (1mg/L) from seed germination through the first harvest (40 days), switched to control water, and fate monitored at days 45 and 50. Sulfamethoxazole was the only compound where tissue concentrations increased with increasing sand concentrations to 24.7ng/g fresh weight (FW). Lincomycin was most readily accumulated with increasing concentrations observed at the second harvest in both the loam (68.3ng/g FW) and sandy soils (66.6ng/g FW). Apparent toxicity of the antibiotic mixture resulted in decreasing plant mass (37-72%) with increasing sand content. Results from this study show that soil texture impacts plant growth, contaminant transport, plant uptake, and toxic effects, which all contribute to, observed concentrations in edible plant portions.

AB Personal care products (PCPs) are used globally wherever there is human activity, and are typically emitted to the environment in wastewater under normal use. Regulators and scientists have thus begun focusing on PCPs as a potential water quality concern. PCP manufacturers are increasingly motivated to leverage available data on potential exposure and hazards to the natural environment to guide sustainable decision making and minimize the potential for products to cause adverse environmental effects. We describe a novel algorithm to: select data on environmental exposure and hazard potential relevant to PCP ingredients after use, evaluate and interpret those data, and translate the information to a single numeric score usable by non-specialists to incorporate environmental protection goals into PCP sustainability decision making. The algorithm has been implemented as the Global Aquatic Ingredient Assessment (GAIA) database tool, incorporating information on environmental persistence, bio-accumulation potential, aquatic toxicity of the parent compound and degradants, excess toxicity from ecological endocrine disruption effects, and the potential for producing photochemical smog. GAIA quantifies environmental hazard potential using an algorithm allowing it to be used as a risk surrogate for PCP product use. GAIA data are also used in environmental risk assessments with product-specific exposure data as a final check during product reformulation or as a post hoc measure of progress toward corporate sustainability goals. Scoring results are demonstrated for eight representative substances: benzophenone-4, ethylene diamine tetraacetate salts, ethylhexylglycerin, menthol, methyl salicylate, musk xylene, phenoxyethanol, and zinc oxide. Case studies show how GAIA scores, used as a front-line decision tool, led to environmental risk reductions in two cases: a newly developed surfactant and a reformulated cleansing product.

AB The major pathway of pharmaceuticals from urban applications to urban surface waters is via wastewater treatment plants. Ozonation is able to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents. However, during that reaction, ozonation products are formed. Some ozonation products were found to be persistent and have adverse effect on the environment. Moving bed bio reactors (MBBRs) were tested for the removal of the ozonation products of macrolide antibiotics and diclofenac at two different concentration levels 1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L in laboratory reactors. It was found that the MBBRs are capable of degrading these compounds without back-transformation into the parent compounds. However, reaction rate constants and the degradation kinetics varied for different compounds and different concentrations. Depending on compound and conditions, the degradation reaction kinetics was found to follow either i) zero order ii) first order or iii) lag phase succeeded by first order. The study has proven that MBBRs have the potential to be efficient in polishing post ozonation treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the occurrence of micropollutants (MPs) in sewage-, surface-, ground-and drinking water, and their removal processes are widely discussed. The content of various chemical organic/inorganic pollutants (pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, hormones, heavy metals etc.) has increased over the years. Most of these compounds are not eliminated or biotransformed in traditional wastewater treatment plants. Several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of resistant micropollutants from water sources have been studied. Ferrate (VI) has aroused interest as an alternative oxidizing agent in drinking water pre-oxidation treatment. Electrochemically prepared potassium ferrate was used to remove the studied organic micropollutants. The effect of ferrate on two widely occurring organic micropollutants in water sources, carbamazepine and caffeine, was investigated. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for sample analysis.

AB Complete removal of estrogens such as estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and ethinylestradiol (EE2) in wastewater treatment is essential since their release and accumulation in natural water bodies are giving rise to environment and health issues. To improve our understanding towards the estrogen bioremediation process, a mathematical model was proposed for describing estrogen removal by nitrifying activated sludge. Four pathways were involved in the developed model: i) biosorption by activated sludge flocs; ii) cometabolic biodegradation linked to ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) growth; iii) non growth biodegradation by AOB; and iv) biodegradation by heterotrophic bacteria (HB). The degradation kinetics was implemented into activated sludge model (ASM) framework with consideration of interactions between substrate update and microorganism growth as well as endogenous respiration. The model was calibrated and validated by fitting model predictions against two sets of batch experimental data under different conditions. The model could satisfactorily capture all the dynamics of nitrogen, organic matters (COD), and estrogens. Modeling results suggest that for El, E2 and EE2, AOB-linked biodegradation is dominant over biodegradation by HB at all investigated COD dosing levels. However, for E3, the increase of COD dosage triggers a shift of dominant pathway from AOB biodegradation to HB biodegradation. Adsorption becomes the main contributor to estrogen removal at high biomass concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A synergistic UV/TiO2/Fenton (PCF) process is investigated for the degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) at circumneutral pH. The IBP decay in the PCF process is much faster than that with the conventional UV, UV/H2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton, and photocatalysis processes. The kinetics analysis showed that the IBP decay follows a two-stage pseudo-first order profile, that is, a fast IBP decay (k(1)) followed by a slow decay (k(2)). The effects of various parameters, including initial pH level, dosage of Fenton's reagent and TiO2, wavelength of UV irradiation, and initial IBP concentration, are evaluated. The optimum pH level, [Fe2+](0), [Fe2+](0)/[H2O2](0) molar ratio, and [TiO2](0) are determined to be approximately 4.22, 0.20 mmol/L, 1/40, and 1.0 g/L, respectively. The IBP decay at circumneutral pH (i.e., 6.0-8.0 for wastewater) shows the same IBP decay efficiency as that at the optimum pH of 4.22 after 30 min, which suggests that the PCF process is applicable for the treatment of wastewater in the circumneutral pH range. The lnk(1) and lnk(2) are observed to be linearly correlated to 1/pH(0), [IBP](0), [H2O2](0), [H2O2](0)/[Fe2+](0) and ln[TiO2](0). Mathematical models are therefore derived to predict the IBP decay.

AB It is well known that pharmaceuticals are not completely removed by conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants. Hospital effluents are of major concern, as they present high concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds. Despite this, these specific effluents are usually co-treated with domestic wastewaters. Separate treatment has been recommended. However, there is a lack of information concerning the efficiency of separate hospital wastewater treatment by activated sludge, especially on the removal of pharmaceuticals. In this context, this article presents the results of a 2-year monitoring of conventional parameters, surfactants, gadolinium, and 13 pharmaceuticals on the specific study site SIPIBEL. This site allows the characterization of urban and hospital wastewaters and their separate treatment using the same process. Flow proportional sampling, solid-phase extraction, and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used in order to obtain accurate data and limits of quantification consistent with ultra-trace detection. Thanks to these consolidated data, an in-depth characterization of urban and hospital wastewaters was realized, as well as a comparison of treatment efficiency between both effluents. Higher concentrations of organic carbon, AOX, phosphates, gadolinium, paracetamol, ketoprofen, and antibiotics were observed in hospital wastewaters compared to urban wastewaters. Globally higher removals were observed in the hospital wastewater treatment plant, and some parameters were shown to be of high importance regarding removal efficiencies: hydraulic retention time, redox conditions, and ambient temperature. Eleven pharmaceuticals were still quantified at relevant concentrations in hospital and urban wastewaters after treatment (e.g., up to 1 mu g/L for sulfamethoxazole). However, as the urban flow was about 37 times higher than the hospital flow, the hospital contribution appeared relatively low compared to domestic discharges. Thanks to the SIPIBEL site, data obtained from this 2-year program are useful to evaluate the relevance of separate hospital wastewater treatment.

AB Due to its key role in the contamination of natural resources, the assessment of raw and treated wastewater effluents is a current major concern and urges comprehensive analytical methods capable of selectively capturing the chemodiversity of these samples. In this context, the overall objective of this work can be summarized as (i) the assessment of the performance of secondary and tertiary (advanced oxidation) wastewater treatments through multivariate analysis followed by (ii) the comprehensive characterization of wastewater samples based on their spectral fingerprints and a combination of suspect and non-target screening approaches. Several compounds, belonging to different sources of contamination were annotated and/or partially identified: pharmaceuticals, metabolites and transformation compounds, human activity markers, surfactants, and polyethoxy compounds. These results highlight the contribution of filtering and screening tools such as monoisotopic exact mass, mass defect, MS/MS data-dependent acquisitions, isotopic pattern and retention time to the selection, and the identification of environmental contaminants and their metabolites/degradation products. This paper completes the target study conducted in the SIPIBEL site and offers an alternative for the assessment of treatment processes by broadening the spectrum to a larger number of compounds and the correlations between them.

AB The secondary effluent from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant was treated by biological aerated filter (BAF) before and after ozonation, namely BAF1 and BAF2, respectively. The results showed that BAF2 fed with the ozonized secondary effluent exhibited a high efficiency in degrading organic pollutants. The removal efficiency of COD and NH4-N was 6.0 +/- 3.2 and 48.2 similar to 18.6% for BAF1 and 12.5 +/- 5.8 and 62.1 similar to 40.9% for BAF2, respectively, during the whole operation. The integration system of ozonation and BAF could tolerate a higher organic loading rate. When HRT decreased from 4 to 1 h, COD removal efficiency decreased from 12 to 4% for the BAF1 system, but it kept almost unchanged at high levels of 27-32% for the ozonation-BAF2 system, with around 20% removal by ozonation. The biomass in BAF2 exhibited a higher activity of protease, DHA, and SOUR than that in BAF1. The organic pollutants in influent and effluent of BAF were mainly ester compounds, which were difficult to biodegrade by BAF. The predominant genera in BAF1 were Gemmatimonadaceae uncultured, Thauera, and Thiobacillus, while the dominant genera in BAF2 were Nitrospira, Gemmatimonadaceae uncultured, and Flexibacter, respectively. Overall, BAF2 performed better than BAF1 in organic pollutant removal and microbial activity. The ozonation process was vital for BAF to treat petrochemical secondary effluent.

AB Fe2O3/graphite (Fe2O3/C) and nano-TiO2-coated glass bead were prepared by impregnation and sol-gel method respectively and employed as the catalyst of a novel three-dimensional electrode photoelectrocatalytic (3-D PEC) system. The photoexcited electrons can transfer from TiO2, Fe2O3 to counter electrode. It improves the migration of photoexcited charges, retards the fast recombination of electron-hole, and increases the lifetime of photogenerated holes (h(+)). In addition, the cycle reaction of Fe3+/Fe2+ on Fe2O3/C surface enhanced the Fenton reaction which can produce more hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and promote the capacity of mineralization of the pollutants. This novel 3-D PEC system showed excellent performance for the degradation of berberine chloride form (BCF). At the pH value of 3, 93% BCF was removed within 60 min; besides, 98.64% COD removal rate, 78.96% mineralization, 21.47% mineralization current efficiency, and just 3.16 kW h g(-1) TOC energy cost were obtained in 120 min. In this study, we proposed the 3-D PEC mechanism. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and scavenging experiments suggest that the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)), center dot OH, and h(+), while the role of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) is insignificant. This work provides a new dimension for the design of reactors for wastewater treatment and the construction of the 3-D PEC system can potentially be utilized in water purification.

AB A basic environmental risk assessment was carried out for the top 10 dispensed pharmaceuticals in Melbourne, Australia, in contrast to the more commonly assessed measure of the most used drugs by physical mass. This allowed for the evaluation of compounds that had not previously been the subject of risk assessment. Estimations of the possible fate and behaviour of the target pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants were also made. The predicted removal rates of most drugs within standard sewage treatment were expected to be low, with the exception of the statins, which had high removal rates. Each pharmaceutical was predicted to be present in Melbourne wastewater at the nanogram per litre range or lower. All compounds were predicted to be of low toxicity risk, although it was not possible to model mixture effects. Atorvastatin and Irbesartan were also found to possess the potential to possibly bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain but not to the extent that would require regulation or labelling.

AB The pollution characteristics and ecological risk of 12 classified as sulfonamide, trimethoprim, quinolone, and tetracycline antibiotics in Dongting Lake, China, were studied. The total concentrations of the antibiotics ranged from 1.06 to 135.40 ng L-1 for all sampling sites. The highest average concentration was observed for sulfadiazine, followed by sulfamethoxazole. The detection frequencies (over 60%) of sulfonamides were higher than those of other antibiotics. The direct discharge of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry wastewater might be the main pollution sources of antibiotics in the Dongting Lake. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution and the scale of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry sources. The seasonal changes of antibiotic concentration were relatively diversified, with the dry season generally having higher concentrations than the wet season. The results of the ecological risk assessment indicated that sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and sarafloxacin might pose a significant risk to the aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially in Potou and Nandu. This study enriches the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake.

AB Having in mind that there is a general lack of monitoring plans and precaution measures in the developing countries and that the Danube is the second longest river in Europe, the estimation of the relevant concentration levels of unregulated xenobiotics is a topic of interest both on local and international level. The selected pharmaceuticals, caffeine, and benzotriazole presented in the collected water samples from seven representative locations around the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, during 1-year period, were analyzed with the use of solid-phase extraction followed by the liquid chromatography coupled with triple quad tandem mass spectrometry. The most frequently detected compounds were caffeine and carbamazepine in the concentrations up to 621 and 22.2 ng/L, respectively, while the maximum concentration of the analyzed pharmaceuticals was obtained for ibuprofen (60.1 ng/L). The presence of benzotriazole along the analyzed section of the river was confirmed in the concentration levels up to 26.7 ng/L. Although sulfamethoxazole and desmethyldiazepam were detected at trace levels (0.22 and 3.41 ng/L, respectively); the presence of these pharmaceuticals in complex mixtures should not be neglected. Due to the frequent detection caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and benzotriazole could be proper candidate for hydrophilic anthropogenic markers for quantification of wastewater contamination in surface water in the analyzed Danube section.

AB The pharmaceutical products are emerging pollutants continuously released into the environment, because they cannot be effectively removed by the wastewater treatment plants. In recent years, questions have been raised concerning the environmental risks related to these pollutants. The goal of this research was to evaluate the responses in Lemna minor after 7 days and in Corbicula fluminea after differing durations (1, 3, 7, and 19 days) of exposure to the psychoactive drug mixture (valproic acid, citalopram, carbamazepine, cyamemazine, hydroxyzine, oxazepam, norfluoxetine, lorazepam, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in different concentrations (0, 0 + ethanol, drug concentration (DC) 1 = river water concentration, DC2 = effluent concentration, and DC3 = 10x effluent concentration). In this aim, growth parameters of L. minor, gluthathione S-transferase (GSTs), catalase (CAT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and/or gene expressions (pi-gst, cat, cytochrome P450 4 (cyp4), multidrug resistant 1 (mdr1), and superoxide dismutase (sod)) were measured. GST activities increased significantly in L. minor exposed to DC3, but no changes were found in CAT activity. In C. fluminea, EROD activity was induced significantly in both gill and digestive gland tissues after 3 days' exposure to DC3, while a GST increase was observed only in digestive gland tissues, suggesting that these pharmaceuticals induced an oxidative effect. Gene expression analysis revealed transient transcriptomic responses of cyp4, sod, and mdr1 under drug concentrations 2 or 3 and no change of expression for the other genes (cat and pi-gst) or condition (environmental drug concentration) tested. Finally, the data reported in this study represent important ecotoxicological information, confirming that this enzyme family (cyp4, sod, and mdr1) may be considered as a sensible and early indicator of exposure to drugs and emphasizing the involvement of selected genes in detoxification pathways.

AB A survey was conducted in regions of North China to better understand the effect of antibiotic residue pollution from swine feedlots to nearby groundwater environment. A total of nine experimental sites located in the regions of Beijing, Hebei, and Tianjin were selected to analyze the presence of residues of 11 most commonly used antibiotics, including tetracyclines (TCs), fluoroquinolones (FQNs), sulfonamides (SAs), macrolides, and fenicols, by using liquid chromatography spectrometry. The three most common antibiotics were TCs, FQNs, and SAs, with mean concentrations of 416.4, 228.8, and 442.4 mu g L-1 in wastewater samples; 19.9, 11.8, and 0.3 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples from swine feedlots; and 29.7, 14.0, and 0 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples from villages. Ordination analysis revealed that the composition and distribution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (AGRs) were similar in groundwater samples from swine feedlots and villages. FQNs and TCs occurred along the path from wastewater to groundwater at high concentrations and showed correlations with ARGs, with a strong correlation between FQN resistance gene (qnrA) copy number. FQN concentration was also found (P < 0.01) in wastewater and groundwater in villages (P < 0.01). Therefore, antibiotics discharged from swine feedlots through wastewater could disseminate into surrounding groundwater environments together with ARG occurrence (i.e., qnrA, sulI, sulII, tetG, tetM, and tetO). Overall, this study suggests that the spread of veterinary antibiotics from swine feedlots to groundwater environments should be highly attended and controlled by restricting excess antibiotic usage or improving the technology of manure management.

AB The Fenton process is used as a tertiary treatment to remove organic pollutants from the effluent of bio-treated pharmaceutical wastewater (EBPW). The optimal and most appropriate Fenton conditions were determined by an orthogonal array test and single-factor experiments. The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was influenced by the following factors in a descending order: H2O2/Fe(II) molar ratio > H2O2 dosage > reaction time. Under the most appropriate Fenton conditions (H2O2/Fe(II) molar ratio of 1:1, H2O2 dosage of 120 mg L-1 and reaction time of 10 min), the COD and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed with efficiencies of 62 and 53%, respectively, which met the national discharge standard (GB 21903-2008) for the Lake Tai Basin, China. However, the Fenton treatment was inadequate for removal of N compounds, and the removal of organic nitrogen led to an increment in N-NH3 from 3.28 to 19.71 mg L-1. Proteins and polysaccharides were completely removed, and humic acids (HAs) were partly removed with an efficiency of 55%. Three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix spectra (3DEEMs) indicated complete removal of fulvic acid-like substances and 90% reduction in the florescence intensity of humic acid-like substances. Organic pollutants with molecular weights (MW) > 10 kDa were completely removed, MW 5-10 kDa were degraded into smaller MW ones, and some low molecular weight acids (MW 0.1-1 kDa) were mineralized during the Fenton process. Some species, including pharmaceutical intermediates and solvents were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The operational costs of the Fenton's treatment were estimated to be 0.58 yuan RMB/m(3) EBPW based on reagent usage and iron sludge treatment and disposal.

AB Since the detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in various environmental media, research has explored the potential uptake and toxicity of these chemicals to species inhabiting these matrices. Specifically, pharmaceuticals, including the antiepileptic API carbamazepine (CBZ), are taken up from soil by a range of plants. Many short-term studies have also suggested that certain APIs induce toxicity in plants. However, the effects of APIs on fruiting plants remain relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the uptake, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of CBZ in Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) from seed to full maturity across a range of CBZ exposure concentrations in soil (0.1-20mg/kg). Results of biomass, chlorophyll, starch and total nitrogen (N) concentration in C. pepo indicated toxicity at soil concentrations of >= 10mg/kg. There were clear visual indications of increasing toxicity on leaves, including chlorosis and necrosis, from soil concentrations of 1 up to 20mg/kg. The present study also revealed novel insights into the effect of CBZ accumulation on C. pepo fruiting: female C. pepo flowers were unable to set fruit when leaf concentrations were >= 14mg/kg. These findings may have implications for future agricultural productivity in areas where reclaimed wastewater containing APIs is a source of irrigation. Detectable CBZ concentrations were found in edible C. pepo fruit, indicating the possibility of trophic transfer. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Progestins are utilized as a component of human contraceptives, and commonly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluent. Certain progestins activate fish androgen receptors and cause decreases in fecundity and masculinization of females. We used a nest acquisition assay and computer-assisted sperm analysis to examine the effects of levonorgestrel on male fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) reproductive fitness. Males were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d. Combinations of a control male and a male from one of the treatments were placed into a competitive nesting assay, and the time each male spent holding the nest and time spent exhibiting aggressive behaviors were analyzed at 48 h postexposure. Semen samples were analyzed for total motility, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, linearity, beat cross frequency, and wobble at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 s postactivation. Males exposed to either 10 or 100 ng/L of levonorgestrel exhibited increased nest acquisition success and lower levels of aggression compared with control-control pairings, as well as decreases in multiple sperm motion characteristics. Our results suggest that further research is required to ascertain the effects of levonorgestrel on male gamete quality and reproductive behaviors. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB De facto reuse is the percentage of drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intake potentially composed of effluent discharged from upstream wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Results from grab samples and a De Facto Reuse in our Nation's Consumable Supply (DRINCS) geospatial watershed model were used to quantify contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) concentrations at DWTP intakes to qualitatively compare exposure risks obtained by the two approaches. Between nine and 71 CECs were detected in grab samples. The number of upstream WWTP discharges ranged from 0 to >1,000; comparative de facto reuse results from DRINCS ranged from <0.1 to 13% during average flow and >80% during lower streamflows. Correlation between chemicals detected and DRINCS modeling results were observed, particularly DWTPs withdrawing from midsize water bodies. This comparison advances the utility of DRINCS to identify locations of DWTPs for future CEC sampling and treatment technology testing.

AB In this study, the heterogeneous Fenton oxidation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in an aqueous solution was examined over the nano-sized magnetite (Fe3O4) as a catalyst supplied through high-energy planetary ball milling process. To characterize the magnetite samples after and before ball milling operation, the Xray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were applied. The catalytic properties of the magnetite were considerably improved because of the enhancement in its physical properties, resulted from milling process. The findings also indicated that 6 h ball-milled magnetite demonstrated better properties for elimination of CIP of about 89% following 120 min reaction at optimal conditions of H2O2 12 mM, Fe3O4 1.75 g L-1, CIP 10 mg L-1 and pH 3.0. The effects of various operational parameters, including the initial pH of the solution, H2O2 initial concentration, catalyst dosage, milling time and OP initial concentration was investigated. Application of organic and inorganic scavengers considerably decreased the CIP removal efficiency. Correspondingly, with respect to the leached iron values at pH 3, it was concluded that CIP elimination was mainly occurred through heterogeneous Fenton procedure. This process included the adsorption and oxidation phases in which the hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) played a significant role. GC-MS analysis was used for recording of the generated intermediates of the CIP removal in the course of heterogeneous Fenton process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Submarine sewage outfalls (SSOs) are considered the main input source of contaminants of emerging concern continuously released in coastal areas, with the potential to cause adverse effects for aquatic organisms. This work presents the investigation of nine endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 26 pharmaceutically active chemicals (PhACs) in marine sediments within the vicinities of 7 SSOs along the Sao Paulo State Coast (Brazil). Method optimization for the multi-residue determination by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS using QuEChERS extraction/clean-up are discussed. Results demonstrate the occurrence of EDCs in concentrations ranging from less than method quantification limits (MQL) to 72.5 ng g(-1) in sediments. All PhACs were < MQLs. Nonylphenol was the most ubiquitous compound and the diversity of EDCs increased with an increase in populations serviced by SSOs. The predicted environmental risk assessment considering measured environmental concentrations and ecotoxicity endpoints from literature suggest a high-risk potential in some of the investigated SSOs.

AB The distribution, sources, and risk assessment of eight quinotone antibiotics (QNs) in the surface sediments from the wetland in Jiaozhou Bay were investigated. The results showed that QNs were detected in all samples, and the total concentrations of QNs in the sediments ranged from 0.276 to 5.229 ng/g. The highest concentration occurred at the entrance to the Yang River wetland. Principal component analysis suggested that the QNs mainly originated from sewage discharges from hospitals, human and aquaculture industries. Risk assessment, based on risk quotients, indicated the current ofloxacin level might be a medium risk level, while other QNs were all low risk. Nevertheless, there should still be concerns due to high consumption of QNs by human beings, animals, and aquatic organisms in the wetland. This investigation provides baseline data that the government can use as a reference guide to control QNs residues in Jiaozhou Bay wetland.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most detected pharmaceutical compounds around the world, with adverse human and animal health impacts in wastewater effluents. Recently, biocatalytic degradation using ligninolytic enzymes such as laccase along with redox mediators provides a promising approach for their removal from water and wastewater. However, the effects of operational parameters on biotransformation need to be investigated in order to design a robust and efficient process. In this research, central composite design was performed and analyzed using response surface methodology to study the effects of temperature, pH, enzyme concentration and mediator concentration. The adequacy of the developed model was confirmed by the coefficient of multiple regression (R-2 = 75.97%) indicating a reasonable model for practical implementation. The results showed that performing the biotransformation at 35 degrees C, pH 6, with 60 U/L of enzyme concentration and 18 mu M of mediator concentration resulted in 95% removal of CBZ. 10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxy-CBZ were identified as the major metabolites of CBZ oxidation by laccase. The estrogenicity tests indicated that the CBZ with an initial concentration of 4 mu M and its biotransformation products had no estrogenic effect. The successful transformation of CBZ demonstrated the potential of the laccase-mediator system for the removal of recalcitrant micro-contaminants.

AB The presence of most prescribed antibiotic compounds from four therapeutic classes (beta-lactam, cephalosporins, macrolides, fluoroquinolones) were studied at two full-scale WWTPs, two rivers, thirteen groundwater resources, and five water treatment plants in Tehran. Analytical methodology was based on high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. Samples were collected at 33 sample locations on three sampling periods over four months from June to August 2016. None of the target antibiotics were detected in groundwater resources and water treatment plants, while seven out of nine target antibiotics were analyzed in two studied river waters as well as the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants at concentrations ranging from <LOQ to 926.32 ng/L. Ciprofloxacin predominated in all analyzed influent (552.6-796.2 ng/L) and effluent (127-248.7 ng/L) samples of WWTP A, whereas cephalosporins including cephalexin (523.3-977.7 ng/L) and cefixime (278.65 to 422.1 ng/L) were the most abundant detected antibiotics in the influent and effluent of WWTP B. Aqueous phase removal efficiencies were assessed and ranged from 339.83% to 100% for the seven detected antibiotics. "Negative removals" were observed for erythromycin, azithromycin, and cefixime due to the deconjugation of conjugated metabolites via biological transformation in the studied WWTPs. From a statistical point of view, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the concentrations of cefixime, cephalexin, azithromycin, and erythromycin in the effluent of both studied WWTPs. Ciprofloxacin and cephalexin were the most abundant detected antibiotics in the two studied river waters. Statistical results revealed that there were significant differences in the concentrations of ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and erythromycin (p < 0.05) in Firozabad ditch (receiving WWTP effluent) and Kan River (non-receiving WWTP effluent) which demonstrated thatWWTPs discharges could be an important source of antibiotics being released in water bodies.

AB While ozonation is considered an efficient treatment to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from secondary wastewater effluents, the presence and persistence of transformation products (TPs) resulting from ozonation of TrOCs is a major concern that should be assessed prior to effluent discharge to the environment. Venlafaxine (VLX), an environmentally relevant tertiary amine-containing TrOC, was chosen as the model for this study. TP analysis confirmed that the lone electron pair of the non-protonated amine are the predominant site of oxidant attack, and therefore strongly affected by pH value and VLX speciation. N-oxide VLX (NOV), the primary ozone-induced TP, was formed and degraded simultaneously during ozonation of VLX-containing secondary effluent and reached a maximumyield of 0.44 to 0.85 (NOV-to-VLX0 ratio), depending on pH and hydroxyl (OH) radical presence. Rate constants for the reaction of NOV with ozone (3.1 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) and OH radicals (5.3 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) were determined. A simple kinetic model was developed to fit the kinetics of formation and degradation of NOV during ozonation in secondary effluents, based on a known ozone-reaction kinetic equation. The biodegradability of NOV (degradation rate of 39%) was significantly lower than that of the parent compound (VLX, 92%) after 71 days, as evaluated by modified Zahn-Wellens tests, suggesting that N-oxide products are not better removed than the parent compound in a simulated biological post-treatment, which may even result in partial reformation of the parent compound. Lessons learned from this study were supported by a pilot-scale demonstration at the Shafdan wastewater-treatment plant, confirming the presence of NOV after ozonation and its persistence in biological post-treatment. Removal of such persistent TP will require higher dosages or promotion of OH-radicals during ozonation. Nevertheless, further assessment of the toxicity of persistent TPs relative to the parent compound is needed for complete evaluation of concerned TPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new membrane fouling control technique using ozonated water flushing was evaluated for direct nanofiltration (NF) of secondary wastewater effluent using a ceramic NF membrane. Experiments were conducted at a permeate flux of 44 L/m(2)h to evaluate the ozonated water flushing technique for fouling mitigation. Surface flushing with clean water did not effectively remove foulants from the NF membrane. In contrast, surface flushing with ozonated water (4 mg/L dissolved ozone) could effectively remove most foulants to restore the membrane permeability. This surface flushing technique using ozonated water was able to limit the progression of fouling to 35% in transmembrane pressure increase over five filtration cycles. Results from this study also heighten the need for further development of ceramic NF membrane to ensure adequate removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) for water recycling applications. The ceramic NF membrane used in this study showed approximately 40% TOC rejection, and the rejection of PPCPs was generally low and highly variable. It is expected that the fouling mitigation technique developed here is even more important for ceramic NF membranes with smaller pore size and thus better PPCP rejection.

AB In recent years, accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment has been an issue of growing concern. Conventional wastewater treatment has limited effectiveness with many pharmaceuticals at concentrations of ppb or ppt scale. An intuitive solution would be to treat the pharmaceuticals-contaminated wastewaters at the source sites before dilution in sewer networks. Health institutions with concentrated drug consumption provide logical point sources for pharmaceuticals entering the sewage. This paper describes the pilot-scale removal of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from real wastewaters via gas-phase pulsed corona discharge oxidation. The process was studied for raw sewage from a public hospital and for biologically treated wastewater of a health-care institute. The non-selective oxidation of the observed pharmaceuticals (32 compounds) was effective at reasonable energy cost: 87-% reduction in residual pharmaceuticals (excluding biodegradable caffeine) from raw sewage was attained with 1 kWh m(-3) from the raw sewage and 100% removal was achieved for biologically treated wastewater at only 0.5 kWh m(-3). The impact for affected aquatic environments upon the present solution would be a dramatically reduced load of pharmaceutical accumulation.

AB This study focuses on developing a method for the effective removal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, fenoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and carbamazepine from wastewater using water-soluble proteins, which were extracted from Moringa stenopetala seeds. The functional groups and the surface charge of water-soluble protein powder were evaluated using FTIR and Zetasizer Nano ZS. Different parameters that affect the removal of selected pharmaceuticals such as initial concentration, the amount of the removing material and pH were optimized. The optimized method was applied to real wastewater samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant. A 100% removal was observed for all analytes under optimum conditions (4 mg dose of watersoluble protein powder, 1 ppm concentration of mixture a NSAIDs and at pH 3) for a synthetic standard solution prepared in ultra-high purity water. A slight decrease in the removal efficiency for the NSAIDs (82-86%) was observed when the water-soluble protein was applied to real wastewater samples. Despite the slight drop, such levels are still higher than those achieved with most advanced technologies and comparable with others. The attractiveness of this approach is its efficiency, environmental friendliness and that it is cost effective. The results thus demonstrate the capacity of water-soluble protein of Moringa stenopetala seed as an effective and efficient material for the removal of pharmaceutical drugs from environmental waters.

AB Reusing wastewater in agriculture has attracted increasing attention as a strategy to support the transition towards the circular economy in the water and agriculture sector. As a consequence, there is great interest in solutions for governing the transactions and interdependences between the associated value chains. This paper explores the institutions and governance structures for coordinating transactions and interdependences between actors in linked value chains of wastewater treatment and crop production. It aims to analyze how transactions and interdependences shape the governance structures for reusing wastewater at the local level. A transaction costs analysis based on data from semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire is applied to the agricultural wastewater reuse scheme of the Wastewater Association Braunschweig (Germany). The results show that different governance structures are needed to match with the different properties and requirements of the transactions and activities between linked value chains of wastewater treatment and crop production. Interdependences resulting from transactions between wastewater providers and farmers increase the need for hybrid and hierarchical elements in the governance structures for wastewater reuse. The authors conclude that aligning governance structures with transactions and interdependences is key to efficiently governing transactions and interdependences between linked value chains in a circular economy.

AB A pilot scale biological nutrient removal (BNR) process, batch experiments and modeling exercises were employed to investigate the removal and biotransformation of trimethoprim (TMP) in a BNR activated sludge process. The concentrations of the active microbial groups -ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHOs) and polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) - in the BNR bioreactor were quantified through modeling of the pilot bioreactor. The overall TMP removal efficiency for the pilot BNR process was 64 +/- 14% while the TMP biotransformation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones were 22 +/- 20%, 27 +/- 8% and 36 +/- 5% respectively. Batch tests with and without nitrification inhibition showed that AOB played a role in the biotransformation of TMP in BNR activated sludge. A pseudo first order model which incorporated the contributions of PAOs, OHOs and AOB to the overall biodegradation of TMP was found to describe the biodegradation of TMP in batch tests with and without nitrification inhibition. This model showed that PAOs, OHOs and AOB contributed towards the biotransformation of TMP in aerobic BNR activated sludge with the biotransformation rate constants following the trend of k(AOB) > k(OHOs) > k(PAOs).

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) receives increasing attention because of its specific composition and higher concentrations of some micropollutants. Better knowledge of HWW is needed in order to improve management strategies and to ensure the preservation of wastewater treatment efficiency and freshwater ecosystems. This context pushed forward the development of a pilot study site named Site Pilote de Bellecombe (SIPIBEL), which collects and treats HWW separately from urban wastewater, applying the same conventional treatment process. This particular configuration offers the opportunity for various scientific investigations. It enables to compare hospital and urban wastewater, the efficiency of the two parallel treatment lines, and the composition of the resulting hospital and urban treated effluents, as well as the evaluation of their effects on the environment. The study site takes into account environmental, economic, and social issues and promotes scientific and technical multidisciplinary actions.

AB Hospital and urban effluents are a source of diverse pollutants such as organic compounds, heavy metals, detergents, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, and microorganisms resistant to antibiotics. Usually, these two types of effluent are mixed in the sewage network, but a pilot site in France now allows studying them separately or mixed to understand more about their characteristics and the phenomena that occur following their mixing. In this study, their ecotoxicity (Daphnia magna mobility, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth, Brachionus calyciflorus reproduction, and SOS Chromotest) and antibiotic resistance (integron quantification) were assessed during mixing and treatment steps. The main results of this study are (i) the ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potentials of hospital wastewater are higher than in urban wastewater and (ii) mixing two different effluents does not lead to global synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potential. The global additivity effect observed in this case must be confirmed by other studies on hospital and urban effluents on other sites to improve knowledge relating to this source of pollution and its management.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are the main sources of a broad spectrum of pharmaceuticals found in freshwater ecosystems. These pollutants raise environmental health concerns because of their highly bioactive nature and their chronic releases. Despite this, pharmaceuticals' effects on aquatic environments are poorly defined. Biofilms represent a major part of the microbial life in rivers and streams. They can drive key metabolic cycles and their organizations reflect exposures to changing chemical, physical, and biological constraints. This study estimated the concentrations, over a 3-year period, of ten pharmaceuticals and five nutrients in a river contaminated by a conventional WWTP fed by urban and hospital wastewaters. Variations in these concentrations were related to biofilm bacterial community dynamics. Rock biofilms had developed over defined periods and were harvested at four locations in the river from the up- and downstream WWTP discharge point. Pharmaceuticals were found in all locations in concentrations ranging from not being detected to 192 ng L-1. Despite the high dilution factor of the WWTP effluents by the receiving river, pharmaceuticals were found more concentrated downstream than upstream the WWTP. Shifts in bacterial community structures linked to the environmental emission of pharmaceuticals were superior to seasonal community changes. A community structure from a site located downstream but close to the WWTP was more strongly associated with high pharmaceutical loads and different from those of biofilm samples from the WWTP upstream or far downstream sites. These latter sites were more strongly associated with high nutrient contents. Low environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals can thus be transferred from WWTP effluents to a connected stream and induce bacterial aquatic community changes over time.

AB Since extensive application, an increasing amount of antibiotics has been released into wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system was fed with synthetic wastewater containing erythromycin (ERY) and oxytetracycline (OTC) for 7 days to evaluate the variations of solution ortho-P (SOP), volatile fatty acid (VFA), poly-bhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), specific oxygen uptake rater (SOUR), and microbial community in the EBPR system. The obtained results showed that the P-removal efficiency decreased to 0.0%, and at the end of the experiment, only less than 20% of the VFA could be consumed. Besides, the variable processes of P and PHAs were destroyed. Moreover, to better grasp the inhibitory mechanism of antibiotics, microbial community compositions of activated sludge sampled in all reactors were investigated by high-throughput sequencing techniques. Results of comparative and evolutionary analysis revealed that high concentrations (5 and 10 mg/L) of ERY and OTC could seriously shift microbial communities, while combined antibiotics could induce more. Additionally, Accumulibacter and Competibacter were two primary microorganisms at the genus level in the EBPR system. Accumulibacter decreased seriously for exposure to antibiotics, while Competibacter increased in all experimental reactors especially in combined antibiotics reactor.

AB Incorporation of graphene/graphene oxide on a low-cost support has been established to improve adsorption performance. This study reports the synthesis of silica nanotubes (SNT) from elephant grass, its encapsulation by reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/graphene oxide (GO) and its application as a highly efficient adsorbent for the remediation of sulfamethoxazole from wastewater. The SNT was synthesized and encapsulated with GO and RGO, to obtain silica nanotubes graphene oxide (SNTGO) and silica nanotubes reduced graphene oxide (SNTG), respectively. The adsorbents were characterized with FTIR, CHN elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, XRD, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The FTIR, elemental analysis, and XRD results confirmed successful synthesis of the materials. SNTGO had an adsorption capacity of 125 mg/g, which increased to 248 mg/g when it was reduced to SNTG in the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole. The pseudo-second-order model best described the adsorption kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm was best fit for the equilibrium data. Thermodynamic studies showed the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. The desorption studies revealed that the adsorbent could be regenerated and reused in the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole. SNTG was a better adsorbent compared to SNTGO for wastewater remediation.

AB The use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation is foreseen as a possible strategy to mitigate the pressure on water resources in dry regions. However, there is the risk of potential accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the edaphic environment, their percolation and consequently contamination of aquifers. In the present study, we measured the levels of a wide range of commonly used pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in sewage from a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in soils irrigated with treated wastewater. Analysis of target compounds showed total concentrations between 73 and 372 mu g L-1 in WWTP influents, and from 3 to 41 mu g L-1 in effluents. The total concentrations of PhACs detected in surface soil samples were in the range of 2 and 15 ng g(-1), with predominance of analgesics and anti-inflammatories (maximum concentration = 10.05 ng g(-1)), followed by antibiotics and psychiatric drugs (maximum concentration = 5.45 ng g(-1) and 3.78 ng g(-1), respectively). Both effluent samples and irrigated soils shared similar compositional patterns, with compounds such as hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac being predominant. Additionally, PhAC5 were also detected in soil samples at a depth of 150 cm, indicating that these chemical undergo leaching associated with heavy rain episodes. Their occurrence in soils was affected by temperature too, as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months (up to 14 ng g(-1)), indicating higher persistence at lower temperatures. Finally, the ecotoxicological risk of PhAC5 in soil was evaluated by calculating their risk quotients (RQs). The risk was very low as RQ values ranged between <0.01 and 0.07. However, this initial assessment could be improved by future works on toxicity using specific terrestrial organisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The parameter AOX (adsorbable organic halogens) indicates the total amount of organic halogens in an environment. Seawater and surface sediment samples from 12 sample sites in the Hangzhou Bay (HZB), China, were analyzed for AOX to investigate its contamination status. In this study, the AOX concentration ranged from 140.6 +/- 45.6 mu g/L to 716.1 +/- 623 mu g/L in seawater of the HZB, and from 11.3 +/- 2.4 mg/kg to 112.7 +/- 7.2 mg/kg in the sediment. Ocean currents, fluvial currents and the Yangtze River exerted profound influences on the distribution of AOX in the HZB. The point sources around the HZB, represented by wastewater treatment plants, discharged at least 645.4 t AOX into the HZB every year, most of which was generated by industrial activities rather than the human daily activities.

AB A study was conducted in which the effluent at four small to medium sized sewage treatment plants (STP) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was monitored for three pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol) over a period of four years. Grab sampling and auto sampling campaigns were accomplished with respect to various weather conditions in the catchment area. Flow volumes and hydraulic retention times (HRT) from various sampling dates which provide information on processes causing emission changes were additionally taken into account. Monitoring results showed that concentration scattering in the effluent is related to HRT in the sewage treatment plants. Dilution effects following rain events in the catchment area were analysed for the three investigated substances. Short-term emission changes explained by dilution only could be well determined by the mathematical relation between discharge and concentration, and for carbamazepine to be solely determined by the dilution effects at all HRTs. For metoprolol, a clear decrease in concentrations was observed at HRTs above 80 h, and a significant contribution of biodegradation was supported by independent biodegradation tests. For three out of the four STPs, a decrease in concentrations of diclofenac was observed at hydraulic retention times above 80 h, indicating removal, whereas the relationship between concentration and HRT of the other STP could be explained by dilution only. The study shows that emissions can vary with weather conditions, hampering the assessment of emissions and estimation of concentrations in surface waters from generic removal rates only. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of HRT of rather stable substances in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A mobile pilot plant was set up in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in southwest Spain to address potential adverse effects of effluents as a whole contaminant, which are discharging into marine environments. Ruditapes philippinarum specimens were exposed to different effluent concentrations (50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.15%) during seven days. After effluent exposure, lysosomal membrane stability alterations (LMS), changes in the energy status storage (total lipids content (TLP) and in the mitochondria) electron transport (MET), inhibition of inflammatory mechanisms (cyclooxygenase activity (COX)), and neurotoxic effects (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were determined in exposed organisms. Furthermore, potential toxic reduction in the effluent was analysed by the application of an additional microalgae tertiary treatment called photobiotreatment (PhtBio). Results after PhtBio confirmed the toxic effect reduction in exposed organisms. Neuroendocrine effects, alterations in energy budget and in lipid storage revealed alterations in clam's health status causing stress conditions after effluent exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, the agricultural reuse of pharmaceutical sludge is still limited due to environmental and agronomic issues (e.g. low stabilization of the organic matter, phytotoxicity). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics of a pharmaceutical sludge derived from the daptomycin production and to study the possibility of improving its quality through composting. The pharmaceutical sludge showed high content of macronutrients (e.g. total KjeldahlN content was 38 g kg(-1)), but it was also characterized by high salinity (7.9 dS m(-1)), phytotoxicity (germination index was 36.7%) and a low organic matter stabilization. Two different mixtures were prepared (mixture A: 70% sludge + 30% wood chips w/w, mixture B: 45% sludge + 45% wood chips + 10% cereal straw w/w) and treated through static composting using two different aeration systems: active and passive aeration. The mixtures resulted in the production of two different compost, and the evolution of process management parameters was different. The low total solids and organic matter content of mixture A led to the failure of the process. The addition of cereal straw in mixture B resulted in increased porosity and C/N ratio and, consequently, in an optimal development of the composting process (e.g. the final organic matter loss was 54.1% and 63.1% for the passively and actively aerated treatment, respectively). Both passively and actively aerated composting of mixture B improved the quality of the pharmaceutical sludge, by increasing its organic matter stabilization and removing phytotoxicity.

AB In this study, the impact of dead cells on biofouling and consequent biofouling effects on three pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) retention by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane were systematically studied through inoculating live and dead Pseudomonas aeruginosa into artificial wastewater, respectively. The biofilm was characterized by quantifying the surface properties, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and total organic carbon (TOC) amount, biomass activity, total live/dead cells and biofilm thickness. The solution-diffusion model was applied to identify the role of biofilm on the solute retention. The results showed that dead cells in feed water had the same potential to cause biofouling as live cells. After excluding the flux effect, we observed an increase in PhAC rejection during biofouling with live cells due to the dominant steric exclusion. However, PhAC rejection decreased significantly during biofouling with dead cells. It was explained that dead cells could enhance cell activity in feed water and increase total biomass, cell counts and biofilm thickness on membrane surfaces, which improved the biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure (BEOP). Our study will give implication in further research on the dead cells in feed water and the removal of PhACs by NF/RO membrane under the biofouling condition.

AB The hypoglycemic pharmaceutical glibenclamide (GLB) is widely used around the world. This medication is released into the environment by municipal, hospital and industrial wastewater discharges. Although there are reports of its environmental occurrence in the scientific literature, toxicity studies on aquatic species of commercial interest such as the common carp Cyprinus carpio are scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced on C carpio by environmentally relevant concentrations of GLB. Biomarkers of oxidative damage such as hydroperoxide content, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content were evaluated as well as the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. The concentration of GLB was determined in water as well as in gill, liver, muscle, brain and blood of carp at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The findings obtained in the study prove that GLB induces increases in biomarkers of oxidative damage and antioxidant enzyme activity in the teleost C. carpio, that this response is not concentration dependent and that the organs evaluated bioconcentrate this hypoglycemic agent. These findings permit us to conclude that the presence of GLB in water bodies represents a risk for aquatic species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intentional and unintentional contamination incidents, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and accidental spills, can result in large volumes of contaminated water. These waters may require pretreatment before disposal and assurances that treated waters will not adversely impact biological processes at wastewater treatment facilities, or receiving waters. Based on recommendations of an industrial workgroup, this study addresses such concerns by studying electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) pre-treatment for contaminated waters, using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode, prior to discharge to wastewater treatment facilities. Reaction conditions were investigated, and microbial toxicity was assessed using the Microtox (R) toxicity assay and the Nitrification Inhibition test. A range of contaminants were studied including herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and flame retardants. Resulting toxicities varied with supporting electrolyte from 5% to 92%, often increasing, indicating that microbial toxicity, in addition to parent compound degradation, should be monitored during treatment. These toxicity results are particularly novel because they systematically compare the microbial toxicity effects of a variety of supporting electrolytes, indicating some electrolytes may not be appropriate in certain applications. Further, these results are the first known report of the use of the Nitrification Inhibition test for this application. Overall, these results systematically demonstrate that anodic oxidation using the BDD anode is useful for addressing water contaminated with refractory organic contaminants, while minimizing impacts to wastewater plants or receiving waters accepting EAOP-treated effluent. The results of this study indicate nitrate can be a suitable electrolyte for incident response and, more importantly, serve as a baseline for site specific EAOP usage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study a novel iron-based reducing agent of highly effective reduction toward nitrobenzene (NB) was obtained by pretreating zero valent iron (ZVI) with H2O2/HCl. During the H2O2/HCl pretreatment, ZVI undergoes an intensive corrosion process with formation of various reducing corrosion products (e.g., Fe2+, ferrous oxides/hydroxides, Fe3O4), yielding a synergetic system (prtZVl) including liquid, suspensions and solid phase. The pretreatment process remarkably enhances the reductive performance of ZVI, where a rapid reduction of NB (200 mgL(-1)) in the prtZVl suspension was accomplished in a broad pH range (3-9) and at low dosage. Nitrosobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine are identified as the intermediates for NB reduction with the end-product of aniline. Compared with the virgin ZVI as well as another nanosized ZVI, the prtZVl system exhibits much higher electron efficiency for NB reduction as well as higher utilization ratio of Fe-0 A rapid reduction of various nitroaromatics in an actual pharmaceutical wastewater further demonstrated the feasibility of the prtZVl system in real wastewater treatment.

AB We have reported on the potential use of membrane distillation (MD) to remove emerging pollutants from wastewater as an alternative to other biological and chemical treatments. For every successful application of MD, the fouling and scaling associated with membrane wetting must be reduced to minimize the deterioration in performance. Here, we have hypothesized that the effectiveness of the antibiotic removal from wastewater can be significantly influenced by the interfacial interaction between the antibiotics and the membrane surface. To verify this, we investigated the applicability of the direct contact MD (DCMD) to treat the antibiotics, including positively-charged tobramycin (TOB), negatively-charged cefotaxime (CTX), and neutral ciprofloxacin (CFX). DCMD tests were performed with negatively-charged commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, with the observance of a significant decline in flux and wetting issues during the MD treatment of TOB. The PVDF membrane exhibited a stable flux (CTX: 19.76 LMH and CFX: 19.81 LMH), with almost 100% rejection of the CTX and CFX due to electrostatic repulsion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) further elucidates the insitu fouling development for TOB, CTX and CFX.

AB In this study, a microbial electrochemical system (MES) was designed to evaluate the effects of a low frequency low voltage alternating electrical current on denitrification efficacy in the presence of ibuprofen as a low biodegradable organic carbon source. Cylindrical carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh electrodes containing a consortium of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were mounted in the wall of the designed laboratory scale bioreactor. The effects of inlet nitrate concentration (50-800 mg L-1), retention time (2.5-24 h), waveform magnitude (0.1-9.6 Vp-p), adjustable direct current voltage added to offset voltage (0.1-4.9 V), alternating current frequency (10-60 Hz), and waveforms (sinusoidal, square, and ramp) were studied in this work. The results showed that the proposed system removes 800 mg L-1 nitrate up to 95% during 6.5 h. Optimum conditions were obtained in the 8 Vp-p using a frequency of 10 Hz of a sinusoidal waveform. The morphology studies confirmed bacterial morphology change when applying the alternating current. Dehydrogenase activity of biofilms formed on surface of stainless steel electrodes increased to 15.24 mu gTF mg(biomass) cm(-2) d. The maximum bacterial activity was obtained at a voltage of 8 Vp-p. The experimental results revealed that the MES using a low frequency-low voltage alternating electrical current is a promising technique for nitrate removal from pharmaceutical wastewaters in the presence of low biodegradability of carbon sources such as ibuprofen.

AB New robust correlation models for ozonation, based on UVA(254) and fluorescence surrogate parameters and developed considering kinetic information, have been applied at pilot-scale. This model framework is validated with the aim for operators to control the ozone dose for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in effluents from full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants. The inflected correlation model between ATrOCs and the surrogates predicts the removal of TrOCs (based on statistical evidence) solely using the 2nd order reaction rate constant with ozone (k(o3)) and in a more adequate manner than similar single correlation models. This allows the use of this new model for current and future TrOCs under investigation which is highly interesting when imposed discharge limits might include more and other TrOCs in future. The use of UVA254 might be preferable at the current timing for online monitoring of TrOC abatement as the model showed a good predictive power (based on statistical evidence and visual confirmation). Reliable online sensors are more widespread (and commercially) available compared to fluorescence sensors which are still under development, with the exception of a few examples. Nevertheless, the data processing of the fluorescence signals, isolating the different intensities associated with moieties reacting similarly to ozone might even increase the predictive power, given the lower degree of interference (i.e. less scattering).
