AB An innovative photoreactor, FluHelik, was used to promote the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) by a photochemical UVC/H2O2 process. First, the system was optimized for the oxidation of a model antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC), using both ultrapure water (UPW) and a real urban wastewater (UWW) (collected after secondary treatment) as solution matrices. Following, the process was evaluated for the treatment of a UWW spiked with a mixture of OTC and 10 different pharmaceuticals established by the Swiss legislation at residual concentrations (Sigma CECs <660 mu g L-1). The performance of the FluHelik reactor was analyzed both at lab and pre-pilot scale in multiple and single pass flow modes.
   The efficiency of the FluHelik photoreactor, at lab-scale, was evaluated at different operational conditions (H2O2 concentration, UVC lamp power (4, 6 and 11 W) and flow rate) and further compared with a conventional Jets photoreactor. Both photoreactors exhibited similar OTC removal efficiencies at the best conditions; however, the FluHelik reactor showed to be more efficient (1.3 times) in terms of mineralization when compared with the Jets reactor. Additionally, the efficiency of the UVC/H2O2 photochemical system using the FluHelik photoreactor in reducing the toxicity of the real effluent containing 11 pharmaceuticals was evaluated through zebrafish (Banjo rerio) embryo toxicity bioassays. FluHelik scale-up from laboratory to pre-pilot to promote UVC/ H2O2 photochemical process proved to be feasible. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigates the removal and fate of 23 emerging organic micropollutants (EOMs) including a wide range of pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, beta-blockers, analgesics, diuretics, psychostimulants, antiepileptics, immunosuppressives, anticoagulants), and steroid hormones detected in municipal wastewater by a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant at two different solid retention times (SRTs) of 60 and 21 days. Different removal efficiencies of the selected EOMs were observed and explained based on their physicochemical properties (such as distribution coefficient, log D; dissociation constant, pK(a); solid-water distribution coefficients, and K-d) along with process operating parameters. The dominant removal mechanisms of EOMs were biotransformation and sorption onto the sludge, which were confirmed by the mass balance study. Moreover, changes in the sludge properties, as a consequence of different SRTs, were evaluated based on variations in soluble microbial products (SMP), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and capillary suction time (CST). Finally, the quality of the MBR effluent was compared with some established guidelines, which confirmed the fulfilment of water quality requirements for reuse purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Global society is confronted with various challenges: climate change should be mitigated, and society should adapt to the impacts of climate change, resources will become scarcer and hence resources should be used more efficiently and recovered after use, the growing world population and its growing wealth create unprecedented emissions of pollutants, threatening public health, wildlife and biodiversity. This paper provides an overview of the challenges and risks for sewage systems, next to some opportunities and chances that these developments pose. Some of the challenges are emerging from climate change and resource scarcity, others come from the challenges emerging from stricter regulation of emissions. It also presents risks and threats from within the system, next to external influences which may affect the surroundings of the sewage systems. It finally reflects on barriers to respond to these challenges.

AB In testing a series of bismuth oxybromo-iodide (BiOBrxI1-x; 0 <= x <= 1) solid solutions, BiOBr0.9I0.1, due to its superior charge-carriers separation, exhibited the best performance in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Subsequently, its superparamagnetic version, BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO2, possessing a mesoporous hierarchical morphology, was solvothermally developed, and completely degraded the two model PPCPs, ibuprofen and benzophenone-3, in 1 and 2 h, respectively. Scavenger studies revealed that the ibuprofen degradation was dominated by e(-), O-center dot(2)-, and h(+), while the benzophenone-3 degradation was dominated by e(-) and O-center dot(2)-. Hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and demethylation were found to be the major reactions involved in the degradation pathways. The aquatic toxicity of the intermediates - estimated using the ECOSAR software - was found to be lower than for the parent PPCP molecules, indicating a reduced environmental risk after photocatalytic degradation. The solution matrix study elaborated the varying extent of the interacting roles of the co-present anions, cations, and NOM. The reusability and stability of BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO(2)was examined in real secondary treated sewage in a prototype photocatalytic reactor equipped with a magnetic separator. Due to the interferences and unwanted interactions caused by the co-present constituents in secondary treated sewage, a gradual loss in the photocatalytic performance of BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO2 was observed during consecutive rounds of recycling.

AB Herein we investigated the multi-phase distribution and estrogenic effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloids, and soluble phases from the Shaying River to assess the composition of estrogenic compounds and associated estrogenic risk. The yeast two hybrid (YES) method, cross flow ultrafiltration (CFUF), and LC-MS/MS were employed. Risk quotient (RQ) values ranged from 0.72 to 3.88, revealing that the Shaying River posed high estrogenic risk to aquatic organisms. The contribution ratios of the target EDCs to the EEQ(YES) ranged from 62.7% to 92.5%, indicating that these chemicals were major contributors of estrogenic effects in the Shaying River. Further, 54.0-77.8% of the detected EDCs were distributed in the soluble phase, 15.1-31.7% were bound to colloidal substances, and 3.90-19.4% EDCs were associated with SPM. Significant correlation between total EDC abundance and COD contents was detected, and the concentrations of endogenous estrogens (E1, E2, and E3) were positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In addition, the in-situ SPM-soluble (Kpoc) and colloid-soluble partition (Kcoc) coefficients were calculated. The log Kpoc values of target compounds varied from 4.10 to 5.19, while log Kcoc values ranged from 4.25 to 5.56. Their Kcoc values were larger than the Kpoc values, indicating that organic colloids were the most important carriers of EDCs in the aquatic environment.

AB Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), recognized as effective methods for tertiary water treatment in view of trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal, were investigated in this study. By assessing and comparing different ozone-based AOPs for TrOC degradation in secondary wastewater effluent, criteria for appropriate AOP application and oxidant dose are provided. In this study, the value of the minimum ozone demand for formatted hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) to react with target contaminants was proposed and determined. The ozone exposure and (OH)-O-center dot exposure were systemically investigated and compared in four types of different ozone-based AOPs (i.e., O-3 only, O-3/H2O2, O-3/UV, and O-3/H2O2/UV). The significant increase in (OH)-O-center dot exposure was achieved by means of adding H2O2 and/or UV, which results in the increase of the eliminant efficiency of TrOCs. In particular, ozone-resistance compounds (e.g., atrazine and alachlor) were removed more efficient by combination O-3 with H2O2 and UV than O-3 only, O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV at the equal ozone dose. Such as, the removal of atrazine and alachlor tripled after 2 min of treatment in the effluent by combining O-3 with H2O2 and UV. Among the four ozone-based AOPs, the highest ozone exposure (3.27 mg min/L) was achieved by applying an O-3:DOC of 0.9 O-3 only. High ozone exposure is beneficial to enhance the abatement efficiency of high ozone-selective compounds (e.g., pentachlorophenol).

AB The main objective of the present study is to prioritize those pharmaceuticals that have higher chances to be detected in water due to incomplete removal in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). To do so, the total consumption of pharmaceuticals in Catalonia (NE Spain) were compiled to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in wastewater effluents and in river water. PECs were estimated using publicly available consumption data in the period of 2013-2016 for a suite of 165 compounds. The selected compounds were based on generic pharmaceuticals with emphasis on drugs consumed by people aged 65 or over as they represent the age group with the highest consumption of pharmaceuticals.The mean total consumption of pharmaceuticals in the period studied was of 623 +/- 3 t per year. Paracetamol, metformin and ibuprofen were the most administered drugs although the highest PEC values corresponded to metformin, amoxicillin and metamizole. Finally, predicted environmental levels together with acute and chronic toxicological data allowed estimating the risks of these compounds. Amoxicillin is expected to pose adverse effects for cyanobacteria, whereas metformin and ibuprofen pose a small potential for adverse effects to invertebrates and fish, respectively.

AB Large quantities of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are susceptible of entering the terrestrial environments through the application of recycled wastewater, manures, and biosolids, resulting in their progressive contamination and possible long-term effects over terrestrial species. Many studies on the environmental fate of CECs focus on aquatic environments and/or wastewater treatment plants, but little is still known about their behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations in agricultural soils. In this study, we evaluated the adsorption and degradation of nine different pharmaceuticals (nadolol, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethopyridazone, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, diclofenac, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil) and four artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose) in two soils under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The sorption of target compounds in soils fitted well to a Freundlich isotherm model and was relatively low (K-f < 200 L kg(-1)) Sorption was highest for cyclamate (K-f = 162 L kg(-1)) and acesulfame (K-f = 156 L kg(-1)), while lowest sorption coefficients were measured for ibuprofen (K-f = 1-7 L kg(-1)) All target compounds (except for carbamazepine) were susceptible to microbial degradation under aerobic conditions, with half-lives ranging from 1 to 18 days. Degradation occurred at a higher rate under aerobic conditions for most contaminants, but they were relatively persistent under anaerobic conditions. For instance, over 90% of the initial amount of spiked nadolol was degraded in aerobic soils after 4 days of incubation, while only 18-24% was lost in absence of oxygen after 1 month, resulting in t(1/2) values between 95 and 103 days. The degradation behavior of the target compounds varied in relation to soil and compound physicochemical properties as well as the microbial activities (e.g., 220 ppm of CH4 were produced in anaerobic experiments) and aeration of the tested soils. Overall, the poor adsorption and relative persistence of sucralose and carbamazepine suggests that both may be used as potential tracers for soil and groundwater contamination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals in streams is increasingly being reported, yet the impacts of these contaminants of emerging concern on aquatic ecosystems are relatively unknown. Bacteria and fungi are vital components of stream environments and, therefore, exposure to antimicrobials may have important consequences for ecosystem services, such as carbon cycling. The objective of this study was to investigate how two antimicrobials, ciprofloxacin and climbazole, impact detrital biofilm metabolism in urban and rural streams. To establish baseline conditions, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of red maple (Acer rubrum) biofilms was measured in one urban and one rural stream. In mesocosm studies, the BOD of biofilms on singleand mixed-species leaf litter from the same sites was measured after exposure to 10 mu g/L of the antimicrobials, both in combination and individually. The presence of ciprofloxacin and climbazole did not affect BOD compared to the controls at the urban site, although significant differences were identified for select treatments at the rural site. In addition, the BOD of mixed-leaf biofilms was not significantly different from that of single species litter after exposure. Overall, exposure to 10 mu g/L of the antimicrobials did not significantly impact community-level carbon processing by the leaf biofilms, and leaf mixtures did not result in increased biofilm BOD compared to single species leaves. The outcomes of this work demonstrate a need for further research for the understanding the effects of antimicrobials on rural streams to prevent unintended consequences to ecological processes and biota from future development, leaking septic systems, and wastewater spills.

AB The unrestricted discharge of domestic and industrial wastewaters along with agricultural runoff water into the environment as mixed-wastewater pose serious threat to freshwater resources in many countries. Mixed-wastewater pollution is a common phenomenon in the developing countries as the technologies to treat the individual waste streams at source are lacking due to high operational and maintenance costs. Therefore, the need to explore the potential of the suspended growth process which is a well-established process technology for biological wastewater treatment is the focus of this paper. Different wastewater constituents: representing domestic, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum, and agricultural runoff were synthesized as a representative of mixed-wastewater and treated in two semi-continuous bioreactors (R1 & R2) operated at constant operating conditions, namely MLSS (mg/L): 4640-R1, 4440-R2, SRT: 21-d, HRT: 48-72 h, and uncontrolled pH. The system attained stable condition in day 97, with average COD, BOD and TSS reduction as 84.5%, 86.2%, and 72.2% for R1; and 85.1%, 87.9%, and 75.1% for R2, respectively. Phosphate removal on average was by 74.3% in R1 and 76.6% in R2, while average nitrification achieved in systems 1 and 2 were 56.8% and 54.7%, respectively. The biological treatment system has shown potential for improving the quality of mixed-wastewater to the state where reuse may be considered and tertiary treatment can be employed to polish the effluent quality.

AB In this study, photochemical degradation of two emerging pharmaceutical chemicals, mefenamic acid (MF) and triclosan (TCS), was investigated to clarify the role of treated wastewater effluent matrices on their environmental photolysis. Target compounds were individually exposed to simulated sunlight in different media: ultrapure buffered water and synthetic field water with treated municipal wastewater effluent. The results in ultrapure buffered water showed that the direct photolysis processes in aquatic environments are not relevant to the elimination of MF. However, in samples containing treated wastewater effluent, photochemical degradation of MF was clearly enhanced. Our results indicate that MF undergoes indirect photolysis by reactive intermediates produced in an effluent matrix. Further quenching experiments suggested that photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and excited triplet state dissolved organic matter drive the degradation of MF. In contrast to MF, TCS photochemical degradation proceeds through rapid direct photolysis. TCS was quickly degraded in ultrapure buffered water but it is considerably hampered in samples containing wastewater effluent. The declined degradation of TCS in the synthetic field water was discussed in terms of underlying optical filter effects by coexisting chromophoric substances. Results emphasize the importance of taking local water chemistry into consideration when predicting natural attenuation of pharmaceutical chemicals in receiving areas.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are essential to preserve human and animal welfare, as well as to prevent illnesses. However, the elevated consumption of drugs, followed by incorrect disposal and inefficient wastewater treatment, may increase their environmental risk. In the case of antibiotics, such as ampicillin, some of the already known consequences are bacterial resistance and some toxic interactions with aquatic organisms. The scope of the present work is to investigate the removal of ampicillin through batch adsorption experiments onto granular activated carbon (GAC). The influence of pH and phase contact time were evaluated. Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were adjusted to experimental data to determine process kinetics. In order to study adsorption equilibrium and thermodynamics parameters, isotherms at 298 K, 298 K and 308 K were constructed. The models of Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips fitted to experimental data. The best results (73% of removal, residual concentration 5.2 mg L-1) were reached at pH 6 and 120 minutes of contact time. Pseudo-first order model better represented the adsorption kinetics (R-2 = 0.99), while the Langmuir equation suited well the experimental isotherms at 288 K and 298 K (R-2 = 0.998 and R-2 = 0.991) and the Sips equation better represented the system at 308 K (R-2 = 0.990). Thermodynamic parameters were estimated as Delta G degrees = -6,000 J mol(-1); -6,700 J mol(-1); -7,500 J mol(-1) at 288 K, 298 K and 308 K respectively, Delta H degrees = 14,500 J mol(-1) and Delta S degrees = 71.0 J mol(-1) K-1. The results indicate that this process is spontaneous, efficient and potentially applicable in the removal of ampicillin from water.

AB In the present study, comparison of activation efficiencies of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate (PS, Na2S2O8) induced by Fe(III)-Ethylenediamine-NN-disuccinic acid (EDDS) under polychromatic irradiation UVA and visible region at same conditions was studied for the first time. The effects of pH, Fe(III)-EDDS concentration, H2O2 and PS concentrations were investigated. p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPA) was taken as a model pharmaceutical intermediate pollutant to estimate the oxidative process efficiency. In these two systems, the degradation rate of p-HPA increased (not linearly) using higher concentrated solution of H2O2 and Na2S2O8. However, when Fe(III)-EDDS concentration exceeding 250 RIVI, the degradation efficiency of p-HPA began to decrease. Surprisingly, results of pH effects showed that Fe(III)-EDDS/H2O2/UV system presents much higher degradation efficiency than Fe(II)-EDDS/PS/UV whatever the solution pH's, especially in neutral and alkaline solutions. In the Fe(III)-EDDS/H2O2/UV reaction, p-HPA degradation rate (12,A) increased fast from pH 2.5 to 7.5, then it began to decrease when pH increased to 9.0. While ItpHpA started to decrease with pH increase to 3.9 in Fe(III)-EDDS/PS/UV system. To explain this phenomenon, the second order constant of p-HPA (for both molecular and mono-anionic forms) with HO' and SO4- radicals were determined by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments for the first time. Results showed that iCp_HpA jie was higher than kp_HpA,soi for both anionic and molecular forms of pollutant. These results demonstrated that iron-complex induced photo-Fenton process is more efficient than activation of persulfate process, particularly at environmentally closed pH values and sun simulated wavelengths (X > 300 nm).

AB Through a less-investigated in-situ hot-pressing synthesis method, the phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40 (denoted as PW12) was rapidly incorporated into a metal-organic framework MFM-300(In) in a short time, affording novel PW12@MFM-300(In) composites. This solvent-free preparation process is not only environment-friendly but also energy/time-saving. The inclusion of PW12 in MFM-300(In) was demonstrated by different physical and chemical characterizations. It was interesting to fmd that PW12@MFM-300(In) as new heterocatalysts display synergistic activity for the visible-light-driven catalytic degradation of pharmaceutically active compound sulfamethazine (SMT). 4-PW12@MFM-300(Ln) with excellent robustness possesses the high removal efficiency of about 98% toward SMT within 2 h at room temperature, and can also be recycled multiple times for this catalytic process.

AB Continuous exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is a critical concern given potential toxicity impacts on aquatic environments and human health, although concentrations of PPCPs in the environment are low. While several studies have focused on the fate and toxicity of organic micropollutants in wastewater, the environmental impacts of life cycle assessment induced by these organic micropollutants in advanced wastewater treatment processes are still unknown. To address this need, an environmental evaluation of three representative advanced wastewater treatment processes (ozonation, granular activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis) involving PPCPs removal was conducted using life cycle assessment and USEtox model in this study. Although a large amount of PPCPs can be eliminated during conventional waste highest characterization factors for freshwater toxicity, while 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, sertraline, and 17 beta-estradiol had the highest human toxicity characterization factors. From the perspective of LCA, reverse osmosis appeared to have the greatest environmental burden due to the high energy and material consumption during the treatment process. After involving 126 PPCPs in life cycle inventory, the ecotoxicity impact results were increased significantly in three advanced wastewater treatment processes. The contribution of effluent was improved in toxicity impact category, accounting more than 25% for the three processes. The effluent (including PPCPs) as the key factor was next only to electricity and chemicals in eutrophication, ecotoxicity and human toxicity impacts category particularly. Therefore, PPCPs should not be ignored in life cycle assessment of advanced wastewater treatment processes, although they are not typically monitored in wastewater. These results are valuable for conducting a comprehensive environmental evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment processes considering micro-pollutants removal. The identified PPCPs with high freshwater and human toxicity can be considered as the priority control index of organic micropollutants for wastewater treatment plants.

AB Porphyrins are known as effective photosensitizers and can be an interesting key in phototreatment of water contaminated with micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals. They already showed to be efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of dyes, chlorophenols and other pollutants. This work demonstrates the applicability of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TF5PP) as photosensitizer for treatment of water contaminated with metoprolol, a highly prescribed beta-blocker, which is not completely removed in sewage treatment plants. Studies were firstly developed under homogeneous conditions with simulated solar radiation and porphyrin was found to be efficient in the photodegradation of metoprolol, following a pseudo-first order kinetics with ca. 90% metoprolol degradation after 12 h. Experiments in presence of scavengers confirmed the mechanism of degradation via singlet oxygen. Appearance of several new peaks in HPLC chromatograms indicates the formation of products, identified by HPLC-MSn. Furthermore, the porphyrin was immobilized on a silica support and used as heterogeneous photocatalyst in degradation of metoprolol. Experiments using this heterogeneous photocatalyst under real solar irradiation were also performed, and similar results were obtained. Kinetic comparison of metoprolol photodegradation in buffer solution and in real wastewater treatment plant effluent showed that the efficiency of the immobilized porphyrin was not decreased by the complex matrix of the effluent.

AB In present study, we investigated the enantioselective behaviors of the chiral antidepressant venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine in loath Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (M. anguillicaudatus), as well as effects of microplastic on toxicity, distribution and metabolism through a 40-day co-exposure. The contents of SOD and MDA in loach liver elevated when the loach was exposed to venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Moreover, co-exposure with microplastic might lead to more adverse effect against loach. The distribution of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were both detected in loath tissues and liver subcellular. The concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were lower in water in microplastic-present treatment. Whilst, more contaminants were accumulated in liver through the "vehicle" (microplastic). Enantioselective behavior of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine occurred with R-enantiomers being preferentially degraded. With microplastic present, the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine in loath tissue amplified more than 10 times. In liver subcellular structure, microplastic may help to transport more compounds into subtle areas and postpone the contaminants metabolism in organisms. The present study for the first time gained an insight into the potential ecological effects and environmental behaviors of combined pollutions of chiral pharmaceuticals and microplastic, which could supply important information for environment risk assessment of concurrent organic pollutants and microplastic.

AB Amine-containing pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen, diclofenac, and sulfamethoxazole are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and other aquatic environments. Amine-containing pharmaceuticals can be effectively removed by chlorination. These drugs, however, may coexist in wastewater. Thus, they may compete with each other, and their chlorinated products may react with each other to form new products. In this study, competitive effects of the above three amine-containing pharmaceuticals by chlorination and their products were investigated. The priority of chlorination of these compounds was dependent upon the pH of the solution, due to the dissociation of the compounds and hypochlorite. It followed the order of sulfamethoxazole > diclofenac > acetaminophen in an acidic condition, the order of sulfamethoxazole > acetaminophen > diclofenac in a neutral condition, and the order of sulfamethoxazole approximate to acetaminophen > diclofenac in an alkaline condition. Some of the chlorinated products in single- and multiple-compound systems were the same. Dimers of sulfamethoxazole and its chlorinated products, however, were not found, but dimers of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen or diclofenac were found in multiple-compound systems. This finding is important because it means that new products may be produced if different amine-containing pharmaceuticals react with free chlorine simultaneously. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although reverse osmosis produces high quality reusable water from wastewater the rejected concentrate (ROC) poses potentially serious health hazards to non-target species. This is especially the case when it is disposed into aquatic environments due to the presence of high concentrations of dissolved natural organics, micro-organic pollutants (MOPS) and other pollutants. In batch and column studies we found that granular activated carbon (GAC) was very effective in simultaneously removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 18 MOPs from ROC. The amounts of all DOC fractions adsorbed (0.01-3 mg/g) were much higher than those of the MOPs (0.01-2.5 mu g/g) mainly because ROC contained larger concentrations of DOC fractions than MOPs. However, the partition coefficient which is a measure of the adsorbability was higher for most of the MOPs (0.21-21.6 L/g) than for the DOC fractions (0.01-0.45 L/g). The amount of DOC fraction adsorbed was in the order: humics > low molecular weights > building blocks > biopolymers (following mostly their concentrations in ROC). The partition coefficient was in the order: low molecular weigth nuetrals > humics > building blocks > biopolymers. The MOPs were classified into four groups based on their hydrophobicity (log Kow) and charge. The four positively charged MOPs with high hydrophobicity had the highest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient, with 95-100% removal in the GAC column. The MOPs that are negatively charged, regardless of their hydrophobicity, had the lowest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient with 73-94% removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increased use of synthetic textiles in the last decades, coupled with recent emphasis on the accumulation of (micro)plastic across multiple environmental compartments, has garnered interest into how microplastic fibers are released into the environment. In particular, polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis, including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement, has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies. In this study, we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic (In) fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension, as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total In content in the fibers was measured to be 0.2 % by weight, which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies (e.g. density, etc.) but provided sensitive detection limits by ICP-MS. Fiber length was 510 mu m +/- 410 mu m and 30 mu m in diameter. The incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge, with < 0.1 % In leaching over two months. In batch experiments, the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge ( > 99.9 %), with a mass balance of > 95 % recovery achieved on average across batches. Fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min, suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport.

AB Organic contaminants, specifically contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), have a great environmental impact, since the removal of these pollutants is of great difficulty by conventional treatments and the presence of these pollutants in the aquatic medium, even at low concentrations, is extremely hazardous to human health. Advanced oxidation processes and, specifically, TiO2-photocatalytic process is considered an option with positive results for an efficient treatment. However, the photocatalyst must be accessible to the UV radiation, for the activation of the TiO2. For this reason, it is recommendable to use a floating photocatalyst (with lower density than water) if the UV light comes from the solar radiation, because it will be on the water surface. In addition, this characteristic of the catalyst can entail an increase of the process efficiency if the pollutant is mainly located on the surface of water. In this context, the goal of this work is the preparation of floating photocatalysts for the removal of CECs from wastewater. TiO2 is deposited in low-density-polyethylene (LDPE), support with lower density than water and high stability and resistance to degradation. LDPE-TiO2 mixtures were prepared by different methods: mixing TiO2 and LDPE in a hot-cylinder-mixer or using o-xylene or an anionic surfactant as dispersing agent, in order to increase the dispersion of TiO2 before extrusion. Filaments obtained were printed as meshes in a Fused-Deposition-Modelling 3D-printer. The printed photocatalysts improved the activity in comparison with the plate obtained in the cylinder, used as benchmark. Thus, this study opens the doors to the in-situ treatment of CECs, using floating photocatalysts and solar radiation as the sole reagent, a very economical, efficient, easily implantable and environmentally compatible process.

AB This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Fe(III)-EDDS complex for degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in a solar photo-Fenton-like process at neutral pH in two different aqueous matrixes. Electrochemical experiments were performed to monitor the formation and stability of the complex, as a function of the amount of complexing agent and pH. Eight compounds, including diazepam, dipyrone, fluoxetine, furosemide, nimesulide, paracetamol, progesterone, and propranolol, were analyzed in distilled water and simulated wastewater, at initial concentrations of 500 mu g L-1. By applying Doehlert matrix design and the response surface methodology the optimal experimental conditions were found to be 0.28 mmol L-1 Fe(III)-EDDS and 5.00 mmol L-1 H2O2, with a ratio of 1:2 for Fe(III)-EDDS. The most persistent transformation products (TPs) generated during the treatment process were investigated using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 16 TPs were identified and classified as having high toxicity (according to the Cramer rules), low biodegradability (according to the START scheme), and possible carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity. Most of the compounds were degraded in the first minutes of treatment, and most of the identified TPs had been successfully removed at the end of the process.

AB In this study, the efficiency of three different hybrid systems coupling ultrafiltration (UF) with (i) UVC/H2O2, (ii) UVC/TiO2, and (iii) UVC was evaluated for the treatment of a secondary effluent (SE) from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a surface water (SW) from Miedwie Lake, both spiked with 5 mg L-1 of oxytetracycline (OTC). A ceramic membrane made of TiO2 was tested. The effect of H2O2 concentration (30 to 120 mg L-1) on the UVC/H2O2-UF system and of P25-TiO2 loading (0.5 to 1.5 g L-1) in suspension on the photocatalytic UVC/TiO2-UF system were investigated. A photonic flux of 5.1 J s(-1) was provided in all systems. The maximum pure water flux (PWF) was 111 L m(-2) h(-1). Adsorption on the photocatalyst particles and/or on the membrane surface was found to be an important contribution for the removal of OTC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The UF membrane contributed significantly to photocatalyst and pollutants rejection in the photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) with the UVC/TiO2 system; whereas when using the UVC/H2O2 process, with the highest H2O2 dose, the membrane effect was negligible. Using SE as reaction matrix in the UVC/ TiO2-UF system with 1.0 g L-1 of TiO2, the complete OTC removal was achieved in 5 h with a mineralization of 49%. For the same reaction period, a DOC removal of 52% was achieved with the UVC/H2O2-UF system (120 mg H2O2 L-1). A similar permeate flux decrease (ca. 40%) was observed in both cases. Furthermore, the highest reduction of permeate flux (60%) was observed when using the UVC-UF system. Using SW as reaction matrix, higher OTC degradation rates and percentage of mineralization were reached for the same reaction period, when compared with SE, due to the lower COD and inorganic salts concentration present in the surface water.

AB Cytostatic drugs have become one of the greatest environmental threats. They occur in surface, ground and even drinking water. Their key emission sources are hospital effluents, municipal wastewater, as well as drug manufacturers and their effluents. These compounds are extremely stable in natural waters and they are not significantly removed during wastewater treatment, because they are resistant to biodegradation. The aim of this work was to establish possible negative effects of chosen cytostatics: bleomycin and vincristine on the three trophic levels of surface waters. A single agent acute toxicity test was conducted on representatives of the producer an - aquatic freshwater plant Lemna minor, the consumer - crustaceans Daphnia magna, and the decomposer - bacteria Pseudomonas putida. Binary mixture tests were performed according to the Concentration Addition, Response Additivity, and Independent Action models. Both substances had a different effect on the tested organisms; bleomycin could be classified as a very toxic, while vincristine as a toxic water pollutant. Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values designed in the presented single agent acute toxicity studies are < 10 mg/L in all the tests with bleomycin as well as vincristine conducted on L. minor. In tests with vincristine performed on D. magna and P. putida EC50 > 100 mg/L. The highest toxicity is demonstrated by bleomycin towards the aquatic freshwater plant (EC50 = 0.2 mg/L). The binary mixture of the tested chemicals showed antagonistic effects of environmental concern.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are emerging pollutants causing serious challenges to wastewater treatment plants due to poor biodegradability. In this study, the enhanced removal of highly recalcitrant and commonly monitored PhACs, carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) by heterogeneous photocatalysis was investigated using 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS). The effects of catalyst dose, initial pollutants concentration, and mineralization during the photocatalytic degradation of PhACs were investigated. The matrix effect was assessed in deionized water (DW) and real membrane bioreactor effluent (RME). Optimal CBZ and DCF removals of 89.10% and 93.5%, respectively for 180 min of UV irradiation were achieved at catalyst dosage of 0.4 g L-1 in DW matrix. However, the optimal catalyst dosages for CBZ and DCF in RME matrix were increased by factor 2 and 1.5, respectively, to achieve the same degree of removal. Declining trends of removal rate were observed when initial concentrations of both the PhACs were increased under optimal catalyst dosages, and kinetics seem to fit the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Photo-induced holes and (OH)-O-center dot were the dominant oxidation species involved in the photocatalytic degradation of the PhACs. A plausible reusability of 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst was observed for both the PhACs. Moreover, various aromatic/aliphatic intermediates generated during the photodegradation CBZ were identified using fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, and a possible multi-step degradation pathway was proposed. Overall, the removal of PhACs using 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst showed promising results in real wastewater.

AB Persulfate-based advanced oxidation process is a powerful countermeasure for water remediation, where effective and low-cost catalysts are still needed. Herein, a one-pot synthetic method for magnetic nitrogen-doped sludge biochar (MS-biochar) was presented, which exhibited better catalytic property with PDS for tetracycline degradation than typical graphitic carbon (graphite powder, graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes) and two other types biochars. EDAX manifested the uniform dispersion of elements in MS-biochar. Similar to "top-down", a research thought from whole to part of MS-biochar for contribution measurement was presented, where acid-soluble substance (ASS) was the most important contributor for MS-400/600 while carbon matrix (CM) was dominant for MS-800. Quenching and EPR demonstrated a free-radicals pathway in MS-biochar/PDS, where ASS mainly assumed to be effective for SO4 center dot- and CM was primarily committed to center dot OH generation. EDAX, XPS and Raman studies proved three kinds of catalytic sites, namely the iron compounds, doped nitrogen and graphitic carbon. And their activating mechanism were discussed where one internal electron migration path (from sp(3) to nanocrystalline sp(2) carbon) has been first proposed. Reusability, metal leaching detection and pharmaceutical wastewater application indicated the potential of MS-biochar. This work not only presents a potential resource-based disposal of sewage sludge, a novel research thought from whole to part for materials performance measurement, but also provides guidance for carbon materials' design for persulfate activation, especially for sp(2) and sp(3) co-hybridized carbons.

AB This study used freshwater rotifers to evaluate the effects of two endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which can be considered emergent contaminants in urban and rural wastewater and are of ecotoxicological importance. LH stimulates the synthesis of testosterone, whereas FSH promotes the maturation of follicles and sperm in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, in rotifers, there are no reports of the effects of chronic exposure to these hormones when added to reconstituted culture medium, as a way to study potential adverse effects that might occur in the environment. Therefore, we studied the reproductive effects of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus Pallas 1766 using a 4-day reproductive assay. Our results indicate that LH has a significant effect in increasing the production of females, males, and cysts, while FSH had no significant effect compared to control treatment. Additionally, our results indicate that LH exposure resulted in 0.33% of organisms being deformed, whereas FSH exposure resulted in 1.09% of organisms being deformed. Deformations included: (a) abnormal growth of lorica, (b) joined foot-head, (c) deformed anterior spine, and (d) deformed parthenogenetic eggs. The organisms with LH-induced deformations did not reproduce and only lived 48 h after 4 days of exposure, while those with FSH-induced deformities survived 15 days and produced 105 cysts with a hatching percentage of 58.10%. Our goal was to contribute to the knowledge of endocrine systems and endocrine hormones of rotifers, to explain the potential mechanism of endocrine disruption that results in adverse effects in freshwater rotifers.

AB Application of anaerobically digested sludges and manure (digestates) to agricultural fields reduces the need for fertilizer application, but might also pose environmental risks due to the introduction of various pollutants - including metal trace elements and pharmaceuticals- to amended soils. The simultaneous presence of different contaminants can affect plant uptake, altering the performance of phytoremediation. This work aims to investigate and compare the single and combined effects of Enrofloxacin (Enro) and Cu on their plant uptake from digestate solutions. Plant uptake experiments were carried out by exposing, for 5 days, Phragmites australis to three different concentrations of a liquid digestate doped with Cu and/or Enro. Contaminant concentrations were afterward determined in both plant tissues and digestate solutions. Contaminant speciation in solution and Cu speciation in plant roots were also assessed. Cu plant uptake (mostly in plant roots, Cu concentration varied between 55 and 254 mu g.g(-1)) was observed, especially at low concentration of digestate. At high digestate concentration, Cu uptake decreased clue to the formation of Cu-DOC complexes rendering Cu less bioavailable. The presence of the antibiotic slightly further reduced Cu plant uptake due to the formation of Cu-Enro complexes. Plant roots also accumulated Enro, an accumulation also higher for the lowest concentration of digestate (an increase of 40%), and that slightly increased in the presence of Cu (up to 226 mu g.g(-1)). However, proportion of free Enro in solution decreased (up to 70%) in the presence of Cu due to complexation. Cu speciation in plant roots confirmed the implication of the complexation in the uptake of Cu and Enro when they are simultaneously present in solution. Thus, the presence of amendments (such as digestates) increasing the DOC content, in addition to the interactions between contaminants, should be taken into account for field crop soils as well as for phytoremediation technologies.

AB Simultaneous elimination of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is rarely investigated in full-scale riverine wetlands. Here, we compared the occurrence, abundance, and removal of 60 antibiotics and 27 ARGs in natural (Yeya Lake (YL)) and constructed (Bai River (BR)) riverine wetlands in Beijing, China. The concentrations of antibiotics in YL wetland were ND-51.9 ng/L. in water and ND-37.9 ng/g in sediments Significantly higher concentrations were found in BR wetland (ND-546 ng/L in water and ND-118 ng/g in sediments), which locates at the downstream of a reclaimed water treatment plant. The abundances of ARGs in YL and BR wetlands were up to 533 x 10(5) and 841 x 10(5) copies/mL in water, and 1.60 x 10(7) and 4.67 x 10(8) copies/g in sediments, respectively. These results suggest that wastewater greatly contributes to the elevated abundance of antibiotics and ARGs in both water and sediments. Compared to summer, higher levels of antibiotics in water were found in winter due to the higher usage, slower attenuation and the limited dilution. But higher abundances of ARGs were found in summer than in winter, in accordance with the favored microbial growth at higher temperature as denoted by copies of 16S rRNA. Compared to BR wetland, YL wetland achieved better removal of antibiotics and Sigma RGs, with average removal efficiencies of 70.0% and 87.5%. Antibiotics, ARGs and environmental factors showed strong correlations in water samples from YL wetland. However, in BR wetland that receives urban wastewater effluents, no correlation between antibiotics and ARGs was found although the distribution of antibiotics was affected by aquatic environmental factors. These results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics may stimulate the prevalence of ARGs in natural wetlands. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Opioids, both as prescription drugs and abuse substances, have been a but topic and a focus of discussion in the media for the last few years. Although the literature published shows the occurrence of opioids and some of their metabolites in the aquatic environment, there are scarce data in the application of high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for the analysis of these compounds in the environment. The use of HRMS allows increasing the number of opioids that can be studied as well as the detection of unknown opioids, their metabolites and potential transformation products. In this work, a retrospective analysis for the identification of opioids and their metabolites using a curated database was applied to surface water and wastewater samples taken in the state of Minnesota (U.S.) in 2009, which were previously analyzed by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) for antidepressants. The database comprised >200 opioids including natural opiates (e.g. morphine and codeine), their semi-synthetic derivatives (e.g. heroin, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycoclone, oxymorphone, mepericline and buprenorphine), fully synthetic opioicls (e.g. fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, dextromethorphan and propoxyphene), as well as some of their metabolites (e.g. 6-monoacetylcodeine, dextrorphan, COOP, normorphine and O-desmethyltramadol). Moreover, additional MS-MS experiments were performed to confirm their identification, as well as to recognize fragmentation patterns and diagnostic ions for several opioids. These data provide a better understanding of the historical occurrence of opioids and their metabolites in surface waters impacted by wastewater sources. The concentrations of individual opioids in surface water and wastewater effluent varied from 8.8 (LOOP) to 1640 (tramadol) ng L-1 and from 12 (dihydrocodeine) to 1288 (tramadol) ng L-1, respectively. The opioids with higher overall frequency detections were tramadol, dextromethorphan and its metabolite, dextrorphan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens is a good candidate for manure management. We evaluated the effect of sulfonamide pollution on the growth of H. illucens. Four treatments were considered with a sulfonamide content in the feed of 0 (control group), 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. The control larvae were fed without sulfonamide. Survival and development status of the individuals were recorded daily. The weights of the fifth instar larvae, prepupae, and pupae were checked. Antioxidant enzyme activity was determined with the fifth instar larvae. The results showed that a low (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) concentration of sulfonamides had no effects on larval survival, pupation, and eclosion of BSFs. A high sulfonamide concentration of 10 mg/kg had a significant effect on the survival of larvae and pupae and on the body weight of larvae, prepupae and pupae. Peak of the cumulated pupation rate and eclosion rate in the sulfonamide treatment of 10 mg/kg was very low. Pupation and eclosion in this group peaked later than that of the control and low sulfonamide concentration treatment groups (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg). Larvae from the sulfonamides group showed lower antioxidase activities than that of the control. In sulfonamide groups, the activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethazine were not detected in the harvested prepupae. Only sulfadiazine was discovered in the sulfonamide treatments of 1 and 10 mg/kg. In conclusion, BSFs can tolerate certain concentrations of sulfonamide contamination.

AB Many pharmaceuticals are present in reclaimed wastewater and effluent-dominated water bodies used to irrigate edible crops. Previous research has shown that plants irrigated with reclaimed wastewater can accumulate pharmaceuticals. However, plant-driven processes that contribute to differences in accumulation among compounds are not well understood. Here, we tested the effects of exposure to mixtures on spinach accumulation and metabolism of four psychoactive pharmaceuticals found in reclaimed wastewater: carbamazepine, fluoxetine, amitriptyline, and lamotrigine. Coexposure of plants to carbamazepine and fluoxetine or amitriptyline decreased accumulation of the toxic carbamazepine metabolite 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine. Furthermore, we tested a simple transpiration-based accumulation model and found that transpiration is a strong predictor for accumulation of the studied compounds. Amitriptyline accumulated to a larger extent than predicted from transpiration alone, and we suggest the possibility that a transporter protein may be involved in its uptake. Our findings highlight the need to consider plant physiology and mixture effects in studying accumulation of polar and ionizable organic contaminants and their metabolites.

AB This study examined the performance of natural clinoptilolite (NC) modified with two surfactants of Triton X-100 (NC-Triton) and Tween 80 (NC-Tween) on apramycin (APR) adsorption from wastewater in batch and continues systems. The optimum pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature were achieved. The findings revealed that the sorption was best described using the Langmuir isotherm compared to other isotherms. The maximum adsorption capacity of NC-Triton was greater than NC and NC-Tween. The lumped method was applied to solve the fixed-bed equations; predict breakthrough curve; determine axial dispersion coefficient and overall mass transfer coefficient parameters; and compare theoretical results with experimental results. Good fitness of experimental data with kinetic models of intra-particle diffusion, pseudo-first-order/liquid film diffusion and pseudo-second-order for NC, NC-Tween and NC-Triton, respectively, indicated that they were more suitable than the other models. Endothermic and spontaneous processes were resulted from positive enthalpy and negative Gibbs free energy changes, respectively.

AB Residual diclofenac sodium (DS) in the environment is harmful to human health. A promising method for DS removal is the use of adsorbents functionalized with amino groups that can form an ionic bond with the carboxyl group of DS at a suitable pH. In this work, a novel composite adsorbent composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and chitosan (CS) has been synthesized and functionalized by ethylenediamine (ED) in both layers. Characterization methods, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were used to confirm the morphology and synthetic mechanism of the double- amino-functionalized adsorbent. Based on the optimization of adsorption conditions and modeling of the adsorption mechanism, the DS adsorption process on CNC-ED@CS-ED involves chemical adsorption, and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model is 444.44 mg/g. CNC-ED@CS-ED exhibits good adsorption capacity and high sustainability; thus, it is a promising composite material for the removal of DS from wastewater.

AB Population growth, industrialization and the lack of restrictions on the use of recalcitrant compounds have led to the release of large amounts of pollutants. Water resources have been particularly affected by the presence of these compounds because the conventional wastewater treatments are unable to completely remove these pollutants. In fact, certain pharmaceutical products have been detected in drinking water at concentrations as high as 0.3 mu g/L. The seriousness of environmental pollution has triggered the development of scientific activities for the prevention and control of water pollution; among them, the application of enzymatic processes is emerging as a promising alternative. The stability of some ligninolytic enzymes and the development of processes for their repeated reuse, have been fundamental to scale-up enzymatic experiments from test-tubes to full-scale reactors. This review shows the key advances for scaling-up the enzymatic degradation processes, the problems that have arisen during the operation of different reactors and the strategies that have served to solve these problems. Finally, the work includes a cost comparison between the utilization of enzymatic treatments and other technologies. The available information indicates that enzymatic treatments have a real potential to compete with other processes in terms of efficiency, costs and environmental impact.

AB The aquatic environment and drinking water production are under increasing pressure from the presence of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products in surface waters. Demographic developments and climate change result in increasing environmental concentrations, deeming abatement measures necessary. Here, we report on an extensive case study around the river Meuse and its tributaries in the south of The Netherlands. For the first time, concentrations in the tributaries were measured and their apportionment to a drinking water intake downstream were calculated and measured. Large variations, depending on the river discharge were observed. At low discharge, total concentrations up to 40 g/L were detected, with individual pharmaceuticals exceeding thresholds of toxicological concern and ecological water-quality standards. Several abatement options, like reorganization of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and additional treatment of wastewater or drinking water were evaluated. Abatement at all WWTPs would result in a good chemical and ecological status in the rivers as required by the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive. Considering long implementation periods and high investment costs, we recommend prioritizing additional treatment at the WWTPs with a high contribution to the environment. If drinking water quality is at risk, temporary treatment solutions in drinking water production can be considered. Pilot plant research proved that ultraviolet (UV) oxidation is a suitable solution for drinking water and wastewater treatment, the latter preferably in combination with effluent organic matter removal. In this way >95% of removal of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products can be achieved, both in drinking water and in wastewater. Application of UV/H2O2, preceded by humic acid removal by ion exchange, will cost about Euro0.23/m(3) treated water.

AB Water scarcity is a worldwide problem boosted by global warming and pollution of anthropogenic origin. The contaminants of emerging concern in water sources are increasing due to the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatments, and these should be mitigated. Advanced oxidation processes appear as suitable solutions for decontamination. The photocatalytic oxidation of the mixture of sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and lorazepam was investigated. TiO2 modified by Ag and TiO2 modified by Pd were used as photocatalysts to improve photoactivity. The impact of light wavelengths was examined using UVA and visible radiation as well as natural sunlight. Visible light revealed the lowest ability for decontamination in 60 min of irradiation through Ag and Pd-TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation. On the other hand, UVA and sunlight in the presence of photocatalysts were able to totally remove the contaminants. This can be related to the high production of reactive oxidative species at those conditions. The increase of the noble metal load promotes the improvement of the decontamination efficiency. The kinetic rate was analyzed for UVA and sunlight radiation for different photocatalytic conditions. The presence of a natural light source without energy costs leads to an increase in the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant. Sunlight radiation with a suitable photocatalyst can be a very good option for water decontamination.

AB Pharmaceuticals are consumed in high amounts and can enter as emerging organic compounds in surface waters as they are only partially retained in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Receiving pharmaceuticals may burden the aquatic environment, as they are designed to be bioactive even at low concentrations. Sediment biofilm populations were analyzed in river sediments due to the exposure of an inflow of WWTP effluents. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed of 108 sediment samples, which were taken from multiple cores within three sampling locations in the Panke River, with one sampling site located downstream of the inflow. Sequencing data were processed to infer microbial community structure in samples concerning the environmental variables, such as micropollutants and physicochemical parameters measured for each core. More than 25 different micropollutants were measured in pore water samples, in which bezafibrate, clofibric acid, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were detected at high concentrations. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Ignavibacteriae as the most abundant groups in the samples. Differences in microbial community composition were observed with respect to micropollutants. However, our findings revealed that the composition of the microbial community was not only governed by the effluent. The significant changes in the alpha- and beta-diversity were explained by phenobarbital and SO42-, which did not originate from the WWTP indicating that more unobserved factors are also likely to play a role in affecting the biofilm community's composition.

AB The detection and monitoring of illicit drug concentrations in environmental waters is of increasing interest. This study aimed to determine if illicit and regulated compounds, their potential pre-cursors, and metabolites varied in amount discharged into the environment from treated wastewater at different facilities. Water samples were taken from discharge points of four different tertiary wastewater treatment plants discharging directly into the Hawkesbury-Nepean River (Australia) on two different occasions and analysed to determine the concentrations of compounds including: ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine. Here, we show that detectable levels of illicit drug and metabolites are being emitted on a consistent basis after having persisted through the wastewater treatment process. The concentrations of methamphetamine are in excess of previously reported surface water concentrations. The estimated total load of compounds being discharged on a daily basis is greater than similar sized catchment areas. The results presented here are of concern from both an ecological and human health perspective.

AB In recent years, pharmaceutical products have been causing a serious environmental problem in hospital wastewater and water purification plants. The elimination of these pollutants is difficult due to their resistance to biological degradation. Paracetamol has been detected in higher concentrations in hospital wastewater than in other buildings. Activated carbons are a good material for removing paracetamol from hospital wastewater. One of the starting materials to obtain activated carbons is kenaf, which is an easy plant to cultivate. To study the elimination of paracetamol from hospital wastewater by activated carbon, the textural and chemical characterization of activated carbon, as well as the kinetic study and the analysis of the paracetamol adsorption mechanism by the adsorbent, have been carried out. The activated carbon samples studied are micro-mesoporous, with high specific surface values. The chemical composition with presence of oxygen groups favours the adsorption process. The adsorption kinetics were adjusted to a pseudo-second order model. The adsorption mechanism followed the intraparticular diffusion model, carried out in two stages: a fast first stage on the surface of the adsorbent and a slow one inside the pore. Based on the kinetic study, the use of this type of carbon is a good application for the removal of paracetamol from hospital wastewater.

AB The first step of an anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) system is typically the formation of nitrite (NO2-) via partial nitritation, which can generate hydroxyl radical (OH) when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light. This study demonstrated that the presence of nitrite in buffer and wastewater matrices during medium-pressure UV irradiation (at lambda >= 220 or >= 280 nm) enhanced the degradation of select pharmaceutical compounds of different therapeutic classes (atenolol, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and trimethoprim). Total pharmaceutical removals in a wastewater matrix irradiated at lambda >= 280 for 120 minutes were 47% for trimethoprim, 50% for carbamazepine, 60% for atenolol, and 57% for fluoxetine at fluences of 58.6 mEi m(-2) (2033.1 mJ cm(-2)). When irradiated at lambda >= 220 for 60 minutes, removals were 52% for trimethoprim, 56% for carbamazepine, 69% for atenolol, and 90% for fluoxetine at fluences of 634.7 mEi m(-2) (23 969.2 mJ cm(-2)). Reaction with OH accounted for similar to 78-90% of pharmaceutical removal at lambda >= 280 nm. Although direct photolysis did contribute to target compound removal for irradiation with lambda >= 220 nm, much of the light was absorbed in the buffer and wastewater matrices, and reaction with OH accounted for similar to 70-93% of pharmaceutical removal. Quencher experiments with isopropanol confirmed the importance of reaction with OH as the main contributor to pharmaceutical removal. para-Chlorobenzoic acid was used as a probe to estimate steady-state OH concentrations, which averaged 8.58 x 10(-15) M for both matrices at lambda >= 280 nm and 3.50 x 10(-14) M for both matrices at lambda >= 220 nm. Nitrosamines were formed and accumulated during the UV treatment step, however, concomitant with their direct photochemical destruction. Presence of the pharmaceutical micro-pollutants studied, such as the secondary-amine containing atenolol and fluoxetine, did not elevate nitrosamine formation.

AB The staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (SAFMBR) is effective to remove organic substances with reduced sludge production by minimizing excess waste sludge. This study investigated the removals of four pharmaceuticals present at trace levels in municipal wastewater by using a SAFMBR. The target pharmaceuticals included ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and diclofenac. A pilot-scale SAFMBR with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) from 4.5 to 13.5 hr was established and operated for 450 days with a municipal wastewater spiked with four pharmaceuticals. In the results, the BOD and COD removals were effective and limitedly affected the presence of pharmaceuticals. The BOD removal efficiencies in the anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFBR) and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFMBR) were 63.5 +/- 28.6% and 81.6 +/- 25.1%, respectively. However, the treatment efficiencies of four pharmaceuticals varied. Naproxen that contains electron donating group was treated efficiently (63.8%similar to 72.1%), whereas the removal efficiencies of ibuprofen (25.0%similar to 32.4%), carbamazepine (16.6-18.5%), and diclofenac (non-detected) remained low. Ibuprofen was less efficient to compete with other electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment. For pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine with a high acid dissociation constant (pKa = 13.9) or diclofenac with a high octanol-water partition coefficient (log K-ow = 4.51), sorption onto the sludge could be one critical process affecting their concentrations in the water phase. By being positively charged at neutral pH and/or hydrophobic, the pharmaceuticals were initially adsorbed onto sludge, followed by being desorbed when sludge decayed after long operating hours. Nitrogen balance was analyzed to indicate the decay of the bacteria in the AFMBR. Increasing the HRTs only slightly improved the treatment efficiencies (e.g., the naproxen removal was increased from 63.8% to 72.1% when the HRT was increased from 4.5 to 7.5 h). The different processes responsible for the removals of these pharmaceuticals were more critical and their effects were limitedly changed by HRT adjustment, indicating the importance of knowing the properties of a pharmaceutical for selection of a proper treatment approach.

AB The removal efficiencies and accumulated concentrations of oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin in three pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with different flow configurations (surface, horizontal subsurface, and vertical subsurface flow) were investigated. The results indicated that the average mass removal efficiencies of the CWs for the target antibiotics in one year of treatment ranged from 85 to 99%, and the vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands exhibited the highest and most stable removal efficiencies for oxytetracycline (99 +/- 0.27%) and ciprofloxacin (97 +/- 0.26%). The influence of seasonal changes on the removal efficiencies of oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin in CWs was insignificant. The higher accumulated antibiotic concentrations and antibiotic-degrading bacteria abundances indicated that substrate adsorption and biodegradation were the predominant pathways affecting the antibiotic removal efficiency of wetlands. The concentration of accumulated ciprofloxacin in soil and oyster shell (84-124 and 83-115 mu g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than that of oxytetracycline (37-81 and 3-17 mu g kg(-1)). In addition, analysis results based on pilot-scale CWs also indicated that the influence of the type of CW on the bacterial community was more significant than the wetland substrate and residual concentration of antibiotics.

AB This paper, inspired by Sven Erik Jorgensen's academic life, takes a systems ecology perspective on sustainability in wastewater sludge management. First, an overview identifies the indicators and methods currently used to assess sustainability and sustainable development in the area of wastewater sludge. Second, two systems ecology conceptual models are presented. Third, the indicators and methods are discussed in the perspective of these systems ecology models. Four methods were found common in assessing wastewater sludge sustainability: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Exergy Analysis (ExA), Emergy Analysis (EmA), and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was added since it was found to be used in the larger wastewater treatment context, and complements the other four methods. When comparing the indicators and methods with the systems ecology models it was found that no method covered every aspect of the models. ExA, EmA and ERA covered the full extent of the models but not from every aspect interesting from a sustainability point of view. LCA and CBA had a lower reach at the ecosystem side of the models, but produced deeper knowledge regarding environmental impacts for LCA, and economic flows and storages for CBA. The investigation concludes that a complementary approach of methods and indicators is needed to assess sustainability, and they are suggested to be used in an integrated way, in the spirit of Sven Erik Jorgensen's findings.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) undergoing incomplete removal during wastewater treatment may be found in treated wastewater (TWW) used for irrigation of agricultural products. Following uptake into edible plant parts, EOCs may eventually enter in the food chain, with associated human exposure. In the present study, we used a newly developed steady-state plant uptake model with added phloem transport to predict the uptake of four EOCs (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) into three varieties of lettuce. Input data were derived from an experimental study with vegetables grown in greenhouse and irrigated with TWW spiked with CBZ at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 210 mu g/L in each variety of lettuce.
   Predicted carbamazepine concentrations in leaves were on average 82% higher than in roots, with good agreement between measured and calculated data. We subsequently predicted the uptake of anti-inflammatory compounds ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, for which the chemical analysis could not provide concentrations above detection limit. These three substances are weak acids and predicted concentrations in roots were higher than in the edible leaves, mainly due to phloem transport downwards. The daily dietary intake of all four EOCs was estimated for consumption of leafy vegetables, being far below usual therapeutic doses.

AB The health of both coral reefs and people are imperiled by a local threat that is widespread across the globe-sewage and the typical components it carries (e.g., nutrients, sediments, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, pathogens, and pharmaceuticals). Despite this common threat, those concerned with human health and those concerned with coral reef health have rarely joined forces. To jump-start an alliance between coral conservation and human health sectors, this article documents the threats that humans and reefs face and identifies threat-abatement strategies that will benefit both people and reefs, highlighting the mitigation of water pollution as a prime example. By joining forces, marine conservationists and human health practitioners can increase the amount and efficiency of both intellectual and financial resources they bring to bear against sewage.

AB Complex mixtures of low concentrations of organic micropollutants are commonly found in rivers and streams, but their relationship to the structure of native bacterial communities that underlie critical ecological goods and services in these systems is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we used correlation-based network analysis to explore co-occurrence patterns between measured micropollutant concentrations and the associated surface water and sediment bacterial communities in a restored riparian zone of the Des Plaines River (DPR) in Illinois that is impacted by both wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and agricultural runoff. Over a two year period, we collected 55 grab samples at 11 sites along the DPR and one of its tributaries (48 surface water samples) and from WWTP effluent (7 samples), and screened for 126 organic micropollutants. In parallel, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial community in sediment and surface water. Our results revealed quantifiable levels of 102 micropollutants in at least one surface water or WWTP effluent sample, 85 of which were detected in at least one surface water sample. While micropollutants were temporally and spatially variable in terms of both presence and concentration, 21 micropollutants were measured in over 75% of the 48 surface water samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing documented diverse bacterial communities along the DPR transect, with highly distinct community structures observed in sediment and water. Bacterial community structure in surface water, but not in sediment, was significantly associated with concentrations of micropollutants, based on a Mantel test. Correlation-based network analyses revealed diverse strong and significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion patterns between specific bacterial OTUs and both micropollutant groups (defined based on k-means clustering on chemical substructure) and individual micropollutants. Significantly more associations were documented between micropollutants and bacterial taxa in the water compared to the sediment microbiomes. Taken together, our results document a significant link between complex mixtures of micropollutants commonly found in aquatic systems and associated bacterial community structure. Furthermore, our results suggest that micropollutants may exert a more significant impact on water-associated than on sediment-associated bacterial taxa.

AB A facile one-pot spray-drying process was developed for fabrication and in situ crosslinking of chitosan microspheres to improve the adsorption capacity by microscopic design. A fully biobased nature was achieved by utilizing genipin (GP) as a crosslinking agent and chitosan-derived nanographene oxide (nGO) as a property tuner. The produced chitosan microspheres were further proven as powerful adsorbents for common wastewater contaminants such as anionic dyes and pharmaceutical contaminants, here modeled by methyl orange (MO) and diclofenac sodium (DCF). By regulating the amount of GP and nGO, as well as by controlling the process parameters including the spray-drying inlet temperature and postheat treatment, the surface morphology, size, zeta potential, and adsorption efficiency of the microspheres could be tuned accordingly. The adsorption efficiency for MO and DCF reached 98.9 and 100%, respectively. The microspheres retained high DCF adsorption efficiency after six adsorption and desorption cycles, and the recyclability was improved by the incorporated nGO. The fabricated microspheres, thus, have great potential as reusable and eco-friendly adsorbents.

AB A waste-based alternative activated carbon (AAC) was produced from paper mill sludge under optimized conditions. Aiming its application in tertiary wastewater treatment, AAC was used for the removal of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and paroxetine from biologically treated municipal wastewater. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were run under batch operation conditions. For comparison purposes, they were also performed in ultrapure water and using a high-performance commercial AC (CAC). Adsorption kinetics was fast for the three pharmaceuticals and similar onto AAC and CAC in either wastewater or ultrapure water. However, matrix effects were observed in the equilibrium results, being more remarkable for AAC. These effects were evidenced by Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities (q(m), mgg(-1)): for AAC, the lowest and highest q(m) were 19410 (SMX) and 2879 (PAR), in ultrapure water, and 47 +/- 1 (SMX) and 407 +/- 14 (PAR), in wastewater, while for CAC, the lowest and highest q(m) were 118 +/- 7 (SMX) and 190 +/- 16 (PAR) in ultrapure water and 123 +/- 5 (SMX) and 160 +/- 7 (CBZ) in wastewater. It was found that the matrix pH played a key role in these differences by controlling the surface electrostatic interactions between pharmaceutical and AC. Overall, it was evidenced the need of adsorption results in real matrices and demonstrated that AAC is a promising option to be implemented in tertiary wastewater treatments for pharmaceuticals' removal.

AB Pharmaceuticals are important environmental stressors since they have a worldwide use; they are usually released in the aquatic compartment without adequate treatment, and because of their intrinsic properties, they may affect several non-target organisms. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active substance of aspirin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, being one of the most widely prescribed analgesics in human medical care. Consequently, this compound is systematically reported to occur in the wild, where it may exert toxic effects on non-target species, which are mostly uncharacterized so far. The objective of the present work was to assess the acute and chronic effects of ASA on selected oxidative stress biomarkers [catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST)], lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance), and histological alterations in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor (Annelida: Polychaeta). The obtained data showed that ASA is not exempt of toxicity, since it was responsible for significant, albeit transient, changes in biomarkers related to the redox status of the organisms, occurring as an increase in the activity of catalase in the individuals exposed acutely to ASA. Chronic exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of this drug showed to be mostly ineffective in promoting any significant biochemical alteration in H. diversicolor. However, histochemical observations revealed proliferation of mucous cells in the tegument of chronically exposed individuals to ASA.

AB An enrichment process was employed by applying high ibuprofen concentration in an immobilized cell bioreactor in order to favor the ibuprofen-degrading community present in activated sludge. Experimental data showed the ability of the immobilized cell bioreactor to achieve high ibuprofen removal efficiencies (98.4 +/- 0.3%), the tendency of the enriched biomass to acidify the treated liquor, and the inhibition of the nitrification process. Illumina sequencing revealed a massive increase in the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (from 29.1 to 80.8%) and a dramatic decrease in the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia (from 42.7 to 2.1%) when pure ibuprofen served as the sole carbonaceous feeding substrate. This shift in the feeding conditions resulted in the predominance of Novosphingobium and Rhodanobacter (25.5 +/- 10.8% and 25.2 +/- 3.0%, respectively) and demonstrated a specialized ibuprofen-degrading bacterial community in activated sludge, which possessed the selective advantage to cope with its degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this bioreactor system was capable of effectively treating the highest ibuprofen concentration applied in wastewater treatment plants.

AB In this study, we report an effective degradation method for trace level beta-blockers (propranolol and acebutolol) in hospital wastewater using a new droplet flow-assisted heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactor (DFEF) system. Biogenic iron-carbon nanocomposites (RHS/C-x% Fe) as eco-friendly and low-cost heterogeneous Fenton catalysts were synthesized from rice husk via hydrolytic sol-gel routes. Here, we demonstrate the use of natural air as a nebulizing agent for fast and continuous catholyte air saturation and Fenton catalyst transfer to the cathode electrode. The effects of key operational parameters were evaluated and optimized using central composite design. Results clearly indicated that enhanced beta-blocker degradation was mainly dependent on the interactive effects of electrolysis time, current density, and catalyst dosage. Fast degradation efficiencies (99.9%) was recorded at neutral pH conditions. The decay followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with degradation rates of up to 2.72x10(-2) and 2.54x10(-2)min(-1) for acebutolol and propranolol, respectively. The synergistic contribution of (OHbulk)-O-center dot attributable to DFEF process and (OHadsorbed)-O-center dot for anodic oxidation (AO) at the anode electrode significantly enhanced the degradation process. Compared to AO, the conventional flow-assisted electro-Fenton (FEF), and the batch electro-Fenton (BEF), DFEF degradation efficiency followed a decreasing order: DFEF ? FEF ? BEF? AO. This trend in performance was mainly due to the fast and continuous cathodic electro-generation of H2O2 and Fe2+ regeneration. Additionally, in order to elucidate degradation mechanism, we used a combination of DFEF approach with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This approach demonstrates a simple, cleaner, and highly efficient degradation approach for trace level recalcitrant pollutants in a complex aquatic matrix, without the need for external chemical addition and pH adjustment.

AB In this study, a novel Fe-Mn binary oxide (FMBO), which combined the oxidation capability of iron and manganese oxides, was constructed to remove sulfamethoxazole (SMX) effectively using the simultaneous co-precipitation and oxidation methods, and the reaction products were probed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Particularly, FMBO-mediated transformation mechanisms of SMX were explored using radical scavengers and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Results indicated that the best removal efficiency was obtained at a pH of 4.0, with the H2O2 of 6.0mmol/L and the FMBO dosage of 2.0g/L, giving 97.6% removal of 10mg/L SMX within 60min. More importantly, we found that the hydroxyl (center dot OH) radicals generated by FMBO through Fenton-like reaction were responsible for the SMX oxidation. EPR studies were confirmed that the peak intensities of hydroxyl adduct decreased remarkably with increasing pH values. Moreover, the four SMX degradation intermediate products were detected by LC/MS and a reaction pathway for the possible mineralization of SMX, with center dot OH radicals as the main oxidant, was proposed. These findings provide a novel insight into the removal of SMX by FMBO-mediated radical reactions in aquatic environments. Moreover, this research suggested that FMBO can act as an efficient catalyst to remove SMX in hospital wastewater.

AB The degradation of roxithromycin (ROX) by hydroxyl radical ( OH ) generated by UV/H2O2 was systematically investigated in terms of degradation kinetics, effects of water chemistry parameters, oxidation products, as well as toxicity evaluation. The degradation of ROX by UV/H2O2 with varying light irradiation intensity, initial ROX concentration, and H2O2 concentration in pure water and wastewater all followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The second-order rate constant for reaction between ROX and OH is 5.68 +/- 0.34x10(9)/M/s. The degradation rate of ROX increased with the pH; for instance, the apparent degradation rates were 0.0162 and 0.0309/min for pH4 and pH9, respectively. The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) at its concentrations up to 10mg C/L did not significantly affect the removal of ROX. NO3- and NO2- anions inhibited the degradation of ROX due to the consumption of OH in reactions with these ions . Fe3+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ cations inhibited the degradation of ROX, probably because of the formation of ROX-metal chelates. A total of ten degradation products were tentatively identified by HPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS, which mainly derived from the attack on the oxygen linking the lactone ring and the cladinose moiety, tertiary amine and oxime side chain moiety by OH . The toxicity evaluation revealed that UV/H2O2 treatment of ROX induced the toxicity to bioluminescent bacteria increased.

AB BACKGROUNDOfloxacin is a frequently detected fluoroquinolone antibiotic in wastewater treatment plant effluents, sea waters and surface waters. Photocatalytic technology is considered to be the most promising treatment technology for the removal of ofloxacin. However, it is a big challenge to exploit a novel sunlight-driven photocatalyst and reveal the mechanism of ofloxacin degradation.
   RESULTSCo3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 composites were prepared using a facile hydrothermal synthesis method. The structural, morphological and optical properties of the composites were well characterized. Both the degradation efficiency and cyclical stability of the Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 composites increased significantly under simulated sunlight irradiation when ofloxacin (OFX) or methyl orange (MO) was used as the target molecule, as compared with single-phase Ag3PO4 and Co-3(PO4)(2). The reduction of antimicrobial activity for 8%Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 reached 88.8% after 5min of sunlight irradiation.
   CONCLUSIONCo3(PO4)(2) played a critical role in suppressing carrier recombination and provided a large number of photogenerated holes and O-center dot(2)- to oxidize OFX or MO. The OFX degradation mechanism included piperazinyl dealkylation, decarboxylation and defluorination. The reduction of antimicrobial activity for degradation byproducts was obvious after simulated sunlight irradiation over Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4. Therefore Co-3(PO4)(2)/Ag3PO4 is an attractive candidate for the removal of OFX. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Macrolide antibiotics are one of the major groups of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants that have been detected in aquatic systems. Photocatalytic degradation under UV light is useful for mineralization of various pharmaceutical pollutants but very limited studies are available for degradation of azithromycin (AZY) using visible light. In the present study, a novel ZrO2/Ag@TiO2 nanorod ternary nanocomposite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal and photodeposition method for efficient degradation of AZY under visible light. The composite was detailed characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM analyses, which revealed the formation of cubic ZrO2 and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 nanorods (TNR). More than 90% of azithromycin (20 mg/L) was degraded after 8 h of visible light irradiation. The plausible transformation pathway for azithromycin was proposed based on the LC/MS-IT-TOF analysis. The phytotoxicity evaluation of the azithromycin and its degraded products was assessed on Vigna radiata. The germination index (GI) of azithromycin was found to be 12.3% before degradation while it increased to 81.05% after 8 h of degradation, indicating this photodegradation process achieved nearly complete detoxification. Furthermore, the toxicity of the degradation products was determined on the basis of Escherichia coli colony forming unit assay which confirmed high detoxification efficiency. Thus, this work demonstrated an efficient strategy for visible light degradation and detoxification of azithromycin, which provided new insight on macrolide antibiotic photodegradation and would be promising for antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB Halogenated aromatic compounds are toxic and carcinogenic. This is the case of 4-chlorophenol (4CP), a priority pollutant found in large amounts in industrial wastewater effluents from pharmaceutical, dye, pulp and paper industries. Long term exposure to 4-CP even at low-concentration is associated to endocrine disruption. Photocatalysis is a promising advanced oxidation process that attains complete degradation of organic pollutants. The use of UV lamps undermines actual photocatalysis application due to the electrical energy requirements. In this frame, the development of visible light photoactive catalysts can overcome these challenges allowing the implementation using affordable light sources like light emitting diodes (LEDs) or natural sunlight. This work is to present the synthesis and use of an alternative photocatalyst that provided eight-fold increase on 4-CP degradation in comparison to commercial TiO2 Degussa P-25. Almost complete removal (99.20%) was achieved with synthesized Fe/N/S-doped TiO2 at 1.0 g L-1 of photocatalyst dose and pH 7.0 for treating 10 ppm of 4-CP.The first-order rate constant, k(LH ) and Langmuir adsorption constant, Ku(LH, )were calculated with values of 0.429 min(-1) and 2.326 ppm(-1), respectively. The Fe/N/S-TiO2. photocatalysts showed an excellent stability maintaining their performance during four cycles of recovery/reuse. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB This study demonstrates the adsorptive recovery of high-concentration Iopamidol (TOP) from aqueous solution. IOP is a highly valuable X-ray iodinated contrast agent (ICA), and the reuse of the adsorbent activated carbon (AC) is via elution with alcohol. Of the adsorbents selected, coconut powder AC (CPAC) displayed the best adsorption performance for IOP. The results of batch investigation into adsorption kinetics, isotherms, activation energy, and thermodynamic calculations support the occurrence of a physisorption process. The adsorption mechanism has been determined using the intraparticle diffusion model. A Boyd plot has revealed that IOP adsorption onto CPAC was mainly governed by particle diffusion. CPAC also exhibited excellent adsorptive performance toward IOP, which was efficiently eluted and recovered using methanol in a semicontinuous flow system. Moreover, the spent CPAC was efficiently regenerated and reused in five adsorption/desorption cycles. The characterization of CPAC samples by SEM, DRIFT, and TGA shows that IOP is absorbed onto CPAC, leading to significant decreases in the BET surface area and pore volume and shift of the pore diameter. pi-pi, donor-acceptor complex, van der Waals, and hydrogen-bond interactions are governed by the IOP adsorption. Hydrogen-bond interactions between IOP and alcohols play a crucial role in the desorption process. IOP was completely eluted, and the surface properties of CPAC were recovered after elution in the flow system. This study demonstrates that many benefits can be achieved from adsorption/desorption processes, such as those in wastewater treatment and the recovery of valuable compounds, as adsorbent recycling simplifies the operations and reduces treatment costs.

AB Diclofenac is a pharmaceutical compound which is listed as a priority substance to be removed from wastewater. The current research investigated the adsorption of diclofenac using graphene oxide (GO) which was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the adsorption of diclofenac onto GO based on central-composite design. According to the developed model, the dominant parameters affecting the process were dosage and initial concentration. The optimum adsorption conditions were dosage of 0.16 g/L, time of 14.75 min, initial concentration of 400 mg/L and temperature of 40 degrees C. Under these conditions, GO exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 653.91 mg/g for diclofenac. The diclofenac uptake by GO was consistent with the Langmuir adsorption and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The active binding sites for diclofenac in GO might be hydroxyl, carboxyl and alkoxy as determined by FTIR analysis. The results provided sufficient evidence to support GO as a promising adsorbent for removal of diclofenac in aqueous solution. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB An evaluation of the environmental risk assessment (ERA) proposed by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its applicability in Brazil was performed on ten of Belo Horizonte's most pharmaceuticals by the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS). The predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) was proposed, with some refinements to a better representation of the city of study. All PECs obtained were compared only to measured environmental concentrations around the world, due to the lack available data in the city of study and in Brazil. During the performance of EMA's guideline, the risk quotient (RQ) of impact was established through the ratio of PECs and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs). The PECs obtained in more refined phases show the initial evaluation of EMA's guideline, possible subdimensions, and the potential risks. The RQ for all studied pharmaceuticals ranges from clonazepam (1.26) to losartan (5457.45). These results indicate potential risks to the aquatic life present in the streams that receive the wastewater treatment plant's effluent. This risk can be spread since the streams carry these contaminants to other water bodies that undergo to multiple cities of Brazil, and even after dilutions, it can still be potentially toxic to the biotic life. ERA shows that it can be a useful tool for a better understanding and modeling of pharmaceuticals fate in the environment, specifically in water bodies. In addition, the usage of this model shows to be a useful tool that determines which contaminant should follow a more thorough study since the detection and analysis of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples are costly and technically challenging.

AB Pharmaceuticals and household chemicals are important components of municipal sewage. Many of them are biologically active, disrupting not only hormonal regulation of aquatic animals but also, indirectly, disturbing their immunological protection. In the environment, chemicals rarely act as individual substances, but as elements of mixtures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to check whether the acute laboratory exposure of common carp juveniles to a mixture of ibuprofen, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol in increasing concentrations, modifies the levels of innate immunity (lysozyme, C-reactive protein) as well as general stress (metallothioneins, heat shock proteins HSP70) markers in brain, liver, gills, spleen and mucus. The levels of the markers were measured by an immunodetection technique. Not only do the pharmaceuticals and household chemicals impair immunological reactions of young carp in various tissues but also do that in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver, gills, spleen and mucus. This has a very important implication, since it may result in higher sensitivity of young fish to pathogens due to energy allocation to defence processes. The comparisons of the pattern of stress reactions in the studied organ samples indicated that mucus appeared to be a good, non-invasive material for monitoring of environmental state and fish conditions.

TI Experimental evaluation of forced circulation crystallizer performance
   in production of sugar crystals
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID IN-SITU CRYSTALLIZATION; KINETICS
AB Operating conditions of forced circulation crystallizer, which is equipped with a condenser, are investigated in this research. The results can be used as tally rules for design and process optimization. The effect of operating pressure, operating temperature, and cooling water flow rate on the performance of forced circulation crystallizer as an industrial type of evaporators is evaluated in this research. Moreover, the relationship between the amounts of produced sugar crystal, acidity, distilled water, sugar crystal size, and energy consumption in the heat exchanger has been investigated, experimentally. Finally, the relationship between the concentration of sugar in liquor and related density is measured in this article. The experimental results show, with increasing operating temperature from 87.1 to 91.6 degrees C, the density of outlet liquor from the crystallizer decreases from 1,122.37 to 1,121.48kg/m(3). In addition, 6.24kWh as the minimum amount of energy consumption is obtained at a temperature of 27.3 degrees C. Results show that the difference between feed temperature and heat exchanger temperature is between 5.9 and 9.8% for different cooling water flow rates.
   Practical applicationsA forced-circulation crystallizer operates under reduced pressure. A high recirculation rate through the external heat exchanger is used to provide good heat transfer and minimize encrustation. The crystal magma is circulated from the lower conical section of the evaporator body through the vertical tubular heat exchanger and reintroduced tangentially into the evaporator below the liquor level to create a swirling action and prevent flashing (sudden evaporation). Feedstock enters on the pump inlet side of the circulation system. Product crystal magma is removed below the conical section. Its purpose is to concentrate nonvolatile materials such as organic compounds, mineral sugars, acids, and bases. Totally, a forced circulation evaporator utilizes a heavily recirculated heat exchanger with suppressed boiling. Moreover, it is typically used for fouling or crystallizing products. A high liquid rate combined with induced turbulence deters scaling on the heat transfer surfaces. Totally, the forced circulation crystallizers apply in food industries. Some of the industries, which are related to the forced circulation crystallizer, are mineral ingredients companies, chemical companies, and feed industries. The main applications of forced circulation crystallizer are as follows: (a) suitable for material with bigger concentration ratio, higher viscosity, and easily crystallization; (b) widely used in the evaporation and concentration of water phase solution or organic phase solution, in food, pharmaceutical, chemical, biological engineering, and other industries; (c) widely used for the evaporation and concentration of tomato sauce, malt dextrin, starch, sugar, glucose, lysine, inositol, fructose, oligosaccharides, peptides, and so on; (d) compact structure and convenient operation, ideal evaporator for treating corn syrup, tomato paste, and industrial sewage; and (e) for the production of chemical and petrochemical compositions such as phosphoric acid, ammonium sulfate, soda, sodium sulfate, and gelatin, urea.

AB The purpose of this research was the preparation and photocatalytic evaluation of a novel nanocomposite (NC) based on Fe3O4/ZnO, to eliminate four persistent antibiotics in surface waters: sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin and roxithromycin. Prior to the operation of the photocatalytic reactor, the influence of pH (3-9), catalyst concentration (50-800 mg L-1), oxidant dose (0-100 mg L-1) and concentration of different targets (10-100 mu g L-1) on the catalytic efficiency was evaluated. The analysis of reaction kinetics showed that degradation processes of the four antibiotics followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Antibiotics adsorption onto the nanocomposite surface depended on their electrostatic nature and played an important role when decreasing the initial concentration of antibiotics. In this context, kinetic rates were higher at lower initial levels of organic pollutants, which is a favourable effect from a practical application perspective. On the other hand, a synergistic effect of the available Fe in the nanocomposite was found, contributing to the oxidation of antibiotics by photo-Fenton as a secondary reaction. Then, a magnetic photocatalytic reactor was operated under optimal conditions. The enhanced photonic efficiency of Fe3O4/ZnO in the system, as well as the ease of the magnetic separation and catalyst reusability, indicate the viability of this reactor configuration.

AB Purpose Long-term microscale field experiments established at four sites in the Czech Republic (since 1996) were used for an assessment of the severity of the wide-scale contamination of treated soils by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as a result of the long-term regular pollutant load via sewage sludge and farmyard manure applications and for an estimation of the potential environmental risk caused by long-term pollutant inputs to agricultural soils.
   Material and methods The experimental plots were treated as follows: (i) NPK mineral fertilization (NPK); (ii) sewage sludge (SS1); (iii) sewage sludge applied at three times the rate compared to SS1 (SS2); (iv) farmyard manure (FYM); and (v) untreated control. Except for antibiotics, which showed results for all analyses below the detection limit, all groups of the analyzed compounds showed measurable contents in the treated soils.
   Results and discussion Among the POPs, the levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were detected at two locations at levels exceeding the Czech preventive values for their contents in agricultural soils (7.5 mu g/kg for dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane family, 20 mu g/kg for hexachlorbenzene, and 10 mu g/kg for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane), regardless of the treatment. Similarly, elevated contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were occasionally observed without any substantial relationship to the fertilizer application scenario. Thus, these contaminants are connected with atmospheric deposition in the given areas (PAHs) and their long-term stability (OCPs) even several decades after their ban; the role of the fertilizer composition was negligible.
   Conclusions The levels of per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances, brominated flame retardants, and synthetic musk compounds tended to increase in the sewage sludge-treated plots, indicating that sewage sludge can contribute to the abundance of these compounds in soil, although the contaminant levels determined do not represent a direct environmental risk. The levels of these contaminants in sewage sludge and sludge-treated soils should be regularly monitored in further research.

AB Endangering of the aquatic organisms and humans health by entrance of the pharmaceuticals in hydrosphere is becoming an important growing problem in the world. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered one of the main disposal pathways and incoming load of different pharmaceuticals in hydrosphere. In the present work, a new carrier-mediated hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (CM-HFLPME) based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) was combined with HPLC-UV and applied for determination of ethinylestradiol (EE) and raloxifene (RLX) in pharmaceutical wastewater samples. The target analytes were extracted from 17mL of the basic solution with pH 11 into an organic phase, as the supported liquid membrane (SLM) impregnated in the pores of a hollow fiber, and then back-extracted into the acceptor phase locating into the lumen of the hollow fiber. SLM consisted of n-octanol containing N,N,N-cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), as the carrier, and the acceptor phase contained a mixture of DES and HCl. The important factors including sample pH, extraction time, HCl concentration and CTAB amount were optimized using a central composite design (CCD). Under the optimized conditions, preconcentration factors of RLX and EE were found to be 86 and 53, respectively. The limits of detections (LODs), based on 3S/N, were found to be 5.0ng/mL for RLX and 10ng/mL for EE, respectively. The calibration curves of RLX and EE were linear within the ranges of 20-5000ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9980) and 30-5000ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9985), respectively. Relative standard deviation (RSD%) of RLX and EE, based on three replicates at the concentration of 100ng/mL, was calculated 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method was successfully confirmed by extraction and determination of RLX and EE in pharmaceutical wastewaters.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation is an attractive advanced oxidation process for wastewater treatment, but highly active catalysts with strong response to visible light are urgently needed to push forward its practical application. In this study, a hierarchical biomimetic monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with leaves morphology was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and employed as catalyst for oxalic acid and penicillin degradation in photocatalytic ozonation. The results show that the organics degradation was more efficient using leaves shaped BiVO4 as catalyst than the bulk shaped one in photocatalytic ozonation and the synergy index is ranged from 2.8 to 3.3, indicating a superior positive synergistic effect between photocatalysis and ozonation. The higher activity of the leaves shaped BiVO4 was probably attributed to the distinctive biomimetic morphology and preferable band structure with more negative CB potential. Mechanism studies suggested that the main reactive species were h(+) and center dot OH for the degradation of persistent oxalic acid in photocatalytic ozonation. In addition, the effect of ozone concentration and inorganic ions and reusability of the material were also intensively investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study focused on 11-nor-9carboxy-Delta 9-THC (THC-COOH) and Benzoylecgonine (BE), the most common metabolites of cannabis and cocaine, respectively, present in the domestic sewage entering the wastewater treatment plants. The aims of the study were: (1) to validate the analytical method of detection in wastewater and sludge; (2) to determine contribution of biodegradation and other processes to the removal in the biological reactor of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the response of biomass to different drug concentrations. The Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry method showed to be repeatable and reliable (recovery>75%; repeatability<10-15%; bias uncertainty<10) for measurements in wastewater; the ultrasound assisted extraction (USE) demonstrated to be reliable as pre-treatment of activated sludge solid phase. Both drugs were fully removed from the liquid phase in the lab-scale biological reactor within 24 h. Biodegradation was the main BE removal mechanism, and the first order kinetic model provided the best fitting of the experimental data. THC-COOH was mainly removed due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation; adsorption was better described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm. Both drugs at the higher concentrations caused inhibition of nitrogen oxidation and carbon removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metformin has been widely used as an oral drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, its consumption can be influenced by many economic and social factors. In this study, we investigated the spatial consumption pattern of metformin in China through wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 21 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 19 cities of the northeast China. A method using solid-phase extraction combined with N-Methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) derivatization for GC-MS detection was applied for metformin analysis. In 21 days, metformin showed high stability in wastewater at 24 degrees C and -20 degrees C. The mean concentrations of metformin in all WWTPs ranged from 2.42 mu g L-1 to 53.6 mu g L-1 . The consumption of metformin was 0.66-15.6 mg d(-1) capita(-1) with the mean value of 5.54 +/- 4.28 mg d(-1) capita(-1) . The prevalence of metformin ranged from 0.09% to 2.10% with an average of 0.74%. Both the consumption and prevalence of metformin displays significant spatial variations in northeast China. A statistical correlation analysis indicated that the consumption of metformin increases with the decrease of per capita disposable income of urban residents. To further predict the use of metformin in China, we developed a regress model and depicted a consumption map. The annual consumption of urban residents in Chinese provinces range from 1085-63,828 kg yr(-1) with mean value of 25,347 kg yr(-1) , which would provide a certain reference value for public health care and diabetes control.

AB Ternary extractive distillation is a green and sustainable separation process for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing methanol/acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water azeotropes that achieves the recovery of the acetonitrile and methanol solvents. A novel sequential iterative optimization methodology is proposed and the isovolatility curves of systems at different pressures are analyzed in this work to investigate the effect of the operating pressure on the ternary extractive distillation process. Four optimization procedures with different conditions of pressure and limits for the use of cold utilities were carried out. The optimization results showed that the optimal pressures of the first column and the third column are related to the top vapor that can be condensed by chiller water and cooling water, respectively, and the pressure of the second column is related to the effect of preheating on the third column. The ternary extractive distillation process with optimal operating pressure shows 60.1% energy cost savings and 47.0% total annual cost savings compared with the optimal process operating at atmospheric pressure. The proposed optimization method has the advantages of automatic optimization with a smaller number of simulator runs, providing a new solution for the simulator-based process optimization. The investigation of the operating pressure effect provides additional insight for the design and optimization of ternary extractive distillation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) of Bogota-Colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound (375 kHz). The considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim and clindamycin); cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine. Due to limitation of the MWTP for the pollutants elimination, ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds. Interestingly, ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids, whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds. For the latter ones, an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established. Afterwards, the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions (sono-Fenton), ferrous ions plus light (sono-photo-Fenton) or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid (sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid). Additionally, to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems, individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant (valsartan) were performed. The complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation, following the order: sotto-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid > sono-photo-Fenton similar to sono-Fenton > sonochemistry. The Fe2+ addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk. Meanwhile, oxalic acid avoided Fe3+ precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle. Thus, the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real-world wastewater matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current literature about pharmaceutical and personal care compounds (PPCPs) focuses on identifying their concentration and toxicological risk both in surface water and in wastewater. However, the influence of urban areas (population ageing, income level, hospitals and others) has not yet been analysed. Knowing how a population (and its facilities) affects PPCPs' presence in wastewater is important to identify the conditions that are responsible for their presence. In this work, the influence of water consumption, population ageing, income level, hospitals and nursing homes on the anti-inflammatory concentration have been analysed. To fill the gap between the quantitative data on PPCPs' concentration and the qualitative reasoning of the influence of urban areas on the anti-inflammatory concentration, the use of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is proposed. The fsQCA results are presented as recipes that show the different causal combinations of conditions that explain the presence of anti-inflammatories in wastewater. Using fsQCA for urban wastewater management with the aim of explaining the presence of anti-inflammatories in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a novelty in the literature. The results obtained here show the influence of water consumption (WATCON), hospitals (HOSP) and population ageing (POPAG) as the main conditions for the anti-inflammatory concentration in Valencian wastewater. Specifically, these conditions are present in all the recipes obtained with consistency of 99%. Through the results obtained, it would be possible to identify that HOSP are the main facilities that discharge anti-inflammatories into urban wastewater. Hence, the necessity of preventive measures to avoid the anti-inflammatory discharge into water bodies has been showed. Furthermore, under a methodological point of view, this work highlights the eligibility of fsQCA as a wastewater cycle management tool. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and pharmaceutical compounds (PhC) are xenobiotics present in many saline wastewaters. Although fungi are known for their ability to remove xenobiotics, the potential of halophilic fungi to degrade highly persistent pollutants was not yet investigated. The use of two halophilic fungi, Aspergillus sydowii and Aspergillus destruens, for the elimination of PAH and PhC at saline conditions was studied. In saline synthetic medium both fungi used benzo-alpha-pyrene and phenanthrene as sole carbon source and removed over 90% of both PAH, A. sydowii due to biodegradation and A. destruens to bioadsorption. They removed 100% of a mixture of fifteen PAH in saline biorefinery wastewater. Test using Cucumis sativus demonstrated that wastewater treated with the two fungi lowered considerably the phytotoxicity. This study is the first demonstration that ascomycetous halophilic fungi, in contrast to other fungi (and in particular basidiomycetes) can be used for mycotreatments under salinity conditions.

AB Phenolic derivatives are compounds used in the production of pesticides, pharmaceutical products and several other industrial applications. These compounds are discharged into freshwater from industrial effluents, domestic sewage, urban and agricultural run-offs which leads to pollution. Water at six sampling locations along the course of Buffalo River; namely Buffalo river estuary (BRE), Mdantsane (MSN), Zwelitsha (ZW), King William's Town (KWT), Izele Town (IZ) and Maden dam (MD) in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were evaluated for phenolic contamination using eleven phenolic derivatives of United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) priority pollutants. Samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction technique, derivatized with acetic anhydride and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The levels of the individual pollutants in the river water were higher in summer (< LOD to 12246 ng/L) than in autumn (< LOD to 713 ng/L). Their concentrations were found higher than the USEPA recommended limit (500 ng/L) in most of the sampling sites. The most prominent pollutant was 2-NP. However, the cancer risk assessment values and hazard quotient were below USEPA maximum limits of 10(-6) and 1, respectively. Conclusively, the concentrations of these organic pollutants could be a threat to public health and should be managed to be below the recommended limit though the present levels are unlikely to cause cancer to both human and wildlife.

AB Poor surface characteristics and mechanical strength have impeded the industrial utilization of starch based polymers for wastewater treatment. Though miniaturization of adsorbent materials to nano scale level, has improved the surface area of materials, nano-scale adsorbents often form stable colloidal suspension/emulsion, and thus pose separation challenges. This study was designed to develop a novel starch-based magnetic polyurethane polymer for removal of tetracycline antibiotics from water media. Magnetic starch was synthesized by in-situ co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the presence of starch, and thereafter subjected to one-step reticulation with 4,4-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate to produce magnetic starch polyurethane polymer nanocomposite (MSPP). The characterization studies with FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, BET, and XRF indicated successful synthesis. The characterization, adsorption isotherm and pH studies indicated pi-pi and pi-cation interaction as possible adsorption interactions. Besides optimization of desirable properties of MSPP, the RSM approach provided empirical evidence for the existence of the suggested adsorption interaction, as adsorption increased with increment in magnetite content and degree of crosslinking of the MSPP nanocomposite which were responsible for pi-cation and pi-pi interactions, respectively. The adsorption/desorption profile of MSPP indicated multiple potential applications beyond water treatment. Aside incorporation of magnetic separation, the regenerability, cheap, and sustainable nature of starch precursor confers a comparative cost advantage to the developed polymer. Considering its effectiveness in both simulated and real-time wastewater samples, MSPP holds great promise for commercialization of starch-based polymer adsorbents beyond decontamination applications.

AB This work evaluates the removal of five pharmaceuticals and personal care products, i.e., ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, triclosan and propylparaben, from urban wastewater under two novel algal-bacterial photobioreactor settings. The first configuration (phase A) consisted of an anoxic-aerobic photobioreactor operating at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 d at different concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) (90 mg L-1-200 mg L-1). In the second configuration (phase B) an anaerobic step was introduced before the anoxic tank to set a photosynthetic A(2)O process. In this phase, the HRT varied between 3 and 4 d and the TOC was kept constant at 200 mg L-1. In addition, the impact of external aeration in the aerobic photobioreactor was assessed. The maximum removals for ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, triclosan and propylparaben (94 +/- 1%, 52 +/- 43%, 98 +/- 2%, 100 +/- 0%, 100 +/- 0%, respectively) were recorded during phase B. In phase A, low TOC concentrations triggered higher ibuprofen and naproxen removals likely due to the high contribution of biological oxidation on their removal. In phase B, total or very high removal efficiencies were observed for ibuprofen, propylparaben and triclosan independently on the operating conditions. In contrast, the removal efficiency of naproxen and salicylic acid decreased when the HRT dropped from 4 to 3 d in the absence of external aeration, which suggests that biodegradation played a key role in their removal. In addition, sorption might have contributed to the elimination of triclosan and propylparaben from the wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Per capita loads of six UV filters were estimated in wastewater influent samples from 36 wastewater treatment plants in Australia collected over a weekend period during the 2016 Australian Census. Of the analysed samples, 99% contained at least one of the target compounds. Phenyl benzimidazole sulfonic acid (PBSA) was the most prevalent (99%), followed by benzophenone 4 (BP4) (97%), benzophenone 3 (BP3) (87%), benzophenone 1 (BP1) (84%), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) (22%) and isoamyl 4-methoxycinnamate (IMC) (1.5%). The highest concentrations were 3780 and 5070 ng L-1 for PBSA and BP4, respectively. Total per capita UV filter loads in influent across all plants were calculated using population data from the Australian Census and ranged from 0.21 to 3.4 mg day(-1) person(-1). Notably, a relationship was found between latitude and total per capita daily mass load of UV filters with an increase in mass load from southern to northern catchments. Compared to international studies, mass loads were generally similar with higher loads of BP4 found in Australia. This study provides insight into the occurrence of UV filters in influent wastewater from across Australia and provides the first comprehensive nationwide baseline of UV filter loads.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted, using a randomized block design, including twelve heavy metal (Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb) mixture treatments, with each metal participating in the treatment with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg, respectively. Common beet (Beta vulgaris L.) was chosen as test plant. The plants were irrigated with treated municipal wastewater taken from the Wastewater Treatment Plant of the town of Amaliada, N.W., Peloponnese, Greece. The experiment aimed at studying the interactions between heavy metals and macro-microelements, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The basic scope was to shed some light on the potential environmental implications, of these interactions on the soil PPCPs for a more effective monitoring of these emerging contaminants in the plants and soil continuum. It was found that the PPCPs have a very high potential interactive capacity, having interacted with all the studied metals, and metalloids, as well as with plant macro elements (P, and K). The uptake of PPCPs by plants was statistically significantly related with their respective content in the soil. The general inference is that the interactive relations between heavy metals, macro-, microelements, and emerging contaminants, being mainly antagonistic, which contribute to the decrease the uptake of soil PPCPs.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, little is known about their ecological effect on aquatic biota and ecosystems. Drug-induced behaviour changes could have a substantial impact on consumer-resource interactions influencing stability of the community and ecosystem. We combined laboratory experiments and functional response modelling to investigate effects of real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, as well as environmentally relevant concentrations of the antidepressants citalopram and opioid pain medication tramadol, on trophic interactions. Our biological system consisted of dragonfly Aeshna cyanea larvae as predator of common carp Cyprinus carpio fry. Exposure to WWTP effluent significantly increased A. cyanea maximum feeding rate, while those parameters in tramadol and citalopram-exposed larvae were significantly lower from unexposed control group. This suggested the potential of all tested pollutants to have an effect on consumer-resource equilibrium in aquatic ecosystems. While WWTP effluent strengthened interaction strength (IS) of consumer-resource interaction dynamics making the food web more vulnerable to fluctuation and destabilization, tramadol and citalopram could inhibit the potential oscillations of the consumer-resource system by weakening the IS. Similar studies to reveal the potential of pervasive pharmaceuticals to change of consumer-resource interactions dynamics are needed, especially when real WWTP effluent consisting of mixture of various pharmaceuticals displayed very different effect from single compounds tested.

AB In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were studied for their potentials as novel adsorbents for trace concentrations of phosphorus and aluminum in water and wastewater. Static adsorption results demonstrated that CNT and rGO employed in this study removed up to 65.6% of total dissolved Al and 98.9% of P from a natural surface water and a secondary wastewater effluent. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between CNT/rGO and oxyanions were hypothesized to contribute to the adsorption process. Accordingly, acetaminophen (AAP), a pharmaceutical compound known to form hydrogen bonding with CNT, was spiked into the real water as a competitor for P and Al adsorption. Subsequent sorption results showed that the presence of AAP reduced Al and P adsorption by CNT and rGO by 9.3%-18.4% and 11.2%-18.2%, respectively. These results suggest that hydrogen bonding interactions with CNT/rGO influenced the adsorption of P and Al species. In addition, pH effect investigation on Al/P removal further verified the above opinion. Overall, this study provided important evidence and insights into CNT/rGO adsorption of P and Al species from water and wastewater, which expanded our understanding on the ability of carbonaceous nanomaterials for advanced water and wastewater treatment.

AB Benzophenone-3 is an organic compound widely used as a UV filter, which has been reported as water pollutant and is connected with endocrine disruption in humans and animals. Expanded granular sludge beds (EGSB) are a form of an anaerobic digestion system, which has been successfully evaluated for wastewater treatment, and the removal of different compounds, however little is known about the effect of compounds as Benzophenone-3 in the performance of EGSB systems. In this study, we evaluate the effect of BP-3 on the performance, microbial structure and metabolism of EGSB reactors. For this purpose, biogas production, removal efficiencies of BP-3 and DQO were monitored. Changes in bacteria and archaea microbial structure were investigated using PCR-DGGE, and the effect on anaerobic metabolism was evaluated by measuring the expression of mcrA and ACAs genes through qRT-PCR. The systems remained stable and efficient throughout the operation stages, with CH4 percentages greater than 55% and COD and BP-3 removal percentages greater than 90%. The presence of different concentrations of Benzophenone-3 influenced the organization of microbial communities, especially archaea. However, this did not affect the stability and performance of the EGSB systems.

AB In-sewer stability of illicit drug biomarkers has been evaluated by several reactor-based studies, but less has been done in sewer pipes. Experiments conducted in sewer pipes have advantages over lab-scale reactors in providing more realistic biomarker stability due to the flow and biological dynamics. This study assessed the transportation and transformation of seven illicit drug biomarker compounds in a pilot-scale rising main and a gravity sewer pipe. Biomarkers presented diverse stability patterns in the pilot sewers, based on which a drug transformation model was calibrated. This model was subsequently validated using transformation data sets from the literature, aiming to demonstrate the predictability of the pilot-based transformation coefficients under varying sewer conditions. Furthermore, transformation coefficients for five investigated biomarkers were generated from four studies, and their prediction capabilities under the pilot-sewer conditions were jointly assessed using performance statistics. The transformation model was successful in simulating the in-sewer stability for most illicit drugs. However, further study is required to delineate the sources and pathways for those compounds with potential formations to be simulated in the transformation model. Overall, the transformation model calibrated using the pilot-sewer data is a credible tool for the application of wastewater-based epidemiology.

AB Pharmaceutical products and their byproducts which are present in wastewater and superficial water are becoming an environmental problem. A large effort has been made to introduce new and more efficient treatment processes for removing these emerging pollutants. Among them, activated carbon is currently being studied to be implemented in wastewater treatment plants. In the present study the equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption of carbamazepine (Cbz) and sildenafil citrate (Sil) onto powdered activated carbon are presented. Batch experiments were performed to assess the potential of this kind of activated carbon for removing these recalcitrant pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems. In addition, its adsorption efficiency was compared with the granular activated carbon. The isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson were applied. Pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models, as well as a combined model and an intraparticle diffusion model were assayed on the results obtained.
   Linear and non-linear analyses were carried out to compare the best fitting isotherms and kinetics. The Langmuir isotherm was a good fit for the adsorption of Sil, whereas the Redlich-Peterson isotherm described the adsorption of Cbz. The experimental results for both pharmaceuticals follow a kinetic of pseudo first order. Comparative studies preparing the solutions with distilled water, dechlorinated water and wastewater were performed. No significant differences were observed in these studies.
   When initial concentrations similar to those found in surface waters for both pharmaceuticals were evaluated, removal efficiencies greater than 85% were obtained. Therefore, the use of this kind of activated carbon seems to be an efficient tool for the removal of recalcitrant emerging pollutants, such as Sil and Cbz.

AB The increasing release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into water poses serious threats to human beings. In this study, a novel core-shell activated carbon (CSAC) material with a high-mechanical strength porous ceramic shell was synthesized and tested by adsorbing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from aqueous solutions. An activated carbon core (AC core) was synthesized from a mixture of powder AC (92%) and cassava waste splinters binder (8%). Moreover, a shell with a high thickness of 0.13 cm and compressive strength (2.92 MPa) was generated from the mixture of coal fly ash and clay at ratio of 60:40. It demonstrated high protection of the AC core. The adsorption efficiency of SMX by CSAC attained 99.0% and 97.9% at initial concentrations of 5 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. Furthermore, 77.0, 68.6 and 60.4% of SMX were adsorbed at higher concentrations of 30, 50, and 100 mg L-1, respectively. The kinetics study demonstrated that the adsorption of SMX followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Moreover, the sorption isotherm was better fitted to Freundlich isotherms. Finally, SMX adsorption on CSAC simultaneously depended on the pore texture of CSAC and the hydrophobic properties of SMX, as well as the pi-pi bonds and electrostatic interactions between them.

AB The occurrence of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) at detectable levels in wastewater and surface waters led to a growing concern over the persistence of toxicological effects in the environment. Sorption is significant process in municipal wastewater treatment plants to remove TOrCs due to low water solubility and high hydrophobic of most TOrCs. The work herein explored the sorption behavior of four typical TOrCs onto sludge solids. The sorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. Greater sorption amount was observed for EE2 that 60.9% of EE2 in liquid phase was removed, followed by BPA (49.4%) and SMX (35.8%), while only 19.5% of CBZ was adsorbed. Sorption of CBZ, BPA and EE2 was primarily a physical process dominated by partition function, while SMX was mainly sorbed through multiple interactions, and this strong affinity between SMX and activated sludge resulted in least desorption rate. Deep insight into the pathway of SMX in SBA revealed that total removal rate in a period was about 50.22%. Sorption process was observed in anaerobic stage, and biological degradation was mainly occurred in aerobic stage with biodegradation rate of 29.18%.

AB Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated with Ni-Co alloy nanoparticles (NiCo@NCNTs) were readily synthesized by annealing Ni/Co salts with dicyandiamide. The magnetic nanocarbons were assembled as a flat membrane for heterogeneous degradation of organic toxins. The synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and metal alloy encapsulation significantly enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of NCNTs in catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for purification of an emerging pollutant, ibuprofen. The hybrid catalyst yielded a fast reaction rate of 0.31 min(-1), which was 23.4 and 5.8 times higher than that of pristine CNTs and monometallic (Ni or Co) encased CNTs, respectively. The robust membrane catalysis was further confirmed by degrading other organic aqueous pollutants, such as naproxen, sulfachloropyridazine, phenol, methylene blue, and methyl orange. Mechanistic investigation was performed using electron paramagnetic resonance and competitive radical screening tests, which indicated that radical (center dot OH and SO4 center dot-) oxidation and nonradical pathway co-existed and played critical roles for catalytic degradation. The study provides a novel advanced oxidation system with catalytic membrane for wastewater remediation.

AB UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been widely explored to remove organic contaminants from water streams. In this lab-scale study, the removal of 17 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) by UV/H2O2, UV/ PDS and UV/Chlorine was investigated at equimolar radical promoter concentrations in municipal wastewater. Direct comparison of the UV-AOPs was conducted with eight TOrCs being resistant to direct oxidation by H2O2, PDS and chlorine and revealed a general oxidation performance following the order of UV/Chlorine > UV/ H2O2 approximate to UV/PDS while UV/PDS and UV/Chlorine exhibited higher compound selectivity than UV/H2O2. However, although oxidation performance of UV/Chlorine is outstanding in comparison of the three UV-AOPs, it has to be noted that oxidation by-product (OBP) formation potential might be substantially higher during both UV/PDS and UV/Chlorine compared to UV/H2O2 which was not investigated in this study. Evaluating potential optical surrogates to predict trace organic chemical (TOrCs) removal in UV-AOPs, nine parameters were selected representing chromophore and fluorophore features of DOM including components derived by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation-emission matrices. UV absorbance (UVA), total fluorescence (TF) and the selected fluorescence peak P_IV revealed highest linear correlation coefficients and were therefore identified as surrogates representing underlying mechanistic reactions of each UV-AOP. As none of the surrogates directly reacted with UV irradiation, slopes of surrogate-indicator correlations for photo-susceptible TOrCs decreased towards higher oxidant dosages. Correlations for these compounds should therefore only be determined for a limited range of oxidant dosage.

AB Porous polymeric membranes are widely used in potable water purification, wastewater treatment, the food and the pharmaceutical industries, and haemodialysis. However, producing specialized membranes with diverse transport properties is challenging. A method for fabricating membranes with controllable transport properties is described here by stepwise synthesis of aromatic oligoamide on a porous polymeric support. The use of aromatic oligoamide affords good water permeance due to its hydrophilic character. Alternate couplings of trimesoyl chloride and meta-phenylenediamine yielded an oligoamide dendrimer that was covalently bonded to the support. The water permeance and molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the synthesized membranes were controlled (with values of 4.6 to 543 L.m(-2) h(-1).bar(-1) and 22.6 to 332 kDa, respectively) by adjusting the number of oligoamide synthesis cycles in the range of 2.5-20.5. The oligoamide membrane with 5.5 synthetic cycles showed a high rejection of the negatively charged rose bengal dye (95% rejection) with high flux (126.4 +/- 4.2L.m(-2) h(-1) at 5.2 bar), as compared with other membranes reported in the literature. The fabricated membranes are potentially highly useful for the separation of macromolecules with specific ranges of molecular weight, for industrial separations that require membranes with tunable MWCO ranges, or for the separation of charged macromolecules.

AB To date, little is known about the removal of fluoroquinolones (FQs) in the in-situ sludge ozone-reduction (SOR) process. Hence, this study investigated the behavior of five commonly used FQs, including ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin in the SOR process. Batch experiments indicated that ozonation could effectively eliminate the target FQs present in the sludge, which was accelerated by increasing the initial pH (5.0-9.5). Continuous operation of an anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process coupled with sludge ozonation and phosphorus recovery showed that the SOR process could achieve zero yield of excess sludge. In addition, chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen species were stably removed, with efficiencies comparable to those obtained in the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. However, an increase in the effluent total phosphorus concentration was observed in the SOR process. The effluent FQ concentrations in the SOR process remained quite stable and were close to those in the CAS process, whereas the FQ concentrations in the sludge decreased remarkably after ozonation. Mass balance analysis revealed that the FQs were released to the environment mainly through excess sludge disposal (69.9 +/- 2.3%) in the CAS process, whereas were degraded mainly by ozone in the SOR process (75.8 +/- 2.0%). Therefore, the SOR process was able to minimize the excess sludge and the release of FQs to the environment simultaneously.

AB The emerging organic micro-pollutants, such as bisphenol A (BPA), chloroxylenol (PCMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ), have raised concerns owing to their adverse impact on human health and ecological security. In this study, a novel cyclodextrin polymer (beta-CDP) has been successfully prepared by nucleophilic substitution of beta-cyclodextrin with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFP). The removal of three emerging organic micro-pollutants (BPA, CBZ and PCMX) by beta-CDP under a single or mixture adsorption system was examined, and the adsorption behavior was investigated by adsorption kinetics and isotherm study. The maximum adsorption capacity of beta-CDP for BPA, PCMX and CBZ according to Langmuir isotherm in single system was 164.4, 144.1 and 136.4 mg/g, respectively. Compared with single system, the competitive adsorption of each pollutant on beta-CDP in mixture system was only slightly inhibited. Changing the pH, raising the presence of fulvic acid (FA) or ionic strength had no significant influence on the adsorption of BPA, PCMX and CBZ onto beta-CDP. The removal of these three organic micro-pollutants was related to the value of logK(ow) of the contaminants. These results demonstrated remarkable advantages of beta-CDP material relevant to organic micro-pollutants removal in wastewater treatment.

AB The residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products are the cause of increasing concern around the world. The aim of this study was to carry out the quantification of six antipsychotic drugs in hospital wastewater with the aid of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and, subsequently, make a preliminary assessment of the environmental risk posed. Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and solid phase extraction were optimized by multivariate design and validated in compliance with international guidelines. The extraction procedures were successfully applied to the quantification of the six selected antipsychotics in samples that were formed each day and collected at two main sampling points of the sewage network over the period of a week, in December 2017. Olanzapine (0.31-0.52 mu g L-1), clozapine (0.56-0.97 mu g L-1), haloperidol (1.43-2.73 mu g L-1), risperidone (0.92-0.98 mu g L-1) and chlorpromazine (0.52 mu g L-1) were found in at least one sampling point. In the case of most analytes, the highest concentrations were determined at sampling point A, which are derived from the psychiatric wing. The environmental risk quotient for clozapine, chlorpromazine and risperidone was >600, a very high-risk index, which signals the need for a better control of the emission of antipsychotics and an improvement of the wastewater treatment, especially, with regard to wastewater discharged from the hospital psychiatric wing.

AB Eight recently isolated microalgal species from Northern Sweden and the culture collection strain Scenedesmus obliquus RISE (UTEX 417) were tested for their ability to remove 19 pharmaceuticals from growth medium upon cultivation in short light path, flat panel photobioreactors. While the growth of one algal species, Chlorella sorokiniana B1-1, was completely inhibited by the addition of pharmaceuticals, and the one of Scenedesmus sp. B2-2 was strongly inhibited, the other algal strains grew well and produced biomass.
   In general, lipophilic compounds were removed highly efficient from the culture medium by the microalgae ( > 70% in average within 2 days). The most lipophilic compounds Biperiden, Trihexyphenidyl, Clomipramine and Amitriptyline significantly accumulated in the biomass of most algal species, with a positive correlation between accumulation and their total biomass content. More persistent in the growth medium were hydrophilic compounds like Caffeine, Fluconazole, Trimetoprim, Codeine, Carbamazepin, Oxazepam and Tramadol, which were detected in amounts of above 60% in average after algal treatment.
   While Coelastrella sp. 3-4 and Coelastrum astroideum RW10 were most efficient to accumulate certain compounds in their biomass, two algae species, Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 and Chlorella saccharophila RNY, were not only highly efficient in removing all 19 pharmaceuticals from the growth medium within 12 days, at the same time only small amounts of these compounds accumulated in their biomass allowing its further use. Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 was able to remove most compounds within 6 days of growth, while Chlorella saccharophila RNY needed 8-10 days."Wild" Nordic microalgae therefore are able to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients, equally or more efficient than the investigated culture collection strain, thereby demonstrating their possible use in sustainable wastewater reclamation in Nordic conditions.

AB Loratadine and desloratadine are second-generation antihistaminic drugs. Because of human administration, they are continuously released via excreta into wastewater treatment plants and occur in surface waters as residues and transformation products (TPs).
   Loratadine and desloratadine residues have been found at very low concentrations (ng/L) in the aquatic environment but their toxic effects are still not well known. Both drugs are light-sensitive even under environmentally simulated conditions and some of the photoproducts have been isolated and characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute and chronic ecotoxicity of loratadine, desloratadine and their light-induced transformation products in organisms of the aquatic trophic chain. Bioassays were performed in the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and in two crustaceans, Thamnocephalus platyurus and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Loratadine exerted its acute and chronic toxicity especially on Ceriodaphnia dubia (LC50: 600 mu g/L, EC50: 28.14 mu g/L) while desloratadine showed similar acute toxicity among the organisms tested and it was the most chronically effective compound in Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Generally, transformation products were less active in both acute and chronic assays.

AB We investigated the occurrence of three pharmaceutical residues in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from northern Tunisia. The selected compounds were carbamazepine, naproxen, and ibuprofen; they are among the most commonly prescribed and widely used pharmaceutical agents worldwide. Samples (200 mL) were pre-concentrated using the solid phase extraction (SPE) enrichment procedure and the analysis of the pharmaceuticals was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV). The overall procedure provided limits of detection (LOD) lower than 0.5 mu g.L(-1)and recoveries of 78-97%. For the carbamazepine compound, the mean concentrations were 60.58, 93.19, and 132 mu g.L-1 for the Bizerte, Jendouba, and Tunis WWTPs, respectively. This pharmaceutical was not detected in the Beja WWTPs. Naproxen and ibuprofens were not detected in the Jendouba WWTP but were found in the three other WWTPs with concentrations ranging from 2.94 to 36.17 mu g.L-1 and from 8.02 to 43.22 mu g.L-1, respectively. From the obtained data, it seems that these WWTPs are not able to eliminate this kind of micro-pollutants.

AB By using an innovative, positive pressure sample loading technique in combination with an in-line filter of finely ground sand the bottleneck of solid phase extraction (SPE) can be reduced. Recently published work by us has shown the proof of concept of the technique. In this work, emphasis is put on the SPE flow rate and method validation for 26 compounds of emerging environmental concern, mainly from the 1st and 2nd EU Watch List, with various physicochemical properties. The mean absolute recoveries in % and relative standard deviations (RSD) in % for the investigated compounds from spiked pure water samples at the three investigated flow rates of 10, 20, and 40 mL/min were 63.2% (3.2%), 66.9% (3.3%), and 69.0% (4.0%), respectively. All three flow rates produced highly repeatable results, and this allowed a flow rate increase of up to 40 mL/min for a 200 mg, 6 mL, reversed phase SPE cartridge without compromising the recoveries. This figure is more than four times the maximum flow rate recommended by manufacturers. It was indicated that some compounds, especially pronounced for the investigated macrolide molecules, might suffer when long contact times with the sample glass bottle occurs. A reduced contact time somewhat decreases this complication. A very good repeatability also held true for experiments on both spiked matrix-rich pond water (high and low concentrations) and recipient waters (river and wastewater) applying 40 mL/min. This work has shown that, for a large number of compounds of widely differing physicochemical properties, there is a generous flow rate window from 10 to 40 mL/min where sample loading can be conducted. A sample volume of 0.5 L, which at the recommended maximum flow rate speed of 10 mL/min, would previously take 50 min, can now be processed in 12 min using a flow rate of 40 mL/min. This saves 38 min per processed sample. This low-cost technology allows the sample to be transferred to the SPE-column, closer to the sample location and by the person taking the sample. This further means that only the sample cartridge would need to be sent to the laboratory, instead of the whole water sample, like today's procedure.

AB Steroid hormones and biocides are regarded as emerging contaminants in rural wastewater in China, owing to their widespread occurrence and adverse effects on both aquatic organisms and humans. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an alternative technology for cost-effective and efficient decentralized rural sewage treatment. In this study, an integrated constructed wetland (ICW) system was built and used to treat a typical rural wastewater mixture composed of domestic sewage and livestock wastewater from a small village. As expected, five steroid hormones (ADD, AED, 19-NTD, T, and P) and four biocides (DEET, TCS, CBD, and MP) were detected in the influent in concentrations ranging from 30.5 +/- 1.25 ng/L to 105 +/- 5.14 ng/L and from 63.4 +/- 2.85 ng/L to 515 +/- 19.7 ng/L, respectively. The ICW system effectively removed the detected steroid hormones (97.4 +/- 0.09%) and biocides (92.4 +/- 0.54%). Based on the measured concentrations, the total pollution loadings of the detected steroid hormones and biocides in the influent were calculated to be 2330 +/- 26.5 mu g/day and 5710 +/- 196 mu g/day, which decreased to 60.8 +/- 1.44 mu g/day and 433 +/- 25.6 mu g/day in the final effluent. The risk quotients for these steroid hormones and biocides in the effluent from the ICW system were lower than those from reported wastewater treatment plants, indicating that CWs are a promising technology for removing contaminants including steroid hormones and biocides in rural wastewater, although additional efforts are required to optimize and improve the design of CWs before the steroid hormones and biocides present in the effluent can be safely and directly discharged into the environment.

AB Hospital functioning generates a great quantity of contaminants, among which organic materials, heavy metals, and diverse pharmaceuticals are noteworthy that can affect organisms if they are not properly removed from the effluents. The hospital effluent evaluated in the present study came from IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) Clinic 221 in downtown Toluca, State of Mexico, a secondary care facility. The contaminants identified in hospitals have been associated with deleterious effects on aquatic organisms; however, it is necessary to continue with more studies in order to be able to regulate the production of said contaminants which are generally dumped into the city sewage system. The present study had the purpose of evaluating the alterations to embryonic development and teratogenic effects on oocytes Cyprinus carpio after exposure to different proportions of hospital effluent. For said purpose, the physicochemical properties of the effluent were determined. Concentrations of the main microcontaminants were also determined. An embryolethality study out and the determination of the main alterations to embryonic development and teratogenic effects produced, due to exposure of C. carpio at different proportions of the effluent, were carried out. The results showed that the physicochemical properties were within the values permitted by Mexican regulation; however, the presence of contaminants such as NaClO, metals, anti-biotics, anti-diabetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones and beta-blockers, was detected. Lethal concentration 50 was 5.65% and the effective concentration for malformations was 3.85%, with a teratogenic index of 1.46. The main teratogenic alterations were yolk deformation, scoliosis, modified chorda structure, tail malformation, fin deformity and mouth hyperplasia. A high rate of hatching delay was observed. The results suggest that the hospital effluent under study is capable of inducing embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in oocytes of C. carpio. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-Saharan urban centers have to tackle high population growth, lack of sanitation infrastructures and the need for good quality water resources. To characterize the impacts of anthropization on the water resources of the capital of Cameroon (Yaounde), a multi-disciplinary approach was used in ten sub-watersheds (peri-urban and urban) of the Mefou watershed. Pharmaceutical residues were used as tracers of surface and groundwater contamination caused by the release of domestic wastewater from pit latrines and landfills. A water use survey was conducted in the vicinity of the sampling sites to better assess water use, treatment and management. Available land use and hydro-geomorphological data completed characterization of the sub-watersheds. The combined data showed that natural features (elevation, slope, and hydrography) and human activities (land use) favor rainfall-runoff events and hence surface water contamination. Pharmaceutical monitoring revealed contamination of both surface and groundwater especially in the urban sub-watersheds. Analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-epileptic carbamazepine were the most frequently found compounds (in up to 91% of water samples) with concentrations of acetaminophen reaching 5660 ng/L. In urban sub-watersheds, 50% of the groundwater sites used for drinking water were contaminated by diclofenac (476-518 ng/L), carbamazepine (263-335 ng/L), ibuprofen (141-276 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (<2-1285 ng/L) and acetaminophen (110-111 ng/L), emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the interactions between surface and groundwater. The use of groundwater as drinking water by 68% of the total population surveyed raises concerns about population exposure and potential health risks. This case study highlights the need for strategies to limit contamination of the water resource given the predicted future expansion of Sub-Saharan urban centers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study focuses on the intensification of a photochemical UVC/H2O2 system using a mili-photoreactor (NETmix) for a better and faster elimination of oxytetracycline (OTC) from urban wastewater. This miliphoto-reactor comprises a network of small cylindrical chambers and prismatic transport channels sealed by a UVC transparent quartz slab allowing unique properties. Since light has a profound effect on the photochemical process, UVC photons distribution over the reaction medium was investigated using a multiple UVC lamp design (4, 6 or 11W) allocated in parallel or perpendicular to the solution movement. In addition, the effect of other operating variables, such as oxidant dosage (100-900 mg L-1), oxidant feed configuration (single entry or continuous multi-injection) and flow rate (50-100 L h(-1)) was studied. A kinetic model able to describe the OTC oxidation by the UVC/H2O2 photochemical system in the mili-photoreactor was also developed. Moreover, matrix effect was evaluated by spiking OTC in a secondary effluent from an urban WWTP. In this case, OTC degradation was inhibited in about 2 to 3 times due to the presence of organic/inorganic substances (soluble and particulate), inherent to the real matrix, that act as scavenger of oxidant species and as UVC light filter. The NETmix mili-photoreactor presented high photochemical space time yield (PSTY) values when compared with a conventional tubular photoreactor. This highlights the NETmix capacity to enhance UVC/H2O2 processes through an homogeneous light distribution over the entire reaction medium. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of diclofenac (DCF), trimethoprim (TMP), carbamazepine (CBZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by laccase from Trametes versicolor was investigated. Experiments were conducted using the pharmaceuticals individually, or as a mixture at different initial concentrations (1.25 and 5 mg/L each). The initial enzymatic activity of all the treated samples was around 430-460 U-(DMP)/L. The removal of the four selected pharmaceuticals tested individually was more effective than when tested in mixtures under the same conditions. For example, 5 mg DCF/L was completely removed to below its detection limit (1 mu g/L) within 8 h in the individual experiment vs. after 24 h when dosed as a mixture with the other pharmaceuticals. A similar trend was visible with other three pharmaceuticals, with 95 vs. 39%, 82 vs. 34% and 56 vs. 49% removal after 48 h with 5 mg/L of TMP, CBZ, and SMX tested individually or as mixtures, respectively. In addition, at the lower initial concentration (1.25 mg/L each), the removal efficiency of TMP, CBZ, and SMX in mixtures was lower than that obtained at the higher initial concentrations (5 mg/L each) during both the individual and combined treatments. Four enzymatic transformation products (TPs) were identified during the individual treatments of DCF and CBZ by T. versicolor. For TMP and SMX, no major TPs were observed under the experimental conditions used. The toxicity of the solution before and after enzymatic treatment of each pharmaceutical was also assessed and all treated effluent samples were verified to be non-toxic.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter surface waters via sewage treatment plants. In the environment, the substances and their transformation products, formed by the degradation of the parent compounds, can affect aquatic wildlife, including freshwater invertebrates. However, research on pharmaceutical-induced effects in wild freshwater organisms other than fish is still scarce. In our study, we investigated the impact of the highly consumed antidiabetic drug metformin and its main transformation product, guanylurea, on the health of a freshwater gastropod-the big ramshorn snail (Planorbarius corneus) by analysing its biochemical and cellular stress responses and apical parameters. The snails were exposed to different concentrations of the drug (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/L) and its transformation product (0, 0.1, 10, and 100 mg/L). The examined parameters were mortality, weight, tissue integrity of the hepatopancreas, and the levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides. Mortality and the levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides were not influenced by the two substances. In response to the highest concentrations of both chemicals, the weight of the snails was slightly but not significantly reduced. The histopathological investigation of the hepatopancreas revealed a significant effect of guanylurea at a concentration of 100 mg/L with an increased number of symptoms of cellular responses in the tissue (e.g., dilated lumen, disturbed compartmentation of the digestive cells, nucleus deformation, hyperplasia, and hypertrophy of crypt cells). For the parent compound, a similar trend was also observed for the highest concentration. Overall, the observed effects did not occur at environmentally relevant concentrations, but at concentrations which were 10,000 times higher than these. Thus, the results did not give rise to a major concern that metformin and guanylurea could pose a risk to the big ramshorn snail in the environment.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are continuously affected by anthropogenic pressure. One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.

AB Metformin has been treated for diabetes (type 2). Nowadays, this compound is frequently found in ambient water, influent/effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. To evaluate the metformin aquatic toxicity under a multi-generational exposure regimen, we exposed Oryzias latipes to metformin for two generations (133 d) and investigated its adverse effects. In the F0 generation, metformin significantly elevated gene expression for cytochrome P450 19a (CYP19a) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) in male fish; in female fish, the treatment decreased gene expression of vitellogenin (VTG2) and ER beta 1, suggesting endocrine disruption (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Intersex occurrence of F0 female fish were found in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no significant changes in fecundity and hatching rate were observed (p < 0.05). Metformin increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, and decreased the glutathione (GSH) content in F0 male fish compared with those of the control (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). In F0 female fish, metformin increased catalase activity compared with that of the control (p > 0.05). The results demonstrated that metformin leads to oxidative stress and two-generation endocrine disruption in O. latipes. These results may be useful for better understanding metformin toxicity mechanism.

AB The use of anaerobic biomass attached to a support has been recently presented as a good prospect in the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds, such as sulfamethazine (SMZ). SMZ has been found in swine wastewater and sewage treatment plants, which motivates assessing their degradation by new wastewater treatment technologies. Thus, this paper describes the use of a continuous fixed structured bed bioreactor for the purpose of evaluating SMZ removal kinetics present in lab-made wastewater. The analysis of SMZ used online solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (SPE online-LC-MS/MS). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also monitored to evaluate the organic matter removal. The bioreactor was operated under mesophilic conditions (30C), with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h. In order to evaluate SMZ removal, four different concentration levels were studied: 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng L-1. COD removal efficiency obtained for filtered effluent kept at 91.01% and there was no interference due to the increase of SMZ concentration. For SMZ, the removal efficiencies were of for 200 ng L-1 concentration level; for 400 ng L-1; for 600 ng L-1, and for 800 ng L-1. COD removal kinetics presented a first-order apparent removal rate constant () of h(-1). SMZ also showed a first-order apparent removal rate constant of h(-1) for the following concentrations levels: 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng L-1.

AB Direct potable reuse of wastewater is attractive as the demand for potable water increases. However, the presence of organic micropollutants in industrial and domestic wastewater is a major health and environmental concern. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are not designed to remove these compounds. Further many of these emerging pollutants are not regulated. Membrane bioreactor based biological wastewater treatment has recently become a preferred method for treating municipal and other industrial wastewaters. Here the removal of five selected micropollutants representing different classes of emerging micropollutants has been investigated using a membrane bioreactor. Acetaminophen, amoxicillin, atrazine, estrone, and triclosan were spiked into wastewaters obtained from a local wastewater treatment facility prior to introduction to the membrane bioreactor containing both anoxic and aerobic tanks. Removal of these compounds by adsorption and biological degradation was determined for both the anoxic and aerobic processes. The removal as a function of operating time was investigated. The results obtained here suggest that removal may be related to the chemical structure of the micropollutants.

AB Reuse of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is used to augment freshwater supplies globally. The Shenandoah River Watershed (U.SA.) was selected to conduct on-site exposure experiments to assess endocrine disrupting characteristics of different source waters. This investigation integrates WWTP wastewater reuse modeling, hydrological and chemical characterization, and in vivo endocrine disruption bioassessment to assess contaminant sources, exposure pathways, and biological effects. The percentage of accumulated WWTP effluent in each river reach (ACCWW%) was used to predict environmental concentrations for consumer product chemicals (boron), pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine), and steroidal estrogens (estrone, 17-beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol). Fish endocrine disruption was evaluated using vitellogenin induction in adult male or larval fathead minnows. Water samples were analyzed for >500 inorganic and organic constituents to characterize the complex contaminant mixtures. Municipal ACCWW% at drinking water treatment plant surface water intakes ranged from <0.01 to 2.0% under mean-annual streamflow and up to 4.5% under mean August streamflow. Measured and predicted environmental concentrations resulted in 17-beta-estradiol equivalency quotients ranging from 0.002 to 5.0 ng L-1 indicating low-to-moderate risk of fish endocrine disruption. Results from the fish exposure experiments showed low (0.5- to 3.2-fold) vitellogenin induction in adult males.

AB The aim of this investigation was to study the degradation of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in aqueous solution by heterogeneous photocatalysis (UV-C/TiO2). To perform the investigation, aqueous solutions containing the contaminant were exposed to UV radiation in the absence or presence of TiO2 in suspension or supported on a Fe-Cr metal alloy plate. TBP analyses before and after the treatment were performed by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) in order to quantify the contaminant degradation. The results showed that the TiO2 photocatalytic system was able to remove TBP from the solution and the formation of some by-products was observed. TiO2 photocatalytic systems were able to reduce acute toxicity in an Artemia Salina bioassay according to the increase in LC50 from 10.2 +/- 0.5%(v/v) to 16.9 +/- 0.6 %(v/v) for the immobilized system and to levels which were not possible to detect by the applied method any more for the suspension system.

AB Two green chemistry extraction systems, an in-house stainless-steel column Pressurized Hot Water Extraction system (PHWE) and a commercially available Espresso machine were applied for analysing 23 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in sewage sludge. Final analysis was performed on UPLC-MS/MS using two different chromatographic methods: acid and basic. When analysing all 23 APIs in sewage sludge both extraction methods showed good repeatability. The PHWE method allowed for a more complete extraction of APIs that were more tightly bound to the matrix, as exemplified by much higher concentrations of e.g., ketoconazole, citalopram and ciprofloxacin. In total, 19 out of 23 investigated APIs were quantified in sewage sludge, and with a few exceptions the PHWE method was more exhaustive. Mean absolute recoveries of 7 spiked labelled APIs were lower for the PHWE method than the Espresso method. Under acid chromatographic conditions mean recoveries were 16% and 24%, respectively, but increased to 24% and 37% under basic conditions. The difference between the PHWE method and the Espresso method might be interpreted as the Espresso method giving higher extraction efficiency; however, TIC scans of extracts revealed a much higher matrix co-extraction for the PHWE method. Attempts were made to correlate occurrence of compounds in sewage sludge with chemical properties of the 23 APIs and there are strong indications that both the number of aromatic rings and the presence of a positive charge is important for the sorption processes to sewage sludge.

AB Much of the current understanding of pharmaceutical pollution in the aquatic environment is based on research conducted in Europe, North America and other select high-income nations. One reason for this geographic disparity of data globally is the high cost and analytical intensity of the research, limiting accessibility to necessary equipment. To reduce the impact of such disparities, we present a novel method to support large-scale monitoring campaigns of pharmaceuticals at different geographical scales. The approach employs the use of a miniaturised sampling and shipping approach with a high throughput and fully validated direct-injection High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry method for the quantification of 61 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their metabolites in tap, surface, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and WWTP effluent water collected globally. A 7-day simulated shipping and sample stability assessment was undertaken demonstrating no significant degradation over the 1-3 days which is typical for global express shipping. Linearity (r(2)) was consistently 0.93 (median = 0.99 +/- 0.02), relative standard deviation of intra- and inter-day repeatability and precision was <20% for 75% and 68% of the determinations made at three concentrations, respectively, and recovery from Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry grade water, tap water, surface water and WWTP effluent were within an acceptable range of 60-130% for 87%, 76%, 77% and 63% of determination made at three concentrations respectively. Limits of detection and quantification were determined in all validated matrices and were consistently in the ng/L level needed for environmentally relevant API research. Independent validation of method results was obtained via an interlaboratory comparison of three surface-water samples and one WWTP effluent sample collected in North Liberty, Iowa (USA). Samples used for the interlaboratory validation were analysed at the University of York Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry (York, UK) and the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver (Colorado, USA). These results document the robustness of using this method on a global scale. Such application of this method would essentially eliminate the interlaboratory analytical variability typical of such large-scale datasets where multiple methods were used.

AB Struvite crystallization is an interesting method for the recovery of phosphorus (P) from wastewater. However, the struvite crystals obtained are small, which makes them difficult to separate from wastewater. A continuous reactor for enlarging struvite crystals was developed. Batch-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the optimum factors for the enlargement of struvite crystals. The results of pH experiments showed that P recovery efficiency increased with an increase of pH values (7.6 to 10), while the size of struvite crystals decreased. The results of the Mg:P ratios found that the maximum P recovery efficiency occurred at the maximum ratio of Mg:P. The sizes of struvite crystals were not significantly different. For the variation of temperature values, the results showed that P recovery efficiency and crystal sizes decreased when temperature values increased. Therefore, the optimized conditions for P recovery efficiency and enlargement of struvite crystals for the continuous reactor were pH 8.5 and an Mg: P ratio of 1.2:1 at 30 degrees C (room temperature). The treated swine wastewater and seawater were continuously fed in at the bottom of the reactor. After 30 days, the size of struvite crystals had increased from 125 mu m to 0.83 mm (seven times).

AB This study evaluated the reutilization of waste materials (scrap tires, sewage sludge, and wood chips) to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylenes/trichloroethylene/cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (BTEX/TCE/cis-DCE), plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and pharmaceutically active compound carbamazepine from artificially contaminated water. Different hybrid removal processes were developed: (1) 300mg/L BTEX+20mg/L TCE+10mg/L cis-DCE+tires+Pseudomonas sp.; (2) 250mg/L toluene+sewage sludge biochar+Pseudomonas sp.; (3) 100mg/L DEHP+tires+Acinetobacter sp.; and (4) 20mg/L carbamazepine+wood chips+Phanerochaete chrysosporium. For the hybrid process (1), the removal of xylenes, TCE, and cis-DCE was enhanced, resulted from the contribution of both physical adsorption and biological immobilization removal. The hybrid process (2) was also superior for the removal of DEHP and required a shorter time (2days) for the bioremoval. For the process (3), the biochar promoted the microbial immobilization on its surface and substantially enhanced/speed up the bioremoval of toluene. The fungal immobilization on wood chips in the hybrid process (4) also improved the carbamazepine removal considerably (removal efficiencies of 61.3 +/- 0.6%) compared to the suspended system without wood chips (removal efficiencies of 34.4 +/- 1.8%). These hybrid processes would not only be promising for the bioremediation of environmentally concerned contaminants but also reutilize waste materials as sorbents without any further treatment.

AB The generation of large volumes of waste by industrial processes has become an object of study because of the necessity to characterize the composition of residues in order to suggest appropriate treatments and to minimize adverse environmental impacts. We performed analyses of total fixed and volatile solids, moisture, and chemical oxygen demand (COD). We found high organic matter content. We also measured physicochemical characteristics, including corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Sewage sludge showed levels of chloride and sodium above the maximum allowed limits. These data suggest the potential for anaerobic digestion as a treatment option for sewage sludge and for its use as a biofertilizer.

AB In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distributions and risks of 15 non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water collected from Qinzhou Bay, China during the summer and winter of 2017. Our results showed that 14 out of the 15 target PPCPs were detected, and they had higher concentrations in the winter than the summer, except for N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide and indomethacin. Furthermore, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide and caffeine respectively were the dominant contaminants in the summer and winter, with their highest concentrations up to 33.7 ng/L and 26.8 ng/L. Generally, concentrations of PPCPs were higher in the inner bay than outer bays, with untreated sewage and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) as main pollution sources. The results of the risk assessment indicate that diclofenac may pose risks to aquatic organisms. Overall, our results provided occurrence and important insights into the risk management of PPCPs in Qinzhou Bay.

AB This study characterized changes in biomarker responses in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) upon exposure to effluent water discharged from a sewage treatment plant (STP) under real conditions. Fish were exposed to contamination in Cezarka pond, which receives all of its water input from the STP in the town of Vodnany, Czech Republic. Five sampling events were performed at day 0, 30, 90, 180, and 360 starting in April 2015. In total, 62 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were detected in the polar organic chemical integrative sampler. Compared to a control pond, the total concentration of PPCPs was 45, 16, 7, and 7 times higher in Cezarka pond at day 30, 90, 180, and 360, respectively. The result of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme biomarkers indicated alterations in the liver and intestine tissues of fish from Cezarka pond at day 30 and 360, respectively. High plasma vitellogenin levels were observed in both exposed females (180 and 360 days) and males (360 days) compared with their respective controls. However, only exposed female fish had higher vitellogenin mRNA expression than the control fish in these periods. Exposed female fish showed irregular structure of the ovary with scattered oocytes, which further developed to a vitellogenic stage at day 360. Low white blood cell levels were indicated in all exposed fish. Despite numerous alterations in exposed fish, favorable ecological conditions including high availability of food resulted in a better overall condition of the exposed fish after 1 year of exposure compared to the controls.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds like diclofenac (DFS), ibuprofen (IBP), and other drugs that persist in the environment are listed as emerging contaminants. These escape from normal wastewater treatment plants and find their way to water streams; therefore, alternate treatment processes are needed. Herein, a sorbent material is reported that is prepared through hydrotermal carbonization from dried fruit powder of Zizipus mauritiana L. (HTC-ZM) and applied for simultaneous removal of DFS and IBP. Carbonized material (HTC-ZM) was found as agglomerates of approximately 1 mu m particle size with surface area of 1160 m(2)/g having oxygen functional groups (e.g., COO, O, C=O) on surface. Simultaneous removal of IBP and DFS onto HTC-ZM was studied using response surface methodology with a set of 18 experiments using factors such as pH, amount of sorbent, contact time, and sorbate concentration. Maximum removal efficiency was obtained 88% and 97% for DFS and for IBP, respectively, with adsorption capacity of 2.03 mmol g(-1) for DFS and 2.54 mmol g(-1) for IBP. Kinetics modeling and "mean free energy" values predicted that sorption is mainly governed by physical interactions followed by "pore filling" mechanism for uptake of DFS and IBP.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical drugs has become a major environmental issue considering that these substances (or their metabolites) end up inevitably in sewage waters after excretion. In the wild, these chemicals may affect non-target organisms, and their potential toxicity is not sufficiently studied, a reality that is particularly true for marine organisms. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is known to be toxic in high dosages, namely, by triggering oxidative effects. These effects may be potentiated in marine organisms subjected to contamination resulting from large human settlements along coastal areas. In order to assess how different exposure regimes (acute vs. chronic) may affect aquatic wildlife, individuals of the gastropod species Phorcus lineatus were acutely (96 h) and chronically (28 days) exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of acetaminophen. The effects were evaluated through the quantification of selected biomarkers-catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and cholinesterase (ChE) activities. The results from acute exposure showed no significant effects in all three biomarkers, but chronically exposed organisms showed significant increases in the activities of CAT and ChEs. The data show that P. lineatus triggered a defensive biological response in the presence of acetaminophen, and also show that realistically low levels of acetaminophen can exert adaptive changes with unknown consequences.

AB Poor removal of many pharmaceuticals and personal care products in sewage treatment plants leads to their discharge into the receiving waters, where they may cause negative effects for aquatic environment and organisms. In this study, electrochemical removal process has been used as alternative method for removal of mefenamic acid (MEF). For our knowledge, removal of MEF using electrochemical process has not been reported yet. Effects of initial concentration of mefenamic acid, sodium chloride (NaCl), and applied voltage were evaluated for improvement of the efficiency of electrochemical treatment process and to understand how much electric energy was consumed in this process. Removal percentage (R%) was ranged between 44 and 97%, depending on the operating parameters except for 0.1 g NaCl which was 9.1%. Consumption energy was 0.224 Wh/mg after 50 min at 2 mg/L of mefenamic acid, 0.5 g NaCl, and 5 V. High consumption energy (0.433 Wh/mg) was observed using high applied voltage of 7 V. Investigation and elucidation of the transformation products were provided by Bruker software dataAnalysis using liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. Seven chlorinated and two non-chlorinated transformation products were investigated after 20 min of electrochemical treatment. However, all transformation products (TPs) were eliminated after 140 min. For the assessment of the toxicity, it was impacted by the formation of transformation products especially between 20 and 60 min then the inhibition percentage of E. coli bacteria was decreased after 80 min to be the lowest value.

AB In this study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was synthesized by (L)-ascorbic acid reduction, which was a relatively mild and environmental friendly reduction method, and the adsorption of organic contaminants was compared to graphene oxide (GO) to probe the potential adsorption mechanisms. The morphology properties of GO and RGO were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared transmission (FTIR), Raman spectrometer, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adsorption affinities of GO and RGO for phenanthrene and 1-naphthol were studied in batch experiments. The effects of pH and surfactants were also assessed. The results demonstrated that RGO reduced by (L)-ascorbic acid show significantly greater adsorption affinity for both phenanthrene and 1-naphthol than GO, and even greater than most of RGOs that reduced by the strong reductive reagents. This was mainly attributed to the hydrophobic interaction, pi-pi interaction, and H-bonding between graphene sheets and organic contaminants. Both GO and RGO showed stronger adsorption to phenanthrene than to 1-naphthol. The adsorption of 1-naphthol increased with decreasing pH and reached a maximum around pH = 7.34. The surfactants, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfaonate (SDBS) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), had negligible influence on adsorption to GO. Note that CTAB significantly inhibited the adsorption of phenanthrene/1-naphthol on RGO, which could be attributed to the pore blockage effect. In addition, RGO could be regenerated and reused with high recyclability over five cycles. The present study suggests that RGO obtained via (L)-ascorbic acid reduction can be deemed as a promising material for organic contaminated wastewater treatment.

AB A scale-up methodology was developed and verified that utilizes bench-scale biofilter results to simulate field-scale (pilot or full scale), flow-through biofilter performance. This methodology builds on recirculating batch reactor methods combined with single-pass flow-through methods at empty bed contact times (EBCTs) equivalent to the field scale. This method allows for control of variables that are often not controllable at the field-scale level, that is, influent primary and secondary substrate concentrations, temperature, and replication. The robustness of the method was verified using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal in one drinking water (DW) and two wastewater (WW) effluents and the removal of 12 trace organic contaminants in one WW effluent. The average absolute difference (delta) between bench- and pilot-scale results for 14 comparisons was 2% for DOC removal. Experimental DOC results were not impacted by the range of biofilter hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) with a WW effluent and a DW effluent, confirming that at Damkohler number II values less than 0.1, the biofilters were reaction rate limited with little contribution from mass transfer. This allows for the use of lower HLRs and shorter filter media depths at the bench scale to yield equivalent EBCTs of field scale. Utilizing bioacclimated media, this bench-scale methodology could expedite biofilter implementation in DW and water reuse treatment plants.

AB Wastewater containing pesticides released to water courses without any previous treatment produces an extremely negative impact into the environment, causing concern among the population and authorities. Imazalil (IMZ) is a post-harvest fungicide used on a myriad of fruit crops; it is classified as "likely to be carcinogenic in humans" and produce a negative impact on the biota. In this work we propose a coupled solar Fenton-Biological process in a pilot plant for the treatment of water containing the fungicide IMZ and organic coadjutants. Water solutions containing up to 500 mg/L IMZ, 500 mgC/L TOC and 1300-1400 mgO(2)/L COD were partially oxidized by Solar-Fenton process. For the first time, the efficiency of the treatment in the Buenos Aires area during different seasons was studied. In summer the treatment was faster but less efficient than in winter. Organic compounds were converted to organic acids like malic, formic and oxalic acids. The resultant solution was biodegraded using consortium adapted to IMZ oxidation byproducts without the incorporation of any extra carbon sources. As a result of the treatment TOC and COD were reduced to acceptable values for discharge in sewage, and its toxicity (determined by assays on Lactuca sativa L.) was significantly decreased. These results exemplified the advantages of combining advanced oxidation with the biological process for recalcitrant compounds degradation.

AB Permeability loss and the low retention efficiency of soluble organics significantly restrict the application of ultrafiltration (UF) for water reclamation. In this work, the tertiary treatment of secondary effluent using UF was investigated under a variety of transmembrane pressures (TMPs) (20-150 kPa) to obtain more insight into fouling by effluent organic matter (EfOM) and its impact on organic rejection, particularly for hydrophobic pharmaceuticals represented by carbamazepine and naproxen. The flux decline and the reversible fouling during secondary effluent filtration were substantially aggravated with increasing TMP, whereas the irreversible fouling was generally reduced, as attributed to restriction of EfOM adhesion to the membrane surface by the fouling layer. The fouling process was successively dominated by pore blocking and cake layer filtration, and the shift in the dominant mechanism was accelerated under higher TMPs. The rejection of EfOM was improved in the presence of a fouling layer, which acted as a secondary filtration medium, particularly at higher TMPs. The maximum rejection of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals by UF was observed in a moderate TMP range (40-60 kPa), probably due to a trade-off between increased fouling layer retention and reduced rejection due to increased wall shear and aggravated cake-enhanced concentration polarization with increasing TMP. The results would encourage the strategy of utilizing the fouling layer for irreversible-fouling restriction and better rejection of hydrophobic PhACs.

AB Novel wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are based on a partial nitritation-anammox (PN-anammox) process, enable higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery to produce biogas and lower treatment costs. In this study, rotating belt filters (RBFs) were examined in different configurations to identify the opportunities for RBFs to be included in novel WWTP configurations. RBFs enable recovery of 22-37% of the influent COD and removal of 34-56% of hydrophobic organic micropollutants (OMPs). However, the effluent was not suitable for treatment in a PN-anammox process due to its high COD. Chemically enhanced settling (CES) enabled these limitations to be overcome and caused an increase in OMP removal to 73-94%. However, a dose of 300 mg L-1 of ferric chloride was required to produce a suitable effluent for a PN-anammox reactor. The combination of RBFs and CES not only produced effluents suitable for treatment in PN-anammox units but also decreased the alkalinity consumption and the required chemical dose 3-fold to achieve comparable COD recovery and OMP removal. The methane yield of the combined sludges that were produced (184 L(N) CH4 per kg CODinfluent) was 75% higher than that obtained from a conventional wastewater treatment (105 L(N) CH4 per kg CODinfluent), and the electricity requirements decreased from 0.54 to 0.41 kWh m(-3) of treated wastewater. The energetic calculations showed that a WWTP incorporating this combined treatment could attain energy autarky with 29% lower operational costs than that of a conventional treatment (0.022 vs. 0.031 (sic) m(-3)) as long as a minimum alkalinity-to-ammonium ratio of 1-1.25 g IC to g NH4+-N was ensured in the effluent of the combined treatment.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical and hormone residues in water bodies is a matter of recent global concern. This study investigated the presence of such contaminants in two urban water bodies located in the city of Santa Maria, in southern Brazil. Two urban catchments, characterized by anthropogenic influences and poor household waste collection and treatment systems, were investigated. The Cancela-Tamandai catchment covers an area of 2.7 km(2), 50% of which is impervious soil, and is home to 14,300 inhabitants. The Joao Goulart catchment area covers 5.5 km(2), 40% of which is impervious soil, and houses 11,900 inhabitants. Ten sampling campaigns were conducted in each catchment. Samples were checked for diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, ethisterone, estrone, and megestrol acetate. Four of the hormones (17 beta-estradiol, estriol, estrone, and megestrol acetate) were not detected in either catchment. Ethisterone was detected in a single sampling campaign in Cancela-Tamandai. Ibuprofen and paracetamol were detected in several samples, while diclofenac was absent. The mean concentration of ibuprofen in the Joao Goulart catchment was 0.51 mu g L-1 and in the Cancela-Tamandai it was 1.26 mu g L-1. Mean paracetamol concentrations were 0.4 mu g L-1 in the Joao Goulart catchment and 3.0 mu g L-1 in the Cancela-Tamandai.

AB Four artificial composite soil treatment systems (ACSTs) fed with reclaimed water containing trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were constructed to investigate SMX and TMP biodegradation efficiency, ammonia and nitrite removal conditions and the microbial community within ACST layers. Results showed SMX and TMP removal rates could reach 80% and 95%, respectively, and removal rates of ammonia and nitrite could reach 80% and 90%, respectively, in ACSTs. The MiSeq sequencing results showed that microbial community structures of the ACSTs were similar. The dominant microbial community in the adsorption and biodegradation layers of the ACSTs contained Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Nitrospirae. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were considerably dominant in the ACST biodegradation layers. The entire experimental results indicated that Nitrosomonadaceae_uncultured, Nitrospira and Bacillus were associated with nitrification processes, while Bacillus and Lactococcus were associated with SMX and TMP removal processes. The findings suggest that ACSTs are appropriate for engineering applications.

AB Laccases were studied for their ability to remove two compounds, 2-chlorophenol and sulfamethoxazole, in batch studies, both in buffered solutions and in wastewater samples from different points in a municipal water resource recovery facility. Two enzymes with and without a mediator (acetosyringone) were investigated: a commercial product derived from Myceliphthora thermophile and a laboratory-generated enzyme mix derived from Tramates versicolor. The chlorophenol was removed rapidly by the commercial enzyme in the presence of acetosyringone, but the primary products were coupling complexes of the reactants. Excellent removal was achieved without acetosyringone by the natural enzyme mix. Sulfamethoxazole was poorly removed in all laboratory-generated chemically buffered solutions, but was very well removed, without the addition of mediators, in secondary effluent suspensions from a municipal water resource recovery facility. Mechanistic studies are still required, but the results suggest that treatment via direct addition of enzymes is feasible to remove recalcitrant compounds in municipal wastewater.

AB A systematic study of extraction of various organic pollutants from highly contaminated solid media (e.g., sludge) by applying a phase transition of a benign partially miscible solvent system composed of water/ethyl acetate/ethanol was conducted. This solvent system possesses an upper critical solution temperature of about 55 degrees C. The efficiency of the phase transition extraction (PTE) process is found to be higher and much faster compared to those obtained without phase transition (at ambient temperature). The influence of various operating conditions on the process efficiency was investigated. The performance of the phase transition extraction when applied on contaminated sludge is much better than the extraction with ethyl acetate only, although the latter is shown to be a very efficient solvent for extracting various organic contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals, persistent organic pollutants) from aqueous solutions. The efficiency of phase transition extraction from the aqueous solution was somewhat lower than that achieved with ethyl acetate, but it shows a clear advantage in the presence of detergents, as emulsion formation is prevented.

AB The continuous discharge of antibiotic pharmaceuticals from incomplete wastewater treatment processes into receiving water bodies has become a matter of both scientific and public concern as antibiotics may exert adverse influences on non-target organisms. In this study, the occurrence of seven most commonly prescribed antibiotics belonging to four therapeutic classes of beta-lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones were investigated in the effluent of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and two river waters: Firozabad Ditch (receiving effluent) and Kan River (not receiving effluent) in Tehran, Iran. In 2016, average consumption rate of target antibiotics in Tehran province was evaluated based on Anatomical Therapeutic chemical (ATC)/Deflned Daily Dose (DDD) system and reported as DDD/1000 inh/day. The highest consumption rate was for amoxicillin (128017.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/day), whereas it remained lower for other compounds (amoxicillin > cefixime > azithromycin > ciprofloxacin > cephalexin > erythromycin > penicillin). Ciprofloxacin (79.62 mg/1000 inh/d) and cephalexin (209.51 mg/inh/d) with highest mass loads were evaluated in the influent of WWTP A and WWTP B, respectively. Ciprofloxacin (24.87 mg/1000 inh/d) and cefixime (90.45 mg/1000 inh/d) were the highest evaluated mass loads in the effluent of Ekbatan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP A) and Tehran Southern wastewater treatment plant (WWTP B), respectively. The calculated risk quotients showed that six out of seven target antibiotics posed a high risk to algae (M. aeruginosa and P. subcapitata) and bacteria (P. putida) in the effluent of WWTPs and the rivers wherein amoxicillin and penicillin posed a higher risk than other antibiotics occurring due to their lowest PNEC.

AB The present endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater effluents due to incomplete removal during the treatment processes may cause potential ecological and human health risks. This study evaluated the removal and uptake of seven EDCs spiked in two types of wastewater effluent (i.e., ultrafiltration and ozonation) and effluent cultivated with the freshwater green alga Nannochloris sp. In ultrafiltration effluent cultivated with Nannochloris sp. for 7 days, the removal rate of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and salicylic acid (SAL) was 60%; but Nannochloris sp. did not promote the removal of other EDCs studied. The algal-mediated removal of E2, EE2, and SAL was attributed to photodegradation and biodegradation. Triclosan (TCS) underwent rapid photodegradation regardless of adding algae in the effluent with 63%-100% removal within 7 days. Triclosan was also found associated with algal cells immediately after adding algae, and thus the primary mechanisms involved were photodegradation and bioremoval (i.e., bioadsorption and bioaccumulation). After algal cultivation, TCS still has a bioaccumulation potential to pose high risks within the food web and the endocrine disrupting properties of the residual estrogens in the effluent are not eliminated. Algal cultivation can be exploited to treat wastewater effluents but the removal efficiencies of EDCs highly depend on chemical types. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transformation of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) during wastewater treatments results in the generation of transformation products (TPs), which can be more persistent than parent compounds. Due to reuse of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) for crop irrigation, OMCs and TPs are released in soils being capable to translocate to crops. Furthermore, OMCs are also susceptible to transformation once they reach the soil or crops. The recalcitrant antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) and some of its frequently reported TPs have been found in agricultural systems. However, there is no knowledge about the fate in reuse practices of multiple CBZ TPs that can be formed during wastewater treatment processes. For the first time, this work presents a study of the behavior of CBZ TPs generated after a conventional Ultraviolet-C (UVC) treatment in an agricultural environment. The UVC-treated water was used for the irrigation of lettuces grown under controlled conditions. The latter was compared to the fate of TPs generated in the peat and plant by irrigation with non-treated water containing CBZ. A suspect screening strategy was developed to identify the TPs using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of flight (LC-QTOF-MS). The results revealed the presence of 24 TPs, 22 in UVC-treated water, 11 in peat and 9 in lettuce leaves. 4 of the TPs identified in peat (iminostilbene, TP 271B, TP 285A-B): and 3 in leaves (10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine, TP 271A-B) were not previously reported in soils or edible parts of crops, respectively. Comparing the TPs found in peat and lettuces derived from both irrigation conditions, no significant differences regarding TPs formation or occurrence were observed. UVC treatment did not contribute to the formation of different TPs than those generated by transformation or metabolism of CBZ in peat or plant material. This research improves the current knowledge on the fate of CBZ TN in agricultural systems because of reuse practices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are introduced into agricultural fields by the application of manure or biosolids, or via irrigation using reclaimed wastewater. Antibiotics can enter the terrestrial food chains through plant uptake, which forms an alternative pathway for human exposure to antibiotics. However, previous studies mainly focused on detecting residues of the parent antibiotics, while ignoring the identification of antibiotics transformation products in plants. Here, we evaluated the uptake and metabolism of clarithromycin (CIA) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) in lettuce under controlled hydroponic conditions. The antibiotics and their metabolites were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QToF-MS/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatograph Micromass triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). The structure of CLA, SDZ and N-acetylated SDZ were confirmed with synthesized standards, verifying the reliability of the identification method. Eight metabolites of CIA and two metabolites of SDZ were detected in both the leaves and roots of lettuce. The metabolites of CLA included phases I and II transformation products, while only phase II metabolites of SDZ were observed in lettuce. The proportion of CLA metabolites was estimated to be greater than 70%, indicating that most of the CIA was metabolized in plant tissues. The proportion of SDZ metabolites was lower than 12% in the leaves and 10% in the roots. Some metabolites might have the ability to increase or acquire antibacterial activity. Therefore, in addition to the parent compounds, metabolites of antibiotics in edible vegetables are also worthy of study for risk assessment and to determine the consequences of long-term exposure.

AB Wastewater samples were collected from the main hospital's effluent (HWW), influents and effluents of the old wastewater treatment plant (OWWTP) built in 1990 and the new one (NWWTP) built in 2010 located in Doha, Qatar. Analytical methods were optimized to determine the concentrations of eight selected antibiotics (ABs): penicillin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and clavulanic acid. Samples were prepared through automated solid phase extraction (SPE) before analysis using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with positive ion electrospray. Among the eight target compounds tested, recoveries were obtained in the range of 47.5-98%. The highest concentration of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were detected in the HWW at levels of 5.46 mu g/L and 1.99 mu g/L, respectively. In effluents samples collected from both WWTPs, clavulanic acid was the most prominent compound at concentration of 84.74 mu g/L. The highest concentration of erythromycin (7.20 mu g/L) was detected in the influent sample collected from OWWTP. Amoxicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin were below the detection limit (0.1 mu g/L). There was a significant statistical correlation between the concentrations of most of the studied antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin, clavulanic acid, and metronidazole in all influent samples, whereas the concentration of erythromycin was highly correlated with those of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples. No significant difference (P >= 0.05) was found between concentrations of the targeted antibiotics in the NWWTP and OWWTP. Generally, both treatment plants showed effective removal rates (99.44%) of penicillin and metronidazole. However, clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from the effluent of either plant, even though the effluent passed through the ultrafiltration stage in the new WWTP. The findings reveal that HWW is not the only source of ABs in wastewater but direct disposal onto the sewer system could be the major source. The study calls for further investigation of additional pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants in the wastewater of Qatar as well as their metabolites and biodegradation products as well as application of advanced treatment technologies for highest removal rate and safe water reuse options.

AB The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has pose a huge threat to both human health and environmental ecosystem. However, little is known regarding the pool of ARGs in extracellular DNA (eDNA). In this study ten ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetW, tetX, ermA, ermB, bla(TEM), ampC, cat and cmr) and class I integron (intI1) in the sludge from hospital, pharmaceutical industry, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and swine manure, and sediment in urban lake in the form of both eDNA and intracellular DNA (iDNA) were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that every gram of sludge dry weight contained from 7.31 x 10(3) to 1.16 x 10(10) copies of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and from 1.04 x 10(5) to 2.74 x 10(12) copies of intracellular ARGs (iARGs). The sludge from hospital with the highest ratio of eARGs to total ARGs (11.02-89.63%), followed by the sediment from urban lake, implying that most of the ARGs in these regions were contributed by eARGs. The relative abundance of eARGs were higher than iARGs in sludge from WWTP and pharmaceutical industry, moreover, 1/3 and 5/9 detected eARGs were higher than the ARGs in the iDNA extracted from sludge of hospital and sediment from urban lake, respectively. Furthermore, the transforming ability of eARGs suggesting that adsorbed eARG is more preferentially coupled to the competent cells than free eARG. These findings highlight the need to focus attention on the contribution of eARGs to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance into environment, and also future needs in mitigating the spread of eARGs in the environment.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an emerging field that has mostly been applied to investigate consumption of illicit drugs. In this study, the wastewater-based epidemiology approach was employed to study consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and measure their prevalence of use in eight densely populated, urban areas of Beijing, China. Ammonium loads were used to estimate the population equivalents of each sewershed. These estimates were applied to calculate population-normalized antibiotic consumption and prevalence of use during flu season, when antibiotics are frequently misused as a medical treatment. Results indicated that 21.9 g d(-1) (10(4) people)(-1) of ten popular antibiotics were consumed across the eight sewersheds, indicating that 1.98% of the 12.5 million population equivalents used these antibiotics during the sampling period. A comparison of these results to calculations made using previously reported data from 2013 suggest that recent Chinese antibiotic control policies have been effective. Uncertainty analyses were conducted to identify the 95% confidence range for antibiotic prevalence of use as 1.44-3.61%. Human excretion factors were identified as the most sensitive variable. The wastewater-based epidemiology methods were also applied to a wider range of PPCPs, and the results indicated positive relationships between consumption and socioeconomic factors, such as housing price and population density. Overall, this work provides important public health information on antibiotic use and elucidates relationships between PPCP consumption and socioeconomic characteristics.

AB Urban estuaries receive large volumes of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment facilities containing numerous contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals residues. Water was sampled for 16 highly prescribed pharmaceuticals at 17 sites along the Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary located in the Northeastern U.S. Pharmaceutical concentrations were highest in western LIS, ranging from non-detect to 71 ng L-1 and declining steadily eastward, while river samples from four major tributaries ranged from non-detect to 83 ng L-1. Two tracers, sucralose and caffeine, accurately predicted pharmaceutical behavior in LIS while only sucralose was effective at the river sites. Sucralose also tracked well with the salinity gradient in LIS, exhibiting conservative behavior along the transect. Attenuation factors were determined for measurable pharmaceuticals and compared against sucralose to estimate the magnitude of decline in concentrations that may be attributable to in situ degradation and partitioning. The results demonstrate sucralose's effectiveness as a tracer of wastewater-borne contaminants under estuarine conditions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy medication has made antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) a significant pharmaceutical class in regions of high HIV infection rates. However, relatively little is known regarding the environmental occurrence of these emerging contaminants, and this is especially true for their metabolites. In this work, we report analytical methods to study the simultaneous occurrence of a range of common ARVDs and some of their known metabolites in surface water and wastewater. A novel direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method is reported for the analysis of ARVDs of different therapeutic classes and their selected metabolites in wastewater samples. In addition, a solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure was developed for pre-concentration of ARVs and metabolites from surface water samples. The respective methods proved suitable for the quantitative analysis of six parent ARVDs from three ARV classes, as well as three metabolites. Method validation showed average recoveries of 86% for the direct injection method, and 64% for the SPE method. With the exception of Zidovudine and the metabolites of Zidovudine and Ritonavir, all target ARVDs were detected in wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants in the Western Cape, South Africa. Higher concentrations were generally measured in influent compared to effluent samples, in the dry compared to the wet season as well as in chlorinated compared to uv-irradiated effluents. This study contributes for the first time quantitative data on the environmental occurrence of the known metabolites of Nevirapine (12-hydroxy-Nevirapine) and Efavirenz (8,14-dihydroxy-Efavirenz).

AB Presence of organic pollutants in the wastewater and aquatic environment is one of the serious concerns worldwide. Superior adsorption of organic pollutants on modified clays with organocations is well approved nowadays. Among hybrid materials, clay-polyelectrolyte nanocomposites (CPN) are one of the specifically designed materials for the efficient adsorption of diverse organic pollutants. Due to higher surface area of the clay mineral coupled with a polymer coating, they have an explicit affinity for the organic pollutants. In this background, we have developed statistically significant and mechanistically interpretable quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model for adsorption coefficient of diverse organic pollutants to the protonated montmorillonite poly-4-vinylpyridine-co-styrene (Mt-HPVPcoS), a hybrid CPN. Further, the model was employed to predict the logk(d) value of similar to 0.9 million chemicals from five diverse databases spanning from existing and experimental pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic chemicals and dyes with unknown logk(d) value for the mentioned CPN. The reliability of predicted data is checked with two layers confidence screening i.e. the applicability domain study followed by prediction quality check by 'Prediction Reliability Indicator'. Thus, prediction of each compound can be used for data gap filling by environmental regulatory authorities as well as industries. Followed by, maximum common substructure-based (MCS) algorithm is employed for individual database to extract the important structural scaffold for higher logk(d) to the mentioned CPN.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) effluents represent an important source of contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds and their human metabolites. To better evaluate dedicated treatment of hospital effluents for pollutant mitigation, not only the parent compounds should be considered but also the intermediates generated during treatment. The metabolite metoprolol acid (MTPA) has been found in urban wastewaters at higher concentration than its parent compound metoprolol (MTP), being more recalcitrant to biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate degradation, transformation and sorption of the beta-blocker MTP, and its recalcitrant metabolite MTPA, during water treatment based on the fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus. Fourteen intermediates were identified in MTP biotransformation while five of them also attributed to MTPA biodegradation and two to MTPA only. Their identification allowed their correlation in separate biotransformation pathways suggested. The highest degradation rate of metoprolol (up to 51%) and metoprolol acid (almost 77%) was found after 15-days treatment with Ganoderma lucidum, with an increase in toxicity up to 29% and 4%, respectively. This fungus was further selected for treating real HWW in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor (FBB). Treated wastewater and fungal biomass samples were used to evaluate the distribution of the target compounds and the intermediates identified between solid and liquid phases. While similar elimination capabilities were observed for the removal of metoprolol, and even higher for its persistent metabolite metoprolol acid, the extent on compound transformation diminished considerably compared with the study treating purified water: a high level of the persistent alpha-HMTP and TP240 were still present in effluent samples (15% and 6%, respectively), being both TPs present at high proportion (up to 28%) in fungal biomass. This is the first time that pharmaceutical TPs have been investigated in the fungal biomass. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biotransformation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants ultimately depends on the enzymatic activities developed in each biological process. However, few research efforts have been made to clarify and identify the role of enzymes on the removal of OMPs, which is an essential knowledge to determine the biotransformation potential of treatment technologies. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the enzymatic transformation of 35 OMPs under anaerobic conditions, which have been even less studied than aerobic systems. Initially, 13 OMPs were identified to be significantly biotransformed (>20%) by anaerobic sludge obtained from a full-scale anaerobic digester, predestining them as potential targets of anaerobic enzymes. Native enzymes were extracted from this anaerobic sludge to perform transformation assays with the OMPs. In addition, the effect of detergents to recover membrane enzymes, as well as the effects of cofactors and inhibitors to promote and suppress specific enzymatic activities were evaluated. In total, it was possible to recover enzymatic activities towards 10 out of these 13 target OMPs (acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and its transformation product sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, atenolol, clarithromycin, citalopram, climbazole, erythromycin, and terbutryn, venlafaxine) as well as towards 8 non-target OMPs (diclofenac, iopamidol, acyclovir, acesulfame, and 4 different hydroxylated metabolites of carbamazepine). Some enzymatic activities likely involved in the anaerobic biotransformation of these OMPs were identified. Thereby, this study is a starting point to unravel the still enigmatic biotransformation of OMPs in wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the potential of CWs to remove bacteria, including antibiotic resistant bacteria, and antibiotics from livestock (swine production) wastewater. Microcosms were assembled with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud and feed with wastewater spiked or not with 100 mu g/L of enrofloxacin or of ceftiofur, alone or as a mixture. Wastewater (spiked or not) was treated during twenty one-week cycles. Treated wastewater was collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20 to evaluate the removal of pollutants, including nutrients, organic matter, metals and added antibiotics, and total cultivable and antibiotic resistant bacteria (enterobacteria and enterococci), which were enumerated in plate culture media. After treatment, a significant reduction in pollutants load (up to 99% depending on the parameter) was observed regardless of the presence of the veterinary antibiotics. Antibiotics were also significantly removed (removal > 90%). High removal rates were achieved for enterobacteria and enterococci bacteria during the experimental period, in the presence or absence of antibiotics (mean removals between 86 and 100%). For antibiotic resistant bacteria initially present in the influent wastewater mean removals > 90% were obtained, and no significant effect of time or of antibiotic presence was observed. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to focus on the removal of enrofloxacin and ceftiofur resistance in faecal bioindicators in CWs fed with livestock wastewater. Results confirm CWs as a green alternative to reduce the risks associated with the release of livestock effluents into the environment.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of 33 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), five artificial sweeteners (ASs), and six pesticides in groundwater in rural agricultural and rural non-agricultural area in South Korea. A total of 31 target compounds (15 antibiotics, four anthelmintics, seven other PPCPs, four ASs, and one pesticide) were detected in agricultural groundwater at concentrations from not detected (ND) to 49.3 ng/L for PPCPs, ND to 1340 ng/L for ASs, and ND to 116 ng/L for pesticides. Four target compounds (two PPCPs and two ASs) were detected in rural non-agricultural groundwater in the range of 0.085-5.74 ng/L for PPCPs and 5.64-1330 ng/L for ASs. Among the target compounds, ASs, especially acesulfame (detection frequency 69% in rural agricultural areas and 100% in the rural non-agricultural area) were predominantly detected in both agricultural (mean: 32.9 ng/L) and non-agricultural (mean: 536 ng/L) groundwater, but different occurrence patterns were observed according to the sources of contamination. Knownmarkers of sewage leakagewere detected in both agricultural and non-agricultural groundwater samples (e.g., acesulfame (69% and 100%), caffeine (88% and 100%), and crotamiton (62% and 100%)), while compounds related to agricultural activities were only observed in agricultural groundwater (e.g., sulfathiazole (38%), sulfamethoxazole (31%), oxfendazole (69%), and carbofuran (42%)).

AB Drug consumption in individual cities, regions, and at various music events and festivals across the EU has generally been monitored via questionnaires, patients' medical data, and police reports. However, an overview of drug consumption obtained from these methods can be negatively affected by various subjective factors. We aimed to investigate an association between levels of target drugs in wastewater, music genres, and festival courses. The occurrence of illicit drugs, their metabolites, and psychoactive compounds was investigated in the influent of six wastewater treatment plants in the Czech and Slovak Republic during seven large-scale music festivals from different music genres: metal, rock, pop, country and folk, ethnic, multi-genre, dance, and trance. The total number of participants included N130,000 active festival attendees. The association between music genre and illicit drug and/or psychoactive pharmaceutical consumptions is discussed on the basis of the results obtained through wastewater analyses. The observed trend was similar to worldwide published data with a specific local phenomenon of methamphetamine prevalence that did not significantly change between music events. Increased specific loads of cocaine (measured as its metabolite benzoylecgonine) and Ecstasy, along with some cannabis, were mainly observed during pop/rock and dance music festivals. However, there was no significant increase observed in the specific loads of all monitored psychoactive pharmaceuticals. This study demonstrates that the abuse of some illicit drugs is closely associated with specific music preferences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, removal, mass loading, seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of nine psychiatric pharmaceuticals and four of their selected metabolites, were studied in one hospital and one urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ioannina city, in northwestern Greece, providing information about the efficiency of the plants and their contribution into the final receiver's flow. Samples were collected from the influents and the effluents of the plants in different sampling campaigns, from July to December 2016. Analytical methodology was based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, after solid-phase extraction through Oasis HLB cartridges. Concentrations in both WWTPs ranged between bLOQ and 1126.3 ng/L in the influents and between bLOQ and 1127.4 ng/L, in the effluents. Results indicated that venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine were the most frequently detected compounds in the influents and the effluents of both WWTPs. Metabolite to parent compound ratio ranged in the influents between 0.01 and 87.2 while in the effluents between 0.01 and 47.7. Based on mass loads in the influents, venlafaxine is consumed in high amounts (up to 67.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.), and consequently its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine (up to 139.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.). Similarly to the influents, environmental emissions, were also higher for venlafaxine and O-desmethyl venlafaxine (10.1 and 13.3 mg/d/1000 inhab., respectively). Removal efficiencies in the hospital WWTP ranged from -100% to 98.9%, while in the city WWTP from -49.9% to 99.8%. Furthermore, an important outcome was the evaluation of the potential ecotoxicological risk, by means of risk quotients (RQs), where none of the target psychiatrics or their metabolites showed RQ above 1.

AB This study investigated the performances of nanofiltration (NF-NF 90, NF 270, MPF34, DK and Duracid) and reverse osmosis (RO-BW30 and SG) as surface water treatments to reject pharmaceutical compounds at very low concentrations, on water permeability and on their desalting ability. The Doce river in Brazil was chosen as the background matrix for this study (geographical coordinates 18 degrees 51'50.45 '' S and 41 degrees 56'46.86 '' W), this river is a source of drinking water and used for sewage disposal without previous treatment. Five pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were detected recurrently and were investigated in this study: Betamethasone, Fluconazole, Phenylbutazone, Prednisone and Metformin. The results obtained suggest that NF may be the better option. The NF rejection efficiencies are very close to those achieved by RO membranes. Among the evaluated NF membranes, the DK membrane was selected as being the most suitable since it showed high desalting ability and PhAC rejection associated with high permeate flux, low fouling potential and specific energy consumption. The flux decline was dependent on the surface water composition but generally occurred due to concentration polarization. DK membrane showed high rejection of the charge of hydrophilic neutral PhAC evaluated, but limited rejection of Betamethasone, a more hydrophobic neutral compound. The rejection of this hydrophobic neutral compound was affected by water composition and membrane fouling.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) has great potential in removing trace organic micropollutants in wastewater, especially pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, little information is available on PPCPs rejections under complex feed water matrices, which better represent real wastewater treatment conditions. In this paper, the PPCPs rejection behaviors and the dominating mechanisms by NF membranes were studied under multi mixed influent matrices which contained various inorganic ions, humic acids and sodium alginate. The results showed that the DF30 membrane had the highest rejection of negatively charged indomethacin (95.4%) and diclofenac sodium (94.1%) in pure water. Our study also showed that electrostatic effect and steric hindrance were the primary rejection mechanisms of PPCPs by DF30 membrane in pure water. The predominant fouling of DF30 membrane could be explained by the complete blocking model in the filtration of mixed influent matrices containing both inorganic ions and organic matters. The components in membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent was beneficial to retention of positively and neutrally charged PPCPs, but had no significant effects on retention of negatively charged PPCPs. Risk quotients of the six target PPCPs in NF effluent were all lower than 0.1, likely indicating low risk to aquatic organisms. This work has potential implications for a deeper understanding of PPCPs rejections by NF in wastewater treatment.

AB A visible-light Z-scheme g-C3N4/Fe-0/TiO2 anodic catalyst was tested with cathodic WO3 in photocatalytic Fuel Cell (PFC) that efficiently degrades berberine chloride and simultaneously generate electricity at pH 2,5,7 and 13. The Stainless-steel mesh electrodes loaded with prepared catalyst were irradiated by visible-light in single chamber PFC. The highest removal of berberine Chloride, cell voltage, and power density were 91%, 0.8 V, and 16.4 W/m(2) at a current density of 2.02 mA/cm(2), respectively after 90 min irradiation in 0.05 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with 10 Omega external resistance. The impacts of pH and initial concentration of BEC on photocatalytic degradation and cell voltage were evaluated. The cell current density is enhanced while the photocatalyst activity increased. The constructed PFC maintained high-performance after 5 uses. Its use in degrading wide spectrum refractory pollutants and generate electricity is expected for the proved catalyst design, paired electrodes and high PFC performance for practical wastewater treatment.

AB Decomposition of the peroxydisulfate ion (S2O82-, PS) to sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) is a key step in sulfate radicalbased advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs). In this study, quantum chemical investigations and calculation of activation energy were performed to reveal the decomposition process of S2O82- at the atomic level. Furthermore, the impacts of several main co-existing components (CCs), including inorganic cations, inorganic anions and organic molecules in wastewater, on the activation energy were evaluated. The results revealed that 3 steps were involved in the S(2)O(8)(2-)decomposition: 1) the distance between two subgroups of the ground state of S2O82- (PSS0) increases from similar to 0.15 to similar to 0.215 nm driven by exogenous energy; 2) a transition occurs for S2O82- from PSS0 to the lowest triplet state (PST1); and 3) two subgroups of PST1 separate from each other spontaneously. The energy needed in the first step was demonstrated to be the activation energy. Moreover, two possible routes by which CCs affect the transition from PSS0 to PST1 were proposed. After ascertaining which route would be taken by different types of CCs, various methods of calculation were used to determine their impacts on S2O82- decomposition, i. e. promotion effect for H+, NH4+, Ca2+, Cl- and Br-, and inhibition effect for Na+, K+, Mg2+, NO3-, CO32-, SO42-, and all studied organic molecules, including acetic acid, benzene, bromoethane, 1-propanol and 4-chlorotoluene. The present study provided novel insights into the decomposition of S2O82- to SO4 center dot-, and emphasized the effects of main co-existing inorganic ions and organic molecules in wastewater on SR-AOPs.

AB In this study, photocatalysts made of Cu-TiO2@functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes were prepared via a newly developed two-step (sol-gel/hydrothermal) process for the catalytic decomposition of sulfamethazine under natural solar irradiation. The properties of the photocatalysts were studied using BET, PL, FT-IR, XRD, TEM, TGA, FESEM, EDS, Raman, DRS, EIS, EDX and SAED tests. The TEM and FESEM images revealed a uniform distribution of Cu-doped TiO2 particles on the surface of the SWCNTs. The EIS and PL analysis indicated that photo-induced electrons were trapped by the SWCNTs and/or Cu oxidation states, which reduced electron-hole recombination. Photodecontamination was performed in a batch reactor, and the investigation of influencing factors indicated that sulfamethazine could be completely degraded at a Cu content of 4%, SWCNT content of 10%, pH of 7, catalyst loading of 0.9 g/L, and initial sulfamethazine concentration of 30 mg/L after 135 min solar irradiation. Kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo first-order kinetic model best fit the degradation of sulfamethazine under selected conditions. Trapping experiments indicated that O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot reactive radicals, rather than h(+), were accountable for the decontamination process. The efficiency with which sulfamethazine was removed was evaluated in the presence of co-existing anions. The results revealed that the removal rate was considerably reduced by the addition of sulfate or chloride anions but only slightly reduced by the addition of phosphate or nitrate anions. A tentative mechanism and pathway for sulfamethazine degradation were formulated. The synthesized photocatalysts could be reused after five consecutive cycles of photodecontamination but with a slight reduction in removal rate (approximately 7%). An experiment involving pharmaceutical wastewater showed that photocatalytic decontamination eliminated 59.3% of TOC and 74.6% of COD after 390 min of solar irradiation.

AB A series of visible-light-driven direct Z-scheme CdS/CuInS2 nanoplates were fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method, and the molar ratio of CdS to CuInS2 was optimized. The highest visible-light photocatalytic degradation activity of Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction is about 4 times than that of pure CuInS2, which is due to the narrowest band gap, the largest BET surface area, the most efficient charge separation and transfer, and the synergistic effect between CdS and CuInS2. Meanwhile, Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction also exhibits excellent photocatalytic reduction activity with almost 100% of aqueous Cr (VI) reduction efficiency in absence of hole scavengers after 60 min. The special significance is that Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction shows excellent stability in five degradation cycles, and can effectively treat real pharmaceutical wastewater with 76.5% COD removal efficiency with aid of H2O2 in 13 h, indicating that Z-scheme CdS/CuInS2 has a promising prospect in real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The direct discharge of untreated wastewater has been identified as an important source of environmental contamination by active pharmaceutical ingredients and other 'down-the-drain' chemicals in developing countries. R necessitates the development of an environmental risk assessment approach for the resulting impact zone. This study was designed lo investigate the impact of low level of dilution (<10) on the natural attenuation processes of distribution and degradation within the impact zone. Dilution of the untreated wastewater resulted in increased desorption and corresponding environmental concentrations. The presence/absence of the microbial population in the batches affected the degree of sorption depending on the compound charge (i.e. positive or negative), highlighting an experimental technical bias. The degradation half-lives of acebutolol and diclofenac increased with increasing dilution and resulted in higher environmental persistence. The modelling of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) allowed an estimate of the temporal end boundary of the impact zone to be predicted as 24 h. Therefore, it was concluded that most of the investigated compounds would persist beyond the end of the impact zone as defined by the return to environmental BOD concentrations. It is proposed that, within environmental risk assessment protocols, the impact zone should be considered as a semi-natural wastewater treatment area in such a way to allow the estimate of environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals beyond its end.

AB Pharmaceuticals have become "persistent" pollutants in the aquatic environment, due to theft wide usage in daily life and their continuous release into the aquatic environment. Hence, prioritization and ranking lists are required to screen for target compounds as part of risk assessments. A ranking system based on three criteria, such as occurrence, exposure potential and ecological effects, was developed in this study for specific application to China. A total of 100 pharmaceuticals were selected as candidates based on the ranking system and available consumption data. These pharmaceuticals have been previously reported by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in China. 13 pharmaceuticals were classified as priority pharmaceuticals, among which diclofenac, erythromycin, and penicillin G were highly prioritized. Due to their abuse, antibiotics contributed a majority to the priority pharmaceuticals among all therapeutic classes, indicating that antibiotics should be considered based on their behaviors in WWTPs. The pharmaceuticals ranking list achieved good applicability and will help to establish a focus for future monitoring and management of pharmaceuticals. It will also provide an important basis for both ecological risk assessment and pollution control of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater was investigated in pilot-scale after a high- and a low loaded activated sludge process. Higher ozone doses were required to remove organic micropollutants in the effluent wastewater from the high loaded activated sludge process. Further comparison of the micropollutant removal was based on normalized ozone doses, expressed as g O-3/g DOC and g O-3/g soluble COD (sCOD). A clear difference was noted for the two effluents when the micropollutant removal was normalized by DOC. This difference disappeared almost completely when the removal was linked to ozone doses normalized by sCOD. The dose-response curves for the organic micropollutants were practically linear in the removal range up to 95%. A linear prediction model was developed and compared with literature values to test the transferability of the obtained results. Results from this comparison indicated that the slope of the dose-response functions could be used to predict the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants at a third plant with an average uncertainty of 10%. The modeled ozone requirements were then set in relation to the COD concentrations in the discharged wafer from approximately 90 Swedish activated sludge treatment plants with and without nitrogen removal. This comparison highlighted the need for a well-functioning biological treatment for an effective ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants. The results in this study suggest that soluble COD should be further explored for design and modeling of ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater.

AB Carbamazepine is one of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and has been widely used to treat depression and seizures, and it cannot be effectively removed during the conventional wastewater treatment processes. In this study, three processes were used for the carbamazepine degradation, including single radiation, radiation in the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and radiation followed by PMS oxidation. The results show that radiation in the presence of PMS could enhance the degradation and mineralization of carbamazepine, decreasing the absorbed dose required for completely degrading carbamazepine from 800 Gy to 300 Cy, no matter what the molar ratio of PMS to carbamazepine was. The radiation followed by PMS oxidation significantly increased the mineralization, and the maximum mineralization achieved 46.5% at the dose of 600 Cy. Eight intermediates were tentatively identified. Compared to single radiation process, the radiation in the presence of PMS enhanced the transformation of intermediates and the release of ammonium ion. In real wastewater, the radiation in the presence of PMS could effectively remove carbamazepine and considerably decreased the biological toxicity of the wastewater containing carbamazepine.

AB Gliclazide is a pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, this drug is considered to be highly undesirable when present in the environment. We tested in vitro the biodegradation of gliclazide as the sole source of carbon and energy by a microbial consortium. After a 5-month adaptation period in batch culture, two bacterial strains were isolated and identified, namely, Aeromonas hydrophila and Serratia odorifera. With an initial concentration of gliclazide at 0.5 g/L, these two bacteria and their combined culture degraded gliclazide with a specific activity of 22.3, 24.1, and 19.2 ng/(mg center dot h) and a yield of 88.88%, 82.94%, and 95.88%, respectively. Experimental results reveal a removal efficiency of 98.904% at an inlet concentration of 5 g/L and a flow rate of 14 L/h. The maximum removal efficiency of the biotrickling filter was 99.6%, at a gliclazide inlet concentration of 0.5, 1, and 5 g/L and a flow rate of 6.3 L/h. Interestingly, it was observed that after a period of 12 months, the two dominant strains differed from those present in the initial inocula. Thus, the high elimination efficiencies obtained in this study reveal the interest of the use, for the first time, of a biotrickling filter for the study of the biodegradation of gliclazide. Obtaining a microbial consortium strongly adapted to this substrate may prove to be an interesting alternative for a possible application in the treatment, before discharge, of wastewater containing this molecule or other related molecules, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB The complex nature of diclofenac limits its biological degradation, posing a serious threat to aquatic organisms. Our present work aims to eliminate diclofenac from wastewater through photocatalytic degradation using TiO2-SnO2 mixed-oxide catalysts under various operating conditions such as catalyst loading, initial diclofenac concentration and initial pH. Different molar ratios of Ti-Sn (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1) were prepared by the hydrothermal method and were characterized. The results indicated that addition of Sn in small quantity enhances the catalytic activity of TiO2. Energy Band gap of the TiO2-SnO2 catalysts was found to increase with an increase in Tin content. TiO2-SnO2 catalyst with a molar ratio of 20:1 was found to be the most effective when compared to other catalysts. The results suggested that initial drug concentration of 20 mg/L, catalyst loading of 0.8 g/L and pH 5 were the optimum operating conditions for complete degradation of diclofenac. Also, the TiO2-SnO2 catalyst was effective in complete mineralization of diclofenac with a maximum total organic carbon removal of 90% achieved under ultraviolet irradiation. The repeatability and stability results showed that the TiO2-SnO2 catalyst exhibited an excellent repeatability and better stability over the repeated reaction cycles. The photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac resulted in several photoproducts, which were identified through LC-MS.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are widely recognized as the main source of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) in natural water courses. The problem is aggravated in those regions where water is scarce and its reuse is necessary. With the aim of avoiding these problems, the present paper reports the results obtained by installing a nanofiltration membrane at the outlet of the secondary decanter at the WWTP situated in the municipality of Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), Permeate samples were taken over a period of 72 h while the membranes were operating. Contaminants belonging to the aforementioned families (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin and penicillin G) were analysed by means of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The results indicate that nanofiltration removed these contaminants from the wastewater turning the treated water as suitable to be reused for all the uses included in the Spanish Royal Decree 1620/2007 on water regeneration and reuse. 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Environmental fate of 58 pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) grouped into 11 therapeutic classes in the three different waters, hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant (STP) and river water, was estimated by combination of their quantitative concentration analysis and evaluation of their extent of contribution as loading sources. At the same time, distribution of six classes of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) in the same water samples was estimated by screening of individual PhC-resistant microbes grown on each specific chromogenic medium. The results indicate that 48 PhCs were detected ranged from 1 ng/L (losartan carboxylic acid) to 228 mu g/L (acetaminophen sulfate) in hospital effluent, and contribution of the pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was estimated as 0.1% to 15%. On the other hand, contribution of STP effluent to river water was high, 32% to 60% for antibacterials, antipertensives and X-ray contrast media. In the cases for AMRB, detected numbers of colonies of AMRB in hospital effluent ranged from 29 CFU/mL to 1805 CFU/mL, and the estimated contribution of the AMRB pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was as low as 0.1% (levofloxacin and olmesartan) to 5.1% (N-clesmethyl tamoxifen). Although the contribution of STPs as loading sources of PhCs and AMRB in surface waters was large, ozonation as an advanced water treatment system effectively removed a wide range of both PhCs and AMRB in water samples. These results suggest the importance of reducing environmental pollutant loads (not only at STPs but also at medical facilities) before being discharged into the surface waters, to both conserve water and keep the water environment safe. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the distribution and contribution of AMRB from hospital effluent to the surface waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical and illicit drug residues potentially arising from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in the Central London portion of the Thames Estuary is presented. Approximately 39 million tonnes of untreated sewage enter the River Thames at 57 CSO points annually. Differential analysis of influents and effluents in a major wastewater treatment plant identified seven potential drug-related CSO markers based on removal rates. Three were present in influent at concentrations >1 mu g L-1 (caffeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine). During dry weather, analysis of hourly samples of river water revealed relatively consistent concentrations for most drugs, including CSO markers, over a tidal cycle. River water was monitored over a week in January and July and then daily across six consecutive weeks in November/December, 2014. Out of 31 compounds monitored, 27 drug residues were determined in the River Thames and, combined, ranged between similar to 1000-3500 ng L-1. Total drug concentration generally declined during extended periods of drier weather. For CSO markers, short-term increases in caffeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine concentration were observed similar to 24 h after CSO events (especially those occurring at low tide) and generally within one order of magnitude. Timings of elevated occurrence also correlated well with ammonium ion and dissolved oxygen data following CSOs. This work also represents an important study of pharmaceutical occurrence before a major 'Super Sewer' infrastructure upgrade in London aiming to reduce CSOs by 95%. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are released into the environment clue to their poor removal during wastewater treatment. Agricultural soils subject to irrigation with wastewater effluent and biosolids application are possible reservoirs for these chemicals. This study examined the impact of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ), and the antimicrobial agents triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) on four soil microbial communities using shotgun sequencing (HiSeq Illumina) with the overall aim of determining possible degraders as well as the functional genes related to general xenobiotic degradation. The biodegradation of CBZ and TCC was slow, with <= 50% decrease during the 80-day incubation period. In contrast, TCS biodegradation was rapid, with similar to 80% removal in 25 days. For each chemical, when all four soils were considered together, between three and ten phylotypes (from multiple phyla) were more abundant in the soil samples compared to the live controls. The genera of a number of previously reported CBZ, TCC or TCS degrading isolates were present: Rhodococcus (CBZ), Streptomyces (CBZ), Pseudomonas (CBZ, TCC, TCS), Sphingomonas (TCC, TCS), Methylobacillus (TCS) and Stenotrophomonas (TCS) were among the most abundant (chemical previously reported to be degraded is shown in parenthesis). From the analysis of xenobiotic degrading pathways, genes from five KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Orthology pathways were the most dominant, including those associated with aminobenzoate, benzoate (most common), chloroyclohexane/chlorobenzene, dioxin and nitrotoluene biodegradation. Several phylotypes including Brodythizobium, Mycobacterium, Rhodopseudornonas, Pseudomonas, Cupriavidus, and Streptomyces were common genera associated with these pathways. Overall, the data suggest several phylotypes are likely involved in the biodegradation of these PPCPs with Pseudomonas being an important genus. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the work was to determine the influence of salicylic acid (SA) oxidation products on the effectiveness of their further removal in the membrane filtration process. Two commercial polyamide-based polymer membranes, HL (GE Osmonics) and TS80 (TriSep(TM)), were used and characterized by SEM microscopic analysis, contact angles, and free surface energy. The products of salicylic acid oxidation, 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and catechol, were determined and their impact on the removal of unreacted salicylic acid in the nanofiltration process was investigated. It was also checked to what extent and why they were retained or not by the membranes. The results of the research have shown that the main product of salicylic acid oxidation, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, has a negative impact on the retention of salicylic acid in the nanofiltration stage, while the other product, catechol, improves SA retention. The determined values of contact angles correlate well with solubility (S) of the tested compounds, which increases in the following order S-SA < S-2,S-3-DHBA < S-CAT, while the contact angle of the membrane decreases. Nevertheless, it has been shown that some oxidation products can penetrate the environment due to poorer membrane separation properties of these products.

AB This study assessed the mechanisms using montmorillonite (MMT) for the uptake and removal of a beta-blocker metoprolol (MTP) from aqueous solution. Uptake of MTP was fast and equilibrium could be reached in 15 min and 4 h under initial MTP tartrate concentrations of 800 and 4000 mg/L, respectively. The MTP uptake capacity was as high as 412 mg/g (corresponding to 1544 mmol/kg), suggesting that MMT was a good candidate for beta-blocker removal. Equilibrium solution pH and ionic strength had strong influence on MTP uptake on MMT and MTP uptake was reduced under high pH and high ionic strength conditions. Desorption of exchangeable cations matched well with the amount of MTP uptake at low loading levels, suggesting cation exchange being responsible for the uptake of MTP. At higher MTP uptake levels, significant expansion of d(001) spacing was observed, confirming extensive intercalation and changes in interlayer configuration of MTP. The decomposition temperature of MTP intercalated into the MMT increased in comparison to that of crystalline MTP as revealed by thermogravimetric analyses. Band shift in FTIR analyses indicated that hydrogen bonding besides cation exchange and ion-dipole interaction was responsible for the high MTP loading levels.

AB Although ozonation is nowadays recognized as one of the most efficient technologies for micropollutants abatement in municipal wastewater effluents, several of the compounds potentially present in those waters exhibit a strong resistance to direct ozone oxidation. In addition, the real-time control of the removal process is still challenging. In this work, the abatement of ozone-recalcitrant micropollutants during wastewater ozonation of six different wastewater effluents was explored using the pesticide acetamiprid as hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) probe. By means of this data, the oxidation efficiency (i. e., hydroxyl radical exposure per consumed ozone) could be described by means of a two-stage model based on the R-OHO3 concept. This was possible using a semicontinuous bubbling ozone contactor in all experiments, which permitted the inclusion of the ozone mass balance in the model. ROHO3 values of (1.53-7.60) center dot 10(-7) s for initial ozonation stage and (0.61-2.95) center dot 10(-6) s for the secondary stage were obtained allowing the characterization and comparison of the process performance in a wide range of effluent qualities, including water matrices with a high content of dissolved and particulate organic matter (total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and turbidity tested ranges: 6.7-50 mg C L-1, 6.6-27.6 mg C L-1 and 0.3-28.6 NTU, respectively). Finally, a surrogate strategy involving % OH exposure estimation by means of ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) measurements was proposed based on the R-OHO3 concept, and by means of its application the removal of atrazine and ibuprofen in six different wastewaters could be rightly predicted (R-2 > 0.98).

AB Trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS-WWTPs) and are discharged into surface waters, where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain TrOCs. The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-VVWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, >= 90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies. Qualitative comparison with CAS literature shows potentially higher IFAS removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench- or pilot-scale studies (atenolol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, DEET, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tertoctylphenol), as well as the chlorinated flame retardants TCIPP and TDCIPP. Effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full-scale CAS-WWTPs. These results provide the first survey of multiple full-scale IFAS-WWTPs employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of basic chemical endpoints (removal of ammonia, TN, TP, and COD), the distribution of solids within the systems, and the removal of TrOCs and estrogenic activity.

AB Transformation of biomarkers (or their stability) during sewer transport is an important issue for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Most studies so far have been conducted in the laboratory, which usually employed unrealistic conditions. In the present study, we utilized a pilot sewer system including a gravity pipe and a rising main pipe to investigate the fate of 24 pharmaceutical biomarkers. A programmable logic controller was used to control and monitor the system including sewer operational conditions and wastewater properties. Sequential samples were collected that can represent hydraulic retention time (HRT) of up to 8 h in a rising main and 4 h in a gravity sewer. Wastewater parameters and biomarker concentrations were analysed to evaluate the stability and transformation kinetics. The wastewater parameters of the pilot system were close to the conditions of real sewers. The findings of biomarker transformation were also close to real sewer data with seventeen biomarkers reported as stable while buprenorphine, caffeine, ethyl-sulfate, methadone, paracetamol, paraxanthine and salicylic acid degraded to variable extents. Both zero-order and first-order kinetics were used to model the degradation of unstable biomarkers and interestingly the goodness of fit R-2 for the zero-order model was higher than the first-order model for all unstable biomarkers in the rising main. The pilot sewer system simulates more realistic conditions than benchtop laboratory setups and may provide a more accurate approach for assessing the in-sewer transformation kinetics and stability of biomarkers.

AB Interpreting the fate of wastewater contaminants in streams is difficult because their inputs vary in time and several processes synchronously affect reactive transport. We present a method to disentangle the various influences by performing a conservative-tracer test while sampling a stream section at various locations for chemical analysis of micropollutants. By comparing the outflow concentrations of contaminants with the tracer signal convoluted by the inflow time series, we estimated reaction rate coefficients and calculated the contaminant removal along a river section. The method was tested at River Steinlach, Germany, where 38 contaminants were monitored. Comparing day-time and night-time experiments allowed distinguishing photo-dependent degradation from other elimination processes. While photo-dependent degradation showed to be highly efficient for the removal of metroprolol, bisoprolol, and venlafaxine, its impact on contaminant removal was on a similar scale to the photo-independent processes when averaged over 24 h. For a selection of compounds analyzed in the present study, bio- and photodegradation were higher than in previous field studies. In the Steinlach study, we observed extraordinarily effective removal processes that may be due to the higher proportion of treated wastewater, temperature, DOC and nitrate concentrations, but also a higher surface to volume ratio from low flow conditions that favorizes photodegradation through the shallow water column and a larger transient storage than observed in comparable studies.

AB Stormwater retention ponds commonly receive some wastewater through misconnections, sewer leaks, and sewer overloads, all of which leads to unintended loads of organic micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals. This study explores the role of pond sediment in removing pharmaceuticals (naproxen, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, furosemide, and fenofibrate). It quantifies their sorption potential to the sediments and how it depends on pH. Then it addresses the degradability of the pharmaceuticals in microcosms holding sediment beds and pond water. The sediment-water partitioning coefficient of fenofibrate varied little with pH and was the highest (average log Kd: 4.42 L kg(-1)). Sulfamethoxazole had the lowest (average log Kd: 0.80 L kg(-1)), varying unsystematically with pH. The coefficients of naproxen, furosemide and carbamazepine were in between. The degradation by the sediments was most pronounced for sulfamethoxazole, followed by naproxen, fenofibrate, furosemide, and carbamazepine. The first three were all removed from the water phase with half-life of 2-8 days. Over the 38 days the experiment lasted, they were all degraded to near completion. The latter two were more resistant, with half-lives between 1 and 2 months. Overall, the study indicated that stormwater retention ponds have the potential to remove some but not all pharmaceuticals contained in wastewater contributions.

AB Complex chemical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams but relatively little work has been done to characterize them and assess their potential effects in headwater streams. In 2014, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) sampled 54 Piedmont streams over ten weeks and measured 475 unique organic compounds using five analytical methods. Maximum and median exposure conditions were evaluated in relation to watershed characteristics and for potential biological effects using multiple lines of evidence. Results demonstrate that mixed-contaminant exposures are ubiquitous and varied in sampled headwater streams. Approximately 56% (264) of the 475 compounds were detected at least once across all sites. Cumulative maximum concentrations ranged 1,922-162,346 ng L-1 per site. Chemical occurrence significantly correlated to urban land use but was not related to presence/absence of wastewater treatment facility discharges. Designed bioactive chemicals represent about 2/3rd of chemicals detected, notably pharmaceuticals and pesticides, qualitative evidence for possible adverse biological effects. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database chemical-gene associations applied to maximum exposure conditions indicate >12,000 and 2,900 potential gene targets were predicted at least once across all sites for fish and invertebrates, respectively. Analysis of cumulative exposure-activity ratios provided additional evidence that, at a minimum, transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates were common. Finally, cumulative detections and concentrations correlated inversely with invertebrate metrics from in-stream surveys. The results demonstrate widespread instream exposure to extensive contaminant mixtures and compelling multiple lines of evidence for adverse effects on aquatic communities. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The present work aimed to explore the potential of autochthonous microorganisms from an urban estuary and from activated sludge of an associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), for biodegradation of an antidepressant drug, paroxetine, and on a cholesterol-lowering agent, bezafibrate. These compounds were chosen as representatives of extensively used pharmaceuticals. Autochthonous microorganisms from the indicated sources were exposed to the target pharmaceuticals (1 mg/L) in co-metabolism with sodium acetate (500 mg/L) along a two-weeks period, for a total of 7 two-weeks periods (here referred as cycles). Exposures were carried out in batch mode, under different incubation conditions (agitation vs. static). Removal of pharmaceuticals was monitored at the end of each cycle, by analysing the culture medium. For paroxetine, fluoride ion release was also followed as an indicator of defluorination of the molecule. The structure of the bacterial communities was analysed by ARISA (Automated rRNA Intergenic Spacer Analysis), at the beginning of the experiment and at the end of the first and the last cycles to identify substantial changes associated with the time of exposure, the incubation conditions and the presence and type of pharmaceuticals. Incubation conditions affected not only the bacterial community structure, but also the biodegradation efficiency. At the beginning of the experiment, removal of target pharmaceuticals was found to be lower under agitation than under static conditions, but at the end of the experiment, results showed high removal of the pharmaceuticals from the culture medium (> 97%) under both conditions, mainly by microbiological processes. For paroxetine, adsorption and abiotic processes also had an important influence on its removal, but defluorination only occurred in the presence of microorganisms. These results highlight that autochthonous microorganisms from estuarine sediments and WWTP sludge have high ability to remove the selected pharmaceuticals with relevant implications for the development of new bioremediation tools for environmental restoration.

AB Background: The occurrence of emerging pollutants like pharmaceuticals and related compounds in the aquatic and terrestrial environments is of increasing concern. Ciprofloxacin is one of the pharmaceuticals which is active against a wide range of bacteria. The main objective of this research is to develop a simple method for the extraction and determination of ciprofloxacin residues in environmental water samples.
   Results: A salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) method for the determination of ciprofloxacin in water samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was developed. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.1-100 mu g/L with coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.9976. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method were 0.075 and 0.25 mu g/L, respectively. The reproducibility in terms of relative standard deviation (% RSD) was less than 10%. The applicability of the developed method was investigated by analyzing tap water, bottled mineral water and waste water and demonstrated satisfactory recoveries in the ranges of 86.4-120%.
   Conclusion: The method offered a number of features including wide linear range, good recovery, short analysis time, simple operation process and environmental friendly. The developed method can be utilized as an attractive alternative for the determination of ciprofloxacin residues in environmental water matrices.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in industrial parks provide centralized treatment for industrial and domestic wastewater. However, the information on toxicity reduction of wastewater and its correlation with treatment process in industrial park is limited. This study compared the toxicity reduction of wastewater in 12 industrial park WWTPs based on battery of toxicity assays. Nine toxic endpoints involving microorganism, phytoplankton, zooplankton, plant and human cell lines were applied. All the influents of WWTPs induced high toxicities, which were significantly reduced after the treatments from 7 of the studied WWTPs. However, the effluents of five WWTPs induced higher toxicity in one or more toxic endpoints compared to the influents. This study also found that most of anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(2)/O)-based processes had good removal efficiency of wastewater toxicity, while the sequencing batch reactor (SBR)-based processes had the lowest removal efficiency. Moreover, low correlation coefficients were obtained among all toxic endpoints, indicating that battery of toxicity assays was necessary to completely characterize the toxicity and risk of wastewater in industrial parks. This study shed new lights to the toxicity reduction of wastewater and its correlation with treatment process, which is very useful for the design, management and operation of WWTPs in industrial parks.

AB Sulfamethazine (SMZ) is an antibiotic from sulfonamides class widely used in veterinary medicine and reported in wastewater and sewage. Thus, it is essential to study technologies to reduce SMZ present in the aquatic environment. Anaerobic bioreactors are a low-cost technology applied for wastewater treatment. The objective of this paper is to study kinetics parameters related to SMZ removal using a horizontal flow-anaerobic immobilized biomass reactor (HAIR) and to evaluate its transformation products formed during this treatment. The bioreactor was operated at mesophilic condition with a hydraulic retention time of 12 h. The removal of SMZ was evaluated at three different concentrations: 200 ng L-1 (phase I), 400 ng L-1 (phase II) and 600 ng L-1 (phase III). The apparent first-order removal constant obtained for chemical oxygen demand was 0.885 +/- 0.094 h(-1) while SMZ showed a removal constant of 0.356 h(-1). SMZ was removed with an efficiency of 56.0 +/- 13.0 % (phase I); 62.0 +/- 12.0 % (phase II) and 62.0 +/- 6.00 % (phase III). Seven transformation products were detected and one of these with m/z 233 is reported for the first-time. The HAIB bioreactor has a potential to assist in wastewater treatment to remove contaminants at ng L-1 concentration level.

AB Environmental release and accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products is a global concern in view of increased awareness of ecotoxicological effects. Adsorbent properties make the biopolymer melanin an interesting alternative to remove micropollutants from water. Recently, tyrosinase-surface-displaying Escherichia coli was shown to be an interesting self-replicating production system for melanin-covered cells for batch-wise absorption of the model pharmaceutical chloroquine. This work explores the suitability of these melanin-covered E. coli for the continuous removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. A continuous-flow membrane bioreactor containing melanized E. coli cells was used for adsorption of chloroquine from the influent until saturation and subsequent regeneration. At a low loading of cells (10 g/L) and high influent concentration of chloroquine (0.1 mM), chloroquine adsorbed until saturation after 26 +/- 2 treated reactor volumes (39 +/- 3 L). The average effluent concentration during the first 20 h was 0.0018 mM, corresponding to 98.2% removal. Up to 140 +/- 6 mg chloroquine bound per gram of cells following mixed homo- and heterogeneous adsorption kinetics. In situ low pH regeneration released all chloroquine without apparent capacity loss over three consecutive cycles. This shows the potential of melanized cells for treatment of conventional wastewater or highly concentrated upstream sources such as hospitals or manufacturing sites.

AB The increasingly ubiquitous release of emerging refractory pollutants into water is a serious concern due to associated risks. In this study, mesoporous hierarchical BiOBr/Fe3O4@SiO2-a solvothermally synthesized visible-light-driven magnetic photocatalyst-not only exhibited fast kinetics (t(1/2) = 8.7 min) in the photo catalytic degradation of ibuprofen in water but also achieved almost complete mineralization over a prolonged irradiation of 6 h. Various reactive species, including center dot O-2(-), center dot OH, and H2O2, were detected, while the scavenging experiments revealed that e(CB)(-)-mediated reactions and direct-hole oxidation are the major degradation routes. The magnetically recycled BiOBr/Fe(3)O4@SiO2 maintained similar to 80% of its initial photocatalytic activity even after five consecutive cycles. The typically copresent wastewater constituents, including NOM and anions, inhibited the photocatalytic performance to varying extents, and hence necessitated an increase in the photocatalyst dosage to achieve complete ibuprofen degradation in real sewage. Based on the findings of batch experiments, the process was scaled up by developing a 5 L prototype photocatalytic reactor integrated with an electromagnetic separation unit. The results of prototype photocatalytic experiments were comparable to those of batch experiments, and an electromagnetic separation efficiency of similar to 99% was achievable in 5 min.

AB In the Duliujian River, 12 water environmental parameters corresponding to 45 sampling sites were analyzed over four seasons. With a statistics test (Spearman correlation coefficient) and multivariate statistical methods, including cluster analysis (CA) and principal components analysis (PCA), the river water quality temporal and spatial patterns were analyzed to evaluate the pollution status and identify the potential pollution sources along the river. CA and PCA results on spatial scale revealed that the upstream was slightly polluted by domestic sewage, while the upper-middle reach was highly polluted due to the sewage from feed mills, furniture and pharmaceutical factories. The middle-lower reach, moderately polluted by sewage from textile, pharmaceutical, petroleum and oil refinery factories as well as fisheries and livestock activities, demonstrated the water purification role of wetland reserves. Seawater intrusion caused serious water pollution in the estuary. Through temporal CA, the four seasons were grouped into three clusters consistent with the hydrological mean, high and low flow periods. The temporal PCA results suggested that nutrient control was the primary task in mean flow period and the monitoring of effluents from feed mills, petrochemical and pharmaceutical factories is more important in the high flow period, while the wastewater from domestic and livestock should be monitored carefully in low flow periods. The results may provide some guidance or inspiration for environmental management.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater biological treatment plants are stressed with multi-component wastewater and unexpected variations in wastewater flow, composition and toxicity. To avoid operational problems and reduced wastewater treatment efficiency, accurate monitoring of influent toxicity on activated sludge microorganisms is essential. This paper outlines how to predict highly toxic streams, which should be avoided, using measurements of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), if they are made in a wide range of initial concentration. The results indicated that wastewater containing multivalent Al3+ cations showed a strong toxic effect on activated sludge biocenosis irrespectively of dilutions, while toxicity of phenol and formaldehyde containing wastewater decreased considerably with increasing dilution. Activated sludge microorganisms were not sensitive to wastewater containing halogenated sodium salts (NaCl, NaF) and showed high treatment capacity of saline wastewater. Our findings confirm that combined indicators of contamination, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), alone do not allow evaluating potential toxic influence of wastewater. Obtained results allow identifying key inhibitory substances in pharmaceutical wastewater and evaluating potential impact of new wastewater streams or increased loading on biological treatment system. Proposed method is sensitive and cost effective and has potential for practical implementation in multi-product pharmaceutical wastewater biological treatment plants.

AB Hydroxyquinone compounds, such as 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone and alizarin sulfonate, are widely used in dye manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other industries. However, the treatment of hydroxyquinone-containing wastewater has seldom been examined. This study used a precipitation method with barium salt to treat nano-silver industrial wastewater. The results show that barium chloride was a suitable reagent for significantly degrading COD and color from nano-silver wastewater. When the initial pH value was 10.5, 8 g of BaCl2 center dot 2H2O were added to 100 mL of wastewater. After reaction at 15 degrees C for 1 h, the removal efficiencies of COD and color in the nano-silver wastewater were 85.6% and 97.1%, respectively. Simulated wastewater containing sodium alizarin-3-sulfonate (ARS) or purpurin was used to further investigate the removal mechanism of hydroxyquinone compounds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and some related experiments showed that hydroxyquinone compounds can directly react with barium ions in the solution so as to transfer from wastewater to precipitate. In addition, the newly produced barium sulfate particles have positive surface charges, which can improve the removal efficiency of hydroxyquinone compounds due to electrostatic attraction.

AB Consumer products such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and pharmaceuticals (PCPPs) enter aquatic ecosystems through inefficient removal during wastewater treatment. Often, the sterilization process of wastewater includes the addition of sodium hypochlorite that can react with PCPPs and other organic matter (i.e., dissolve organic matter) to generate disinfection by-products and can cause the final effluent to be more harmful to aquatic organisms. Here, we exposed Daphnia magna to two stages of wastewater, the pre-chlorinated wastewater (PreCl) and the final effluent. In addition, we exposed D. magna, to the final effluent with a concentration gradient of added PFOS, to investigate if this persistent contaminant altered the toxicity of the final effluent. After 48 h of contaminant exposure, we measured the daphnids metabolic responses to the different stages ofwastewater treatment, and with the addition of PFOS, utilizing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found few significant changes to the metabolic profile of animals exposed to the PreCl wastewater; however, animals exposed to the final effluent displayed increases in many amino acids and decreases in some sugar metabolites. With the addition of PFOS to the final effluent, the metabolic profile shifted from increased amino acids and decreased sugar metabolites and energy molecules especially at the low and high concentrations of PFOS. Overall, our results demonstrate the metabolome is sensitive to changes in the final effluent that are caused by sterilization, and with the addition of a persistent contaminant, the metabolic profile is further altered.

AB Organic wastes treated, used on agricultural land, can replace inorganic fertilizers, due to physical and chemical properties that improve soil and crop quality on long-term. In this study, was used biochar produced from sewage sludge, compost obtained from cattle manure, and mixtures made from biochar-compost in different concentration, at 5 t/ha and 30 t/ha, application rates. The aim of the study is to determine the influence of this organic wastes on the heavy metals bioavailability in greenhouse conditions and on Folsomia candida and Eisenia Andrei, used as test organisms under laboratory conditions. Compared to control variants, the use of biochar mixed with compost in different concentration at 5 t/ha and 30 t/ha, application rates, in a greenhouse experiment did not significantly affect the concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb). Reproduction of collembolans has not been influenced by increasing application rate of the mixtures, and by concentrations of biochar or compost. The earthworms recorded weight losses, only in the experimental treatments with sewage sludge biochar used in different concentrations, at both application rates.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are contaminants of emerging concern which are commonly detected in wastewater effluent and which can disrupt the behavior of non-target organisms. In aquatic snails, the righting response is a critical behavior that has been shown to be inhibited by exposure to SSRI-type antidepressants. We exposed marine and freshwater snails to three tricyclic antidepressants (clomipramine, amitriptyline, and imipramine) for 1h and measured righting response time. In the marine mud snail (Ilyanassa obsoleta), all three TCAs significantly increased righting time at concentrations as low as 156g/L. Similarly, in the freshwater snail Leptoxis carinata, all three TCAs increased righting time at concentrations as low as 263g/L. However, exposure to imipramine from 15.8 to 316g/L resulted in significantly faster righting time. Such low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition are characteristics of a hormetic response. We discuss the possible physiological mechanism of action of TCAs and other antidepressants on snail behavior, and the occurrence of non-monotonic, hormetic dose responses to human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

AB Contamination of the aquatic environment by pharmaceutical drugs is an emerging issue in ecotoxicology. Aquatic organisms, in the presence of xenobiotics, tend to activate defensive mechanisms against toxic effects in order to mitigate and/or compensate for the toxic damages that frequently result from these interactions. Salicylic acid (SA) is a common drug, widely used in human medicine due to its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties, as well as its activity in terms of preventing platelet aggregation, among other clinical and cosmetic uses. It is commonly found in levels of the nanograms per liter to the micrograms per liter range in receiving waters, and its presence has been related to toxic effects in aquatic organisms, including oxidative stress. However, the number of studies that characterize the ecotoxicological profile of salicylates is still scarce and no studies have been published about the putative toxic effects of SA, especially in marine polychaetes. In order to determine the potential ecotoxicological effects caused by SA, individuals of the marine Polychaeta species Hediste diversicolor were exposed for 96h to ecologically relevant concentrations of this compound, and several biochemical endpoints were evaluated, namely the activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT), the phase II biotransformation isoenzymes glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the determination of lipoperoxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay). The obtained results demonstrated that despite the pro-oxidative effects elicited by SA, exposure to realistic levels of this compound was not able to generate a state of oxidative stress, and the adaptive protective responses elicited by exposed individuals were effective enough to minimize and/or inhibit the damage potentially caused by overproduced reactive oxygen species.

AB Heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other wastes released into the environment can significantly influence environmental antibiotic resistance. We investigated the occurrence of 22 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 10 heavy metal concentrations, and the relationship between ARGs and heavy metals in surface sediment from seven sites of Lake Taihu. The results showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between sediment ARG levels, especially for tetracycline and sulfonamides (e.g., tet(A), tet(D), tet(E), tet(O), sul1, sul2 and int-1) and specific heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, among others) in the Lake. In the surface sediments, heavy metals showed an interaction with resistance genes, but the strength of interaction was diminished with increasing depth. For most of the heavy metals, the concentration of elements in the top sediments was higher than that in other depths. Tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(E) and tet(O), beta-lactam resistance genes (SHV, TEM, CTX, OXA and OXY) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sulA, sul1, sul2, sul3 and int-1) were detected. They showed a trend which inferred a statistically significant increase followed by decreases in the relative abundance of these ARGs (normalized to 16S rRNA genes) with increasing depth. This study revealed that tet(A), tet(O), TEM, OXY, int-1, sul1 and sul3 were widespread in surface sediments with high abundance, indicating that these genes deserve more attention in future work.

AB Health concerns have been raised over the excessive occurrences of antibiotics such as tetracycline in aquatic environments. Adsorption is a simple and cheap technique for the removal of pharmaceuticals from industrial wastewater. To date, limited information exists on the fate, economical treatment and safe disposal of spent adsorbents in the environment, and this is often consideredas the main drawback of adsorption. In this article, an alternative strategy to dispose and reuse spent inorganic adsorbents is proposed. We synthesized CoO/CuFe2O4 mixed metal oxide from layered double hydroxides by a modified co-precipitation and calcination method at 500 degrees C for 5h. CoO/CuFe2O4 has a 348.5m(2)/g surface area, pH point zero charge of 5.8 and an average pore diameter of 5.8nm. Results show that the tetracycline removal efficiency at pH 6 reached 96.6% and 84-87.3% in the absence and in the presence of 4g/L competing ions (Cl- and NO3-), respectively. Moreover, CoO/CuFe2O4 retained stable activities, of about 90%, over five consecutive recycling runs. Spent CoO/CuFe2O4 was reused as a catalyst in the presence of sunlight for degradation of azo dye, and this is the first report of achieving similar to 77% discolouration of eriochrome black T dye using a recycled adsorbent.

AB The presence of pharmaceutic compounds has been widely detected in water and wastewater due to the increase in their production and consumption. Since conventional treatments are not able to totally remove these microcontaminants, more efficient technologies, such as adsorption, must be investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the adsorption of diclofenac sodium (DS) onto commercial organoclay (Spectrogel (R) Type C) in static system. Process optimization was performed through Central Composite Design (CCD) and the adsorbent mass of 0.5 g and agitation speed of 200 rpm were selected as the optimum conditions. The variable initial concentration of DS was not statistically significant. Pseudo-first order model showed the best correlation to kinetic experimental data and the investigation of adsorption mechanism revealed that external mass transference was the main rate-controlling step. Equilibrium data obtained at 15 degrees C and at 30 degrees C were best described by Freundlich isotherm model and at 50 degrees C by Temkin isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity from Langmuir was of 0.133 mmol/L at 50 degrees C. Thermodynamically, the process is spontaneous and endothermic. Characterization analysis depicted that DS adsorption takes place on the surface of Spectrogel, which is not significantly modified by the process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-spheres adsorptive microextraction using powdered activated carbons (ACs) was studied as a novel enrichment approach, followed by liquid desorption and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (MSA mu E(AC)-LD/HPLC-DAD) to monitor caffeine (CAF) and acetaminophen (ACF) traces in environmental matrices. In this study, commercial activated carbons (N, N-OX, and R) were tested, with the latter showing a much better performance for the analysis of both anthropogenic drugs. The main parameters affecting the efficiency of the proposed methodology are fully discussed using commercial AC(R). Textural and surface chemistry properties of the ACs sample were correlated with the analytical results. Assays performed on 30 mL of water samples spiked at 10 mu g L-1 under optimized experimental conditions, yielding recoveries of 75.3% for ACF and 82.6% for CAF. The methodology also showed excellent linear dynamic ranges for both drugs with determination coefficients higher than 0.9976, limits of detection and quantification of 0.8-1.2 mu g L-1 and 2.8-4.0 mu g L-1, respectively, and suitable precision (RSD < 13.8%). By using the standard addition method, the application of the present method to environmental matrices, including superficial, sea, and wastewater samples, allowed very good performance at the trace level. The proposed methodology proved to be a feasible alternative for polar compound analysis, showing to be easy to implement, reliable, and sensitive, with the possibility to reuse and store the analytical devices loaded with the target compounds for later analysis.

AB Three different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were applied to investigate the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) i.e. sulfamethoxazole (SMX), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) in synthetically prepared aqueous solutions. The degradation of these substances was carried out by ozonation, sonolysis and photocatalytic oxidation, as well as by different combinations of these processes. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the removal efficiency of each method and to assess the performance variation of sonolysis in combination with other AOPs. The best performances were achieved by sonocatalysis, which resulted in the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals in the range between 37% and 47%. Under similar experimental conditions, the removal of the selected ECs by single compounds by ozonation was slightly lower than the removal of respective compounds in the mixture. Moreover, pseudo first-order removal rate constants of photocatalytic mineralization were determined as 9.33x10(-2), 4.90x10(-3), 1.06x10(-2) min(-1) for SMX, DCF and CBZ, respectively.

AB The determination of the peak volumetric removal rate of ibuprofen in batch culture was used to select a microbial community utilizable for augmentation. For a continuous removal process, this rate, particularly the peak value of the volumetric removal rate is an essential factor reflecting the catabolic behavior (metabolic quotient qs) and the physiological state of a microbial community which depends on environmental conditions. Thus, if stable environmental conditions are maintained in a homogeneous continuous regime, a high metabolic quotient and volumetric removal rate could be maintained for the selected microbial community.
   Using equations derived from the material balance of ibuprofen in a wastewater treatment mini-plant (WTMP) operating in a homogeneous condition, the beginning and end of an acclimatization period after an IBP toxic shock were estimated by comparison of the experimental values of IBP accumulated to its theoretical accumulation. Using the experimental values of IBP accumulated within the WTMP, the actual transient change in the volumetric removal rate along the acclimatization period was calculated from another derived equation. This procedure allows to measure the change in the volumetric removal rate, showing the kinetic response of the system and the acclimatization time of a microbial consortium after a toxic shock.

AB A solar homo/heterogeneous photo-Fenton process using five materials (Fe(II), Fe(III), mining waste, Fe(II)/mining waste, and Fe(III)/mining waste) supported on sodium alginate was used as a strategy to iron dosage for the degradation of eight pharmaceuticals in three different water matrices (distilled water, simulated wastewater, and hospital wastewater). Experiments were carried out in a photoreactor with a capacity of 1L, using 3g of iron-alginate spheres and an initial hydrogen peroxide concentration of 25mgL(-1), at pH 5.0. All the materials prepared were characterized by different techniques. The Fe(III)-alginate spheres presented the best pharmaceutical degradation after a treatment time of 116min. Nineteen transformation products generated during the solar photo-Fenton process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, using a purpose-built database developed for detecting these transformation products. Finally, the transformation products identified were classified according to their toxicity and predicted biodegradability.

AB Investigating the biodegradation of ozonation products of trace organic contaminants is important to further elucidate their fate and to assess the efficiency of advanced water treatment processes. In this study, a continuous ozonation merged with biofiltration (COMBI) laboratory system based on an electrochemical ozone generation method was developed. The system can be operated continuously and resource-efficiently over several months by supplying ozone doses typically used for water treatment and providing stable conditions for the establishment of microbial communities in biofiltration columns. Five trace organic contaminants, acesulfame, carbamazepine, diclofenac, dimethylsulfamide and fluoxetine, were investigated under drinking water and secondary treated wastewater ozonation conditions. After an equilibration time of three weeks, biodegradable ozonation products, for example N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and an acesulfame product, were removed in the filtration columns. Recalcitrant oxidation products such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and two products of diclofenac either passed through the columns at unchanged concentration or were removed to a minor extent. The formation of a secondary biotransformation product from carbamazepine ozonation products could be also observed. In summary, the results show that the developed system is a valuable tool to investigate complex transformation processes of ozonation products during biofiltration. COMBI will simplify future ozonation-biotransformation studies and enable more comprehensive investigations with a wider range of contaminants under different conditions.

AB A rural subdivision in south central Wisconsin was instrumented with monitoring wells and lysimeters before, during, and after its construction to examine the impacts of the unsewered subdivision on groundwater quality and quantity. Prior to construction, the 78-acre (32 ha) site was farmland. Sixteen homes were constructed beginning in 2003. Initial monitoring from 2002 to 2005 showed that groundwater beneath the site had been impacted by previous agricultural use, with nitrate-N values as high as 30 mg/L and some detections of the herbicide atrazine. Our 12-year study shows that the transition from agricultural to residential land use has changed groundwater quality in both negative and positive ways. Although groundwater elevations showed typical seasonal fluctuations each year, there were no measurable changes in groundwater levels or general flow directions during the 12-year study period. Chloride values increased in many wells, possibly as a result of road salting or water softener discharge. Nitrate concentrations varied spatially and temporally over the study period, with some initial concentrations substantially above the drinking water standard. In some wells, nitrate and atrazine levels have declined substantially since agriculture ceased. However, atrazine was still present at trace concentrations throughout the site in 2014. Wastewater tracers show there are small but detectable impacts from septic effluent on groundwater quality. Particle traces based on a groundwater flow model are consistent with the hypothesis that septic leachate has impacted groundwater quality.

AB Countless pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exist on the market with more added each day. Many of these compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and enter bodies of water in their active form. EDCs are known to have physiological and behavioral effects in exposed organisms. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a common EDC found in birth control pills, has been found to lead to population collapse after only a few generations in some fish species. Mechanisms identified as potential driving forces for collapse include feminization of males and altered fecundity in both sexes. However, an additional way in which EE2 could lead to population collapse is by altering courtship behavior, which could then change mating preferences and decrease mating opportunities. The current study had the following objectives: determine if exposing female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to EE2 changes mate choice in males; assess if the dose and duration of female exposure matters; and examine if exposing males to EE2 influences their mating preferences. Both unexposed and exposed males were presented with pairs of females that differed in EE2 dose and exposure duration. The results indicate that males were more responsive to EE2-exposed females than unexposed females, with males being most responsive to females exposed to the low versus high dose. Furthermore, exposed males responded less overall than unexposed males. If EE2 concentration increases in the environment, the likelihood of successful mating could decrease and, therefore, potentially lead to adverse population impacts.

AB This study deals with the potential of bioflocculant for the treatment of various industrial wastewaters. Bioflocculant (BFBl) produced by Bacillus licheniformis NJ3, showed 97% flocculating activity in primary screening (kaolin assay). The characteristics of the BFBl such as temperature and pH stability, cation-independency makes the flocculation process more economic as harmful coagulants and stabilizers are not required. BFBl efficiently treated synthetic wastewaters as compared to alum by reducing turbidity (69-87%), chemical oxygen demand (50-80%) and oil (87%). Further BFBl was used to treat pesticide, petroleum, pharmaceutical and starch processing industrial wastewaters having diversified pH. It reduced total suspended solids (61.9-80%), turbidity (54-94%), total dissolved solids (11-54%), oil and grease (75%) and heavy metals (62-100%) from wastewaters in the absence of cations without altering the temperature and pH. Additionally, Sludge settling process in the presence of BFBl was three times faster as compared to alum. Thus, BFBl successfully treats various wastewaters reducing multiple pollution indices. BFBl was a glycoprotein with 92% polysaccharide and 7% protein contents providing biodegradable nature. As a result, BFBl emerged as environment-friendly and economical alternative for the bioremediation of various industrial wastewaters.

AB Modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) and screen printed electrode (SPE) based on ethyl benzoyl acetate (EBA) were prepared and investigated as lanthanum ion selective electrodes. Effect of various plasticizers (o-NPOE, TCP, DBP, DOS, and DOP) and ionophore content was studied. The reaction mechanism between La(III) and beta-diketone ionophore at the electrode surface was studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and IR spectra measurement. The best performance was obtained using modified SPE and CPE electrodes with o-NPOE and TCP plasticizers. These electrodes showed potentiometric response with a Nernstian slope of 21.0, 19.5 and 20.5 mV decade(-1) over a concentration range from 1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1 with a fast response time of 9, 10 and 13 s over the linear concentration range for modified SPE (electrode I; TCP plasticizer) and two modified CPE plasticized with o-NPOE (electrode II) and TCP (electrode III), respectively. The electrodes exhibited constant potentiometric response in pH range 4-8, 5-8 and 4-7 for electrodes I, II and III, respectively. They showed satisfactory good sensitivity toward lanthanum ions with regard to most common transition metal ions. The sensors were applied for determination of La(III) ion in different water samples (tap water and wastewater) with satisfactory and good reproducibility results. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Seasonal variations in the concentrations and fate of 20 selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated over one year in a wastewater treatment plant in New Zealand, which relies on a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Bardenpho as parallel processes for its secondary treatment. Results showed that all of the monitored PPCPs were detected in the wastewater influent. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and caffeine were predominant in the influent, whereas in the effluent, beta-blockers and benzotriazole were present at significant concentrations. Total PPCPs' concentration in the influent was found to be 130 mu g/L. Average removal efficiency was found to be >= 99% for acetaminophen, caffeine, TCEP, naproxen, and ibuprofen, whereas < 50% of trimethoprim, metoprolol, and benzotriazole were removed. Contrary to the existing literature, no significant differences were found in the removal of PPCPs through MBR and Bardenpho processes, hinting that optimally operated Bardenpho can be equally effective in the removal of emerging contaminants as MBR. The occurrence and removal efficiencies of PPCPs were found to exhibit significant seasonal variations, with the highest influent concentrations of PPCPs reported in autumn and winter. Heavy rainfall had an insignificant impact on PPCPs' removal efficiencies although it resulted in much-diluted concentrations of PPCPs in the influent. Spearman's correlation analysis showed significant correlations between PPCPs' mass loads in the influent, wastewater quality parameters, and environmental factors. It was also found that, except sulfamethoxazole, ecotoxicity risks were minimal for the rest of the monitored PPCPs in wastewater effluent.

AB In this study, degradation of a pharmaceutical drug, Phenazone (PNZ) has been carried out via heterogeneous photocatalysis, photo-Fenton and in-situ dual process (photocatalysis + photo-Fenton) in suspension and fixed-mode under artificial UV-A as well as under natural solar radiations. Waste material such as foundry sand (FS) was exploited as a supplement for iron in case of photo-Fenton reaction. The distinct processes including photocatalysis and photo-Fenton were found to be competent for the degradation of PNZ as both processes revealed an almost 90-95% removal of PNZ after 180 min of UV irradiations. The degradation was improved to a great extent with remarkable reduction in treatment time of PNZ to almost 105 min when these two individual processes were combined together within the same unit. An almost 14% synergy of dual process over distinct processes was obtained. For fixed-bed studies, TiO2 immobilized hollow circular composite disc already containing FS was utilized which yielded an almost 96% reduction in the concentration of PNZ after 4 h of solar irradiations. The disc was recycled 10 times and its stability and activity was confirmed through XRD, SEM/EDS, and DRS. The mineralization of PNZ was confirmed through significant reduction in COD and generation of anions during the treatment process. The transformation products were examined through GC-MS analysis. The novel technique of in-situ dual process especially in fixed-mode visualized in this study by employing renewable energy and durable catalyst can represent a viable solution to various industries for the treatment of wastewater comprising of bio-recalcitrant pollutants.

AB Personal care products and pharmaceuticals have been reported in various concentrations in the effluent of municipal sewage treatment plants (STP). Although they are generally found in the nanogram to microgram per liter range, many of them might have adverse health effects on humans at these concentrations. Conventional treatments applied at the STP are unable to effectively remove most of these recalcitrant compounds, thus there is a necessity for development of alternative treatment techniques. In this article, the efficiency of enzymatic treatment using soybean peroxidase in treating some commonly found micropollutants is discussed. The target compounds were, two phenolic surfactant breakdown products, nonylphenol and octylphenol, two antimicrobial agents, Triclosan and sulfamethoxazole and three phenolic steroids. The effects of the most important parameters pH, enzyme concentration and peroxide concentration have been evaluated for each compound. The treatment of synthetic wastewater was shown to be effective (95% removal), except for sulfamethoxazole, in concentration ranges of 10s of mu M at neutral pH with 2-5mU/L of catalytic activity and 2-3 molar equivalents of hydrogen peroxide. The effectiveness of the treatment has also been determined for lower concentrations (6-9nM) which approximate those in real wastewater. A matrix effect was found in the treatment of Triclosan in spiked real wastewater indicating that re-optimization of important parameters for STP treatment would be required to achieve high removal efficiency. A reverse-phase, solid-phase extraction technique was used to concentrate target analytes in real wastewater, enabling chromatographic detection by UV absorbance.

AB Despite the worldwide presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, a comprehensive picture of their aquatic risk (AR) at the global scale has not yet been produced. Here, we present a procedure to estimate ARs of human pharmaceuticals at a freshwater ecoregion level. First, we predicted country- and year-specific per capita consumption with a regression model. Second, we calculated spatially explicit freshwater concentrations via a combination of mass balance models, addressing the pharmaceutical's fate in respectively humans, wastewater treatment plants and the environment. Finally, we divided the freshwater concentrations at the level of individual freshwater ecoregions with the regulatory limit value derived from toxicity tests to come to an ecoregion-specific AR. We applied our procedure to model time-trends (1995-2015) of ARs of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin, two widely detected and regulatory relevant human use pharmaceuticals. Our analysis of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin showed that ARs, due to exposure to these human pharmaceuticals, typically increased 10-20 fold over the last 20 years. Risks due to carbamazepine exposure were still typically low for the time period assessed (AR < 0.1), although some more densely populated and/or arid ecoregions showed higher ARs (up to 1.1). Risks for ciprofloxacin were found to be much higher with ARs larger than 1 for 223 out of 449 freshwater ecoregions in 2015. Comparison with measured concentrations in ten river basins showed that carbamazepine concentrations were predicted well. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin, measured in four river basins, were, however, generally underestimated by our model with one to two orders of magnitude. We conclude that our procedure provides a good starting point to evaluate ARs of a wide range of human pharmaceuticals at the global scale.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a potential endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC), which produces an adverse impact on aquatic life and human beings. Wastewater discharge is considered as the primary source of triclosan in water bodies. The study is aimed to investigate the occurrence and environmental risk of triclosan released by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). An analytical protocol was developed and validated to determine the presence of TCS in the samples through offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography - electron spray ionization (ESI)quadrupole mass spectrum (LC/ESI/MS). The limit of detection and quantification of protocol was estimated as 2.8ng/L and 6.25ng/L, respectively. The season-wise influent and effluent samples from two WWTP in Chennai, India, were monitored. The TCS concentrations in samples were found in the range of 443 to 1757ng/L. The Risk Quotient (RQ) method was performed to evaluate the environmental (ecotoxicological and human health) risk associated with the exposure of TCS-containing wastewater. The results of the study revealed that primary producer (algae) was highly vulnerable to exposure of TCS in the aquatic environment. The estimated daily intake of TCS was much lower than the reference dosage, and this indicates that TCS did not produce any considerable risk to human health. Also, it suggested that additional treatment was required for complete removal of triclosan residues.

AB The biochar prepared from plantain wood was used to remove Cephalexin antibiotic from aqueous solutions. The effect of some operational parameters such as pH (1-10), contact time (0-120 min), Cephalexin concentration (10, 50, and 100 mg/L), adsorbent dose (0.2-4 g/L), and temperature (10 degrees C-60 degrees C) was evaluated and optimized. The micropore surface area and micropore volume of the biochar were determined to be 896 m(2)/g and 0.472 cm(3)/g, respectively. In the optimum conditions (pH = 6.7, initial concentration of Cephalexin = 50 mg/L, contact time = 60 min, and adsorbent dose = 2 g/L), the removal efficiency was 88.5%. The adsorption isotherm of Cephalexin follows the Langmuir model. Thermodynamic results revealed that the process was endothermic, and the kinetics study confirmed that the adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order reaction. The results of this study indicate that the biochar prepared from the plantain wood can be used as a suitable and cost-effective technology for the removal of Cephalexin from aqueous solutions with high removal efficiency.

AB Land application of wastewater effluent is beneficial for recharging groundwater aquifers and avoiding direct pollutant discharges to surface waters. However, the fate of non-regulated organic wastewater pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), in such wastewater reuse systems is understudied. Here, a 14-month study (October 2016 through December 2017) was conducted to evaluate the fate and potential risks of seven commonly used PPCPs in a local wastewater treatment plant (WWFP) and from 13 groundwater monitoring wells at a spray-irrigation site where effluent has been spray-irrigated since the early 1980s. Acetaminophen and trimethoprim were the most frequently detected (93%) PPCPs in WWI? influent, while in the effluent, caffeine and trimethoprim were detected most frequently (70%). Wastewater treatment generally reduced concentrations of acetaminophen and caffeine by >88%: however, some compounds had low removal or were present at higher concentrations in the effluent compared with influent (e.g. naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ofloxacin). Seasonal trends were observed, with higher PPCP concentrations in the WWTP influent and effluent in the winter. Risk calculations conducted on the wastewater effluent suggest that the risk posed by PPCPs that persisted in the effluent are medium to high to aquatic organisms. Detection frequencies of PPCPs were lower in groundwater samples compared to the effluent, with sulfamethoxazole (40%) and caffeine (32%) as the most frequently detected compounds. Similarly, average concentrations of PPCPs in groundwater were found to be nearly two orders of magnitude lower than concentrations in the effluent Minimal seasonal influence was observed for groundwater samples. Human health risk assessments indicate that concentrations in groundwater, which is used as a drinking water source, appear to pose minimal risk. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The pollution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been highlighted on a global scale because of their serious threats to the environment and human health. Typical urban water in cities with high population density are ideal mediums for the acquisition and spread of antibiotics and ARGs. The pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs in hospital wastewater, groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates through three sewage treatment plants (STPs) were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the 11 detected antibiotics ranged from not detected (ND)-16800 ng L-1 in diverse water samples from Beijing, and fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in the hospital samples. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics in STPs and hospital were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the surface water from Wenyu River and groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by treatment processes were observed for tetracyclines and quinolones, and low removal efficiencies were observed for sulfonamides and macrolides. These results also revealed that the sulfonamide resistance genes (sull, sul2) and macrolide resistance genes (ermB) were detected at the highest relative abundances (7.11 x 10(-2)-1.18 x 10(-1)) in the water bodies of Beijing. It was worth noting that sull abundance was the highest in groundwater samples. The relative abundance of most ARGs in STPs exhibited a declining trend in the order of influent > secondary effluents > effluent. However, the relative abundance of sul 1, sul 2 and tetC in the effluent was higher than those in the influent. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in STPs poses a serious threat to the receiving rivers, and affects ecosystem security. Overall, our findings provide favorable support for a further investigation of the spread and risk of antibiotics and ARGs from diverse sources (e.g., STPs and hospitals) to the aquatic environment.

AB Antidepressant drugs such as Venlafaxine (VFX) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODMVFX) are emerging contaminants that are commonly detected in aquatic environments, since conventional wastewater treatment plants are unable to completely remove them. They can be precursors of hazardous byproducts, such as the carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), generated upon water chlorination, as they contain the dimethylamino moiety, necessary for the formation of NDMA. In this study, the capability of three white rot fungi (Trametes versicolor, Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus) to remove both antidepressants from water and to decrease NDMA formation potential was investigated. Furthermore, transformation by-products (TPs) generated along the treatment process were elucidated and also correlated with their NDMA formation potential.
   Very promising results were obtained for T. versicolor and G. lucidum, both being able to remove up to 100% of ODMVFX. In the case of VFX, which is very recalcitrant to conventional wastewater treatment, a 70% of removal was achieved by T versicolor, along with a reduction in NDMA formation potential, thus decreasing the associated problems for human health and the environment. However, the NDMA formation potential remained practically constant during treatment with G. lucidum despite of the equally high VFX removal (70%). This difference was attributed to the generation of different TPs during both fungal treatments. For example, G. lucidum generated more ODMVFX, which actually has a higher NDMA formation potential than the parent compound itself. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The frequent detection of artificial sweeteners (ASs) in wastewater and surface water gives rise to concerns about their removal, Acesulfame (ACE) and sucralose (SUC) are two ASs that are difficult to remove. The ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation technology (AOT) is being considered as an effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater. However, the study of the degradation of ASs in real wastewater by the UV/PS is minimal. This study investigated the kinetics and modeling of ACE and SUC degradation in wastewater by the UV/PS process. Both ACE and SUC could be degraded effectively using this process. The degradation of ACE was mainly attributed to UV photolysis (51%), HO center dot (26%) and SO4 center dot- (16%), while that of SUC was mainly attributed to HO center dot (68%) and SO4 center dot- (27%). The second-order rate constants of ASs with SO4 center dot- were significantly lower than that with HO center dot. Three major transformation products (TPs) of ACE and four major TPs of SUC were identified. Additionally, the effects and mechanisms of the water matrices, such as HCO3-, Cl-, NO3- and natural organic matter (NOM), on ASs degradation were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM). NOM and Cl- significantly inhibited the degradation of ACE in the UV/PS system, whereas NOM and HCO3- played a main inhibition role on the degradation of SUC. A water matrices parameter model for predicting ASs degradation in real wastewater was established by RSM for the first time, and the removal of ACE and SUC was well predicted by the model.

AB This study combined data of the concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products (PPCPs) in the sediments and the biological responses of the Atherinella brasiliensis fish in two different sites and climate seasons in the Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia, Southeast Brazil. The presence of metals, PAHs, and PPCPs were observed in the sediments demonstrating the contamination throughout the system with contributions of sewage and residues disposal, oil and combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. Higher contaminations were identified in the point of greater human presence (C - Cananeia City), especially during the cold-dry season. The influence of anthropic activities and variations in the estuarine conditions, such as lower hydrodynamics during the lower rainfall period, were observed. In fish, spatial and seasonal changes in the parameters of oxidative stress and biotransformation, genotoxicity and histopathological alterations followed the same trend, with more pronounced responses in C in the cold-dry season. The biological responses of the fish revealed adverse effects in the local species population and indicated the presence of metals, PAHs and PPCPs as stressors. The multivariate analysis and the integrated biomarker response index (IBR) corroborated with these results, also indicating that site C had the worst environmental quality. The present study provides new information about the contamination of the sediments of Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia and the chronic exposure to contaminants in A. brasiliensis. Therefore, contributing to a better understanding of the local environmental quality with data that can support protective management of the area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Households in rural locations utilize septic tanks for wastewater treatment and can cause surface water contamination. A new methodology was developed to help investigate the role septic tanks play in the dissemination of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, personal care products and stimulants in the aqueous environment. Simultaneous analysis of 16 chiral and achiral anthropogenic markers was achieved using a Chirobiotic V2 (R) enantioselective column in polar ionic mode. The optimized method achieved quantitation limits for 16 compounds in the range 0.001-2.9 mu g L-1 and 0.0002-0.43 mu g L-1 for septic tank effluent and stream water, respectively. Application of the method to samples collected in North East Scotland found caffeine to be ubiquitous in all samples studied suggesting it as a good indicator of septic tank discharge. In rural streams studied, concentrations of all prescription drugs investigated were <= 0.02 mu g L-1. However, analgesics and stimulants were at high concentration in one location indicating direct discharge of septic tank wastewater (i.e., not dissipated through a soak away). For example, paracetamol, cotinine and caffeine were measured at 1100 mu g L-1, 31 mu g L-1 and 200 mu g L-1, respectively, which is comparable to septic tank effluents. Furthermore, S(+)-amphetamine and R(-)-amphetamine were present in this stream sample at 0.20 and 0.27 mu g L-1. This corresponds to an enantiomeric fraction of 0.43, which is typical of untreated wastewaters in the UK. Findings illustrate further study on the diffuse impact of septic tanks to surface water is needed and can be supported using this new multi-residue enantioselective method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, the partition of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in colloid-bound and truly dissolved phases in municipal wastewater before and after advanced treatment processes was determined. The effluents, which were filtered using a 0.45 mu m membrane, were further separated with the 1 kDa cross-flow ultrafiltration system into two phases, namely, colloidal phase (0.45 mu m-1 kDa) and soluble phase (<1 kDa), and the partition coefficients of typical EDCs to colloids (Kcoc) were calculated. The removal of typical EDCs and their estrogenic activity in secondary effluent by coagulation sedimentation (CS), granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, magnetic ion exchange resin (NDMP), and ozone processes was compared. Results show that the percentages of colloid-bound EDCs were noteworthy and ranged between 7.8% and 44.3% in secondary effluents. The reduction in EDCs resulting from the GAC adsorption process was positively correlated to their logKcoc, thus suggesting that the adsorption of EDCs onto granular activated carbon and colloids exhibited a similar phenomenal character. Ozone oxidation was most effective in removing both colloidal phase and soluble phase EDCs, whereas CS displayed a relatively adequate performance in reducing colloidal EDCs. EDCs with lower Kow values exhibited higher removal by ion exchange resin. The combination of modified NDMP and ozonation processes achieved the best performance in reducing estrogenic activity and satisfying the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC).

AB Diclofenac (DIC) is a new type of contaminant that has been widely detected in the water environment, posing threats to the ecological environment and human health. However, the conventional wastewater treatment process has a very limited ability to reduce DIC. In this research, persulfate is added to electro-Fenton with the three-dimensional particle electrode (TDE) process whose particle electrodes were formed from manganese slag with loaded active substance (Cu: Fe = 1:1) to construct a three-dimensional electro-Fenton-persulfate (3D electro-Fenton-PS) process to investigate the removal rate of DIC under the optimum working conditions. The effects of different persulfate addition, activator addition and different activators on the removal rate of DIC were researched, respectively. The removal rate of DIC reached 96.3% when the persulfate and the Fe-0 addition were 1,50 mM and 3.00 mM, respectively. The results showed that SO4 center dot- and center dot OH existed simultaneously in the reaction system, and the removal of DIC was the result of the two free radicals. Moreover, degradation pathways and mechanism of DIC were also discussed. The study may provide a new theoretical basis and technical support for the treatment of DIC in municipal wastewater.

AB This study established two mesophilic anaerobic digesters to ascertain the microbial dynamics and variation characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during sludge anaerobic digestion (AD) with high concentration of antibiotics. System parameters, microbial community, ARGs (tetA, tetM, tetW, sulI, sulII) and integrase gene of class 1 (intI1) were analyzed. General performance of AD showed methane production was inhibited by 17.1% under the pressure of antibiotics. Microbial 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results showed the richness of microbial community decreased, but a higher diversity was found with antibiotics added. Furthermore, microbial community structure at genus level was significantly changed. Real-time quantitative PCR of several target genes demonstrated that the adjunction of high concentration of antibiotics exerted a significant induction influence on ARGs, however, the abundance of intI1 decreased observably. Correlation analysis showed intI1 only played a small role in ARGs' transfer during AD, change of potential hosts was the key factor instead.

AB This work analyzes the effect of nalidixic acid (NAL) on the kinetics of the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass growth within a "NIPHO" activated sludge reactor treating municipal wastewater. Thus, the effect of this chemical in the degradation rates of carbon and nitrogen sources and net biomass growth rate is evaluated. Activated sludge samples were taken at three different operation conditions, changing the values of hydraulic retention time (2.8-3.8 h), biomass concentration (1400-1700 mgVSS L-1), temperature (12.6-14.8 degrees C), and sludge retention time (11.0-12.6 day). A respirometric method was applied to model the kinetic performance of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass in absence and presence of NAL, and a multivariable statistical analysis was carried out to characterize the influence of the operation variables on the kinetic response of the system, which was finally optimized. The results showed that there was no inhibitory effect of NAL on heterotrophic biomass, with an increase of net heterotrophic biomass growth rate from 1.70 to 6.73 mgVSS L-1 h(-1) at the most favorable period. By contrast, the autotrophic biomass was negatively affected by NAL, reducing the value of net autotrophic biomass growth rate from 25.37 to 10.29 mgVSS L-1 h(-1) at the best operation conditions. In general, biomass concentration and temperature had the highest influence on the degradation rate of carbon and nitrogen sources, whereas hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time were the most influential on net heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass growth rates.

AB Several advanced treatments, such as ozonation or activated carbon adsorption, are currently considered for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, little is known on the overall performances of a WWTP upgraded with those processes and the benefits provided regarding the elimination of multiple families of OMPs. In this study, 5 sampling campaigns were performed to determine the removal of 48 OMPs in a WWTP followed by an activated carbon pilot. The primary treatment had no effect on OMPs (removals < 20%), whereas the biological treatment removed OMPs that can be easily sorbed onto sludges or biodegraded (>60%). The additional elimination provided by the advanced treatment was not significant (<10%) for OMPs already well removed in the WWTP) but was substantial (>30%) for recalcitrant OMPs. Removals higher than 60% were obtained for all OMPs (except azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole) over the WWTP and the activated carbon pilot. The adsorption conditions (10 g/m(3) fresh activated 'Carbon addition) were not sufficient to achieve the 80% removal targeted in Switzerland for compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment. A higher dose of activated carbon or the combination with another advanced treatment should be used to achieve a satisfactory removal of those compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem that is both pressing and challenging due to the rate at which it is spreading, and the lack of understanding of the mechanisms that link human, animal and environmental sources contributing to its proliferation. One knowledge gap that requires immediate attention is the significance of antimicrobial residues and other pharmaceuticals that are being discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. In this work we provide an approach to develop a harmonized analytical method for 8 classes of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals that can be used for global monitoring in wastewater and receiving waters. Analysis of these trace organic chemicals in the influent and effluent wastewater, and in the respective upstream and downstream receiving waters from different countries across the globe is not trivial. Here, we demonstrated that sample preparation using solid-phase extraction (SPE) not only provides a convenient and cost-effective shipping of samples, but also adds stability to the analytes during international shipping. It is important that SPE cartridges are maintained at cold temperature during shipment if the duration is longer than 7 days because a significant decrease in recoveries were observed after 7 days in the cartridges stored at room temperature, especially for sulfonamides and tetracyclines. To compensate for sample degradation during shipment, and matrix effects in liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry, the use of stable isotope labeled compounds should be employed when available and affordable. The importance of applying a defined tolerance for the ion ratios (Q/q) that have been optimized for wastewater and surface water is discussed. The tolerance range was set to be the mean Q/q of the analyte standard at various concentrations +/- 40% for the influent, and +/- 30% for the effluent, upstream, and downstream samples; for tetracyclines and quinolones, however, the tolerance range was +/- 80% in order to minimize false negative and false positive detection. The optimized procedures were employed to reveal differences in antimicrobial and pharmaceutical concentrations in influent, effluent, and surface water samples from Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. The antimicrobials with the highest concentrations in influent and effluent samples were ciprofloxacin (48,103 ng/L, Hong Kong WWTP 1) and clarithromycin (5178 ng/L, India WWTP 2), respectively. On the other hand, diclofenac (108,000 ng/L, Sweden WWTP 2), caffeine (67,000 ng/L, India WWTP 1), and acetaminophen (28,000 ng/L, India WWTP 1) were the highest detected pharmaceuticals in the receiving surface water samples. Hong Kong showed the highest total antimicrobial concentrations that included macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonamides with concentrations reaching 60,000 ng/L levels in the influent. Antidepressants were predominant in Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.

AB Emerging contaminants have been considered one of the main concerns for ensuring the quality of water around the world. This work presents the results of 10 years of analyses carried out in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil) that has the high population density and intense agricultural and industrial activities. In this work 58 compounds (9 hormones, 14 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, 8 industrial compounds, 17 pesticides and 10 illicit drugs) were determined from 2006 to 2015 in 708 samples including raw and treated sewage, surface and ground and drinking waters. A preliminary risk assessment for aquatic life protection identified potential risks for caffeine, paracetamol, diclofenac, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, estrone, testosterone, triclosan, 4-n-nonylphenol, bisphenol A, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, fipronil, imidacloprid, malathion and tebuconazole. Drinking water criteria were available only for 22 compounds and for them no adverse effects were expected at the concentrations found, except for 17 beta-estradiol.

AB Cruise ship wastewater discharges are pollution sources towards the marine environment that are poorly characterized. In this study, wastewater samples from cruise ships have been obtained during repair works in a shipyard. Different organic pollutants have been analyzed and their concentrations were similar to those in urban wastewaters for pharmaceuticals and fragrances, but higher for UV filters and PAHs. For the first time, cypermethrin, a pesticide highly toxic towards aquatic species, was found at relevant concentrations (> 1 mu g L boolean AND-1). The faecal microorganisms were for all parameters higher than 10 boolean AND 4 CFU 100 mL boolean AND(-)1, which together with the presence of antibiotic compounds in wastewater (e.g., triclosan), could potentially lead to the generation of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). The historical position of cruise ships, determined from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), were used to define the time ships were underway, at port, or in repair. From ship's passenger and crew load, and from estimates of discharges the total volume of wastewater produced by these ships (371,000 m boolean AND 3 year boolean AND-1) and the average flow (0.15 +/- 0.03 m boolean AND 3crew boolean AND-1 day boolean AND-1) were calculated.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the response of bacteria, in terms of microbial community structure, from constructed wetland (CW) microcosms exposed to two veterinary antibiotics, enrofloxacin (ENR) and ceftiofur (CEF), alone or in a mixture, identifying which bacterial groups were dominant in CWs substrate during livestock wastewater treatment. Wastewater, not-doped or doped with ENR and/or CEF (100 mu g/L each), was treated during 18 one-week cycles. Systems showed removal percentages > 85% for the added antibiotics, showing also high removal percentages for nutrients and organic matter and confirming CWs systems were working properly. However, both time of exposure and presence of antibiotics influenced significantly CWs substrate bacterial community structure. Pyrosequencing results showed bacterial communities were dominated by phyla Proteobacteria (38-48%), Firmicutes (20-27%), Bacteroidetes (12-15%) and Actinobacteria (4-9%), and that their relative abundance was clearly affected by the presence of the antibiotics. Results suggest the applicability of CWs for the removal of veterinary antibiotics from livestock wastewaters and provide new knowledge about the bacteria within the system, which can potentially be involved in removal processes. This information could in the future be used to improve CWs removal rates of pharmaceuticals from livestock wastewaters.

AB A novel composite catalytic membrane is developed by blending silicon oxide coated ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4@SiO2) nanoparticles in polyether sulfone (PES) membrane as Fenton-like catalysts via liquid-induced phase separation (LIPS) method. By introducing Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles in PES membrane matrix, the surface hydrophilicity, porosity and mean pore diameter of as-prepared composite catalytic membranes are improved due to the hydrophilic nature of the SiO2 coating layer on the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles. The as-fabricated catalytic membrane can filter large particles above similar to 100 nm and shows a high water flux of 2084 kg m(-2) h(-1) under 0.1 MPa. Importantly, the composite catalytic membrane shows efficient catalytic performance and satisfactory stability in the degradation of organic pollutants based on the Fenton-like reaction mechanism. The proposed strategy for membrane fabrication and the experimental results in this study provide valuable guidance for developing high-flux catalytic membranes with efficient catalytic performances for treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater.

AB Semiconductor photocatalysis has been regarded as an environmentally friendly technology in wastewater treatment and energy production. Here, a series of direct Z-scheme MnIn2S4/g-C3N4 (MnISCN) photocatalysts without electron mediators were fabricated by a simple hydrothermal route on the basis of in-situ loading of MnIn2S4 (MnIS) nanoflakes on the surface of g-C3N4 (CN) nanosheets. Photocatalytic performances evaluated under visible light irradiation revealed these Z-scheme heterostructured photocatalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than single-component samples. The effect of weight ratio between MnIn2S4 nanoflakes and mesoporous CN nanosheets on photocatalytic activity towards treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was optimized to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic activities for both degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater and hydrogen generation compared with alone MnIS nanoflakes and isolated mesoporous CN nanosheets. The significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity could be primarily ascribed to the construction of Z-scheme MnISCN architectures, which effectively accelerated the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers via tight interface contacts built among these two components. The recycling experiments for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment revealed the excellent stability of MnISCN nanocomposites. The advantages of highly efficient photocatalytic activity and excellent stability endowed a promising potential for MnISCN nanocomposites to apply in photocatalytic fields.

AB In the present study, a pilot-scale ozonation system was introduced as post treatment to reduce the pharmaceuticals and toxicity in the effluent of a pilot-scale Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor ( MBBR) treating hospital wastewater. The ozonated effluent was polished further by suspended biofilm carriers to remove biodegradable organic matter and toxicity generated from ozonation by-products. A laboratory ozonation system was used to mimic the experiments, which were carried out at the pilot plant so that the removal of pharmaceuticals in the pilot and laboratory experiments could be compared. Delivered ozone dose achieved 90% removal of pharmaceutical was obtained and it was normalised to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These normalised results show that trimethoprim was eliminated by ozone easier than other pharmaceuticals.
   Fluorescence was found to be highly correlated to the removal of pharmaceuticals, and fluorescence with a wavelength of 275 nm of excitation and 310 nm of emission had the closest correlation. After polishing MBBR was introduced into the ozonated wastewater, half of its protein-like fluorophore was removed.
   The toxicity of the hospital wastewater during MBBR treatment was measured by Vibrio fischeri, the inhibition of which decreased from 80% to 50%. By applying ozonation, this inhibition reduced to 20%.

AB Supplementing nano zero valent iron (nZVI) is an attractive technology for wastewater treatment due to its advantages in accelerating the hydrolysis, fermentation and anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In this present study, nZVI was added to investigate its effects on enhancing tetracycline (TC) wastewater anaerobic treatment and the changes of microbial community, especially for underestimated syntrophic-methanogenic associations. The TC concentrations were 1, 10, 30, 50, 80, 100 and 150 mg/L with 0.38 g nZVI (with iron g/g VS of 0.50) complemented into reactors. Results revealed that nZVI could enhance AD process in both control and TC dosed systems, and the promoting effect on methanogenesis was more significant in systems of high concentration TC, with 100 and 150 mg/L. In addition, cumulative CH4 production for all TC added systems without nZVI were higher than the control indicating TC had positive effect instead of expected negative effect on AD process, high TC concentration of 100 and 150 mg/L only affecting the increase factor rather than causing inhibitory effect. After digestion, TC was largely removed in with/without nZVI systems. And also, nZVI evidently altered the bacterial and methanogenic community structure, with an increase abundance of syntrophic-methanogenic associations (Syntrophobacterales and Methanosarcinales) and resulting in the enhancement of methane generation. This research provides an efficient method for TC wastewater anaerobic treatment.

AB High-solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) is a promising method to centralizedly dispose dewatered sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Until now, few studies have focused on determining the different effects of antibiotic residues on methane yield and microbial communities over a wide range of antibiotic loads in HSAD system. This study investigated the effects of seven typical antibiotics (oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin) on HSAD over a wide range of loads (0-500 mg/L). The results showed that 10 mg/L of antibiotics had no obvious effect on CH4 yield. Interestingly, 100 mg/L of antibiotics exhibited a strong stimulating effect on CH4 yield. Antibiotics at a concentration of 500 mg/L generally suppressed CH4 yield at the initial stage of anaerobic digestion, and some systems recovered at the late stage of the process with a much higher daily CH4 yield than other systems. Among the three kinetics models, the modified Gompertz model showed the best fit to the experimental data (R-2: 0.9772-0.9997). Antibiotic residues did not have strong effects on the bacterial community, but did affect the archaeal community. The relative abundance of Methanosarcina increased while that of Methanosaeta and Methanoculleus decreased with the antibiotic concentrations increasing. The heat map showed that the archaeal community in the system with 500 mg/L was characterized by Methanobacteriales and Halobacteriales. This study provides a new insight into the different effects of antibiotics on HSAD.

AB The coupling of biological with advanced oxidation processes for the removal of 13 pharmaceuticals is reported in this study. The efficiency of this system was examined by using two ligninolytic fungi, Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma lucidum. Pharmaceuticals' removal was examined by using four different quinone substances (1,4-benzoquinone, 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and gallic acid). The quinone redox cycling mechanism of the fungal species promotes the production of hydrogen peroxide for subsequent decomposition to non-selective and highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals in presence of Fe(III)-oxalate. Results evidenced that the most effective mediators for T. versicolor and G. lucidum were 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and gallic acid (GA), respectively. Time-course experiments showed that higher concentrations of Fe(II) were produced using DMBQ and GA, suggesting that the efficiency of the mediator in reducing Fe(III) is linked to the removal of pharmaceuticals. The application of DMBQ in the redox cycling process of T. versicolor resulted to 60-100% removal for all the pharmaceuticals, due to the high affinity of laccase enzyme for DMBQH(2). The advanced bio-oxidation of T. versicolor was tested for hospital wastewater treatment. Results showed a decrease of the elimination degree for pharmaceuticals as compared to the previous bioassays conducted with a synthetic medium. Nevertheless, significant removals (30-100%) were achieved by using DMBQ and GA as mediators of the redox cycle for T. versicolor under the non-sterilized conditions of the hospital wastewater. The use of GA is of great importance since its phenolic form, equivalent to the hydroquinone form, is considered as a critical parameter in Fe(III) reduction.

AB Hospital wastewater contains pharmaceutical residues, chemicals, and pathogens that cause coloration and nourish pathogenic microorganisms. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a medical wastewater treatment system at Military Hospital 175 (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) that combined a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system with nanofiltration (NF). The influent of the system was the wastewater discharged from the operating rooms of the hospital. The system has a capacity of 50 L/day and operates at three organic load rates (OLR) of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 kgCOD/m(3)day (COD: Chemical oxygen demand), in which each load rate operates for 40 days. The results showed that most nutritional criteria generally achieved positive results. Specifically, the average COD removal was shown to be consistently high throughout the three phases at 94%, 93.3%, and 92.7%, respectively. For removal of nitrogen, the system demonstrated efficiencies of 75%, 79%, and 83%, respectively, to three phases. The log removal value (LRV) for Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria were higher than four throughout the study period. The average removal efficiency for color and total iron was approximately 98% and 99%, respectively. The water quality after treatment, especially after NF, meets the Vietnamese standard of grade A. The arrangement in which the MBR preceded NF was also found to limit the amount of soil and solids entering subsequent treatment, which therefore improved the efficiency of NF, as demonstrated by the stability of post-NF transmembrane pressures throughout three cycles renewed by two backwashes.

AB In the present study, sorption of pharmaceuticals ((acetaminophen (ACP), carbamazepine (CBZ)) and personal care products (bisphenol A (BPA), caffeine (CAFF), triclosan (TCS)) using a graphene oxide (GO)-based composite adsorbent was extensively studied. Structural characterization indicated the incorporation of activated carbon and chitosan onto the GO. For both classes of pollutants, the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. On the other hand, the Langmuir isotherm showed a better fit compared to the Freundlich isotherm. Maximum adsorption capacities of ACP, CBZ, BPA, CAFF, and TCS were found to be 13.7, 11.2, 13.2, 14.8, and 14.5 mg/g, respectively. Desorption of ACP, BPA, and CAFF was significantly higher in a polar solvent (70%-80%), whereas CBZ and TCS were able to desorb (60%) in a nonpolar solvent. DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption mechanism is majorly accompanied by size-related diffusion and also a minor contribution by synergetic combination of hydrophobic/hydrophilic, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and pi-pi interactions. Overall, the prepared composite material showed enhanced structural stability along with higher removal characteristics toward multiple emerging contaminants in water and wastewater.

AB In this work, a granular activated carbon (GAC) was produced using primary paper mill sludge (PS) as raw material and ammonium lignosulfonate (AL) as binder agent. PS is a residue from the pulp and paper industry and AL is a by-product of the cellulose pulp manufacture and the proposed production scheme contributes for their valorisation together with important savings in GAC precursors. The produced GAC (named PSA-PA) and a commercially available GAC (GACN), used as referencematerial, were physically and chemically characterized. Then, these materials were tested in batch experiments for the adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and paroxetine (PAR) from ultra-pure water and wastewater. Even though GACN and PSA-PA possess very similar specific surface areas (S-BET) (629 and 671 m(2) g(-1), respectively), PSA-PA displayed lowermaximum adsorption capacities (qm) than GACN for the pharmaceuticals here studied (6 +/- 1-44 +/- 5 mg g(-1) and 49 +/- 6-106 +/- 40 mg g(-1), respectively). This may be related to the comparatively higher incidence of mesopores in GACN, which might have positively influenced its adsorptive performance. Moreover, the highest hydrophobic character and degree of aromaticity of GACN could also have contributed to its adsorption capacity. On the other hand, the performance of both GACs was significantly affected by the matrix in the case of CBZ and SMX, with lower qm in wastewater than in ultra-pure water. However, the adsorption of PAR was not affected by thematrix. Electrostatic interactions and pH effectsmight also have influenced the adsorption of the pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that alter the function of the endocrine system and consequently cause adverse effects to humans or wildlife. The release of particular EDCs into the environment has been shown to negatively affect certain wildlife populations and has led to restrictions on the use of some EDCs. Current chemical regulations aim to balance the industrial, agricultural and/or pharmaceutical benefits of using these substances with their demonstrated or potential harm to human health or the environment. A summary is provided of the natural science evidence base informing the regulation of chemicals released into the environment that may have endocrine disrupting effects on wildlife. This summary is in a format (a 'restatement') intended to be policy-neutral and accessible to informed, but not expert, policy-makers and stakeholders.

AB In arid and semi-arid areas the use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation and other agricultural practices, such as the use of pesticides, increase the number of emerging contaminants (ECs) in crops. Hazards of these practices to human being are largely unknown since there are few studies yet covering a short range of compounds and most of them under non-realistic conditions. This study aims at assessing this problem that will become global soon in an area of Saudi Arabia heavily affected by the reuse of treated wastewater and pesticide in order to ascertain its scale. The novelty of the study relays in the large number of ECs covered and the variety of crops (cabbage, barley, green beans, eggplants, chili, tomato and zucchini) analysed. Extraction procedure developed provided an appropriate extraction yield (up to 50% of the compounds were recovered within a 70-120% range), with good repeatability (relative standard deviations below 20% in most cases) and sensitivity (LOQ b 25 ng g(-1)) for the model compounds. Determination by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QqTOF-MS) is able to identify >2000 contaminants. Sixty-four ECs were identified in wastewater but of the sixty-four compounds, six pharmaceuticals (atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine and its metabolites 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and naproxen) and seven pesticides (acetamiprid, atrazine deethyl, azoxystrobin, bupirimate, diazinon, malathion, pirimicarb and some of their metabolites) were detected in plants. Furhermore, one metabolite of the ibuprofen (not detected in water or soil), the ibuprofen hexoside was also found in plants. Up to our knowledge, this study demonstrate for the first time the accumulation of ECs in crops irrigated with treated wastewater under real non-controlled environmental conditions.

AB Pharmaceuticals and many other chemicals are an important basis for nearly all sectors including for example, food and agriculture, medicine, plastics, electronics, transport, communication, and many other products used nowadays. This comes along with a tremendous chemicalization of the globe, including ubiquitous presence of products of chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the aquatic environment. Use of these products will increase with population growth and living standard as will the need for clean water. In addition, climate change will exacerbate availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality. Since its implementation, conventional wastewater treatment has increasingly contributed to environmental protection and health of humans. However, with the increasing pollution of water by chemicals, conventional treatment turned out to be insufficient. It was also found that advanced effluent treatment methods such as extended filtration, the sorption to activated charcoal or advanced oxidation methods have their own limitations. These are, for example, increased demand for energy and hazardous chemicals, incomplete or even no removal of pollutants, the generation of unwanted products from parent compounds (transformation products, TPs) of often-unknown chemical structure, fate and toxicity. In many countries, effluent treatment is available only rarely if at all let alone advanced treatment. The past should teach us, that focusing only on technological approaches is not constructive for a sustainable water quality control. Therefore, in addition to conventional and advanced treatment optimization more emphasis on input prevention is urgently needed, including more and better control of what is present in the source D water. Measures for input prevention are known for long. The main focus though has always been on the treatment, and measures taken at the source have gained only little attention so far. A more effective and efficient approach, however, would be to avoid pollution at the source, which would in turn allow more targeted treatment to meet treated water quality objectives globally. New developments within green and sustainable chemistry are offering new approaches that allow for input prevention and a more targeted treatment to succeed in pollution elimination in and at the source. To put this into practice, engineers, water scientists and chemists as well as microbiologists and scientists of other related disciplines need to cooperate more extensively than in the past. Applying principles such as the precautionary principle, or keeping water flows separate where possible will add to this. This implies not minimizing the efforts to improve wastewater treatment but to design effluents and chemicals in such a way that treatment systems and water environments can cope successfully with the challenge of micropollutants globally (Kummerer et al., 2018).
   This paper therefore presents in its first part some of the limitations of effluent treatment in order to demonstrate the urgent need for minimizing water pollution at the source and, information on why source management is urgently needed to improve water quality and stimulate discussions how to protect water resources on a global level. Some principles of green and sustainable chemistry as well as other approaches, which are part of source management, are presented in the second part in order to stimulate discussion.

AB This study evaluated the occurrence and distribution of 81 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the vulnerable area of the Ebro Delta region (Catalonia, Spain), to assess the environmental impact of wastewater treatment plants discharge to coastal environments. The occurrence of PhACs was followed along the wastewater-recipient water-sediment chain until they reach estuaries and the Mediterranean Sea. Water and sediment samples were collected in an integrated way at different sampling points covering three different seasons in reaches of the Ebro River located upstream and downstream from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surrounding channels, estuaries, and the associated receiving seawater. 28 out of the 57 compounds detected in effluent wastewater were positively identified in estuary and seawaters, revealing that WWTP discharges are an important source of contamination in coastal environments and that PhACs are suitable markers of urban contamination in these areas. The substances with the highest frequency of detection belonged to the groups of analgesics/anti-inflammatories (acetaminophen, salicylic acid), antihypertensives (valsartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine), and antibiotics (clarithromycin, trimethoprim). In general, a decrease in concentration was observed from inland sampling points towards the Mediterranean Sea, resulting from a dilution in the recipient marine water bodies. A reduced number of PhACs, at concentrations ranging from0.1 to 12.5 ng g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) was detected in sediment samples, indicating that sorption is a minor natural attenuation pathway for these compounds. Finally, a prioritization strategy, based on the compounds concentration and frequency of detection in seawater, removal efficiency in WWTP, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity to marine organisms and persistency, was used to highlight the PhACs of major ecological concern and that could be used as relevant indicators of wastewater contamination in coastal environments.

AB This study quantifies the removal of amixture of commonly detected emerging contaminants, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 4-nonylphenol (NP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) fromsynthetic wastewater using aerobic granular sludge in a sequential batch reactor. The emerging contaminant concentration in the influent wastewater was maintained near 500 mu g/L for the duration of the experiment. Removal of EE2, NP, and CBZ is comprised of both adsorption and degradation. In general, the main removalmechanism for the emerging contaminants was initially adsorption, however it transitions to degradation as the adsorption capacity is saturated. The stabilized degradation for EE2 and NP in the SBR, was 16.09 mu g/g and 20.05 mu g/g, respectively. There was limited degradation of CBZ during the anaerobic phase. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms fit the data well and constants for the equations are calculated. The constants for the Langmuir Isotherm are found to be (X/m)(max)= 36.23, b= 0.0019 for EE2 and (X/m)(max) = 44.25, b= 0.0004 for CBZ. None of the tested compounds were found to be detrimental to the performance of the aerobic granules, and high macronutrient removal efficiency was maintained. The granule sludge bed and particle size were not negatively affected by EE2 and NP, however, carbamazepine appeared to interfere with the mechanism of granule formation resulting in a decrease in particle size during the experiment.

AB The OECD 309 guideline uses spiked incubation tests to provide data on biodegradation kinetics in surface waters. However, potential limitations of spiking test chemicals into the studied water have not been investigated. We conducted the OECD 309 test with unspiked surface water relying on chemical residues present in the water. Parallel experiments were conducted with the same water spiked with 13 chemicals at higher concentrations (50 mu g L-1). Six chemicals detected in both the spiked and the unspiked systems were biodegraded. For each chemical the concentration change over time differed between the systems. Tramadol and venlafaxine showed constant concentrations in the spiked systems but increasing concentrations in the unspiked systems. Atenolol and metoprolol showed first-order elimination with no lag in the unspiked systems, compared to a lag of 15-28 d followed by zero-order elimination kinetics in the spiked systems. Acesulfame was only slightly degraded (<50%) in the unspiked system, while removal was complete (>99%) in the spiked systems. Gabapentin displayed a complex behavior where the features differed markedly between the spiked and the unspiked systems. We conclude that spiking can strongly influence biodegradation, reducing the environmental relevance of test results.

AB Aeration accounts for the largest energy demand in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment. Emerging aeration control strategies for energy conservation have significantly reduced operational bulk liquid dissolved oxygen (DO) from above 2 mg/L to at or below 0.5 mg/L. As we move toward low DO treatment processes, there is a need to understand how low DO impacts the kinetics of micropollutant biotransformation. The objective of this study was to characterize the impact of DO concentration on pharmaceutical biotransformation rates via two approaches: (1) Determine oxygen half saturation constants that describe the community-wide impact of DO on biotransformation rates. (2) Evaluate shifts in the microbial community 16S rRNA pool due to DO concentration. Batch experiments were performed at several DO concentrations using biomass from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Results reveal that substantial reductions in bulk liquid DO concentrations to 0.5 mg-O-2/L are possible without compromising pharmaceutical biotransformation rates. Sequencing of cDNA generated from community rRNA revealed that diverse, low abundance community members may play important roles in pharmaceutical transformation. The results of this work advance our ability to predict and model the impact of DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during wastewater treatment and identify taxonomic groups associated with those biotransformations.

AB Several novel fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs), fully miscible with water and with excellent surfactant behavior, have been studied for pharmacological applications. The use of these novel FILs as drug delivery systems can improve the bioavailability, stability and efficacy of therapeutic proteins. An initial screening of toxicity in four different human cell lines indicated that some of the FILs possess low cytotoxicity. An environmental hazard assessment of these compounds, in the context of Green Pharmacy, is necessary before a pharmaceutical application takes place. In this work, ecotoxicity tests have been performed in aquatic species with different levels of biological organization (Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna and Lemna minor) to evaluate intrinsic hazard that these FILs might pose after being released to the aquatic environment from the human body or from industrial processes. Additionally, the biodegradability of these compounds has been evaluated using microorganisms from wastewater treatment plants.

AB The deterioration in its strength from long-term degradation of organic matter and release of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have caused adverse environmental effects in municipal sewage sludge (MSS) landfill. Lime and a mixture of lime and mussel shell were employed as potential stabilization agents for MSS in this work. Their efficacy was assessed by investigating the effects on transformation of organic matter, as well as the occurrence and fate of four PhACs (fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, triclosan and carbamazepine) over 42 days. The addition of the selected agents: (i) prevented the microbial degradation of organic matter; (ii) modified the predominant functional groups of amide groups (amide I and II) and polysaccharides to deprotonated carboxylic groups and destruction of amide groups; and (iii) shifted the abundance of organic constituents from microbial by-products to humic acid-like organics with conformational changes. The measurement method provided reliable and precise results for determining PhAC concentrations in MSS with and without amendment, although matrix effects and process effects were found to affect measurement sensitivity. Available fractions of the PhACs increased in MSS with lime addition, but decreased in the presence of the mixture of lime and mussel shell due to the strong adsorption effects of the shells. The mixture of lime and mussel shell would be recommended for stabilizing MSS prior to being landfilled. However, longer term and larger scale investigation may be needed to better evaluate the applicability of lime and mussel shell for reducing the hazards and facilitating the management of MSS.

AB Antibiotic fermentative residues are categorized into hazardous wastes in China due to the existence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and residual antibiotics How to treat and manage these wastes is a new challenge. This paper investigated the treatment of erythromycin thiocyanate fermentation (EryTcF) residues using ionizing radiation technology for removing ARGs and antibiotics from the fermentation residues. The results showed that as exposed the EryTcF residues to gamma radiation, the abundance of four macrolide resistance genes (ereA, ermB, mefA and mpfB) decreased 1.0-1.3 log with 90-95% removal, and around 56% of erythromycin was removed at absorbed dose of 30 & kGy and room temperature (19-22 &degrees C). Direct action of gamma-ray radiation contributed to 42-53% of ARGs removal and indirect action (radicals' reaction) was mainly responsible for erythromycin removal (84%). The positive correlation between total ARGs and Shannon index was observed. The potential ARGs-linked hosts were assigned to genera Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae and their abundance decreased by 36-43% at 30 & kGy. Radiation has not obvious influence on the nutrient components of residues, such as protein content, suggesting that the radiation treated fermentative residues can be used as fertilizer, which is favorable for the development of recycling economy in antibiotic pharmaceutical factory. The results could provide a new insight into a sustainable management of antibiotic fermentative residuals.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are constantly released into natural waters, mainly from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) whose processes are unable to completely eliminate them. Among these drugs, the occurrence of benzimidazoles, a class of antiparasitics for human and veterinary use, has been reported in WWTP effluents and surface waters. In this study, an SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and optimized for extraction and quantitation of benzimidazoles in influents and effluents of a local WWTP and in hospital wastewater. The extraction procedure was optimized using response surface methodology (Box-Behnken design) and the optimal parameters were as follows: 2.0 mL of loading solvent consisting of a mixture of water:methanol (95:5, v/v) and temperature at 43 degrees C. In hospital wastewater, albendazole (ABZ) and its principal metabolite ricobendazole (RBZ) were the main benzimidazole-related contaminants and were found at concentrations of up to 3810 and 3894 ng L-1, respectively. The WWTP system was able to remove from 46% to 95% of the ABZ quantified in the influent, discharging an effluent with 16-441 ng L-1 of ABZ. The concentrations of other benzimidazoles and metabolites in the WWTP effluents remained below 350 ng L-1. WWTP effluents fortified with 50 mu g L-1 of ABZ required 26.7 mg(o3) L-1 to remove ABZ and RBZ. After ozonation, the COD and BOD5 of the effluents were reduced by 27%. Photolysis by UVA radiation was not effective to remove ABZ and FBZ from the effluent samples.

AB It is a great challenge to realize the effective removal and transform of emerging pharmaceuticals from aquatic environment. In this study, MnO2 was used as a catalyst to achieve the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in situ on the surface of three-dimensional graphene (3DG). The removal of TC were also evaluated at different temperature, pH and inorganic ions. Due to the synergistic effect of 3DG and MnO2, TC could be efficiently removed by 3DG/MnO2 composites. The removal data were fitted well with rate-retarded model, indicating that the adsorption of reaction products on the surface of 3DG/MnO2 composites could lead to saturation of surface and less reactive sites. Moreover, the reaction of TC with 3DG/MnO2 was endothermic, and reaction rate decreased with the increase of pH, due to the changes of properties of 3DG/MnO2 and TC. Inorganic ions could compete with TC for vacancy or the reactive sites on 3DG/MnO2 surface to inhibit the removal of TC. This work develops a potentially effective carbon material for simultaneous enrichment and degradation of organic pollutants and provides a new sustainable approach for wastewater treatment.

AB Erythromycin mycelial dreg (EMD) is a bio-fermentation residue of the pharmaceutical industry that may be used as a nutrient resource. However, the contaminants present in EMD need to be considered and controlled at an acceptable level prior to utilization. In this study, heat-activated persulfate (PS) oxidation of EMD was developed to degrade the residual erythromycin (ERY) and inactivate the ERY-resistant genes. The effects of temperature, initial PS concentration, and pH on the removal of ERY in EMD were studied. The results revealed that 99.0% ERY was degraded by 25 g PS/kg EMD under 80 degrees C within 120 min. The apparent rate constant (k(app)) in the acidic condition was higher than that in the alkaline condition. The contribution of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) on ERY removal in EMD was found to be 36.8% and 29.4%, respectively. Six intermediate products (IPs) of ERY were clarified, and total organic carbon (TOC) was efficiently reduced by 99.4%. Finally, the detected ERY-resistant genes ere(B), erm(A), and erm(B) obviously presented a reduction during the heat-activated PS oxidation process.

AB For sustainable production, there is an urgent need to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of swine farming, which is a major contributor of the pollutants p-cresol and tylosin. Novel reactive composite alginate beads (CAB-MOACs) were fabricated by combining alginate with activated carbon (AC) and MnO2 recovered from spent battery waste and used for efficient removal of p-cresol and tylosin from water. Batch experiments were carried out under varying pH (3-11), temperature (15-50 degrees C), and agitation speed (50-200 rpm) to understand their effects on removal efficiency. The CAB-MOACs had better removal efficiency for p-cresol and tylosin than alginate beads alone or beads containing only AC or MnO2. Adsorption to CAB-MOACs followed pseudo-second-order kinetics (R-2 >= 0.98) and Langmuir isotherm models (R-2 >= 0.95). CAB-MOACs showed higher removal efficiency (similar to 99.9% after 10 h) compared to beads containing only immobilized MnO2 (60-70%) or AC (94-96%). Regeneration and reuse performance of the CAB-MOACs was excellent through five cycles, although slightly better for p-cresol than tylosin. With low-cost manufacturing and beneficial utilization of hazardous waste such as spent batteries, the newly developed composite beads show potential as an effective adsorbent for treating wastewater effluent containing emerging contaminants like p-cresol and tylosin. Future studies may focus on product refinement and large-scale testing on actual wastewaters.

AB Alarming growth of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environment has elevated concerns about their potential impact on human health. Taking cognizance of this, the present study is focussed on the coating of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with different functionalities and to use them as adsorbents for pharmaceutical waste. The thickness of the coating was analysed using Small angle X-ray scattering technique. Thorough study of the isotherms and kinetics were performed suggesting monolayer adsorption and pseudo kinetic order model, respectively. To get an insight of the interactions liable for adsorption of fluoroquinolones over the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles computational studies were undertaken. The results demonstrated substantial evidence proposing remarkable potential of these nanostructures as adsorbents for different pollutants with an additional advantage of stability and facile recoverability with a view to treat wastewater.

AB The detection of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater has triggered human and ecological health concerns. As highly toxic compounds, chemotherapy agents (CM), such as the cyclophosphamide (CYP) and ifosfamide (IFO) structural isomers, represent a unique threat. This research elucidated the fate of CYP and IFO during ozonation and advanced oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot). Novel semi-batch reactors were used to determine the second-order rate constants for CYP and IFO with O-3 and HO center dot. These reactors provided independent control of the oxidant exposure through continuous and constant aqueous ozone and peroxone (O-3-H2O2) addition. The rate constants for transformation of CYP and IFO by ozone were 2.58 +/- 0.40 M(-1)s(-1) and 6.95 +/- 0.21 M(-1)s(-1), respectively, indicating that ozone alone is not suitable for treating CAs. Transformation of CYP and IFO by hydroxyl radicals was fast, with rate constants of 2.69(+/- 0.17) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) and 2.73(+/- 0.16) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1), respectively. The major transformation products formed by O-3 and HO center dot attack consisted of the 4-hydroxy-, 4-keto-, dechloroethyl-, and imino-derivatives of CYP and IFO. Low yields of the active metabolites of the CM, namely phosphoramide mustard and isophosphoramide mustard, were detected. These findings suggest that treated water may retain the ability to alkylate DNA and confer toxicity.

AB Simvastatin is one of themost commonly cholesterol-lowering prescribed drugs all over the world. With the increase of consumption of these pharmaceuticals and subsequent their discharge into the aquatic environment in recent years, they are present at detectable levels in most sewage effluents. Unfortunately, limited information is provided about their potential impacts on aquatic organisms, especially on the detoxification-related metabolism in fish. In the present study, one local native benthic fish (Mugilogobius abei) in southern China was employed as test species and exposed to SV (0.5 mu g L-1, 5 mu g L-1, 50 mu g L-1 and 500 mu g L-1) for 72 h. The transcriptional expression of nucleus transcriptional factor pregnane X receptor (PXR) and its downstream targeted genes including multixenobiotics resistance protein or permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), cytochrome 1A (CYP1A), cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the expression of associated microRNA such as miR-27, miR-34 and miR-148 in Mugilogobius abei were investigated. Result showed that the expressions of P-gp, CYP 1A, CYP 3A, GST and PXR were induced to some extend under simvastatin exposure for 72 h. A positive correlation was observed between PXR and CYP1A, CYP3A and P-gp. While for microRNA, a negative relationship was found between miR-34a and CYP3A, CYP1A. The expression of miR-148a was significantly induced under the exposure of SV (50 mu g L-1), which was positive related to the transcriptional expression of PXR. For enzyme activity, erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) significantly increased at 24 h and the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) exhibited different trends. CAT was slightly inhibited at 24 h exposure but SOD was significantly induced in high concentration. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was significant inhibited after 72 h exposure. The reductive smallmolecule glutathione (GSH) content showed obvious decrease, while the quantity of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly in high concentrations of SV exposure. GSH and MDA showed a typical negative correlation to some degree. Moreover, simvastatin caused histological changes in the liver tissues of M. abei, especially the size of adipocyte significantly decreased. The present study indicated that environmentally relevant concentration SV may affect the PXR signaling pathway in M. abei and pose potential ecological risks to non-target organisms like fish.

AB The object of this study was to remove the tetracycline (TC) residue in pharmaceutical wastewater after flocculation treatment. MnO2/graphene nanocomposite was synthesized by an in situ hydrothermal method and its TC removal rate was up to 99.4%. This nanocomposite had excellent water solubility. More importantly, the introduction of MnO2 nanorods allowed the avoidance of excessive stacking of treated graphene sheets during the adsorption process, which made the TC molecules to have more opportunities to make contact with the adsorbents. In order to eliminate the interference factors, the adsorption isotherm, kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism were all studied in TC aqueous solution. The influence of solution pH, contact time, MnO2 loading amount, temperature and solution concentration on the adsorption process were also assessed. The main adsorption mechanism contributed to the complexation of Mn(IV) and pi-pi interactions of the benzene ring structure on treated graphene sheets with TC molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The long-term effects on soil microorganisms from 40 years of irrigating soil with reclaimed wastewater was investigated by determining the quantity, composition, and inter-species connection of microorganisms. No significant difference in microbial quantity and composition were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. The dominant bacterial phylum in both irrigation water sources and soils was Proteobacteria, which commonly exists in soil. From the analysis of four (4) alpha diversity metrics, including the observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity, there was no significant difference between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. Three zones (shallow, medium and deep) were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils based on the taxonomic networks and clusters generated by graphical lasso and random walk algorithm. The cluster profiles (shallow, medium and deep zones) appear to be different in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. Soil irrigated with reclaimed wastewater showed less depth of clustered profile in medium zone than that in soil irrigated with groundwater (20-60 cm of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil compared to 20-100 cm of groundwater-irrigated soil), although the significance of such a variance (the depth of medium zone of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil decreased 40 cm than that of groundwater-irrigated soil) is not clear at this time. Positive influence has been identified in the growth and yield of eggplant, tomato and cucumber between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils, suggesting that reclaimed wastewater irrigation can potentially substitute groundwater irrigation, despite the variance in inter-species clustering profiles in soil microbes in certain soil zones. Nevertheless, the possible negative influence of pathogens, organic compounds and pharmaceuticals should be seriously considered during the reclaimed wastewater irrigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biobed bioremediation systems (BBSs) arewidely used to prevent point-source pesticide contamination of water. However, these systems have never been investigated for possible elimination of emerging contaminants (ECs). In this study, two biobed systems, involving biomixtures elaborated with soil and raw olive mill cake (SCP) or its vermicompost (SVP), were assayed to determine their effectiveness in removing the ECs diclofenac, ibuprofen and triclosan from effluent wastewater. Adsorption, incubation and bioaccesibility experiments were carried out. The SCP and SVP biomixtures showed greater adsorption capacity than the soil (S), used as reference. In SVP and S, the degradation rates of the ECs applied were similar and over 94% of these compounds was removed after 84 days of incubation. However, SCP biomixture had a lower removal rate and the percentage of ECs removed ranged from 32 to 68%. In SVP, the bioaccesible fraction (E) reveals that approximately 82% of triclosan and diclofenac adsorption occurred in bioaccesible sites, thus explaining the more efficient decontamination observed in this biomixture. The relationship established between the bioaccesible and biodegradable fractions suggests that E values are a useful tool for predicting the endpoints of ECs biodegradation in bioremediation systems. UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis of samples showed different metabolite products. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On-site sewage treatment facilities, particularly septic systems combined with soil infiltration, can be an important source of emerging organic contaminants in groundwater and surface water and thus represent a significant source of environmental and human exposure. Two infiltration systems in Are municipality, Sweden, were examined to assess the occurrence of contaminants in groundwater and their fate and transport during infiltration. Groundwater samples, recipient surface water samples, and wastewater samples from septic tanks were collected from 2016 to 2017 covering all climatological seasons. These samples were analysed for a total of 103 contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, organic phosphorus flame-retardants, plasticisers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and food additives. Fourteen of 103 contaminants showed 100% detection frequency in groundwater at concentrations in the low ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 range. Of the compounds analysed, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, sucralose, caffeine, and benzophenone showed high abundancy with maximum concentrations in the mu g L-1 range. The data were normalised for dilution using chloride and sucralose as commonly applied tracers; however, the level of sucralose decreased significantly during infiltration and it is thus suboptimal as a sewage water tracer. Large differences between the two infiltration sites were observed in detection frequencies and concentrations in groundwater, which could be attributed to the system design and the contaminant's migration time from release to sampling point. Seasonal variation was observed for selected chemicals, and the more hydrophobic chemicals showed a higher tendency for attenuation, indicating sorption as a major retention mechanism. A moderate environmental risk to aquatic organisms was estimated in adjacent surface water for galaxolide, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate. Due to this site-dependency and potential environmental risks, further studies are needed on infiltration systems in different settings and on alternative treatment techniques to reduce the contaminant discharge from on-site sewage treatment facilities.

AB Biosolids were obtained from four Ontario municipalities that vary in how the sewage sludge is treated. These included a Class B biosolids that was anaerobically digested, a Class A biosolids that were heat treated and pelletized (Propell), and two Class A biosolids that were stabilized using either the N-Viro (N-Rich) or Lystek (LysteGro) processes. Viable enteric indicator or pathogenic bacteria in the biosolids were enumerated by plate count, gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer were detected by PCR, and a subset of these gene targets were quantified by qPCR. Following application at commercial rates to field plots, the persistence of enteric bacteria and gene targets in soil was followed during the growing season. Carrots, radishes and lettuce were sown into the amended and unamended control plots, and the diversity and abundance of gene targets they carried at harvest determined. All three Class A biosolids carried fewer and less abundant antibiotic resistance genes than did the Class B biosolids, in particular the very alkaline N-Viro product (N-Rich). Following application, some gene targets (e.g. int1, sul1, strA/B, aadA) that are typically associated with mobile gene cassettes remained detectable throughout the growing season, whereas others (e.g. ermB, ermF, blaOXA20) that are not associated with cassettes became undetectable within three weeks or less. At harvest a larger number of gene targets were detected on the carrots and radishes than in the lettuce. Overall, land application of Class A biosolids will entrain fewer viable bacteria and genes associated with antibiotic resistance into crop ground than will amendment with Class B biosolids.

AB Calcium-silicate mineral Polonite (R) and aluminum-based catalyst (AL-1010S), previously identified as promising materials for catalytic ozonation, were used as catalysts to investigate the impact of some operating conditions (ratio ozone feed concentration to catalyst load) and wastewater characteristics (chemical oxygen demand - COD and nitrite - NO2 concentration) on the disinfection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) during catalytic ozonation of wastewater. Tests conducted in synthetic wastewater using two different ozone gas concentration (4 and 8 g (nm(3))) and 6 different catalyst loads provided ratios of 0.08, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.32. Results from the experiments indicated that the ratio of 0.11 was optimal and reached residual disinfection below 2 MPN mL(-1) from the initial concentration of 5 +/- 2 x 10 (5) MPN mL(-1) and removal of atrazine (ATZ) above 80% from the initial concentration of 100 +/- 10 mu g L-1 for an ozone dose of 41-45 mg L-1. Catalytic ozonation with the selected materials enhanced disinfection and ATZ removal from synthetic wastewater (SWW) in comparison to non-catalytic ozonation by making the treatment performance less sensitive to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrite (NO2) in the matrix. Validation of the results in real wastewater effluents confirmed that catalytic ozonation enhanced disinfection. Catalytic ozonation using Polonite (R) and AL-1010S provided residual bacteria level of 0.6 +/- 0.42 MPN mL(-1) and 0.29 +/- 0.41 MPN mL(-1), while non-catalytic ozonation lead to an average residual bacteria level of 1.26 +/- 0.09 MPN mL(-1) for the same range of transferred ozone dose. However, under the conditions tested, a limited number of CECs were extracted at levels above the limits of quantification and further validation work required to evaluate the performance of catalytic ozonation for the removal of CECs.

AB Due to complexity and variety of pharmaceutical wastewater composition, little is known as for functionally important microflora of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (pWWTPs). We compared bacterial composition and diversity of pWWTPs (27 sludge samples collected from 12 full-scale pWWTPs) with those of other industrial (iWWTPs) (27 samples) and municipal wastewater treatment plants (mWWTPs) (27 samples) through meta-analysis based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and identified putatively important organisms and their ecological correlations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that the pWWTPs, iWWTPs and mWWTPs showed distinctive differences in bacterial community composition (P < 1e-04), and the pWWTPs had significantly lower bacterial diversity than the mWWTPs (P < 1e-06). Thermotogae and Synergistetes phyla only strictly dominated in the pWWTPs, and 26, 30 and 6 specific genera were identified in the pWWTPs, mWWTPs and iWWTPs, respectively. Totally, 15 and 1300 OTUs were identified as core and occasional groups, representing 23.2% and 66.2% of the total read abundance of the pWWTPs, respectively. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the bacterial components were clearly clustered corresponding to the types of pharmaceutical wastewater, and a total of 129 local specific OTUs were identified in the pWWTPs, among which anticancer antibiotics pWWTPs had the highest number of specific OTUs (40 ones). Co-occurrence network revealed that the species dominating in the same type of pWWTPs tended to co-occur much more frequently than theoretical random expectation. The results may extend our knowledge regarding the ecological status and correlation of the key microflora in pWWTPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZ) are commonly prescribed antibiotics for various infections in humans and are frequently detected in biosolids. Ecological and human health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ are not well understood, but necessary for formulating policies on safe use and management of biosolids. A tiered integrated risk assessment (IRA), based on the World Health Organization (WHO) framework and the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule, was conducted to assess human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ. The IRA utilized the hazard quotient (HQ) approach to evaluate risks to various receptors of concern (including humans, animals, and birds) in sixteen exposure pathways and three conservative biosolids land application scenarios. The scenarios consisted of (i) single-heavy (100 Mg ha(-1)) land application of biosolids containing 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ (USEPA, 2009), (ii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing typical (median; USEPA, 2009) CIP or AZ concentrations, and (iii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing the 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ. The unrealistically conservative screening level (Tier 1) assessment identified three pathways of potential concern: biosolids -> soil -> plant (CIP); biosolids -> soil -> soil organism (CIP and AZ); and biosolids -> soil -> soil organism -> predator (CIP and AZ). Subsequent tier (refined; more realistic) assessments and pollutant limits (calculated based on the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule) suggested negligible human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ under real-world biosolids application scenarios. Pollutant concentration limits were 12 mg CIP kg(-1) and 2.2 mg AZ kg(-1); suggesting that pollutant load tracking is not needed for the majority (75% for CIP and 90% for AZ) of USA biosolids. Biosolids-bome antibiotic resistance (currently not addressed in any risk assessment model) is the principal uncertainty limiting risk assessment of biosolids-bome antibiotics including CIP and AZ.

AB Emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are mainly resulting from the release of municipal wastewater effluents, which are detected at surface water with lower concentration, and these compounds have an impact on aquatic life. The present research investigates the preparation of zeolite supported ZnO for degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products like benzophenone and caffeine. Incorporation of zeolite enhances the adsorption capacity there by results in improved degradation of PPCPs. The prepared materials were characterised by XRD, SEM, EDS, UV and ICP-OES to confirm the impregnation of ZnO in the zeolite powder, which showed 85% caffeine degradation and 78% of BP-3 degradation with an optimum catalyst load of 70 mg.

AB In the rapidly urbanizing watersheds and estuaries flowing to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, USA, instream flows are increasingly influenced by point source and nonpoint source discharges. Spatial and temporal tidal influences on water quality, especially for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), is poorly understood in estuaries and coastal systems. We selected Dickinson Bayou, an urban estuary in Galveston County, Texas, for study because it has historically impaired water quality, receives point source discharge from one major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), while also being influenced by high densities of onsite sewage facilities upstream in the watershed. We explored the occurrence and potential hazards of aquatic contaminants, including nutrients, indicator bacteria for pathogens, and CECs, in relation to this point source discharge, across seasons and at high and low tides. Aquatic contaminants and associated hazards varied significantly in relation to the WWTP discharge, and were influenced by onsite systems. In fact, spatiotemporal water quality varied by class of contaminants (e.g., nutrients, indicator bacteria, CECs), which indicates that traditional surface water monitoring activities should account for such environmental complexity. This study provides a diagnostic approach for future studies of emerging water quality challenges across gradients of rapidly urbanizing coastal bays and estuaries. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A total of 58 samples were collected from hospitals, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a receiving water body (Dagu Drainage Canal, DDC), and adjacent farmland in Tianjin City, China, in May and November 2013 and were analyzed for five common beta-blockers (atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol, and nadolol) to elucidate their source, occurrence and fate in a typical city in China. The profiles of the enantiomers of the beta-blockers in some samples were examined. Sotalol, metoprolol and propranolol were frequently detected, atenolol was less frequently detected, and nadolol was mostly not detected. Generally, the concentrations in hospital waste waters occurred from <LOQto 10 mu g/ L, while concentrations inmunicipal WWTP water samples ranged from <LOQ to 5.2 mu g/ L. Hence, both hospitals and WWTPs acted as sources of beta-blockers in the environment. Sotalol, metoprolol and propranolol were determined in soils adjacent to the DDC with concentrations up to hundreds of ng/kg in the topsoil and declining levels in the subsoil. Seasonal variation was observed with samples obtained in May showing higher concentrations, both in the canal and the adjacent soil, which could be ascribed to greater consumption of these drugs, lower temperature and less precipitation in the spring and the former winter. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of metoprolol and propranolol in soil samples showed a trend of enrichment of E1 (first-eluted) compared to E2 (second-eluted), while sotalol was almost racemic. In the DDC, no significant difference was found for the pair enantiomers of each beta-blocker, while in hospital and WWTP wastewaters, E1 predominated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Complex mixtures of contaminants from multiple sources, including agriculture, industry or wastewater enter aquatic environments and might pose hazards or risks to humans or wildlife. Targeted analyses of a few priority substances provide limited information about water quality. In this study, a combined chemical and effect screening of water quality in the River Bosna, in Bosnia and Herzegovina was carried out, with focus on occurrence and effects of contaminants of emerging concern. Chemicals in water were sampled at 10 sites along the Bosna River by use of passive sampling. The combination of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) enabled sampling of a broad range of contaminants from hydrophobic (PAHs, PCBs, OCPs) to hydrophilic compounds (pesticides, pharmaceuticals and hormones), which were determined by use of GC-MS and LC-MS (MS). In vitro, cell-based bioassays were applied to assess (anti) androgenic, estrogenic and dioxin-like potencies of extracts of the samplers. Of a total of 168 targeted compounds, 107 were detected at least once. Cumulative pollutant concentrations decreased downstream from the city of Sarajevo, which was identified as the major source of organic pollutants in the area. Responses in all bioassays were observed for samples from all sites. In general, estrogenicity could be well explained by analysis of target estrogens, while the drivers of the other observed effects remained largely unknown. Profiling of hazard quotients identified two sites downstream of Sarajevo as hotspots of biological potency. Risk assessment of detected compounds revealed, that 7 compounds (diazinon, diclofenac, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, benzo[k] fluoranthene, fluoranthene and benzo[k] fluoranthene) might pose risks to aquatic biota in the Bosna River. The study brings unique results of a complex water quality assessment in a region with an insufficient water treatment infrastructure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retention soil filters (RSFs) protect water bodies from pollutant loads originating from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by filtering the wastewater through a filter layer having a depth of 0.75 to 1 m. The microbiological processes in the filter material are influenced by the redox potential (Eh). This potential is a strong indicator of the prevailing environmental conditions and the possible type of microbial activity. Previous investigations of filter bodies have been confined to constructed wetlands (CWs) with regular intermittent wastewater inflow. Compared to CWs, RSFs are characterized by higher oxygen availability due to alternating operating and dry periods. This study aimed to determine the Eh in RSFs and investigate its influence on the removal efficiency for different substances. We established a conceptual model for the standard Eh curve following a loading event, and the variations to this standard in two depths and between treatments. Correlations were determined with a canonical correlation analysis between the pollutant removal of COD, ammonium, phosphorous, E. coli, somatic coliphages and diclofenac and the Eh. Although the removal efficiency is influenced by several additional operating factors such as the preceding dry period, filter age and the respective inflow concentrations, our results show that the Eh is an adequate approach to assess the removal efficiency of RSFs for these substances.

AB Pharmaceutical residues impose a new and emerging threat to the marine environment and its biota. In most countries, ecotoxicity tests are not required for all pharmaceutical residues classes and, even when mandatory, these tests are not performed using marine primary producers such as diatoms. These microalgae are among the most abundant class of primary producers in the marine realm and key players in the marine trophic web. Blood-lipid-lowering agents such as bezafibrate and its derivatives are among the most prescribed drugs and most frequently found human pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The present study aims to investigate the bezafibrate ecotoxicity and its effects on primary productivity and lipid metabolism, at environmentally relevant concentrations, using the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Under controlled conditions, diatom cultures were exposed to bezafibrate at 0, 3, 6, 30 and 60 mu g L-1, representing concentrations that can be found in the vicinity of discharges of wastewater treatment plants. High bezafibrate concentrations increased cell density and are suggested to promote a shift from autotrophic to mixotrophic metabolism, with diatoms using light energy generated redox potential to breakdown bezafibrate as carbon source. This was supported by an evident increase in cell density coupled with an impairment of the thylakoid electron transport and consequent photosynthetic activity reduction. In agreement, the concentrations of plastidial marker fatty acids showed negative correlations and Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates of the relative abundances of fatty acid and photochemical data allowed the separation of controls and cells exposed to bezafibrate with high classification efficiency, namely for photochemical traits, suggesting their validity as suitable biomarkers of bezafibrate exposure. Further evaluations of the occurrence of a metabolic shift in diatoms due to exposure to bezafibrate is paramount, as ultimately it may reduce O-2 generation and CO2 fixation in aquatic ecosystems with ensuing consequences for neighboring heterotrophic organisms.

Wastewater-based epidemiology is one technique which can capture information on where and when NPS appear at the community level. The aim of this study was to identify NPS in wastewater samples using a suspect screening approach. Weekend samples were collected from 50 wastewater treatment plants from Australian capital cities and regional areas across all eight States and Territories and screened against a database containing almost 200 NPS. A total of 22 different NPS were found across all regional and metropolitan wastewater treatment plants. Results showed that the most detected compounds were of the cathinone class, with both Alpha-PVP and methcathinone found in every region. In addition, five different synthetic cannabinoids were detected, at least once in half of the regions analysed. Herein, we report the first comprehensive nationwide analysis of NPS and show the utility of liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry screening for delivering spatial information of the NPS being consumed in communities.

AB Scarcity of water and concerns about the ecotoxicity of micro-contaminants are driving an interest in the use of advanced tertiary processes in wastewater treatment plants. However, the life cycle environmental implications of these treatments remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, this study evaluates through life cycle assessment the following four advanced process options for removal of micro-contaminants from real effluents: i) solar photo-Fenton (SPF) operating at acidic pH; ii) acidic SPF coupled with nanofiltration (NF); iii) SPF operating at neutral pH; and iv) neutral SPF coupled with NF. The results show that acidic SPF coupled with NF is the best option for all 15 impacts considered. For example, its climate change potential is almost three times lower than that of the neutral SPF process (311 vs 928 kg CO2 eq./1000 m(3) of treated effluent). The latter is the worst option for 12 impact categories. For the remaining three impacts (acidification, depletion of metals and particulate matter formation), acidic SPF without NF is least sustainable; it is also the second worst option for seven other impacts. Neutral SPF with NF is the second worst technology for climate change, ozone and fossil fuel depletion as well as marine eutrophication. In summary, both types of SPF perform better environmentally with than without NF and the acidic SPF treatment is more sustainable than the neutral version. Thus, the results of this work suggest that ongoing efforts on developing neutral SPF should instead be focused on further improvements of its acidic equivalent coupled with NF. These results can also be used to inform future development of policy related to the removal of micro-contaminants from wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal routes of pharmaceuticals especially biodegradation routes in the activated sludge process are still unclear. Some studies indicated pharmaceuticals were mainly removed via nitrification process (autotrophic biodegradation), while others suggested pharmaceuticals were mainly removed via COD degradation process (heterotrophic biodegradation). These unclear problems limited the improvements of pharmaceuticals removal. In this study, in order to elucidate three biodegradation routes (nitrification, COD degradation, or both nitrification and COD degradation), autotrophic and heterotrophic reactors were individually developed to separate nitrification and COD degradation form the activated sludge process (mix-trophic process including nitrification and COD degradation). Furthermore, the pharmaceuticals removal routes of adsorption, hydrolysis, and oxidation were also studied. Among six degradable pharmaceuticals, heterotrophic biodegradation and adsorption were the major removal routes. Two sulfonamides of five antibiotics were predominantly removed by COD degradation process, while nitrification and adsorption had no contributions. Adsorption, hydrolysis, nitrification, and COD degradation were the main elimination routes of cefalexin. COD degradation and adsorption were the dominant removal routes of norfloxacin. Tetracycline was mainly removed by the adsorption route, and hydrolysis and oxidation also played a role. For two drugs, ibuprofen was removed mainly via nitrification and COD degradation, and no adsorption occurred. Diclofenac could not be removed at all and was persistent in the aerobic conditions. Kinetic studies showed that biodegradation of the two sulfonamides, cefalexin, norfloxacin, and ibuprofen followed first-order kinetics rather than zero-order or second-order kinetics.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 48 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in wastewater effluents from three Slovenian and three Croatian waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) representing the major inputs into the upper and middle course of the Sava River and simultaneously in the Sava River itself. Two sampling campaigns were carried out (May and July 2017). Samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analysed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. In effluents, 23 CECs were >NLOQ with caffeine and the UV-filter 4-hydroxybenzophenone (H-BP) present in the highest concentrations (<49,600 ng L-1 and <28,900 ng L-1, respectively) and most frequently detected (detection frequency; DFr > 83.3%). Bisphenol B and E were detected for the first time in WW from Velika Gorica (May) and Zapresic (July), respectively. In surface water (SW), 19 CECs were detected >NLOQ with CAF again being the most abundant and most frequently detected (DFr = 92.9%). Bisphenols AP, CL2, P and Z were detected>LOQ for the first time in European SW. Active pharmaceutical ingredients naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac; the preservative methyl paraben; CAF and UV-filter HM-BP were the most abundant CECs in SW and WW. An increasing trend in the total CEC load downstream was observed, indicating the cumulative effects of individual sources along the river. The Croatian Zapresic, Zagreb and Velika Gorica WWTP effluents contributed the most towards the enhanced loads of the CECs studied probably due to their size or insufficient treatment. HM-BP was the only compound found at a levels exhibiting high environmental risk (RQ = 1.13) downstream from Ljubljana and Domzale-Kamnik WWTPs. Other SW samples that contained HM-BP, ibuprofen (API) and/or benzyl paraben (preservative) posed a medium risk to the environment. The results suggest the need for further monitoring of CECs in the Sava River Basin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, activation of persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of granular activated carbon (GAC) was studied in order to investigate the degradation of Metronidazole (MTZ) antibiotic in aqueous solution. The results showed that GAC could activate PS effectively better than H2O2. Also, both adsorption and oxidation process induced MTZ removal in the GAC/PS system with remarkable synergistic effect in the combined system. After 240 min, 50% of PS was degraded and 80% of MTZ and 65% of COD were removed under the ambient conditions containing initial MTZ concentration of 100 mg L-1, PS/MTZ molar ratio of 100/1, GAC dosage of 5 g L-1 and initial pH of 3.9. Both PS degradation and MTZ removal followed pseudo first order kinetic with rate constant of 0.0006 min(-1) and 0.0023 min(-1), respectively. Scavenging study using methanol and phenol as a radical scavenger showed that most oxidation of MTZ occurred on the surface or in the boundary layer around catalyst. It was also found that MTZ removal efficiency increased when PS concentration or GAC dosage increased. However, results showed that PS loading is more effective than GAC dosage. The MTZ removal efficiency was still considerable after 4 runs reusability of GAC which implied in-situ regeneration of catalyst. It can be concluded that GAC is a favorable and promising metal-free catalyst for wastewater treatment utilization.

AB There has been a developing technology in algae with pharmaceuticals wastewater. However, the effect and the underlying mechanism of pharmaceuticals on algae are not well understood. To investigate the effect and mechanism of pharmaceuticalson microalgae, four pharmaceuticals of clofibric acid (CLF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on C. pyrenoidosa culture were analyzed. At low concentrations (< 10 mg/L), the pharmaceuticals, especially the DCF, exhibited positive effects on both the structure and function of algal cultures; algal growth (i.e., chlorophyll a accumulation, lipid accumulation) and activities of antioxidant enzymes were stimulated. The algal metabolite differences of various DCF concentrations were investigated and a total of 91 substances were identified, whose samples were clustered and clearly separated. The key metabolomics pathway analysis found that the DCF promoted the carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolic pathway in C. pyrenoidosa under relatively low concentrations (< 10 mg/L). However, the algae metabolomics pathway was disturbed significantly under the action of a high concentration of DCF (>100 mg/L). The study detected the effects of four pharmaceuticals on C. pyrenoidosa and demonstrated that the usage of metabolomics analysis complemented with DCF could be an effective approach to understand the mechanism of molecular evolution in C. pyrenoidosa for microalgal biomass and bioenergy from wastewater in researches of biological resources.

AB Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed phase LC (RPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are widely used for the identification of suspects and unknown compounds in the environment. For the identification of unknowns, apart from mass accuracy and isotopic fitting, retention time (t(R)) and MS/MS spectra evaluation is required. In this context, a novel comprehensive workflow was developed to study the t(R) behavior of large groups of emerging contaminants using Quantitative Structure-Retention Relationships (QSRR). 682 compounds were analyzed by HILIC-HRMS in positive Electrospray Ionization mode (ESI). Moreover, an extensive dataset was built for RPLC-HRMS including 1830 and 308 compounds for positive and negative ESI, respectively. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was used to model the t(R) data. The applicability domains of the models were studied by Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) methods. The MCS method was also used to calculate the acceptable error windows for the predicted tR from various LC conditions. This paper provides validated models for predicting tR in HILIC/RPLC-HRMS platforms to facilitate identification of new emerging contaminants by suspect and non-target HRMS screening, and were applied for the identification of transformation products (TPs) of emerging contaminants and biocides in wastewater and sludge.

AB The potential presence of introduced antibiotics in the aquatic environment is a hot topic of concern, particularly in the Antarctic, a highly vulnerable area protected under the Madrid protocol. The increasing presence of human population, especially during summer, might led to the appearance of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. The previous discovery of Escherichia coli strains resistant to antibiotics in sea water and wastewater collected in King George Island motivated our investigation on antibiotics occurrence in these samples. The application of a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method for 20 antibiotics, revealed the presence of 8 compounds in treated wastewater, mainly the quinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (92% and 54% of the samples analyzed, average concentrations 0.89 mu g/L and 0.75 mu g/L, respectively) and the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin (15% positive samples, and average concentrations near 0.4 mu g/L), and erythromycin (38% positive samples, average concentration 0.003 mu g/L). Metronidazole and clindamycin were found in one sample, at 0.17 and 0.1 mu g/L, respectively; and trimethoprim in two samples, at 0.001 mu g/L. Analysis of sea water collected near the outfall of the wastewater discharges also showed the sporadic presence of 3 antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim) at low ng/L level, illustrating the impact of pharmaceuticals consumption and the poor removal of these compounds in conventional WWTPs. The most widespread antibiotic in sea water was ciprofloxacin, which was found in 15 out of 34 sea water samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 218 ng/L. Bacteria resistance was observed for some antibiotics identified in the samples (e.g. trimetropim and nalidixic acid -a first generation quinolone). However, resistance to some groups of antibiotics could not be correlated to their presence in the water samples due to analytical limitations (penicillins, tetraciclines). On the contrary, for some groups of antibiotics detected in samples (macrolides), the antibacterial activity against E. Coli was not investigated because these antibiotics do not include this bacterial species in their spectrum of activity.
   Our preliminary data demonstrate that antibiotics occurrence in the Antarctic aquatic environment is an issue that needs to be properly addressed. Periodical monitoring of water samples and the implementation of additional treatments in the WWTPs are recommended as a first step to prevent potential problems related to the presence of antibiotics and other emerging contaminants in the near future in Antarctica.

AB Background: Berberine (BBR) is a pharmaceutical chemical with a broad antibacterial spectrum, and its biological treatment has been of research and practical interest. In this study, a pure bacterial strain B16 was isolated from the activated sludge in a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. The aim of the study is to characterize the properties of the strain B16, especially its BBR degradation capability. Methods: The identification of strain B16 was conducted by visual observation, as well as biochemical and phylogenetic analysis. The degradation kinetics of strain B16 was tentatively described by Haldane model. Results: The strain B16 was 100% determined as a Sphingopyxis sp. The kinetic parameters of BBR degradation by strain B16 were as follows: Vmax 54.73 +/- 5.54 mg (g MLSS <bold> h</bold>)(-1), Km 66.68 +/- 8.95 mg L-1, and Ki 43.16 +/- 5.92 mg L-1, with an R-2 of 0.996. Stain B16 exhibited considerable capability of BBR degradation. BBR of initial concentration 40 mg L-1 could be completely degraded in 48 h under optimal conditions. Conclusions: strain B16 was the first pure culture found with the ability to totally mineralize BBR, indicating the potential of B16 application in real industrial processes.

AB In recent years, many studies have highlighted the consistent finding of tramadol (TRA) in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) and also in some rivers and lakes in both Europe and North America, suggesting that TRA is removed by no more than 36% by specific disinfection treatments. The extensive use of this drug has led to environmental pollution of both water and soil, up to its detection in growing plants. In order to expand the knowledge about TRA toxicity as well as the nature of its disinfection by-products (DBPs), a simulation of the waste treatment chlorination step has been reported herein. In particular, we found seven new by-products, that together with TRA, have been assayed on different living organisms (Aliivibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Daphnia magna), to test their acute and chronic toxicity. The results reported that TRA may be classified as a harmful compound to some aquatic organisms whereas its chlorinated product mixture showed no effects on any of the organisms tested. All data suggest however that TRA chlorination treatment produces a variety of DBPs which can be more harmful than TRA and a risk for the aquatic environment and human health.

AB Pharmaceutical residues, and other organic micropollutants that pass naturally through the human body into sewage, are in many cases unaffected by treatment processes at conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Accumulated in the environment, however, they can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems. The present study provides an evaluation of a treatment system for the removal of pharmaceutical residues and other micropollutants. The system is based on a Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), including ultrafiltration (UF), followed by a biofilter using granulated active carbon (GAC) as filter material. It was found that all investigated micropollutants, such as pharmaceutical residues, phenolic compounds, bacteria and microplastic particles, present in wastewater, could be removed by the treatment system to below detection limits or very low concentrations. This shows that the combination of filtration, adsorption and biodegradation provides a broad and efficient removal of micropollutants and effects. The tested treatment configuration appears to be one of the most sustainable solutions that meets today's and future municipal sewage treatment requirements. The treatment system delivers higher resource utilization and security than other advanced treatment systems including solely GAC-filters without biology.

Organoclays are obtained by the combination of clay minerals and surfactants (quaternary alkyl ammonium salts and others) and are appropriate candidates for the adsorption of organic contaminants such as pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals that are more and more found in the water resource despite wastewater treatments. This review article focuses on novel organoclay preparation methods based on the use of nonconventional nonionic surfactants and the interest and limits of these hybrid materials for the adsorption of organic compounds at both batch equilibrium and dynamical percolation experimental conditions.

AB The nano nickel(II) oxide (NiO) was synthesized by sol-gel method and used for degradation of Amoxicillin (AMO) from pharmaceutical wastewater. In this laboratory study, the effects of nanoparticle dose (0.25-2 g/L), reaction time (10-120 min), initial antibiotic concentration (25-200 mg/L) and lamp power (15 W) on AMO removal efficiency were assessed in a batch photocatalytic reactor. Antibiotic concentration in output was measured by the spectrophotometer at the maximum wavelength of 280 nm. The optimum nano NiO dose was obtained to be 0.2 g/L. In this study, the removal efficiency decreased with increasing the concentration of AMO. Under optimal conditions of concentration, the removal efficiency was 96%. It was found that increasing the exposure time to UV increased the rate of AMO degradation in solution. The results also showed that the photo-degradation reaction approximately follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics with constant rates of 0.084, 0.074 and 0.046 min(-1) for concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 mg/L, respectively. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that UV/NiO photocatalytic process can efficiently remove AMO from pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the secondary effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants are of great concern when water reuse is intended. Ozonation and ultrafiltration (UF) are powerful technologies reported to eliminate EDCs. Due to the importance of effluent organic matters (EfOMs) in secondary effluent, the effects of three kinds of EfOM on the treatment of five EDCs using ozonation and OF were investigated. The three kinds of EfOM studied were humic acid sodium salt (NaAH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (NaAg); and the five EDCs were estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol and bisphenol A. The results showed that EfOM accelerated the decay rate of ozone and inhibited the degradation efficiency of EDCs by ozonation in the order NaAH > BSA > NaAg. The ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (UVA(280)) has potential for use as a surrogate indicator to assess EDC removal via ozonation without conducting difficult EDC analyses. When the decline in UVA(280) exceeded 18%, the five EDCs had been completely removed. The OF behavior of NaAH, BSA and NaAg was found to follow the cake filtration law. The fouling potential of EfOM followed the order NaAg > NaAH > BSA; while EfOM on the membrane surface enhanced EDC removal in the order NaAH > BSA > NaAg. The mean retention rate of the membrane was increased by 24%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The properties of EDCs and EfOM cakes both influenced the EDC removal rates due to adsorption, size exclusion and charge attraction.

AB The removal of four dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions, non-acid hydrophobics, hydrophobic adds, hydrophilics and transphilics, was achieved by coagulation-UV/H2O2 oxidation in post-pharmaceutical wastewater (PhWW). Coagulation with Polyfenic chloride (PFC), Polymeric ferric sulfate (PFS) and Polymeric aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) was studied separately to evaluate the effects of the initial pH and coagulant dosage. The coagulation-UV/H2O2 oxidation method resulted in much higher reduction rates for dissolved organic carbon (Doc) (by 75%) and UV254 (by 92%) than coagulation or UV/H2O2 oxidation alone. The proportion of non-acid hydrophobics, hydrophobic adds, transphilics and hydrophilics removed by coagulation was 54%, 49%, 27% and 12 %, while the combined treatment removed 92%, 87%, 70% and 39%, respectively. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence measurements revealed that the humic-like fluorescent component C4 showed the highest removal (by 44%) during the coagulation stage. After coagulation-UV/H2O2 treatment, the humic-like fluorescent component C3 had the highest removal (by 72%), whereas xenobiotic organic fluorescent components C1 and C4 remained recalcitrant to decomposition. Significant correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between Cl and the hydrophobic adds and non-acid hydrophobics suggested the possibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy as an effective tool to assess variations in DOM fraction treatment efficacy in coagulation-UV/H2O2 systems. After the combined treatment, toxic inhibition of cellular activity by post PhWW decreased from 88% to 47% and biodegradability increased from 0.1 to 0.52.

AB Trimethoprim is one of the representative drugs within the pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) group. The photo-Fenton oxidation technology was used to degrade trimethoprim in wastewater and the extent of degradation was analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography, then experimentally obtained the optimal conditions. Analysis of the experimental data showed that, under the single-factor experimental conditions, the optimal conditions for degradation were a pH of 4, an H2O2 concentration of 3.0 mmol/L, an FeSO4 concentration of 0.06 mmol/L, an initial trimethoprim concentration of 0.0689 mmol/L, and an ultraviolet (UV) intensity (UVA) of 12 mW/cm(2). The interaction of pH and the concentration of H2O2 and Fe2+ have been further explored, it was obtained the following response surface results through the central composite design experiment: pH = 4.56, H2O2 concentration = 0.09 mmol/L, and Fe2+ concentration = 0.09 mmol/L. Under these conditions, it can be obtained a degradation rate of 99.95% after 6 min. There were similar results for three sets of parallel experiments, indicating that these simulation conditions were feasible.

AB Pharmaceutical residues and other emerging substances commonly summarised as micropollutants pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and end up in the receiving waters and sludge. Many studies have investigated the removal efficiency of various techniques but a holistic evaluation of various relevant treatment alternatives regarding both the removal efficiency for various micropollutants, investment and operating costs, environmental impacts and future comprehensiveness is still lacking. This paper provides the results from a large 3-year project about the evaluation of sustainable treatment systems for removal of various micropollutants or disruptive effects at Swedish WWTPs and their environmental, economic and future sustainability. The presented results are based on our own pilot tests and related assessment and modelling efforts and provide a holistic view on advanced treatment of wastewater for removal of micropollutants.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal of twenty-nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two water treatment plants (WTPs) in China were investigated. WTP1 employed ozonation and granular active carbon (GAC) filtration after coagulation and sedimentation, while WTP2 applied anthracite and GAC filtration instead. In the influent, six and four selected PPCPs with total concentrations of 554.97 and 12.94ng/L were detected in WTP1 and WTP2, respectively (in October), among which, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin were detected with highest concentrations due to their widely used as both human and veterinary medicines. PPCPs removal varied significantly among compounds and treatment units. In general, coagulation, filtration and single GAC units worked inefficiently and removed the detected PPCPs by less than 50%, as they were not hydrophobic. Ozonation was capable to eliminate a majority of PPCPs by more than 90%, which, however, presented limited mineralization and generated a certain amount of degradation by-products. To seek the improvement of PPCPs removal by coagulation and flocculation, the feasibility of adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into the coagulation process (Fe2+ or Fe3+) to trigger the Fenton reaction was investigated. Results indicated that only under acidic condition, Fe2+ combined H2O2 efficiently removed PPCPs, while Fe3+/H2O2 also showed some removal capacity compared to coagulation process only. It will be impractical to employ this process under neutral pH. But when acidic wastewater is involved, this process may have its potential application.

AB A series of activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by modifying a commercial AC by physical activation using CO2 during different activation times. The ACs were designated as F, F12, F24, and F40 corresponding to the activation times of 0, 12, 24, and 40h, respectively. The surface area, total pore volume, micropore volume, and mean micropore width were determined for all the ACs. The textural properties of the modified ACs increased substantially with the activation time, and the capacity of the ACs for adsorbing diclofenac (DCF) was almost linearly dependent upon the surface area of the ACS. The maximum adsorption capacities of F, F12, F24, and F40 carbons towards diclofenac (DCF) from aqueous solution were 271, 522, 821, and 1033mg/g, respectively. Hence, the adsorption capacities of ACs were considerably enhanced with the activation time, and F12, F24, and F40 carbons presented the highest adsorption capacities towards DCF reported in the technical literature. The F40 adsorption capacity was at least twice those of other carbon materials. The adsorption capacities decreased by raising the pH from 7 to 11 due to electrostatic repulsion between the ACs surface and anionic DCF in solution. The removal of DCF from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was effectively carried out by adsorption on F40. Hence, the capacity of ACs for adsorbing DCF can be optimized by tailoring the porous structure of ACs.

AB Antineoplastic drugs (AD) have been increasingly used, but the disposal of their wastes in the environment via hospital effluent and domestic sewage has emerged as an environmental issue. The current risks posed to these animals and effects of pollutants on the reptiles' population level remain unknown due to lack of studies on the topic. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mutagenicity of neonate Podocnemis expansa exposed to environmental concentrations (EC) of cyclophosphamide (Cyc). The adopted doses were EC-I 0.2g/L and EC-II 0.5g/L Cyc. These doses correspond to 1/10 and 1/4 of concentrations previously identified in hospital effluents. Turtles exposed to the CyC recorded larger total number of erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities than the ones in the control group after 48-h exposure. The total number of abnormalities for both groups (EC-I and EC-II) 96h after the experiment had started was statistically similar to that of animals exposed to high Cyc concentration (positive control 5x10(4)g/L). This outcome confirms the mutagenic potential of Cyc, even at low concentrations. On the other hand, when the animals were taken to a pollutant-free environment, their mutagenic damages disappeared after 240h. After such period, their total of abnormalities matched the basal levels recorded for the control group. Therefore, our study is the first evidence of AD mutagenicity in reptiles, even at EC and short-term exposure, as well as of turtles' recovery capability after the exposure to Cyc.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are widely used for desalination and water treatment. However, they insufficiently reject some small uncharged micropollutants, such as certain endocrine-disrupting, pharmaceutically active compounds and boric acid, increasingly present in water sources and wastewater. This study examines the feasibility of improving rejection of multiple micropollutants in commercial low-pressure RO membrane elements using concentration polarization- and surfactant-enhanced surface polymerization. Low-pressure membrane elements modified by grafting poly(glycidyl methacrylate) showed enhanced rejection of all tested solutes (model organic micropollutants, boric acid, and NaCl), with permeability somewhat reduced, but comparable with commercial brackish water RO membranes.

AB In this study, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were analyzed in the influent and effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment plant in Turkey and a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany and the toxicity of these wastewaters were estimated using a toxic unit (TU) approach. A total of 21 and 32 PhACs were detected in the domestic wastewater and the municipal wastewater, respectively. The TUs estimated for PhACs in municipal wastewater were higher than the TUs estimated for PhACs present in domestic wastewater. The levels of the anti-anxiety drug, oxazepam were estimated to be in the high risk category (HQ>10) in both wastewaters. In bench-scale tests with ozonation, the removals of four PhACs in the municipal wastewater were investigated. At a dose of 2mg/L ozone, 97%-98% of diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed. The lowest removal rate at 71% was observed for metoprolol.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are carried into aquatic bodies along with domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural wastewater discharges. Psychotropic drugs, which can be toxic to the biota, have been detected in natural waters in different parts of the world. Conventional water treatments, such as activated sludge, do not properly remove these recalcitrant substances, so the development of processes able to eliminate these compounds becomes very important. Advanced oxidation processes are considered clean technologies, capable of achieving high rates of organic compounds degradation, and can be an efficient alternative to conventional treatments. In this study, the degradation of alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and carbamazepine was evaluated through TiO2/UV-A, H2O2/UV-A, and TiO2/H2O2/UV-A, using sunlight and artificial irradiation. While using TiO2 in suspension, best results were found at [TiO2] = 0.1 g L-1. H2O2/UV-A displayed better results under acidic conditions, achieving from 60 to 80% of removal. When WWTP was used, degradation decreased around 50% for both processes, TiO2/UV-A and H2O2/UV-A, indicating a strong matrix effect. The combination of both processes was shown to be an adequate approach, since removal increased up to 90%. H2O2/UV-A was used for disinfecting the aqueous matrices, while mineralization was obtained by TiO2-photocatalysis.

AB The synthetic hormone sodium levothyroxine (LTX) is one of the most prescribed drugs in the world and the most effective in hypothyroidism treatment. The presence of LTX in the environment has become a matter of major concern due to the widespread use of this hormone and by the fact that it is only partially removed in conventional water and sewage treatment plants. However, information regarding the photochemical fate of this hormone in environmental or engineered systems is scarce in the literature. In this work, the sunlight-driven direct and indirect LTX degradation was investigated by determining the photolysis quantum yield, I broken vertical bar (LTX) = 3.80 (+/- 0.02) x 10(-5), as well as the second-order kinetic constants of the reactions with hydroxyl radicals, k (LTX,aEuro cent OH) = 1.50 (+/- 0.01) x 10(10) L mol(-1) s(-1) and singlet oxygen, k (LTX,1O2) = 1.47 (+/- 0.66) x 10(8) L mol(-1) s(-1). Mathematical simulations indicate that LTX photodegradation is favored in shallow, nitrite-rich, and dissolved organic matter (DOM)-poor environments, with LTX half-life times varying from less than 10 days to about 80 days. LTX removals of 85 and 95% were achieved by UVC photolysis and UVC/H2O2 after 120 min, respectively. Three transformation products, triiodothyronine, diiodothyronine, and diiodotyrosine, were identified during LTX degradation by the UVC-based processes studied. The results herein regarding photo-induced kinetics coupled with environmental fate simulations may help evaluate LTX persistence and also the design of water and wastewater treatment processes.

AB Solutions with 0.65 mM of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid (INH) in 0.050 M Na2SO4 at pH 3.0 were treated by electro-Fenton (EF) and UVA photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes using a cell with a BDD anode and a carbon-PTFE air-diffusion cathode. The influence of current density on degradation, mineralization rate, and current efficiency has been thoroughly evaluated in EF. The effect of the metallic catalyst (Fe2+ or Fe3+) and the formation of products like short-chain linear aliphatic carboxylic acids were assessed in PEF. Two consecutive pseudo-first-order kinetic regions were found using Fe2+ as catalyst. In the first region, at short time, the drug was rapidly oxidized by (OH)-O-au, whereas in the second region, at longer time, a resulting Fe(III)-INH complex was much more slowly removed by oxidants. INH disappeared completely at 300 min by EF, attaining 88 and 94% mineralization at 66.6 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Isonicotinamide and its hydroxylated derivative were identified as aromatic products of INH by GC-MS and oxalic, oxamic, and formic acids were quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC. The PEF treatment of a real wastewater polluted with the drug led to slower INH and TOC abatements because of the parallel destruction of its natural organic matter content.

AB We present herein the preparation of novel polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) containing insoluble -CD polymer as a carrier, polyvinyl chloride as a base polymer, and dibuthylphtalate (DBP) as a plasticizer in varying proportions. The prepared PIMs can be obtained by a simple, fast, and high-yield preparation process. Physicochemical characterizations of such membranes occurred in a homogeneous structure. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis found that DBP was inserted between these polymeric chains by non-covalent interactions. This led to a spacing of PVC/poly(-cyclodextrin) chains inducing a better access of guest molecules to PIM cyclodextrins. To achieve the elimination of ibuprofen and progesterone, two examples of emerging environmental contaminants that can lead to possible alterations to aquatic environments and affect human health, the effect of three operating parameters was studied (pH, the proportion of -cyclodextrin polymer, and wastewater agitation). The proportion of -cyclodextrin polymer and wastewater agitation had a favorable influence on drug extraction at 10 ppm. The PIMs containing -cyclodextrin polymer was unstable in basic conditions and was more effective at acidic pH. These initial results demonstrate the high potential for drug extraction of this polymer.

AB Activated carbon (AC) was prepared from date palm leaflets via KOH activation. AC was oxidized with HNO3 to produce oxidized activated carbon (OAC) that was surface functionalized using ethylene diamine to produce basic surface (BAC-EDA) and ethylamine to produce hydrophobic carbonaceous surface (HAC-EA). Details of preparation and characterization was published earlier. The adsorption of chlorpheniramine (CP), a basic drug, and ibuprofen (IBU), an acidic drug, on these carbons was investigated at different initial pH, contact time, drug concentration and temperature. Drug adsorption depends mainly on solution pH and the adsorbent surface nature, and initial pH 7 was found optimal for the removal of both drugs. Equilibrium adsorption was reached faster on HAC-EA, OAC and BAC-EDA than on AC with kinetic adsorption data following well pseudo second order model, and enhanced performance as temperature rises. Activation energy (E-a) was found to be in the range of 11.7-29.1 kJ/mol. Equilibrium adsorption data follow well the Langmuir model with better performance as temperature rises. CP uptake follows the order: HAC-EA > OAC > AC > BAC-EDA whereas the adsorption of IBU follows the order: OAC > AC > HAC-EA > BAC-EDA. Thermodynamic parameters showed that drug adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous. Drug adsorption from spiked hospital wastewater showed slightly less capacity than that from deionized water. Dominant adsorption forces between the drugs and the carbons varied from carbon to another depending on their surface nature and solution pH.

AB This study investigate the feasibility of using solar photovoltaic cell (PV) - battery system as a renewable energy source for driven electrochemical treatment of acidic solution of food colorant Brilliant Blue FCF (E133) dye using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and carbon-felt cathode. The average solar irradiation intensity of over 20,000 kJ m(-2) day(-1) was recorded and the PV cells produced more than 10 A current intensity for 8.5-9 h a day, which was sufficient for completely charge two 12 V batteries during the day. Irrespective of slight fluctuation of solar irradiation, constant electric current values (100-500 mA) were able to selected for the electrooxidation with H2O2 (EO-H2O2) and EF treatment of E133 solution. Complete decolorization and mineralization of the E133 solutions was achieved with either process at higher current, whereas only total color removal was obtained at lower current with excellent COD removal. The initial N in the E133 molecule was recovered in the treated solutions mainly as NH4+ along with significant proportion of NO3-, whereas SO32-. in the molecule was released into the solution as SO42-. without detecting SO32-. The solar PV-battery system is a suitable green energy source for efficient electrochemical treatment of organic polluted wastewater.

AB Activated carbon of babassu coconut mesocarp (ACB), which is an environment-friendly material (low-cost), was evaluated as alternative adsorbent for the adsorption and desorption of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from aqueous solution. ASA is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical easily acquired and prescribed worldwide, and not completely removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). For this reason, properties of ACB (untreated) were characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, Boehm titration method and pH(PZC). The microporous nature of ACB strongly influenced both the adsorption of ASA and the occurrence of physical adsorption bonds, which allows the reversibility of the reaction. ACB surface was rich in carboxylic and phenolic groups. The adsorption was best described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model (89.87 mg g(-1)) at pH 2.0, which represented 80% of ACB adsorption capacity. Conversely, desorption was best represented by pseudo-first-order kinetic model (15.07 mg g(-1)) at pH 6.4, which corresponded to approximately 25% of ASA desorption capacity. Sips isotherm model was best fitted to the equilibrium data of adsorption (50.400 mg g(-1)) at pH 2.0 and desorption (85.213 mg g(-1)) at pH(PZC) 6.4. The negative Delta H degrees showed that adsorption ( - 23.45 kJ mol(-1)) and desorption ( - 5 x 10(5)kJ mol(-1)) were exothermic processes. In addition, the regeneration capability, evaluated through the cycles of reuse, indicated increase of the adsorption and desorption capacities of 53.36% and 32.71%, respectively.

AB Various techniques are available for wastewater treatment. However, some types of pollutants in wastewater need advance treatment such as pharmaceutical components. Advanced oxidation process is one of the most helpful methods to degrade the emerging contaminant like Ibuprofen (IBP). We designed a batch reactor, including light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, TiO2 and modified TiO2, to treat synthetic wastewater containing IBP. Our experimental design consisted of 0.5, 2 and 5 mg of IBP, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 g of TiO2 and modified TiO2, respectively, pH 5, 7 and 9 and exposure time 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h. We achieved the optimum amount of FeENCS-TiO2 and TiO2 of 0.2 and 0.3 g, respectively, for IBP removal from synthetic wastewater. At pH 7, IBP concentration of 0.5 mg/l and 3 h radiation time, we obtained 91.4% and 52.4% degradation efficiency of IBP from synthetic wastewater in FeFNS-TiO2/LED and TiO2/LED processes, respectively. The study of synergistic effects also indicated the positive effect of photocatalyst and LED on each other. The removal efficiency in the FeFNS-TiO2/LED and TiO2/LED processes declined by 37.3% and 23.8%, respectively, while adding some amounts of tert-butyl as radical scavenger in the IBP solution. This experiment may indicate the photocatalytic degradation of IBP with the mechanism of hydroxyl radical. We fitted Lagergren's first-order model in a condition, including pH values 7 and 5, 0.5 mg/l IBP concentrations in the synthetic wastewater, 0.2 g of m-TiO2, 0.3 g of TiO2 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h time of exposure. The kinetic rate constant for TiO2/LED and modified TiO2/LED were 0.0591 and -0.123, respectively.

AB Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a type of wastewater posing large problems when discharged in the environment. Yet, due to its high nutrient content, POME may offer opportunities for algal growth and subsequent harvesting of high-value products. The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a potential feedstock diatom for bioactive compounds such as the carotenoid fucoxanthin, which has been shown to have pharmaceutical applications. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the growth and fucoxanthin productivity of P. tricornutum grown on POME, as a function of light intensity, temperature, salinity, and nutrient enrichment. High-saturating irradiance (300molphotonsm(-2)s(-1)) levels at 25 degrees C showed highest growth rates but decreased the fucoxanthin productivity of P. tricornutum. Box-Behnken response surface methodology revealed that the optimum fucoxanthin productivity was influenced by temperature, salinity, and the addition of urea. Nutrient enrichment by phosphorus did not enhance cell density and fucoxanthin productivity, while urea addition was found to stimulate both. We conclude that POME wastewater, supplemented with urea, can be considered as the potential medium for P. tricornutum to replace commercial nutrients while producing high amounts of fucoxanthin.

AB The present work describes the optimization and validation of a highly selective and sensitive analytical method using solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE LC-MS/MS) for the determination of some frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater received and treated by Sharjah sewage treatment plant (STP). The extraction efficiency of different SPE cartridges was tested and the simultaneous extraction of pharmaceuticals was successfully accomplished using hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced reversed phase Waters (R) Oasis HLB cartridge (200 mg/ 6 mL) at pH 3. The analytes were separated on an Aquity BEH C18 column (1.7 mu m, 2.1 mm x 150 mm) using gradient elution and mass spectrometric analysis were performed in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) selecting two precursor ions to produce ion transition for each pharmaceutical using positive electrospray ionization (+ESI) mode. The correlation coefficient values in the linear calibration plot for each target compound exceeded 0.99 and the recovery percentages of the investigated pharmaceuticals were more than 84%. Limit of detection (LOD) varied between 0.1-1.5 ng/L and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.3-5 ng/L for all analytes. The precision of the method was calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD%) of replicate measurements and was found to be in the ranges of 2.2% to 7.7% and 2.2% to 8.6% for inter and intra-day analysis, respectively. All of the obtained validation parameters satisfied the requirements and guidelines of analytical method validation.

AB The fast development of laboratory methods has revealed increased amounts of trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) in waste waters in the Czech Republic. This paper focuses on the expected costs to solve this problem by quaternary treatment of waste water based on activated carbon filtration. The one-time investment costs in 155 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with a capacity of over 10 000 population equivalent (PE) would represent an amount of around 300 million EUR. The increase in end-user operating costs would be 0.4 EUR/m(3), which would mean a 15% increase in water and sewage costs. A sociological survey showed that most respondents (65%) would agree with an increase in price but only by 10%. Currently the cost of the quaternary treatment of wastewater is based primarily on estimates. Therefore changes in legislation leading to stricter limits and an increase in the efficiency of wastewater treatment should be preceded by additional applied research.

AB Photo-driven advanced oxidation process (AOP) with peracetic acid (PAA) has been poorly investigated in water and wastewater treatment so far. In the present work its possible use as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater to effectively minimize the release into the environment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was investigated. Different initial PAA concentrations, two light sources (sunlight and UV-C) and two different water matrices (groundwater (GW) and wastewater (WW)) were studied. Low PM doses were found to be effective in the inactivation of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (AR E. coli) in GW, with the UV-C process being faster (limit of detection (LOD) achieved for a cumulative energy (Q(UV)) of 0.3 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PAA L-1) than solar driven one (LOD achieved at Q(UV) = 4.4 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PM L-1). Really fast inactivation rates of indigenous AR E. coli were also observed in WW. Higher Q(UV) and PM initial doses were necessary to effectively remove the three target CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole), with CBZ being the more refractory one. In conclusion, photo-driven AOP with PM can be effectively used as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater but initial PM dose should be optimized to find the best compromise between target bacteria inactivation and CECs removal as well as to prevent scavenging effect of PM on hydroxyl radicals because of high PM concentration.

AB The sulfonamide antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) has been frequently detected in the wastewater. It has been reported that part of SMX can be transformed by the co-metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during nitrifying process. However, previous studies reported inconsistent or even contradictory results in terms of SMX degradation and/or transformation. Literature study revealed that nitrite may play certain role in SMX transformation, which has been neglected previously. In this study, the transformation behavior of SMX was investigated with and without the presence of nitrite in an enriched nitrifying culture. The results clearly show that the elimination of SMX occurred with the presence/accumulation of nitrite, and a linear regression was observed between SMX elimination efficiency and free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration, indicating that FNA was the major factor responsible for the SMX transformation. By reacting with FNA, SMX transformation products, such as 4-nitro-SMX, desamino-SMX and hydroxylated SMX, were detected. However, when FNA concentration decreased, these intermediates may be retransformed back to SMX. These findings improved our understanding on SMX transformation in a biological system and highlighted the role of nitrite/FNA in the sulfonamide antibiotics degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The frequent detection of propranolol, a widely used beta-blocker, in wastewater effluents and surface waters has raised serious concern, due to its adverse effects on organisms. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/PDS) processes are efficient in eliminating propranolol in various waters, but the formation of oxidation products in these processes, as well as the assessment of their toxicity, has not been systematically addressed. In this study, we identified and compared transformation products of propranolol produced by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-). The electrostatic attraction enhances the reaction between SO4 center dot- and the protonated form of propranolol, while (OH)-O-center dot shows non selectivity toward both protonated and neutral propranolol species. The hydroxylation of propranolol by (OH)-O-center dot occurs at either amine moiety or naphthalene group while SO4 center dot- favors the oxidation of the electron-rich naphthalene group. Further oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- results in ring-opening products. Bicarbonate and chloride exert no effect on propranolol degradation. The generation of CO3 center dot- and Cl-containing radicals is favorable to oxidizing naphthalene group. The acute toxicity assay of Vibrio fischeri suggests that SO4 center dot- generates more toxic products than (OH)-O-center dot, while CO3 center dot- and Cl-containing radicals produce similar toxicity as SO4 center dot-. High concentrations of bicarbonate in UV/H2O2 increase the toxicity of treated solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concern about the presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment from wastewater discharge is mounting. In this work, the occurrence and fate of atenolol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, and chloramphenicol, including 10 different stereoisomers, were investigated in sewage and sludge from diverse treatment processes in 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hong Kong via 4 sampling campaigns over a period of 2 years. The average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the STPs ranged from 4.91 g/d to 6290 g/d, with sludge carrying much lower amounts than the discharged effluent. Mass balance analysis revealed that: larger quantities of these pharmaceuticals were released during the dry seasons, biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for atenolol and chloramphenicol, and the removal via primary sedimentation and disinfection processes was insignificant (<30%). Selectivity toward R-(+)-atenolol, S-(-)-metoprolol, and R-(-)-venlafaxine was mostly found across secondary treated effluent samples. Sold as an enantiopure pharmaceutical in R,R-para-form, chloramphenicol was preferentially eliminated after biological process. This is the first study on the occurrence of chloramphenicol enantiomers in the aquatic environment. Ecotoxicological assessment indicated that atenolol and metoprolol could pose risks to marine fish in effluent-receiving waters (i.e., the western waters and Victoria Harbor) of Hong Kong, while R-(+)-atenolol could pose a risk to protozoans five times higher than the S-(-)-enantiomer.

AB Plastic pollution in oceans is a global problem, with growing research efforts focusing on the threat of micro plastics (< 5 mm fractions). A source of microplastics pollution is derived from personal care products that contain polyethylene micro-spheres which are not captured by wastewater plants. In this work, ten personal care products (mainly scrubs) containing microplastics and marketed in Spain, were physico-chemically characterized. The obtained results proved that those microplastics had different particle size and are presented in high percentages in some cases, between 6 and 7% of the total product. Products with smaller particles usually showed higher concentrations than products with larger particles. Although all the microplastics were shown to be polyethylene, some impurities were observed that demonstrated the presence of silicates and oxides in the microplastics. Regards to morphology, the shape of the particles was irregular in general, although some completely spherical particles can be observed.

AB Early stages of ontogenesis determining subsequent growth, development, and productivity of crops can be affected by wastewater and sludge contaminated with pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac (DCF) and paracetamol (PCT; both 0.0001 to 10mg/L) did not affect seed germination and primary root length of onion, lettuce, pea, and tomato. Conversely, 20-day-old pea and maize plants exhibited decrease in biomass production, leaf area (by approx. 40% in pea and 70% in maize under 10mg/L DCF), or content of photosynthetic pigments (by 10% and 60% under 10mg/L PCT). Quantum yields of photosystem II were reduced only in maize (F-V/F-M and phi(II) by more than 40% under 10mg/L of both pharmaceuticals). Contents of H2O2 and superoxide increased in roots of both species (more than four times under 10mg/L PCT in pea). Activities of antioxidant enzymes were elevated in pea under DCF treatments, but decreased in maize under both pharmaceuticals. Oxidative injury of root cells expressed as lowered oxidoreductase activity (MTT assay, by 40% in pea and 80% in maize) and increase in malondialdehyde content (by 60% and 100%) together with the membrane integrity disruption (higher Evans Blue accumulation, by 100% in pea and 300% in maize) confirmed higher sensitivity of maize as a C4 monocot plant to both pharmaceuticals.

AB Pharmaceuticals entering aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluents are of increasing concern for wild animals. Because some pharmaceuticals are designed to modulate human behaviour, measuring the impacts of exposure to pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour has become a valuable endpoint. While laboratory studies have shown that pharmaceuticals can affect fish behaviour, there is a lack of understanding if behaviour is similarly affected in natural environments. Here, we exposed sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts to two concentrations of two pharmaceutical pollutants often detected in surface waters: temazepam (a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic) or irbesartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker, anti-hypertensive). We tested the hypothesis that changes to behavioural traits (anxiety and activity) measured in laboratory trials following exposure are predictive of behaviour in the natural environment (downstream migration). Measures of anxiety and activity in the laboratory assay did not vary with temazepam treatment, but temazepam-exposed fish began migrating faster in the field. Activity in the laboratory assay did predict overall migration speed in the field. In contrast to temazepam, we found that irbesartan exposure did not affect behaviour in the laboratory, field, or the relationship between the two end-points. However, irbesartan was also not readily taken up into fish tissue (i.e. below detection levels in the muscle tissue), while temazepam bioconcentrated (bioconcentration factor 7.68) rapidly (t(1/2) < 24 h). Our findings add to a growing literature showing that benzodiazepine pollutants can modulate fish behaviour and that laboratory assays may be less sensitive at detecting the effects of pollutants compared to measuring effects in natural settings. Therefore, we underscore the importance of measuring behavioural effects in the natural environment.

AB The adsorption of amoxicillin (AMX), ampicillin (AMP), and chloramphenicol (CHLR) from simulated antibiotic-contaminated water using adsorbents prepared from grape slurry waste is studied. Batch adsorption experiments are carried out to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents for AMX, AMP, and CHLR. Adsorption isotherms are described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, while the pseudo-second order kinetics describe the sorption processes. Negative values of the enthalpy change show that the sorption processes are exothermic, and the positive values of the Gibbs free energy change indicates non-spontaneous but feasible nature of the adsorption. The study shows that grape slurry waste could be a good precursor to prepare effective adsorbents for the remediation of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater.

AB It is of ongoing interest to evaluate real-time instruments for monitoring water contaminants for source water control and water reuse system performance applications. Portable fluorescence sensors have the potential to provide instantaneous measurements of fluorescent organic compounds present in chemical and biological pollutants. Comparisons between one-dimensional fluorescence data from portable sensors and data obtained from higher sensitivity benchtop fluorometers, capable of three dimensional spectral acquisition, are needed to evaluate the performance of portable instruments. We tracked fluorescence intensities in titration experiments with diverse pollutants, including two volatile organic compounds (diesel, gasoline), three pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, caffeine, lopinavir), and a pesticide (isoxathion), added to creek water, tertiary treated wastewater, and water from different treatment stages at a water reuse facility. Our results indicated that optical filters with wavelength bands in the tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like peak regions were able to track the peaks of most organic chemicals studied. Fluorescence intensities measured with both portable and benchtop instruments were highly correlated for all samples and all contaminants (R-2 > 0.90). In the final product water of the water reuse facility, both portable and benchtop fluorometers displayed high sensitivity, being able to discern contaminants from the background at concentrations as low as 0.2 ppb. However, in creek water, post-ozone water, and tertiary effluent, pollutant detection limits were much higher for both portable and benchtop fluorometers. Therefore, in waters with substantial background fluorescence, fluorescence-based sensors may be best suited for tracking higher concentrations of organic contaminants, such as those found in chemical spills in source waters.

AB The excessive release of phosphorus is a main cause of eutrophication, but phosphorus itself is an important non-renewable resource. If phosphorus could be recovered from wastewater, it can not only reduce the pollution, but also reach the aim of resource recycle. An induced crystallization process was combined with the schorl/H2O2 system to remove and recover phosphorus from the fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater. Firstly, in the schorl/H2O2 heterogeneous Fenton system, the organic phosphorus (OP) in fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater was transformed to the inorganic phosphorus (IP), and then IP was recovered by hydroxyapatite (HAP) induced crystallization process. In sequence batch reactors (SBR), the entire crystallization process went through 60 cycles, and each of the cycle lasted for 12 h, including 2 h for reaction and 10 h for sedimentation. The influence of different initial pH values, which were 8, 9, 10 and 11, on the induced crystallized product was investigated. The morphology and structure of the induced crystallized product were analysed. The results indicated that when the pH value was about 8, most of the recovery products was in the form of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCP, CaHPO4). At pH 9 the recovery products were mainly DCP and HAP. As pH increased to 10 or 11, most of the recovery products would be HAP and calcium carbonate. Carbonate involved in the crystallization reaction, especially at pH 11.

AB The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in pollution associated with antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban water systems, threatening the public health and the ecological security. In this study, the patterns of the diversity and abundance of the antibiotics and ARGs in a typical city (Kunming, China) were analyzed by monitoring their presence in the tap water, the land block sewage discharge units, the sewage pipes, the influent of WWTP, the effluent of WWTP, and the urban river channel. The results showed that although the average concentration of total antibiotics in tap water was 10 ng/L, the concentrations reached hundreds or even thousands of ng/L in all the other sections, indicating antibiotics entering water system through human or pets discharge. The relative abundances of ARG copies to 16S rRNA gene copies in the effluent of WWTP, the urban river channel which was the downstream of WWTP were higher than those of the sewage pipes, increasing risk of ARG transfer after treatment by WWTP. In general, the relative abundance of ARGs in spring was higher than that in winter. There was no significant correlation between antibiotics concentrations and their corresponding ARGs, except for a correlation between tetracyclines and tet-resistance genes. Due to the existence of transposases, the urban water system is exposed to a widespread risk of horizontal transfer of ARGs.

AB This study aims to demonstrate that an up-flow microbial fuel cell-coupled constructed wetland (UCW-MFC) can effectively treat synthetic wastewater that contains a high concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs, 10 mg L-1 level), such as ibuprofen (IBP) and bisphenol A (BPA). A significant decline in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal was observed when BPA was added, which indicated that BPA was more toxic to bacteria. The closed circuit operation of UCW-MFC performed better than the open circuit mode for COD and NH4+-N removal. Similarly, the removal rates of IBP and BPA were increased by 9.3% and 18%, respectively, compared with the open circuit mode. The majority of PPCPs were removed from the bottom and anode layer, which accounted for 63.2-78.7% of the total removal. The main degradation products were identified. The removal rates of IBP and BPA decreased by 14.6% and 23.7% due to a reduction in the hydraulic detention times (HRTs) from 16 h to 4 h, respectively. Electricity generation performance, including voltage and maximum power density, initially increased and then declined with a decrease in the HRT. Additionally, both the current circuit operation mode and the HRT have an impact on the bacterial community diversity of the anode according to the results of high-throughput sequencing. The possible bacterial groups involved in PPCP degradation were identified. In summary, UCW-MFC is suitable for enabling the simultaneous removal of IBP and BPA and successful electricity production.

AB The objective of this study was to identify transformation products (TPs) of citalopram (CIT), an antidepressant drug, in laboratory experiments. Moreover, toxicity predictions and analyzes in wastewater samples were performed. For the formation of TPs, raw water was used for the processes of hydrolysis; photodegradation under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and chlorination. The toxicities were predicted by computational toxicity assessment. The TPs were identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) in broadband collision induced dissociation (bbCID) acquisition mode and product ion scan mode (MS/MS). The probable structures of the TPs under study were established based on accurate mass, fragmentations observed in the MS spectra and prediction tools software. The experiments resulted in seventeen possible identified TPs and their stability and formation was monitored over time in the experiments. Two of these TPs were identified in wastewater samples It was also observed that most of TPs formed were either less toxic then CIT or had a similar toxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new acid-resistant bacterium Acinetobacter sp. JR1 was isolated, and its feasibility in nitrogen removal was investigated under acidic condition. Results show that JR1 indicated excellent ammonium and nitrate removal abilities with no accumulation of intermediates, and the maximum ammonium and nitrate removal efficiencies were 98.5% and 91.1%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrated that JR1 preferred to use ammonium with ammonium and nitrate as the mixed N-sources. For JR1, ammonium was assimilated directly as nutrients into cells and also converted into N-2 through heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification. Under acidic condition, JR1 performed comparable nitrogen removal abilities to other strains under neutral or weak alkaline environment, and the efficient removal of ammonium occurred at pH 4.5-10, C/N 12-24, 20-40 degrees C, DO >= 4.72 mg/L, 0-1.5% of salinity, 10 mg/L Zn2+ or 20 mg/L Mn2+. All these make JR1 a promising candidate for treating acidic wastewater containing nitrogen.

AB This work investigated the individual and combined effects of zinc oxide, norfloxacin, and sulfamethazine on sludge anaerobic digestion-associated methane production, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and microbial diversity. Norfloxacin and sulfamethazine (500 mg/kg) did not inhibit methane production, but inhibited its production rate. Zinc oxide nanoparticles with antibiotics inhibited hydrolysis, fermentation, and methanogenesis over varying digestion periods. Complex pollution had a greater impact on methane production than zinc oxide alone, with acute, synergistic toxicity to methanogenesis over short periods. Complex pollution also had varying effects on bacterial and archaeal communities during digestion. These results aid understanding of the toxicity of emerging contaminants in sludge digestion, with the potential to improve pollution removal and reduce associated risks.

AB This study aimed to evaluate treatment performance and membrane fouling of a lab-scale Sponge-MBR under the added ciprofloxacin (CIP) dosages (20; 50; 100 and 200 mu g L-1) treating hospital wastewater. The results showed that Sponge-MBR exhibited effective removal of COD (94-98%) during the operation period despite increment of CIP concentrations from 20 to 200 mu g L-1. The applied CIP dosage of 200 mu g L-1 caused an inhibition of microorganisms in sponges, i.e. significant reduction of the attached biomass and a decrease in the size of suspended flocs. Moreover, this led to deteriorating the denitrification rate to 3-12% compared to 35% at the other lower CIP dosages. Importantly, Sponge-MBR reinforced the stability of CIP removal at various added CIP dosages (permeate of below 13 mu g L-1). Additionally, the fouling rate at CIP dosage of 200 mu g L-1 was 30.6 times lower compared to the control condition (no added CIP dosage).

AB In this study, a novel PA-g/co-PVP reverse osmosis (RO) composite membrane with high-hydrophilic, antifouling, high salt rejection properties, was prepared according to the principle of sand-fixing grass effect for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) was used as a "seed agent" that was seeped into a low cross-linked polyamide (PA) film. A hydrophilic molecular brush of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) grafted on the PA surface (PA-g-PVP) similar to grass growing on sand and a cross-linked copolymer layer of PA and NVP (PA-co-NVP) similar to grass roots distributed in sand, as well as an interlayer cross-linking between PA separation layer and PES ultrafiltration membrane with a highly stable interfacial structure, synchronously occurred through gamma-ray radiation. Upon incorporation of 1.0% of NVP, the resultant PA-g/co-PVP membrane achieved 18.8 degrees water contact angle and high flux recovery ratio (FRR) values of 91.23%, 96.28%, and 93.67% for the foulants of bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium alginate (SA), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively. The FRR value of pharmaceutical wastewater-polluted membrane after cleaning was 94.30%. The PAg/co-PVP RO membrane showed outstanding separation stability due to the radiation cross-linking reactions, which limit matrix swelling and interface delamination similar to the action principle of sand-fixing grass. These merits prove that the RO membrane developed in this study can be used in many applications, including small organic molecular wastewater separation.

AB Natural and synthetic progestins in receiving streams can disrupt the normal endocrine systems of fish. Norethindrone (NET) is a widely used synthetic progestin that often appears in wastewater effluents. For this research, adult female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were exposed to NET at three concentrations. The effects of NET on the following biological factors were evaluated: the histology of the ovaries and livers, the anal fin morphology, and transcription of genes related to steroidogenesis signaling pathways in the livers. After 42 d exposure to NET at 33.0 ng L-1 and 347.5 ng L-1, rapid masculinization, an increase in the number of atretic and postovulatory follicles in the ovary, enhanced vascularization, degenerated hepatocytes and irregular nuclei in the livers were observed. Exposure to NET did not affect the expression of the androgenic and estrogenic receptor genes and Cyp19a except for a significant up-regulation of Er alpha. However, the expression of Vtg A, Vtg B, and Vtg C were markedly inhibited in the females exposed to three concentrations of NET. Compared to the control female, exposure to NET at 33.0 ng L-1 and 347.5 ng L-1 caused a 4.4- and 5.8-fold increase in the expression of Hsd17 beta 3 in the livers, respectively. The results demonstrate that NET can cause rapid masculinization of female G. affinis, hepatopathological alterations and inhibited expressions of Vtg A, Vtg B, and Vtg C. The results imply that G. affinis populations might be threatened in NET-contaminated environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the effects of five different pre-oxidation scenarios (i.e., individual, simultaneous, and sequential applications of chlorine dioxide [ClO2] and chlorine [Cl-2]) on the removal of N-nitro-sodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential (FP) from different water matrices (i.e., non-impacted natural waters, wastewater [WW]-impacted, and polymer-impacted waters) with subsequent chloramination were investigated. Practically relevant doses of ClO2 and Cl-2 were applied for all scenarios to avoid the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) at regulatory levels. The removal efficiency of NDMA FP for all the oxidation scenarios (individual or simultaneous) was <20% in non-impacted natural water samples. In 20% WW-impacted waters, pre-oxidation with ClO2 at pH 7.8 resulted in a significant reduction in NDMA FP (56-73%), whereas pre-oxidation with Cl-2 showed less removals (40-50%). For the integrated oxidation scenarios (i.e., simultaneous or sequential application), NDMA FP removals further increased (20-45%), especially, at pH 6.0 compared to individual application of oxidants in WW -impacted waters. The formation of NDMA in pre-oxidized water samples also decreased significantly under uniform formation condition (UFC). In polymer-impacted waters, integrated applications of Cl-2 and ClO2 significantly improved the deactivation of polymer-derived NDMA precursors independent of oxidation time (10 vs. 60 min) and pH (6.0 vs. 7.8) compared to individual application of these oxidants. In addition, chlorite (ClO2-) formation was low and maintained well below 1 mg/L for integrated applications of Cl-2 and ClO2, while chlorate (ClO3-) formation increased significantly as compared to application of ClO2 only.

AB Scientists are on the lookout for a practical model that can serve as a standard for sorting out, identifying, and characterizing microplastics which are common occurrences in water sources and wastewaters. The microbeads (MBs) used in cosmetics and discharged into the sewer systems after use cause substantial microplastics pollution in the receiving waters. Today, the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics is banned. The existing use cases are to be discontinued within a few years. Yet, there are no restrictions regarding the use of microbeads in a number of industries, cleaning products, pharmaceuticals and medical practices. In this context, the determination and classification of MBs which had so far been discharged to water sources and which continue to be discharged, represent crucial problems. In this work, we examined a new approach for the classification of MBs based on microscopic images. For classification purposes, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -a Deep Learning algorithm- was employed, whereas GoogLeNet architecture served as the model. The network is built from scratch, and trained then after tested on a total of 42928 images containing MBs in 5 distinct cleansers. The study performed with the CNN which achieved a classification performance of 89% for MBs in wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical valsartan is classified as a trace organic compound and is released into wastewater from human consumption. Trace organic compounds are not completely removed during conventional wastewater treatment. In order to prevent their release into the aquatic environment, advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as ozonation are currently implemented. Ozonation leads to the formation of transformation products (TPs), which then enter the receiving waters. In the present work, laboratory-scale ozonation experiments of valsartan solutions were performed. The resulting TPs were analyzed by HPLC-MS and searched for using a non-targeted approach. Of the 51 compounds detected, 27 have tentative structural suggestions based on MS/MS experiments. Ozonation of valsartan does not lead to the formation of TPs with higher toxicity towards A. fischeri than the parent compound. According to QSAR-based environmental behavior estimations, most TPs reveal lower lipophilicity, increased biodegradability as well as decreased acute and chronic toxicities concerning fish, daphnia and algae compared to their parent compound valsartan.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Metformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical with very high use worldwide that is excreted in unchanged form, leading to concern about potential aquatic life impacts associated with MET, and its primary transformation product guanylurea (GUU). This study presents, in two companion papers, a risk assessment following internationally accepted guidelines of MET and GUU in surface water based on literature data, previously unpublished studies, and a new degradation test that resolves conflicting earlier results. Previous studies have shown that MET is removed during sewage treatment, primarily through transformation to GUU. In addition, measurements in WWTPs suggest that MET is not only transformed to GUU, but that GUU is further biodegraded. A prolonged inherent biodegradation test strongly suggests not only primary transformation of MET to GUU, but also subsequent full mineralization of GUU, with both degradation phases starting after a clear lag phase. MET may partition from surface water to sediment, where both transformation to GUU and in part mineralization is possible, depending on the presence of competent degrading microorganisms. In addition, MET may form non-extractable residues in sediments (12.8-73.5%). Both MET and GUU may be anaerobically degraded during sludge digestion, in soils or in sediments. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values in crops and most plants are close to 1 suggesting low bioaccumulation potential, moreover, at least some plants can metabolize MET to GUU; however, in aquatic plants higher BCFs were found, up to 53. Similarly, neither MET nor GUU are expected to bioaccumulate in fish based on estimated values of BCFs <= 3.16. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Metformin (MET), CAS 1115-70-4 (Metformin hydrochloride), is an antidiabetic drug with high usage in North America and Europe and has become the subject of regulatory interest. A pharmaceutical industry working group investigated environmental risks of MET. Environmental fate and chronic effects data were collated across the industry for the present risk assessment. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for MET were modeled for the USA and Europe using the PhATE and GREAT-ER models, respectively. PECs were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) for the USA and Europe. A predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 1 mg/L for MET was derived by deterministic procedures, applying an assessment factor of 10 to the lowest no observed effect concentration (i.e., 10 mg/L) from multiple chronic studies with algae, daphnids and fish. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios were <1, indicating no significant risk for MET with high Margins of Safety (MOS) of >868. MET is known to degrade during wastewater treatment to guanylurea (GUU, CAS 141-83-3), which we have shown to further degrade. There are no GUU toxicity data in the literature; hence, chronic studies for GUU were conducted to derive a PNEC of 0.16 mg/L. PECs were derived for GUU as for MET, plus MECs were retrieved from the literature. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios for GUU were also <1, with an MOS of >6.5. Based on standard risk assessment procedures for both MET and its transformation product GUU, there is no significant risk to aquatic life. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impacts to microbial function, overall performance and eventual fate were assessed for triclosan (TCL) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in intensified (re-circulating) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) constructed wetlands (CWs). The potential toxicity of each pharmaceutical to the intrinsic microbial communities was first assessed over a wide exposure range (0-1000 mu g/l) via an ex-situ dose-response assay to estimate the concentration at which adverse effects were likely to occur. Based on these results an acute (7 day) in-situ exposures (500 mu g/l) were then performed and impacts to the mesocosm systems monitored for 1 month via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) alongside chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates and a range of water quality, and hydrological parameters. Despite the clear potential for negative impacts to microbial function from both compounds observed at 100 mu g/l in the ex-situ dose-response test, no impacts were observed for the 500 mu g/l in-situ exposure in the VSSF mesocosms. COD removal, water chemistry, plant health, and hydrological parameters did not significantly change in response to the in-situ exposure. In terms of fate, the removal efficiency for both TCL and SMX was high (>80%) after 1 h and complete removal (>99.7%) was observed after 168 h. Following the in-situ exposure, and subsequent one month effects-monitoring period, the mesocosms were decommissioned with the media biofilm spatially assessed for organic content as well as TCL and SMX concentrations. TCL and SMX were found to have persisted in the media and demonstrated spatial variation with an overall 2-20% and 5-6% recovered respectively. This suggests that biofilm bound TCL and SMX were biologically degraded in VSSF CWs, however may also accumulate in the biofilm if TCL and SMX are maintained in the influent. These results reinforce the robustness and potential of constructed wetlands for the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Because an understanding of aquatic bioaccumulation of human pharmaceuticals in Latin America is limited, this area was recently identified as a priority environmental quality research need. We examined bioaccumulation of twenty-seven pharmaceuticals. illicit drugs and their metabolites in muscle, liver and gills of multiple fish species (Rhamdia quelen, Hypostomus commersoni, Mottos lacerdae, Prochilodus lineatus) from an urban river receiving wastewater discharges (Parana) and a lotic system (Acaragua) without direct wastewater sources, which runs through a protected area. All samples were analyzed using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Caffeine, which was detected up to 13 mu g/kg, and antibiotics were consistently detected in all fish. Among antibiotics, erythromycin was ubiquitous (0.7-5.6 mu g/kg) but its tissue concentrations were lower than levels of sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim (0.9-5.5 mu g/kg), which are used in human medicine, aquaculture and livestock. Erythromycin bioaccumulation in fish is reported here from Argentina for the first time, though levels of antibiotics in edible muscles of these species were lower than the maximum residue limits for human consumption. We observed norfluoxetine, the primary active metabolite of the antidepressant fluoxetine, ranging from 1.1-9.1 mu g/kg in fish. We further identified benzoylecgonine, a primary metabolite of cocaine, in fish from both study systems, representing the first observation an illicit drug or associated metabolites bioaccumulation in aquatic life from Argentina. Interestingly, high pharmaceutical levels were observed in fish from the Acaragua river suggesting their transport into the protected area, from the surrounding lands. Though fish from the Parana river were sampled near WWTP discharges, pharmaceutical concentrations may have been reduced by hydrological and other environmental conditions, and biological differences among species. These findings, which observed bioaccumulation of select pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and illicit drugs in wild fish sampled inside a protected area highlight the importance of developing an advanced understanding of urban influences on inland protected watersheds.

AB Several micropollutants show low removal efficiencies in conventional sewage treatment plants, and therefore enter the aquatic environment. To reduce the levels of micropollutants in sewage effluent, and thereby the effects on biota, a number of extra treatment steps are currently being evaluated. Two such techniques are ozonation and adsorption onto activated carbon. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of Sweden's first full-scale ozonation treatment plant at removing a number of antibiotics, antimycotics and biocides. The effect of adding granular activated carbon (GAC) on a pilot scale and pilot-scale ozonation were also evaluated. The conventional treatment (13,000 PE) with the add-on of full-scale ozonation (0.55 g O-3/g Total organic carbon (TOC)) was able to remove most of the studied compounds (>90%), except for benzotriazoles and fluconazole (<50%). Adsorption on GAC on a pilot scale showed a higher removal efficiency than ozonation (>80% for all studied compounds). Three types of GAC were evaluated and shown to have different removal efficiencies. In particular, the GAC with the smallest particle sizes exhibited the highest removal efficiency. The results demonstrate that it is important to select an appropriate type of carbon to achieve the removal goal for specific target compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Waters released from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a relevant source of pharmaceuticals and personal care products to the aquatic environment, since many of them are not effectively removed by the treatment systems. The consumption of these products increased in the last decades and concerns have consequently risen about their possible adverse effects on the freshwater ecosystem. In this study, we present a simple, yet effective, analytical model of transport of contaminants released in surface waters by WWTPs. Transport of dissolved species is modeled by solving the advection dispersion reaction equation (ADRE) along the river network by using a Lagrangian approach. We applied this model to concentration data of five pharmaceuticals, diclofenac, ketoprofen, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and irbesartan, collected during two field campaigns, conducted in February and July 2015 in the Adige River, northeastern Italy. The model showed a good agreement with measurements and the successive application at the monthly timescale highlighted significant variations of the load due to the interplay between streamflow seasonality and variation of the anthropogenic pressure, chiefly due to the variability of touristic fluxes. Since the data required by the model are widely available, our model is suitable for large-scale applications.

AB The ever-increasing concentrations of micropollutants (MPs) found at the outlet of conventional wastewater treatments plants, is a serious environmental concern. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM)-based nanofiltration (NF) membranes are seen as an attractive approach for MPs removal from wastewater effluents. In this work, PEMs of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were coated in a layer by layer (LbL) fashion on the surface of a polyacrylonitrile ultrafiltration support to obtain PEM-based NF membranes. The impact of PEM post-treatment, by applying salt and thermal annealing, was then investigated in terms of swelling, hydrophilicity, permeability, and ion rejection. While thermal annealing produced a more compact structure of PEM, it did not improve the ion rejection. Among the different salt concentrations examined for the salt-annealing process, the highest ion rejection was observed for (PAH/PAA)(15) membranes annealed in 100 mM NaNO3, interestingly without any decrease in the water permeability. This membrane was studied for the rejection of four MPs including Diclofenac, Naproxen, 4n-Nonylphenol and Ibuprofen from synthetic secondary-treated wastewater, over a filtration time of 54 h. At an early stage of filtration, the membrane became more hydrophobic and a good correlation was found between the compounds hydrophobicity and their rejection. As the filtration continued until the membrane saturation, an increase in membranes hydrophilicity was observed. Hence, in the latter stage of filtration, the role of hydrophobic interactions faded-off and the role of molecular and spatial dimensions emerged instead in MPs rejection. To test the suitability of the membranes for the ease of cleaning and repeated use, the sacrificial PEMs and foulants were completely removed, followed by re-coating of PEMs on the cleaned membrane. The higher MPs rejection observed in salt-annealed membranes compared to the non-annealed counterparts (52-82% against 43-69%), accompanied with still low ion rejection, confirm the high potential of PEM post-treatment to achieve better performing PEM-based NF membranes.

AB Passive sampling (PS) is a very useful approach for the monitoring of emerging contaminants in environmental matrices, showing greater sensitivity than can be achieved by current best practice - grab sampling - and is applicable to a wide variety of compounds. An EU Directive (2013/39/EC) has added substances to the existing Water Framework Directive (WFD) Priority Substance list. Investigation into PS in the monitoring of these compounds is necessary to show the potential of this technique in supporting monitoring requirements under the WFD. A catchment-based approach evaluated the occurrence of these compounds in Irish surface waters. This work deals with the challenges associated with the use of PS in a legislative context, and for routine monitoring of emerging contaminants. Looking at a number of sites across Ireland, upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants, the focus was on polar analytes and polar PS (POCIS). With method limits of detection (LODs) of 0.001 mg L-1 pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were found in water and passive samples alike, whereas the polar pesticides were not often detected or were below the annual average environmental quality standard levels. The results of this study show the potential for PS as a monitoring technique for emerging and watch-list chemicals.

AB Efavirenz is one of the antiretroviral drugs widely used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus. Antiretroviral drugs have been found to be present in surface water and wastewater. Due to complexity of environmental samples, solid-phase extraction (SPE) is used for isolation and pre-concentration of antiretroviral drugs prior to their chromatographic analysis. However, the commercially available SPE sorbents lack selectivity, which tends to prolong the analysis time. Therefore, in this study a molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized for the specific recognition of efavirenz and then applied as the SPE sorbent for its extraction from wastewater and surface water samples. The imprinted and non-imprinted polymers were synthesized using a bulk polymerization technique where efavirenz was used as the template, 2-vinylpyridine as functional monomer, 1,1'-azobis-(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) as initiator, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker and toluene: acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) as the porogenic solvent mixture. The characterization was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-EmmettTeller, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. Results showed better selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymer to efavirenz than did non-imprinted polymer. The analysis was performed using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photo-diode array detector. The analytical method gave a detection limit of 0.41 mu g/L and the analyte recovery of 81% in wastewater. The concentrations found in wastewater ranged from 2.79 to 120.7 mu g/L, while in surface water they were between 0.975 and 2.88 mu g/L. Therefore, the results of this study show a strong need for a detailed screening of efavirenz in major water utilities in the country.

AB The pollution of pharmaceutical wastewater has attracted global attention. Photocatalysis is an attractive yet challenging method for the degradation of pharmaceutical residues. Fabricating efficient Z-scheme hetero-junctions with intimate interface contact for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts is a challenge. Herein, novel visible-light-driven direct Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 hetero-junctions with intimate interface contact were successfully synthesized by in situ hydrothermal growth of Bi2WO6 directly on the surface of CuInS2 network-like microspheres, and the content of CuInS2 was optimized. The photocatalytic activity of optimal Z-scheme 15% CuInS2/Bi2WO6 for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC center dot HCl) is more than three times that of bare CuInS2 and 17% higher than that of Bi2WO6, which is attributed that the intimate interface contact can assure excellent interfacial charge transfer abilities. Moreover, Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions are highly stable with no inactivation in photocatalytic cycles. More importantly, real pharmaceutical industry wastewater can be efficiently disposed by Fenton-aided photocatalysis of Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 hetero-junctions with COD removal efficiency being 90.5%, which is much higher than the reported results, and thus sets a new performance benchmark for practical application in real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB This study is focused on the assessment of potency of electron beam (EB) irradiation for the degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin (OFC) in aqueous medium. The influence of parameters like, initial concentration, solution pH, and presence of various additives viz., NO3, NO2, propanol, thiourea, H2O2 and different water matrices were examined on the degradation of OFC. The degradation followed the pseudo first-order reaction kinetics with dose constant values of 1.861, 0.917, 0.659 and 0.540 kGy(-1) for the following initial concentrations: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mmol L-1 with their corresponding (G(-OFC)) values of 0.389, 0.600, 0.779 and 0.936, respectively. OFC degradation in the presence of different additives showed decrease in the dose constant, mainly owing to the competition reactions of OFC and other scavengers with the radiolytically generated reactive radical species, especially HO center dot radicals. Addition of H2O2 exhibited synergistic effect on OFC degradation and mineralization extent. The effectiveness of EB prominently reduced in wastewater when compared to ultrapure, surface and ground water due to the higher scavenging rates of the reactive species. Based on the Gaussian calculations and LC-QTOF-MS analysis, it was inferred that OFC radiolytic degradation was mainly attributed to oxidative HO center dot radicals and the direct cleavage of OFC molecules. Possible removal pathways for OFC using EB irradiation were proposed with identification of almost twenty one transformation products. The OFC transformation products did not exhibited any cytotoxicity even at 1.0 kGy dose, ensuring the ability of EB technology to make water reusable and recyclable for several applications.

AB This study investigated the degradation of three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX)) by UV/persulfate (UV/PS) in pure water and the influence of wastewater on UV/PS performance. Three NSAIDs have no obvious removal in the PS system, while they all showed a decrease in the UV system, and DCF showed the most significant decrease among the three NSAIDs in the UV system. The degradation of NSAIDs in UV/PS system followed the pseudo first-order degradation kinetics, and the kinetic constants orders are: k(DCF) > k(NPX) > k(IBP). SO4-center dot contributes more than center dot OH in NSAIDs degradation according to tertiary butanol and methanol inhibition tests. According to the degradation products detected by LC-MS, hydroxylation and decarboxylation are main pathways in NSAIDs degradation, and dechlorination is also a main path in DCF degradation. When UV/PS was used to dispose effluents spiked with NSAIDs solution (DCF, NPX, IBP, 0.1 mu M each), 10 times of PS dosage and 6 times treatment time were needed to get the same removal in pure water. The water quality parameters (i.e., natural organic matter (NOM), HCO3-, Cl- and NO3-) affects the degradation of NSAIDs by UV/PS. The degradation efficiency of NSAIDs was inhibited in the presence of humic acid and HCO3-. Meanwhile, Cl- and NO3- barely influenced the degradation efficiency.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the anaerobic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the associated bacterial community changes in swine and sewage sludges. The degradation rate of SMX was higher in swine sludge than in sewage sludge. The addition of lactate, citrate, and sucrose had significant effects on SMX degradation, and sucrose addition yielded a higher SMX degradation rate than the other additives. At concentrations of 0.1-10 g/l sucrose, the SMX degradation rates increased in the sludge. The bacterial genera from swine sludge with sucrose exhibited the highest SMX degrading efficiency. Seventeen bacterial genera were found to be the major bacterial community members involved in SMX degradation in the sludge.

AB The emergence of micropollutants into our aquatic resources is regarded as an issue of increasing environmental concern. To protect the aquatic environment against further contamination with micropollutants, treatment with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is put forward as a promising technique. In this work, an innovative AOP based on electrical discharges in a continuous-flow pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with falling water film over activated carbon textile is examined for its potential application in water treatment. The effect of various operational parameters including feed gas type, gas flow rate, water flow rate and power on removal and energy efficiency has been studied. To this end, a synthetic micropollutant mixture containing five pesticides (atrazine, alachlor, diuron, dichlorvos and pentachlorophenol), two pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and 1,7-alpha-ethinylestradiol), and 1 plasticizer (bisphenol A) is used. While working under optimal conditions, energy consumption was situated in the range 2.42-4.25 kW h/m(3), which is about two times lower than the economically viable energy cost of AOPs (5 kW h/m(3)). Hence, the application of non-thermal plasma could be regarded as a promising alternative AOP for (industrial) wastewater remediation.

AB Achromobacter denitnficans strain PR1, previously found to harbour specific degradation pathways with high sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation rates, was bioaugmented into laboratory-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) operated under aerobic conditions to treat SMX-containing real domestic wastewater. Different hydraulic retention times (HRTs), which is related to reaction time and loading rates, were considered and found to affect the SMX removal efficiency. The availability of primary substrates was important in both bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented activated sludge (AS) for cometabolism of SMX. High HRT (24 h) resulted in low food to microorganism ratio (F/M) and low SMX removal, due to substrate limitation. Decrease in HRT from 24 h to 12 h, 6 h and finally 4 h led to gradual increases in primary substrates availability, e.g. organic compounds and ammonia, resulted in increased SMX removal efficiency and degradation rate, and is more favorable for high-rate wastewater treatment processes. After inoculation into the MBRs, the bioaugmentation strain was sustained in the reactor for a maximum of 31 days even though a significant decrease in abundance was observed. The bioaugmented MBRs showed enhanced SMX removal, especially under SMX shock loads compared to the control MBRs. The results of this study indicate that re-inoculation is required regularly after a period of time to maintain the removal efficiency of the target compound. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB There has been increasing research focusing on the detection and occurrence of wastewater contamination in urban water systems. To find suitable markers to indicate industrial and domestic sewage flows inappropriately entering storm drains, this study investigated the occurrence and fate of 52 chemical markers through wastewater treatment facilities of manufacturers of agricultural and sideline products, beverage products, and pharmaceutical products, which are also consumed in our daily life. Of the 52 candidate markers, sodium, chloride, potassium, isomalto-oligosaccharide, acesulfame, theanine, glycerol, and clarithromycin were found to be conservative markers, with an average change in concentrations through the wastewater treatment processes of <30%. These markers are useful in identifying industrial and domestic sewage flow contamination in urban sewers. Specially, sodium, chloride, potassium, isomalto-oligosaccharide, acesulfame, and clarithromycin exhibited higher concentrations in blackwater than in greywater, with detected average concentrations of 43.8 mg/L, 189 mg/L, 37.3 mg/L, 123 mu g/L, 37.2 mu g/L and 0.99 mu g/L in blackwater, respectively. In contrast, theanine and glycerol were observed with higher concentrations in greywater than in blackwater (average 10.1 mu g/L and 19.5 mu g/L in greywater, respectively). The benchmark concentrations to discriminate between industrial and domestic sewage were also presented. A study in a storm drainage system of downstream Taihu catchment, China demonstrated the usefulness of the markers as low-cost options to trace and quantify misconnected wastewater entries into storm drains, while denoting priority areas for misconnected entries correction.

AB Antibiotic concentrations in surface waters far exceed the pollution limit due to the abuse of pharmaceuticals, resulting in an urgent need for an approach with potential efficiency, sustainability and eco-friendliness to remove antibiotic pollutants. A novel biochar-based nanomaterial was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis and was investigated for its removal potential for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) from both artificial and real wastewater. The associative facilitation between biochar and g-MoS2 nano-sheets was proposed, revealing the favorable surface structures and adsorption properties of the composite. The related adsorption kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics were studied by several models with adsorption experimental data, turning out that biochar decorated by g-MoS2 exhibited optimum TC removal with adsorption capacity up to 249.45 mg/g at 298 K. The adsorption behavior of TC molecules on g-MoS2 BC can be interpreted well by three-step process, and it is dominated by several mechanisms containing pore-filling, electrostatic force, hydrogen bond and pi-pi interaction. In addition, the cost-effective g-MoS2-BC nanocomposites demonstrated excellent adsorption and recycling performance in TC-contaminated river water, which might provide the underlying insights needed to guide the design of promising approach for contaminant removal on a large scale in practical application.

AB The removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is variable and some of these compounds pass these plants almost intact and others presenting a removal efficiency close to 100%. Their incomplete removal results in a continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment. To assess the profile of contamination of influents and effluents over a day, a set of 83 pharmaceuticals were evaluated hourly in a WWTP in Leiria, Portugal. The composite samples of the influent and effluent were also collected.
   Concentrations varied from <MDL for ketoprofen, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, and diltiazem to 63.97 mu g/L for caffeine in the WWTP influent composite sample and <MDL for clarithromycin, bupropion, and diltiazem to 2.01 mu g/L for O-desmethylvenlafaxine for effluent composite sample. Concentrations in the range of mu g/L were found for hydroxyibuprolen, salicylic acid, D,L-norephedrine, and caffeine in the WWTP influent, and diclofenac, carbamazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine in the WWTP effluents.
   For the samples collected hourly, thirty-eight and twenty-nine pharmaceuticals were detected in at least one WWTP sample. In the WWTP influent the total concentration of detected pharmaceuticals was higher between 15 and 22 h and lower in the period from 23 to 10 h in the morning. In the WWTP effluent, a slight variation was noticed throughout the sampling hours.
   Carbamazepine, fluoxetine, sertraline, atorvastatin, caffeine, simvastatin, and trazodone were the pharmaceuticals with risk quotient (RQ) >1 in WWIP influents, and carbamazepine, fluoxetine, sertraline the pharmaceuticals with an RQ> 1 in WWTP effluents.

AB Aquatic systems receive a wide range of pharmaceuticals that may have adverse impacts on aquatic wildlife. Among these pharmaceuticals, antihistamines are commonly found, and these substances have the potential to influence the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Previous studies have focused on how antihistamines may affect behaviours of aquatic invertebrates, but these studies probably do not capture the full consequences of antihistamine exposure, as traditional recording techniques do not capture important animal movements occurring at the scale of milliseconds, such as prey escape responses. In this study, we investigated if antihistamine exposure can impact escape responses in aquatic insect, by exposing damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae to two environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) of diphenhydramine. Importantly, we used a highspeed imaging approach that with high-time resolution captures details of escape responses and, thus, potential impacts of diphenhydramine on these behaviours. Our results show overall weak effects of antihistamine exposure on the escape behaviours of damselfly larvae. However, at stage 2 of the C-escape response, we found a significant increase in turning angle, which corresponds to a reduced swimming velocity, indicating a reduced success at evading a predator attack. Thus, we show that low concentrations of an antihistamine may affect behaviours strongly related to fitness of aquatic insect prey - effects that would have been overlooked using traditional recording techniques. Hence, to understand the full consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic wildlife, high-speed imaging should be incorporated into future environmental risk assessments.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is the most representative antibiotic of the sulfonamides group used in both human and veterinary medicine, and thus frequently detected in water resources. This has caused special concern due to the pronounced toxicity and potential to foster bacterial resistance of this drug. Therefore, and to further understand the fate of SMX in the aquatic environment, its photodegradation under simulated solar radiation was here studied in ultrapure water and in different environmental samples, namely estuarine water, freshwater and wastewater. SMX underwent very fast photodegradation in ultrapure water, presenting a half-life time (t(1/2)) of 0.86 h. However, in environmental samples, the SMX photodegradation rate was much slower, with 5.4 h < t1/2 < 7.8 h. The main novelty of this work was to prove that pH, salinity and dissolved organic matter are determinant factors in the decrease of the SMX photodegradation rate observed in environmental samples and, thus, they will influence the SMX fate and persistence, potentially increasing the risks associated to the presence of this pollutant in the environment.

AB The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols to aminophenols by diverse catalysts has attracted much attention owing to its potential applications in wastewater purification, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical fields. Though great progress has been achieved, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols by different crystal phase structured Ni nanocrystals (NCs) has not been investigated until now. Here, the face centered cubic (fcc) Ni and hexagonal close packed (hcp) Ni NCs are controllably synthesized, and employed as the catalysts for hydrogenation of nitrophenols at ambient pressure by using NaBH4 as the hydrogen carrier. The experimental results reveal that both fcc and hcp Ni NCs can catalyze hydrogenation of nitrophenols to related aminophenols. But the hcp Ni NCs exhibit much higher catalytic activity than fcc Ni NCs no matter which nitrophenols is used. Moreover, both hcp and fcc Ni NCs can be recycled at least ten times without obvious loss of activity, showing an exceptional durability that comparable or even superior to supported Ni catalysts. Deduced from the kinetics and XPS analyses, the higher catalytic activity of hcp Ni NCs is attributed to the more richness of active sites on their surfaces in relative to that of fcc Ni NCs. This work may shed some light on design and development of advanced hydrogenation catalysts based on crystal phase engineering.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are an emerging environmental problem. It is strongly confirmed that pharmaceuticals are present in soils and environmental waters (surface, marine and even groundwater), and that wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are the main source of pharmaceuticals in the watershed. The aim of this study was to recognize the spatial distribution and seasonal changes of selected pharmaceuticals in conventional WWTP with Sludge Treatment Reed Beds (STRBs) technology used for dewatering and stabilization of sewage sludge, because these systems have never been studied in terms of pharmaceuticals distribution or removal potential.
   The research was conducted in conventional WWTP in Gniewino, where raw wastewater was treated using mechanical, biological and chemical removal of the organic matter and nutrients, and sewage sludge was treated with STRB. Determinations of pharmaceuticals (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - ibuprofen, paracetamol, flurbiprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and its metabolites) and basic parameters were carried out in samples of influent and effluent from WWTP and in the liquid phase of surplus activated sludge (SAS) as well as reject water from STRB.
   The potential of removal varied among target pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen and naproxen were completely removed by the standard applied technology of the Gniewino WWTP. Diclofenac and its metabolites were the chemicals with the lowest removal potential in wastewater and the highest detection frequency. These pharmaceuticals were also detected in the liquid phase of SAS as well as in reject water. However, removal potential when using STRB was higher than 94% (mostly higher than 99%), independent of the season. Indeed, the STRB technology is not only efficient in sludge dewatering and nutrient removal (primary purpose), but also elimination of polar pollutants. Nevertheless, removal in STRB did not mean that pharmaceuticals were totally eliminated because these compounds could be "trapped and stored" in beds (by the process of sorption) or transformed into other products. This study is a starting point for further exploration of STRB technology for elimination of emerging pollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater remains a great challenge due to low quantum efficiency and poor solar energy utilization of the currently employed photocatalysts. Herein, a novel BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst is designed and prepared by a simple one-pot solvothermal method, and characterized by various techniques. By using this photocatalyst, degradation efficiency of four kinds of emerging refractory organic pollutants (sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol A, 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen) in water is investigated under simulated solar irradiation. Then, total organic carbon is measured to determine the mineralization degree, and degradation intermediates of the pollutants are identified to propose their degradation pathway. It is found that under the given conditions, complete degradation of the pollutants is observed within the irradiation of 5-24 h, and 81-96% mineralization degree is achieved in 24 h. Furthermore, it is shown that the degradation kinetics can be described by pseudo-first order model. Based on the detected intermediates during the degradation process of 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen, the degradation pathways of these two pollutants are suggested to involve cleavage of side chain, heterocyclic ring opening and hydroxylation of aromatic ring. In addition, the application of the BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst in the purification of the spiked real wastewater is also investigated. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The contamination patterns and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were investigated in the Evrotas River (Southern Greece). This is a temporary river with differing levels of water stress and water quality impairment in a number of its reaches. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in order to capture different levels of water stress and water quality. Four sampling sites located on the main channel of the Evrotas River were sampled in July 2015 (moderate stream flow), and June and September 2016 (low stream flow). Discharge of urban wastewater has been determined as the main source of pollution, with PhACs, nutrients and other physicochemical parameters considerably increasing downstream the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Sparta city. Due to the pronounced hydrological variation of the Evrotas River, generally, the highest concentrations of PhACs have been detected during low flow conditions. Simultaneously, low flow resulted in an increased water travel time and consequently longer residence time that accounted for the higher attenuation of most PhACs. The average decrease in total concentration of PhACs within the studied waterbody segment (downstream of Sparta city) increased from 22% in July 2015 to 25% in June 2016 and 77% in September 2016. The PhACs with the highest average concentration decrease throughout the sampling campaigns were hydrochlorothiazide, followed by sotalol, carbamazepine, valsartan, and naproxen.

AB Research over the last decade on emerging trace organic contaminants in aquatic systems has largely focused on sources such as treated wastewaters in high income countries, with relatively few studies relating to wastewater sources of these contaminants in low and middle income countries. We undertook a longitudinal survey of the Ahar River for a number of emerging organic contaminants (including pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products and industrial chemicals) which flows through the city of Udaipur, India. Udaipur is a city of approximately 450,000 people with no wastewater treatment occurring at the time of this survey. We found the concentrations of many of the contaminants within the river water were similar to those commonly reported in untreated wastewater in high income countries. For example, concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ranged up to 1900 ng/L. Other organic contaminants, such as steroid estrogens (up to 124 ng/L), steroid androgens (up to 1560 ng/L), benzotriazoles (up to 11 mu g/L), DEET (up to 390 ng/L), BPA (up to 300 ng/L) and caffeine (up to 37.5 mu g/L), were all similar to previously reported concentrations in wastewaters in high income countries. An assessment of the population densities in the watersheds feeding into the river showed increasing population density of a watershed led to a corresponding downstream increase in the concentrations of the organic contaminants, with quantifiable concentrations still present up to 10 km downstream of the areas directly adjacent to the highest population densities. Overall, this study highlights how a relatively clean river can be contaminated by untreated wastewater released from an urban centre. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A comprehensive study aimed at monitoring of temporal variability of illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, methamphetamine and cannabis) and therapeutic opiate methadone in a large-sized European city using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was conducted in the city of Zagreb, Croatia, during an 8-year period (2009-2016). The study addressed the impact of different sampling schemes on the assessment of temporal drug consumption patterns, in particular multiannual consumption trends and documented the possible errors associated with the one-week sampling scheme. The highest drug consumption prevalence was determined for cannabis (from 59 +/- 18 to 156 +/- 37 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years), followed by heroin (from 11 +/- 10 to 71 +/- 19 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years), cocaine (from 8.3 +/- 0.9 to 23 +/- 4.0 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years) and amphetamine (from 1.3 +/- 0.9 to 21 +/- 6.1 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years) whereas the consumption of MDMA was comparatively lower (from 0.18 +/- 0.08 to 2.7 doses +/- 0.7 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years). The drug consumption patterns were characterized by clearly enhanced weekend and Christmas season consumption of stimulating drugs (cocaine, MDMA and amphetamine) and somewhat lower summer consumption of almost all drugs. Pronounced multiannual consumption trends were determined for most of the illicit drugs. The investigated 8-year period was characterized by a marked increase of the consumption of pure cocaine (1.6-fold), THC (2.7-fold), amphetamine (16-fold) and MDMA (15-fold) and a concomitant decrease (2.3-fold) of the consumption of pure heroin. The heroin consumption decrease was associated with an increase of methadone consumption (1.4-fold), which can be linked to its use in the heroin substitution therapy. The estimated number of average methadone doses consumed in the city of Zagreb was in a good agreement with the prescription data on treated opioid addicts in Croatia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The treatment of a real pharmaceutical production wastewater by electrolysis using three-dimensional electrodes (3D electrolysis), ozonation, and their combined process (3D/O-3) was investigated in this study. The pharmaceutical wastewater was characterized by a high organic concentration (total organic carbon (TOC) of 13,475 mg/L) and high acute toxicity (100% inhibition of the luminescent bacterial Vibrio fischeri). After 6 h treatment, 23% and 43% of TOC could be removed from the pharmaceutical wastewater by individual ozonation and the 3D electrolysis process using granular activated carbon (GAC) as the particle electrodes, respectively. However, the acute toxicity of the wastewater was hardly reduced by the two individual processes. In comparison, by sparging the ozone generator effluent (oxygen and ozone gas mixture) in the three-dimensional electrode reactor, the 3D/O-3 process considerably enhanced TOC abatement to similar to 71% and reduced the inhibition of the luminescent bacterial to < 70% in Microtox bioassays. These improvements can be mainly attributed to the enhanced hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) production in the 3D/O-3 process via several reaction mechanisms, e.g., the reaction of sparged O-3 with in situ generated H2O2, the electrochemical reduction of O-3, and GAC catalyzed O-3 decomposition, which in turn enhanced the oxidation of organics in the bulk and those adsorbed onto the GAC particle electrodes. The results of this study indicate that there exists a synergistic effect between 3D electrochemical process and ozonation for the degradation of toxic organics in the pharmaceutical wastewater. Compared with the two individual processes, the 3D/O-3 process can thus provide a more effective option for the treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB This work compares the removal of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ubiquitous antioxidant in food and pharmaceuticals, from water either by electrocoagulation (EC) with an Fe/Fe cell or H2O2-based electrochemical advanced oxidation processes like electrochemical oxidation (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectroFenton (PEF) with an air-diffusion cathode. BHA degradation by EC was very poor, whereas the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was more effectively abated in urban wastewater. The effect of pH, number of Fe/Fe pairs and current on the EC performance was examined. The additive was also slowly degraded by EO-H2O2 with a RuO2 based or BDD anode in 50mM Na2SO4 solution. In the simulated matrix, BHA decay by EO-H2O2 was substantially enhanced owing to active chlorine generation from anodic oxidation of Cl-, whereas the center dot OH-mediated oxidation at the BDD surface accounted for DOC decay. In EF and PEF, the center dot OH produced in the bulk upgraded the mineralization, primordially using BDD. In raw urban wastewater at natural pH 7.9, the time course of BHA and DOC contents was affected by NOM oxidation, being accelerated in the order: EO-H2O2 < EF < PEF. The quickest decontamination of urban wastewater occurred in PEF at pH 3.0, because of the higher amounts of center dot OH in the bulk along with WA photolysis.

AB A novel magnetic MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 composite was synthesized for photo degradation of tetracycline (TC) under solar light. The composite was characterized by XRD, TGA, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, FTIR, XPS, VSM, ESR, and PL. The resultant composite was environment friendly material, which exhibited high TC degradation efficiency and excellent reusability. In the meantime, it could be separated easily from TC solution by using magnet, which would save significant time and cost of preparation and degradation, having broad prospect in application. Using 1 g L-1 magnetic MIL-101(Fe)/TiO2 at pH = 7, 92.76% degradation efficiency was achieved under solar light irradiation in 10 min for 20 mg L-1 TC. Further experiments indicated that TiO2 introduced in the composite played an important role in the degradation process, which could be activated by the UV light in solar light to generate large amount of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals. The degradation efficiency of TC in this paper was significantly higher than other research papers reported in last three years. This study put forward new magnetic Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)/TiO2 composite for degrading pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB To remove organic contaminants from wastewater using cost-efficient and currently existing methods, our study investigated char-fortified filter beds for on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) in a long-term field setting. OSSFs are commonly used in rural and semi-urban areas worldwide to treat wastewater when municipal wastewater treatment is not economically feasible. First, we screened for organic contaminants with gas chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based targeted and untargeted analysis and then we developed quantitative structure-property relationship models to search for key molecular features responsible for the removal of organic contaminants. We identified 74 compounds (24 confirmed by reference standards) including plasticizers, UV stabilizers, fragrances, pesticides, surfactant and polymer impurities, pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, and many biogenic compounds. Sand filters that are used as a secondary step after the septic tank in OSSFs could remove hydrophobic contaminants. The addition of biochar significantly increased the removal of these and a few hydrophilic compounds (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, alpha = 0.05). Besides hydrophobicity-driven sorption, biodegradation was suggested to be the most important removal pathway in this long-term field application. However, further improvements are necessary to remove very hydrophilic contaminants as they were not removed with sand and biochar-fortified sand.

AB Considerable pollutant loads can enter surface waters during rain events. Three factors challenge quantification of these pollutant fluxes using traditional sampling methods: (i) concentration fluctuations; (ii) unknown event duration; and (iii) placement, operation, and maintenance of equipment. Passive samplers offer the advantage of sampling in a continuous mode without power supply. However, variable uptake rates due to environmental factors and desorption in the case of fluctuating concentrations can affect the accuracy of time-weighted average (TWA) concentration estimates. While uncertainties related to environmental factors could be accounted for with additional effort, we can neither control nor quantify the concentration variability. We present measured and modelled concentration profiles at high temporal resolution and provide a systematic approach to assessing deviations from true TWA concentration due to fluctuating concentration profiles. We evaluate sampling of sewer overflows (0.3-14 h) with Chemcatcher and 1-week sampling in rivers. The uncertainty due to fluctuating concentrations is small, and other factors such as chemical analyses and sampler calibration have a similar or higher impact. The uncertainty due to fluctuations clearly increases with the sampling duration, particularly when exceeding the half-life of equilibrium. We conclude that passive sampling can also be used in wastewater systems with potentially high concentration variations.

AB In this study, the viability of using electrocoagulation process as a method for pharmaceuticals removal from real municipal wastewater was demonstrated. Batch experimental runs were performed using a simple laboratory scale electrochemical reactor with aluminium and stainless steel as anode and cathode, respectively. Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and amoxicillin (AMX) were selected as representative of pharmaceuticals frequently detected in the aquatic environment. The effects of varying experimental parameters namely current density (0.3, 0.5 1.15 and 1.8 mA cm(-2)), initial pharmaceutical concentration (0.01, 4 and 10 mg L-1), electrolysis duration (3, 6 and 19 h) and application mode (continuous vs. intermittent) on pharmaceutical removal efficiencies were evaluated. High pharmaceutical abatement was recorded at elevated current density and prolonged electrolysis duration due to additional electro-generated coagulant species in solution.

AB A rapid and environmental-friendly analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of different personal care products (PCPs) namely synthetic musks (nitro-, polycyclic and macrocyclic musks) and the disinfectant triclosan (TCS) and its transformation product methyl-TCS in wastewater samples has been developed. The method combines dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with in situ aqueous derivatisation using acetic anhydride (Ac2O) prior to &#xfeff;gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Several parameters affecting both extraction and derivatisation efficiency (e.g. type and volume of extractor and dispersive solvents, volume of derivatising reagent, etc.) were optimised to achieve reliable conditions. Validation of the method for all compounds under study showed good linearity with coefficient of correlation > 0.9947. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 2 and 72 ng/L for musks and 28 and 31 ng/L for TCS and methyl-TCS, respectively. Accuracy, expressed as the average recoveries, ranged between 76% and 87%, and precision, expressed in terms of intraday repeatability (%RSD), was better than 13% for all analytes. The application of the method to the analysis of 24 wastewater samples enabled the detection of all the target PCPs at concentration levels up to 2.7 mu g/L, being galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) the more prevalent, present in 88% and 46% of the samples, respectively.

AB Water scarceness has become a serious dispute in many countries now-a-days. So it is necessary for every individual to conserve water in their day to day domestic activities. Industries must be equipped with proper water treatment and recycling units with the intention of recycling water used by them. Thereby the recycled water should be meritoriously reused for other purposes. Industries like Dye and Pharmaceutical industries should be compulsorily equipped with waste water treatment plants, for example Reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Reverse osmosis systems plays a crucial chunk in wastewater treatment thus reducing the silt density index, hydroxyl ion concentration, etc. Generally reverse osmosis systems are used for providing ultra-fine purified water from saline water, waste water and also conduit water. Reverse osmosis systems bear a simple user-friendly setup and are easy to operate in all problems expository situations effectively. Hence it is clear that a pertinent control mechanism should be followed for the competent functioning of the process. This work focuses on the design and implementation of an Active disturbance rejection control system (ADRC) on an experimental RO membrane water system to address large set-point changes and variations in feed water. The transfer function of the system is to be formulated by suitable mathematical modelling of the reverse osmosis process and the outcome is corroborated with the System Identification toolbox available in MATLAB, with the help of real time observed values. This model then was used as the basis for the design of a nonlinear Active disturbance control system, using geometric control techniques.

AB Optimization of photocatalytic degradation of two natural estrogenic compounds, estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) in aqueous medium was performed on TiO2 coated Pilkington Activ (TM) self-cleaning glass as a novel approach to eliminate free nano-TiO2 releasing to the intended environment after treatment. The active glass was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy to characterize the TiO2 nanoparticles. The main purposes were mineralization of target compounds in the treated water during the photocatalytic reaction and also to investigate the oxidation by products. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been applied to optimize the photocatalytic degradation by changing time, pH, and light intensity as effective factors. According to the results, time was the more effective parameter. The maximum efficiency degradation was achieved in alkaline media. Due to interactive effects between variable factors, 1 mg/L aqueous solution of El and 17 beta-E2 in water was totally decomposed by TiO2 photocatalyzed reactions under UV-C irradiation of 10.08 W/m(2) for 52.49 min at pH 9.42. Results of GC-MS analysis were introduced 17-deoxy Estrone and 2-Hydroxyestradiol as intermediate products for El and 17 beta-E2, respectively. All of the peaks finally disappeared after 170 min. Optimized conditions were applied for real sample of wastewater, presenting 30.40% and 56.84% in the efficiency degradation of El and 17 beta-E2, respectively.

AB Ciprofloxacin is the second generation of quinolone antibiotic used to treat infections in living beings. After using this antibiotic, some percentages of the compound are not metabolized in the body and is excreted along with the urine and excreta. This will reach the treatment plant and the conventional treatment methods are not designed to treat these micropollutants, so it is released into the environment. The presence of ciprofloxacin is detected in surface water samples collected from different areas of the world.This study is conducted to find an effective adsorbent that can remove the ciprofloxacin from wastewater. Biochar produced from agricultural waste can be used as an effective adsorbent. Biochar is prepared under a process called pyrolysis which is carried out under relatively higher temperatures and low oxygen content. In this study, biochar is prepared from rice husk at different temperatures ie, 200 degrees C, 250 degrees C and 300 degrees C. The adsorption experiments were conducted at the varying contact time, varying the initial concentration of biochar and varying residence time in the muffle furnace. The biochar prepared at 300 degrees C showed 96% removal in a contact time of 90 minutes. FTIR results showed that stretching vibration of -OH group, phenolic C-OH stretch, C-O in phenol, C-H stretching vibration and C=O stretching play a vital role in ciprofloxacin adsorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetic reaction and Freundlich isotherm agreed well with ciprofloxacin adsorption process. SEM images after adsorption showed a drastic change in the surface morphology of the rice husk biochar.

AB In recent years, environmental issues have become increasingly significant, mainly due to the contamination of water resources by chemicals and pharmaceuticals, such as medicines, disinfectants, contrast media, detergents, pesticides, dyes, paints, preservatives. Advanced techniques, such as advanced oxidative processes (AOPs), are being studied and improved for the removal of these contaminants in wastewater. Among some AOPs we can mention the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis process using materials based on perovskite (e.g. KNbO3) due to their different properties, such as ferroelectricity, optics and applications involving photocatalysis. The use of these materials has provided an improvement in photocatalytic activity through permanent internal polarization that can effectively separate the photoexcited charge carriers and effectively increase the efficiency of the degradation process.

AB The aim of the study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of (methyl and propyl) parabens likely to be environmental contaminants on early and late passage fibroblasts isolated from human skin. The study was carried out on senescent diploid cell lines, namely normal (senescent) dermal fibroblasts CCD-1136Sk (ATCC (R) CRL-2697 (TM)). In order to assess the cytotoxic effect, the MTT test which determines the cells' metabolic activity and the neutral red uptake assay which assesses the cell membrane integrity (NRU test) were applied. Propyl paraben (PrPB) appeared to be more cytotoxic to the analysed dermal fibroblasts (since it reached lower IC50 values); however, none of the tests found a consistent trend for a change in the cells' sensitivity to the analysed parabens as they age, that would be reflected in the determined IC50 values. On the other hand, having analysed the course of the curves of relationships between the cell viability and the preservative concentration, it was found that at the exposure of CCD-1136Sk fibroblasts to propyl paraben, none of the two tests observed different sensitivity of late and early cell passages; however, the exposure of dermal fibroblasts to methyl paraben, determined using the NRU test, indicated a stronger effect of the preservative at a concentration of 50 and 200 mu g/ml on the earliest cells passage (no. 8), compared to the subsequent passages of these cells. At the same time, the compound with a concentration of 50 and 800 mu g/ml was the least toxic to the latest cells passage (no. 20). The presented results indicate that the analysed parabens used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries may be toxic to skin cells; moreover, it is not excluded that with consecutive passaging, differences in the susceptibility to cytotoxic effects may occur. It therefore appears necessary to take into account the possibility of different later and earlier passages cells' reactivity when interpreting the results of studies into the effects of preservatives on the living body. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that humans may be exposed to preservatives due to environmental contamination.

AB The elimination or degradation of micropollutants from wastewater is becoming ever more important nowadays. Using oxidoreductase enzymes to treat different micropollutants seems a promising solution. However, the viability of the process is highly dependent on the availability and stability of the applied enzymes. In order to improve the stability and provide faster reaction rates, enzymes can be immobilized in various carriers. Properties such as simple production, easy retention and biodegradable carrier material are advantageous, e.g. entrapping laccase in alginate beads. This paper shows the results of the preparation and characterization of immobilized laccase entrapped in calcium alginate beads. The technique of adding a mixture of sodium alginate and laccase dropwise into calcium chloride has been applied, improved and standardized to produce laccase-containing beads of uniform size and activity. For the purpose of characterization, a widely used substrate, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, was used to evaluate the performance of the laccase-containing alginate beads. In addition to the characterization of the laccase-containing alginate beads, the enzyme kinetic constants (K-M = 26.43 mu M, V-max = 0.23 mu M/min) were determined. The reduction in the activity during storage has been described by a decay constant (0.26 d(-1)) that provides information concerning the design constraints of the process. Results will be used to test the method in terms of the removal of organic micropollutants in continuous systems.

The results shown that the both types of TiO2 (named VLP 7500 and PC 500) used in the experiments can be employed as photocatalytic materials for the elimination of clofibric acid from wastewater but under the same experimental conditions, ZnO proved to have a higher catalytic activity. The effects of some parameters such as catalytic material concentration, initial pollutant concentration was studied. In order to evaluate degradation rate of CA, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used. Morphology and structure of catalytic materials were investigated by using scanning electron microcopy (SEM).

AB In extreme situations with a large number of victims, field hospitals are deployed to provide patients with medical treatment. The large number of patients with different types of medications used generates the problem of hospital waste accumulation, including hospital wastewater (HWW). Wastewater is water having compromised characteristics that adversely affect the environment. Many countries do not have strict regulations regarding the disposal of hospital effluent, which contains pathogens, toxic chemicals and radioisotopes. The disposal of such substances poses a serious threat to public health and the environment. This paper discusses the possibilities of field hospital wastewater management development. Micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, are found in different ecosystem elements, like soil, surface and ground water, drinking water as well as treated effluent from conventional wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater discharged from different health facilities, with varying concentrations of pharmaceuticals, is often mixed with municipal sewage, thus remains untreated even after passing through conventional treatment plants. Extensive experience in the application of different types of HWW treatment methods allows the development of an optimal treatment scenario for field hospital wastewater problem resolution, including the combination of Microbiological Reactor and Fenton Process technologies. They are applicable in the case of low wastewater flow rate values, specific for field hospital conditions.

In the presence of glucose co-matrix, indole was used as the characteristic pollutant to acclimate aerobic activated sludge by increasing pollutant concentration. The degradation characteristics and microbial characteristics during training were studied. The experimental results showed that indole could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in activated sludge, but after 2 months of intensive culture, activated sludge could adapt to the environment in which indole was the only carbon source. The bacteria species in the sludge were mainly Comamonas (34.18%) and Acinetobacter (15.45%), which could treat indole with a concentration of 200mg/L, the degradation efficiency was increased from 80% to more than 98.6%, and the SOUR value was stable at more than 7.61 mgO(2)/g MLSS.h, which was suitable for application in advanced treatment engineering of indole-containing pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Toxic anions and heavy metals are one of the most important issues of concern in the world because of their exposure to ionic contamination, which is very common, as well as their potential for the environment and human health. Until now, the applications of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied extensively in many different fields such as filtering, purification, detection and storage. However, for some contaminations (eg organic pollutants, heavy metals and hazardous chemicals), their use in the field of wastewater treatment (WWT) has not yet been fully assessed. In this chapter, we discussed the development and comparison of traditional materials based on metal organic frameworks based wastewater treatment techniques. The process of pollutants in water and the performance and details of MOFs in different treatment areas have been emphasized.

AB A new analytical method has been developed, optimised, and validated for simultaneous detection and identification of betrixaban, an oral anticoagulant drug approved recently by food and drug administration (FDA), and hexazinone, a broad-spectrum triazine herbicide, in aqueous media by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The method was validated by the limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, matrix effect, recovery, precision, and accuracy. The recovery experiments were carried out on raw wastewater samples, spiked with these two compounds, using solid phase extraction (SPE). It is the first time that betrixaban has been analysed for environmental samples. The developed analytical method can be applied for more in-depth studies on the fate and occurrence of these compounds in the engineered and natural aquatic environment. The key benefits of the method described here are:
   It is highly suitable for betrixaban and hexazinone detection and quantification in aqueous samples.
   It can be successfully applied for understanding the fate of betrixaban and hexazinone in real-world water samples.
   Method validation revealed that the method is repeatable, robust, and accurate and can be expanded to include detection of other pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aqueous media. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of using Hexadecyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide modified montmorillonite (HDTMA-Mt) as an inexpensive and suitable adsorbent for the removal of Penicillin G from aqueous solutions. The experiments were conducted in a batch system. The effects of different variables including surfactant loading onto the clay, solution pH, contact time, adsorbate concentration and temperature were investigated on the removal of Penicillin G. Surface properties of the clay were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. Various isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) and kinetics (pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models) of adsorption were studied for the data evaluation. The findings indicated that the sorption capacity of the modified clay was found to be 88.5 mg/g over 60 min contact time at pH 9. The pseudo-second kinetic (R-2 = 0.999) and Freundlich isotherm (R-2 = 0.915) models best fitted the experimental data of Penicillin G by the adsorbent. The negative values of Delta G at higher temperature and positive value of Delta H showed the endothermic and spontaneously sorption of the drug by the clay. It can be concluded that the modified clay can be considered as a cheap and eco-friendly sorbent for the removal of Penicillin G from water and wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Abundantly available chitin/chitosan and their derivatives are full of useful bioactivities. They have numerous applications in industries like food, wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, cosmetics etc. However, their insolubility in water plays spoilsport in way of their use as cost-effective biomolecules for various sectors. Breakage of chitosan to smaller oligosaccharides solves this problem to larger extent preferably using highly specific enzymes. It is well known that that bioactivities of oligosaccharides improve upon hydrolysis to lower molecular weight chitosan i.e. chitooligosaccharides. Availability and production of anti-oxidant chitooligosaccharides by non-chemical approach is desirable for consumer satisfaction. Bioprocessing of chitin/chitosan generated from marine waste to be used as bioactive chitooligosaccharides, can reduce both environmental and human health hazards to a great extent.
   Here we review (1) biocatalytic approaches for chitooligosaccharides production, (2) bioprocess strategies for large scale production, (3) functionalization and (4) antioxidant activity of chitooligosaccharides. Specific and non-specific biocatalysts are used for chitooligomer preparation either by hydrolysis and transglycosylation approaches. Cellulase enzymes have been found to be most frequently used non-specific enzymes for chitosan hydrolysis but microbial chitosanases show excellent performance for chitooligosaccharides production both in terms of yield and specificity. Transglycosylation also have been found to be promising for chitooligosaccharides production especially at small scale. Combination reactors have been found to be most suitable for upscaling of chitooligomer production. Immobilized packed column with ultrafiltration membrane reactors are used for simultaneous hydrolysis and separation of chitooligomers. Chemically synthesized derivatives of chitooligomers have been reported in many studies by introducing carboxyl, quaternized amino, amino ethyl, sulfate, gallyl and many more groups. Amino ethyl, Gallyl, sulphated, phenolic acid conjugated and carboxylated derivatized chitooligomers have shown anti-oxidant activity. Anti-oxidant activity of chitooligomers and relation with their structure and polymerisation has been well established. Chitooligomers longer than trimer show good activity while best activity has been reported in degree of polymerisation from 10 to 12. Acetylation of chitooligomers leads to improvement in -anti-oxidant activity than their deacetylated version.

AB In recent years, heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors has proved to be efficient for the treatment of wastewater containing organic pollutants, such as drugs. Among some photocatalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been studied and applied for this purpose. Therefore, this work investigated the photocatalytic degradation of the antipsychotic clozapine under ultraviolet irradiation, using suspended and supported TiO2 in polystyrene material. Some experimental parameters were evaluated through a factorial design 2(3); a higher degradation rate of the compound was verified using 0.15 g of the immobilized catalyst, [H2O2] of 340 mg L-1 and pH 9, after 6 h of treatment. It was possible to obtain degradations above 93.48% and a two-stage model was proposed to describe the reaction kinetics. An artificial neural network was used to model the photocatalytic process and to determine the importance of the operational variables. It was also established that the use of this treatment resulted in 78.30% removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) under optimized conditions. In addition, the stability of TiO2 support after five consecutive cycles was verified from reuse tests. However, by means of toxicological tests with Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis, it was observed that the products generated by the reaction were more toxic than the original compound.

AB Recently, nanotechnology has been utilized in more or less all fields, such as physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, medicine, etc. In this relation, nanotechnology is also applied in the removal of various impurities/pollutants including pathogenic bacteria and virus from water and other water bodies. Among the various methods used for wastewater treatment, adsorption is found to be one of the better methods because of its low-cost and simplicity of operation. Recently, nanoadsorbents have been explored for the removal of various pollutants from waste water. In this paper, the utilization of nanomaterials, as an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals, organic compounds, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other pollutants, is reviewed and discussed. It is to be mentioned that adsorption capacities of the adsorbents vary depending on the characteristics of the adsorbents. the extent of chemical modification and the concentration of adsorbates. There are also few issues and drawbacks on the utilization of nanoadsorbents that have been addressed. To find out the practical utilization of nanomaterials as low-cost adsorbents on the commercial scale, more research should be conducted in this direction. This review article demonstrated that nanomaterials may be effectively utilized for the treatment of wastewater and may be the future novel and promising adsorbents/materials for water treatment.

AB High-quality Al@Fe-MOF was prepared by in situ modification of Fe-MOF with Al3+. In this study, Box Behnken design as a response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effects of major operating variables and optimization conditions of Al@Fe-MOF on COD removal of oily wastewater. Results showed that initial pH was important more than other parameters, and the order of influence of the value is: ozone flux > initial pH > MOF dosage > reaction temperature. When the ozone flux is 1602.06 mg / L, the MOF dosage is added 0.32 g, the initial pH of the wastewater is 7.04, and the reaction temperature is 29.32 C, the maximum COD removal rate of the wastewater is 95.52%. The predicted value of the model is more accurate and the model predicts better performance. Therefore, the combination of the best response value and the optimal factor level is also credible.

TI WASTEWATER REUSE IN THE INDUSTRY: AN ECO-GENOTOXICOLOGICAL APPROACH
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN

DE Industrial wastewater; bioassays; microbiological parameters; Medical
   Devices; wastewater reuse; genotoxicity
AB The treatment and reuse of industrial wastewater is an important key practice for a sustainable water resources management. Waste-water reuse is a goal to be achieved to tackle and manage the scarcity of water resources caused also by the climate changes in particular in the Mediterranean area. This study aims to identify a set of suitable tools needed to assess the potential reuse of treated wastewater from medical devices (MDs) and pharmaceutical manufacturers taking into account ecogenotoxicological and microbiological parameters. The microbiological parameters investigated were Bacterial Total Count (BTC), E. coli, Enterococci, Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. A set of ecotoxicological assays was selected for this study: the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the alga P. subcapitata, the crustacean Daphnia magna, the fish Danio rerio and the plant Sorghum saccharatum. Seeds of Vicia faba were used for the assessment of the genotoxic effects of wastewater using the Micronucleus test (MN-test). The sampling was performed at three MDs manufacturers and were collected at the inlet and outlet of water treatment plants. The results show a significant decrease in treated wastewater samples of the microbiological parameters and the absence of E. coli. The ecotoxicological assays highlight a significant toxicity of the wastewater before the treatment, while a decrease has been recorded after the treatment for some samples. Genotoxic and sublethal effects were reported in some samples for Vicia faba's micronucleus frequencies and fish embryos respectively. Even though preliminary, this approach can be considered a useful tool in the context of the wastewater industrial reuse management and a possible support to the legislation.

AB Focusing on the photocatalytic degradation of phenol under visible light, the synthesized lanthanum orthoferrites (LaFeO3) by gel combustion method using citric acid as sacrificial agent were investigated. With the highest reaction temperature of 200 degrees C, the physicochemical properties of synthesized samples were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS). On the other hand, UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis was carried out to determine the phenol photodegradation activities and mechanism. The results suggested the well-defined LaFeO3 nanocrystals with specific area of 28 m(2) g(-1) were successfully synthesized. Besides that, variations in operating parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol in synthetic wastewater were also examined. In conclusion, LaFeO3 nanocrystalline exhibited an exceptional photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation, thus providing a perfect alternative for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, natural clinoptilolite was modified by saponin and Brij 35 surfactants to remove diethylstilbestrol (DES) from wastewater in batch and continuous systems. The optimum pH, amount of adsorbent, contact time, and temperature were 11, 10 g/L, 12 h, and 35 degrees C, respectively, for the process. The equilibrium data agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm for natural clinoptilolite (NC), natural clinoptilolite modified by Brij 35 (NC-Brij), and natural clinoptilolite modified by saponin surfactants (NC-saponin) compared to other isotherms. The maximum adsorption capacities resulting from the Langmuir isotherm for NC, NC-Brij, and NC-saponin were 8.012, 23.64, and 39.525 mg/g, respectively. Fixed-bed column experiments were performed under various operational conditions to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent bed breakthrough curve. The lumped method solves bed equations to determine the axial dispersion coefficient (D-z) and overall mass transfer coefficient (K-overall) parameters. Comparison of the kinetic models indicated that the DES adsorption process was well described by the intraparticle diffusion model for NC, pseudo-second-order and fractional power kinetic models for NC-Brij, and pseudo-second-order model for NC-saponin. The negative Gibbs free energy and positive enthalpy changes for NC, NC-Brij, and NC-saponin confirmed that the removal reaction of DES was spontaneous and the adsorption was endothermic, respectively.

AB A developing number of contaminants are entering into water supplies from industrialization and human actions. On account of pharmaceuticals, individual care items, hormones, pesticides, and other substance intensifies that are discharged into the water supply, rising contaminations distinguished in water may have contrary effects to human wellbeing and aquatic environments. In perspective of the previously mentioned issues, late consideration has been centered on the improvement of more effective, low cost, vigorous strategies for wastewater treatment, without additionally focusing on nature or endangering human wellbeing by the treatment itself. The treatment methodologies include primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment using chemical and biological processes. Various strategies, for example, electrochemical, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, coagulation, membrane separation, adsorption, dialysis, flotation, and biological methods have been utilized for the expulsion of harmful contaminations from water and wastewater.

AB The growing urbanization in urban centers have continuously contributed to the deterioration of water quality in rivers. The use of caffeine as a chemical tracer for anthropic activities is an approach to the environmental monitoring of urban waterbodies, as its use is limited to humans and less susceptible to sampling error comparing to other traditional parameters for anthropic pollution. To analyze the possibility of using caffeine as a water quality parameter, the anthropic influence over three watersheds (Atuba, Belem and Palmital) from the Greater Curitiba was observed over five sampling campaigns. The caffeine was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem diode array detection, after the solid phase extraction. Traditional parameters of water quality monitoring, such as ammoniacal nitrogen, thermotolerant coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate, were measured for comparison. The results indicate anthropic influence over the basins, probably due to the lack of infrastructure, thus leading to the assumption of untreated domestic wastewater being discharged. The most degraded river was the Belem river (caffeine concentration of 23.08 mu g.L-1). Caffeine presented itself as an appropriate approach for environmental monitoring, presenting a good correlation with the traditional parameters, such as for thermotolerant coliforms (R = 0.7375).

AB Rivers are ecosystems affected first by environmental pollution. Pollutants originating from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities are firstly involved in rivers. At times when the human population was low, waste materials that had been mixed into rivers could be diluted in a short distance and disintegrated from natural routes. However, with the excessive population growth and industrialization that accompanied development, domestic and industrial wastes also multiplied and the rivers became unable to clean themselves.ln the Northeastern Mediterranean, where the freshwater is exposed to a wide variety of different wastewater, it is inevitable for the settlement centers in the vicinity to leave the Iskenderun Gulf, which is a commercially important region, irreversibly polluted.In this study, accumulation levels of 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormones were investigated in the chemicals that disturbed the endocrine system that caused the pollution of some freshwater sources pouring into Iskenderun Bay and started to worry scientists in the last decade.In our country, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormone levels were found to be high in all freshwater resources covered by the study, according to the Regulation on the Monitoring of Surface Waters and Underground Waters in which the Water Framework Directive was implemented at the national level.

AB The implementation of latest International Maritime Organization emission standard raised stringent requirements for marine domestic sewage discharge. In this study, an air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR) was operated to analyze effects of various ecological factors on effluent of marine domestic sewage. Back-propagation (BP)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to simulate effect of each ecological factor on reactor performance. The activities of four enzymes were investigated to reveal microbial activities in reactor. Experimental results indicates that the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), Mixed Liquid Suspended Solids (MLSS) and pH value cannot be less than 4 h, 3000 mg/L and 6, respectively to meet the IMO emission standard for effluent COD. A small value of mean square error (0.00147) indicated that BP-ANN can well describe the relationship between operation parameters (influent COD, HRT, MLSS, and pH) and effluent COD. The order of relative importance was pH approximate to MLSS > HRT > influent COD. Polyphenol oxidase and urease can serve as indicating factors for reactor performance, whereas dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase showed less susceptible towards varied influent COD and MLSS.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are emerging contaminants that have been detected in surface water across the world. Because conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat such pollutants, new technologies are needed to degrade and oxidize such contaminants. The newly developed oxy-cracking process was utilized to treat the antidiabetic drug, metformin. The process, which involved partial oxidation of metformin in alkaline aqueous medium, proved to decompose the drug into small organic molecules, with minimum emission of CO2, therefore, increasing its biodegradability and removal from industrial treatment plants. The reaction gaseous products were probed by online gas chromatography. The liquid phase before and after oxy-cracking was analyzed for total carbon content by TOC and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The products formed from the nitrogen-rich drug included ammonia, amines, amidines, and urea derivatives. A reaction mechanism for the oxy-cracking process is proposed. Because the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) is believed to play a central role in the oxy-cracking process, the mechanism is initiated by (OH)-O-center dot attacks on metformin, followed by single decomposition or isomerization steps into stable products. The reactions were investigated using density functional theory calculations and validated using high quality 2nd order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory energy calculations.

AB The effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on the development of granular sludge was evaluated in sequential batch reactor (SBR) system under alternating aerobic and anaerobic condition fed with pharmaceutical wastewater which is categorized as a high strength wastewater. The magnetic field intensity used in this research was 20 mT and compared with the control system without magnetic field exposure. The results showed that sludge granulation was enhanced significantly in the presence of magnetic field which made the reaction time for granulation process faster compared with that of the control. Matured, dense and compact granules with diameter of 6.5 +/- 1.0 mm with maximum size reaching up to 8.9 mm were developed with good settling velocity of 76.92 m/h. Magnetic field could stimulated EPS production by accumulating iron, calcium and magnesium compounds in the sludge. The contents of total EPS in R2 (with SMF) were 28.5 mg/gVSS, while in R1 (without SMF) were 21.7 mg/gVSS. The magnetic field system was efficiently treated COD, TP, orthophosphate, TN, nitrate and nitrite with over 90% removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. The application of magnetic field is then helpful and reliable for accelerating the granulation process and is capable in treating the pharmaceutical wastewater

AB A novel photo-Fenton catalytic system for the removal of organic pollutants was presented, including the use of photo-Fenton process and a submerged magnetic separation membrane photocatalytic reactor (SMSMPR). We synthesized TiO2-Fe3O4 composites as the photocatalyst and made full use of the magnetism of the photocatalyst to realize the recollection of the catalyst from the medium, which is critical to the commercialization of photocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment. The photo-Fenton performance of TiO2-Fe3O4 is evaluated with amoxicillin trihydrate (AMX) as a target pollutant. The results indicate that the TiO2-Fe3O4/H2O2 oxidation system shows efficient degradation of AMX. Fe3O4 could not only enhance the heterogeneous Fenton degradation of organic compounds but also allow the photocatalyst to be magnetically separated from treated water. After four reaction cycles, the TiO2-Fe3O4 composites still exhibit 85.2% removal efficiency of AMX and show excellent recovery properties. Accordingly, the SMSMPR with the TiO2-Fe3O4 composite is a promising way for removing organic pollutants.

AB The chemical composition, distribution, and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) present in typical pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants were investigated with the aim of effectively removing these pollutants while minimizing waste of resources and energy. The results of this study indicate that the relative content of an organic compound class is unrelated to the number of organic compounds in the influent and effluent, yet it is directly proportional to the pollution contribution in pharmaceutical wastewater. In wastewater influent, the organic compound classes with the highest relative contents and pollution contributions were acids (relative content=63.65%, contribution to pollution=67.22%), esters (44.96%, 41.24%), and heterocyclic compounds (30.24%, 35.23%); in wastewater effluent, these classes were organic acids (62.54%, 65.13%), esters (52.66%, 59.02%), and organosilicon compounds (42.46%, 37.45%). The different physicochemical characteristics of these pollutants result in different removal efficiencies. For example, N,N-dimethylformamide, 4-methyloctane, N-ethylmorpholine, and 4-amino-N,N- and N,N-diethylbenzamide are refractory and are not degraded by microorganisms; thus, these compounds are discharged into the aquatic environment. Other organic compound classes including organosilicon compounds, acids, esters, heterocycles, and alcohols are mostly biodegraded, which leads to high concentrations of hydrocarbons in the wastewater effluent. The results of this study provide a foundation for the improvement of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The sustainable development of human activities is directly related to the protection of the environment by lowering the anthropogenic stress. Pharmaceuticals - due to their growing consumption (use in medicine. veterinary, animal production, cosmetics) and their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants - are classified as a group of new and rapidly emerging pollutants which have been proven to have a negative impact onto water organisms. In order to ensure the proper protection of human health and the environment there is an urgent necessity of determining pharmaceuticals in clinical. cosmetic, food and environmental samples. Gas (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are valuable techniques for such determination, especially when they are coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS; LC-MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS; LC-MS/MS). The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of sustainability features of analytical techniques in the light of necessity to determine trace amounts of pharmaceuticals in the aforementioned different matrices. Using the Delphi method we performed an analysis of the key sources of the competitive advantages of the application of GC and GC-MS techniques for determining the pharmaceutical residue in clinical, cosmetic. food and environmental samples - compared to techniques based on HPLC or LC-MS. The analysis covered the following areas: (i) the features of the technique, (ii) the price. and (iii) the applicability in various sectors of economy.

AB This study investigated the degradability of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by ozonation for the treatment of secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A set of experiments were conducted in a laboratory using a pilot-scale process consisting of three flow-through reactors in series, by varying the ozone dose (1-9mg L-1), the hydraulic retention time (5-15 min), and the concentration of ozone injected into the reactors (14-42 mg L-1). Thirty-seven PPCPs were detected in the secondary effluent, which belongs to the use categories of antibiotics, analgesics, antiarrhythmic agents, anticonvulsants, vasodilators, lipid modifying agents, anti-itch drugs, anti-psychotic drugs, insect repellents, bronchodilators, diuretics, peptic ulcer drugs, NMDA receptor antagonists, antifungal drugs, antimicrobial drugs, and antineoplastic agents. These PPCPs were broadly classified into five groups ranging from sensitive to ozone (O-3) or unstable in the ozonation process, to the group of insensitive to O-3 or very stable in the ozonation process. These groups are based on the PPCP concentrations after the ozone treatment and their limit of detection (LOD). Furthermore, this study examined comparatively the effects of the ozone dose, the retention (reaction) time, and the concentration of O-3 supplied to the reactors on the degradability of the PPCPs.

AB The waste generated from antibiotics as influents or effluents in important waters from the rivers over their increased usage is quickly leading to societal health problems. To avoid increased accumulation of these antibiotics and their waste matter, new methods and materials are required to solve the problems before escalation. This paper aimed at evaluating treated wastewater effluent quality of three wastewater treatment plants in South Africa's Vaal Triangle: Sebokeng, Rietspruit, and Leeuwkuil. The influents and effluents were collected and analysed for heavy metals, and eight antibiotic substances for human use (erythromycin, ampicillin, cimethoprim, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, chloromphemol, and sulfamethoxazol). The physicochemical parameters were also measured and the results showed that Rietspruit influent (Riet IN) had the highest salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and turbidity. Sebokeng was found to have the lowest values for all the measured parameters except for pH, which was lowest in Leeuwkuil influent (Lee IN). All the antibiotics were below the detection limit in all three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), except for sulfamethoxazole. The average concentration of sulfamethoxazole in the influents and effluents for the three investigated WWTPs ranged 39-47.8 ng L-1. The lowest concentrations of magnesium (8.60 mg L-1) and copper (0.054 mg L-1) were found in Rietspruit (Riet MID) and Lee EFF, respectively. Lee IN had the highest concentrations of Na (27.98 mg L-1), K (7.48 mg L-1), Mn (0.249 mg L-1), Cu (0.208 mg L-1), Fe (0.396 mg L-1), Ni (2.271 mg L-1), and Ca (28.60 mg L-1), while Riet IN had the highest Co concentration of 0.324 mg L-1. Sebo EFF and Sebo IN showed 11.82 mg L-1 of Mg and 2.437 mg L-1 of Zn, respectively. The abundance of the metal concentrations follows the order Ca > Na > Mg > K > Zn > Ni > Fe = Pt > Co = Au > Mn > Cu > Cr > As, indicating a higher concentration of Ca as 28.60 mg L-1, while As has the least value, which is 0.053 mg L-1.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater has become an important source for emitting antibiotics into aquatic environments. However, this study aims to evaluate the potential of different advanced oxidation processes like ozonation, photolysis, and photo-catalysis for degrading a fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in real pharmaceutical wastewater. The raw wastewater contains a high concentration of organic content (COD: 603 mg/L, BOD: 116 mg/L) and significant concentration of CIP (7.91 mg/L). In ozonation, compared with the acidic and basic conditions, the degradation rate was faster under basic conditions and showed a competently degraded CIP (up to 98.7%) under the optimum pH 9 within 30 min, whereas photo-catalysis by using commercial anatase (TiO2) is considered to be the most effective technique for decreasing the concentration of CIP up to 100% within 30 min under the optimized TiO2 dose (1000 mg/L). The degradation rate was quicker and found to be several times faster than in direct photolysis. Furthermore, electrical energy per order was also calculated for all processes and was obvious by the results that photo-catalysis consume less energy of about 8.7 kWh/m(3), for almost complete deduction of CIP.

AB A promising membrane configuration based on immobilized TiO2 on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) dual layer hollow fibre membranes was prepared and successfully employed for the photocatalytic degradation of eight pharmaceuticals. Experiments were carried out in a flow reactor of 0.5 L equipped with a lamp emitting at 254 nm, treating groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent. The efficiency of the new catalyst to phototransform target micropollutants was demonstrated, being dependent on the selected compound. Only the application of photocatalysis using the supported catalyst allowed to increase the phototransformation rate of trimethoprim, metoprolol and carbamazepine treating secondary wastewater effluent (1.4-2.2 times faster than photolysis). The determination of electrical energy per order of magnitude of transformation (EEO) confirmed the lowest energy requirements to transform selected pharmaceuticals in secondary effluent employing the supported catalyst (33-58 kW h m(-3) compared to 49-79 kW h m(-3) applying only photolysis). The detection and identification of transformation products formed during the investigated treatments was performed by UPLCQTOF/MS/MS. 156 transformation products were detected showing two different types of time profiles, namely a bell-shape trend or a constant increase along reaction time thus accumulating in the reaction mixture. The chemical structure for 19 out of 156 detected compounds was proposed as derived from parent compounds spiked in the secondary effluent.

Biological treatability studies conducted on these wastewaters showed that the wastewater having BOD/COD ratios above 0.4 could be effectively treated using activated sludge process at 0.21-0.25 g COD/(g VSS d) organic loading. One of the tablet production wastewaters was found to be practically non-biodegradable. Ozonation of this wastewater yielded a limited increase in biodegradability. 60% COD removal could be obtained by biological treatability experiments at organic loadings of 0.06 to 0.1 g COD/(g VSS d) using composite samples prepared as a mixture of ozonized and non-ozonized tablet wastewaters.

AB This paper investigates removal efficiencies of ozone and hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on pharmaceuticals (antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in water solution, which are commonly presented in outflow of wastewater treatment plant. It is proved that AOPs are able to satisfactory remove these substances from water and interrupt its entrance to aquatic environment. Balance between removal efficiencies and costs is the main issue of current research into removing xenobiotics from wastewaters. To investigate justification of using costlier processes for reaching higher effectivity, sets of trials were performed. Artificially contaminated drinking water matrix was treated by various combinations of AOPs (O-3, H2O2, UV, O-3/UV, H2O2/UV, O-3/H2O2) in flow through AOPs pilot unit. Evaluation of removal efficiencies for each AOPs combination was made. Study proves that AOPs are capable of pharmaceuticals removal, especially ozone-based processes which showed very high rate in removal of studied substances in comparison to hydrogen peroxide-based processes. However, coupling ozone with UV or hydrogen peroxide did not result in significant increase of pollutant removal and justification of higher costs is debatable.

AB The efficiency of ozone for the treatment of organics contaminated wastewater is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition in the aqueous phase. Micro-nano-bubbles (MNBs) are a novel method to prolong the reactivity of the ozone in the aqueous phase, thereby accelerating the treatment of the contaminant. In this study, the effects of pH and salinity on the treatment efficiency of ozone MNBs were examined. The highest efficiency was observed in weak acidic conditions and an increase in salinity enhanced the treatment efficiency significantly. Furthermore, the treatment of highly saline industrial wastewater as well as multi-contaminant groundwater containing persistent organics were also investigated. Treatment using ozone MNBs had a considerable effect on wastewaters that are otherwise difficult to treat using other methods; hence, it is a promising technology for wastewater treatment.

AB Kinetic evaluation of an acidogenic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated. For kinetic modeling of the acidogenic reactor (Monod, Contois, Grau, et al.), first-order kinetic models were used. These models have high correlation coefficients in this study. Monod models have shown high correlation coefficients (99%) which were used in describing the process kinetics of the anaerobic acidogenic reactor. Kinetic studies showed that sludge yield (Y) and decay rate (Kd) were 0.25 mg VSS/mg COD and 0.79 1/day, respectively.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are mainly composed of products used in large quantities in everyday life such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, plasticizers, and different industrial additives. Some of the emerging contaminants are persistent and their complete removal is hard to achieve using conventional wastewater treatment processes. The current study focused on the application of classical Fenton process for the removal of selected pharmaceutical compounds (a sub-category of CECs). Acetaminophen was selected to represent this class of compounds and Fenton oxidation was carried out in a column packed with synthetic Zeolites analcime. Face-centered central composite design strategy was adopted to design and perform the experimentation. Three factors, pH, Fe2+:H2O2, and empty bed contact time, were used with three levels of each for experimental design. Quadratic model (with reduced terms) was observed to best fit the experimental data. Experimental results supported with ANOVA indicated that pH and Fe2+:H2O2 ratio had significant effect on removal of acetaminophen whereas empty bed contact time did not. pH (3-6) and Fe2+:H2O2 ratio (1.5-3) is available to achieve complete removal of acetaminophen. Acidic pH of 3, a limitation of homogeneous Fenton process, could be subdued by increasing the Fe2+:H2O2 ratio. The mechanism of removal of acetaminophen were observed to be Fenton oxidation as well as the adsorption on zeolites packed in column.

AB In recent decades the Yinma River Basin has been receiving increasing pollution from industrial and domestic wastewater, agriculture, and livestock production - which are all potential 4-NP pollution sources. Thus, this work investigated spatial-seasonal distribution, risks, and seasonal variations of 4-nonylphenol in the aquatic environment of the Yinma River Basin. The results indicated that the highest concentrations in water and sediment occurred in livestock-production, industrial, and domestic-wastewater areas, and the lowest occurred in agricultural areas; a seasonal variation in 4-NP concentrations in water was observed, with the highest concentrations occurring in the dry season and the lowest concentrations in the wet season. The results for risk quotient indicated that in three water seasons, low ecological risks of 4-NP in water primarily occurred in agricultural areas, and high ecological risks occurred downstream of domestic-wastewater drainage; the ecological risks of 4-NP in sediment from all the sampling sites were exposed to moderate or high ecological risks. Based on the results for hazard quotient, a seasonal variation in human health risks of 4-NP in water was observed; except for a sampling site located downstream of domestic wastewater drainage, human health risks of 4-NP in water were low.

AB Sources of heavy metals and various micropollutants and their journey into the environment are relatively well studied today. One of the areas where a large proportion of micropollutants end up is wastewater treatment plants (WWTP); therefore, plant operators have become increasingly concerned about how to meet pollution requirements and to reduce pollutant loadings to the environment. This study analyses two possible technological alternatives to remove micropollutants using powdered activated carbon (PAC) by conducting laboratory tests. In the first alternative, a tertiary treatment was conducted with PAC dosed into the treated effluent of the operating WWTP. In the second alternative, PAC was dosed into the bioreactor. The decrease in organic matter and organic micropollutants was measured using the sum parameter total organic carbon (TOC). The tests revealed that for the removal of Cu and TOC the tertiary treatment was more effective, with removal efficiencies of 10.9% and 82.1%, respectively. On the other hand, dosing PAC into the bioreactor had a better removal efficiency for Cr (48.3%), Ni (67.5%), Zn (55.4%), Pb (36.3%), and As (66.7%). As to the removal efficiencies per 1 g of PAC, the highest effect was achieved with the dose of 34 mg/L of PAC dosed into the effluent and 14 mg/L of PAC dosed into the bioreactor. Consequently, the selection of technology requires assessment of the capital costs, operating costs, and sludge treatment technology because dosing PAC into the bioreactor will move all the adsorbed hazardous compounds into the sludge phase, thereby making an immediate use of the sludge complicated.

AB A visible light-induced, Cu-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst was synthesized by a microwave hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic efficiency was investigated in the degradation of model water pollutants like Methylene Blue (dye) and ibuprofen (pharmaceuticals), as well as the inactivation of Escherichia coli (bacteria). The Cu-doped BiVO4 samples showed better efficiency than undoped BiVO4, and the 1 wt.% Cu-doped BiVO4 sample showed the best efficiency. The degradation of Methylene Blue reached 95%, while the degradation of ibuprofen reached 75%, and the inactivation of E. coli reached 85% in irradiation with visible light. The appearance of additional absorption band shoulders and widening of the optical absorption in the visible range makes the prepared powder an efficient visible light-driven photocatalyst. Moreover, the formation of an in-gap energy state just above the valance band as determined by density functional theory (DFT) first principle calculation, facilitates the wider optical absorption range of the doped system. Similarly, this in-gap energy state also acts as an electron trap, which is favorable for the efficient separation and photoexcited charge carriers' transfer process. The formation of oxygen vacancies due to doping also improved the separation of the charge carrier, which promoted the trapping of electrons and inhibited electron hole recombination, thus increasing the photocatalytic activity. No decrease in the efficiency of the 1 wt.% Cu-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst in the degradation of ibuprofen over three consecutive cycles revealed the stability of the photocatalyst towards photocorrosion. These findings highlight the multifunctional applications of Cu-doped BiVO4 in wastewater containing multiple pollutants.

AB In this study, the removal of selected pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, chlorpheniramine maleate, and paracetamol from water using natural Jordanian zeolite was studied. The influence of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and initial pharmaceutical concentration on the adsorption process was investigated using batch and column methods. The optimal pH for the removal of all selected pharmaceuticals was found to be 2 except for diclofenac sodium where the optimal pH was 6. The optimum adsorption time was found to be 80 min. The percentage removal increased as the initial concentration of the pharmaceuticals increased from 10.0 to 50.0 mg/L except for indomethacin where the removal decreased as the initial concentration increased. After optimization, the highest removal was found to be 88.3, 30.1, 59.0, 85.8, and 12.7% for ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, chlorpheniraminemaleate, and paracetamol, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to evaluate the adsorption efficiencies of the investigated pharmaceuticals. The results demonstrated that Langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data for diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and paracetamol with adsorption capacity (Q(max)) of 4.8, 26.6, and 55.6 mg/g, respectively, whereas Freundlich isotherm fits the experimental data for both ibuprofen and chlorpheniramine maleate. Continues flow experiment was performed on ibuprofen under constant influent concentration and fixed flow rate. Equal eluted fractions of 100 mL were collected and analyzed for ibuprofen content. The results indicated that percentage removal of ibuprofen on zeolite was found to be the highest after fraction 9 with 78% removal.

AB Following human excretion and limited removal with wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals are accumulating in rivers worldwide. These chemicals can challenge the health of fish and aquatic organisms and since rivers provide drinking water sources, there is concern for cumulative exposure to humans. In this study, we discovered that sandbar willow (Salix exigua), a predominant riparian shrub along streams throughout North America, has the capacity to quickly remove pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions. Our study tracked [H-3]- or [C-14]-labeled substances including 17-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen in oral contraceptives; the antihypertensive, diltiazem (DTZ); and the anti-anxiety drug, diazepam (DZP); and for comparison, atrazine (ATZ), a root-absorbed herbicide. In growth chambers, willow saplings removed 40-80% of the substances from solutions in 24h. Following uptake, the EE2 and DTZ were retained within the roots, while DZP and ATZ were partly passed on to the shoots. The absorbed EE2 was unextractable and apparently bound to the root tissue, while DTZ, DZP, and ATZ remained largely soluble (extractable). The uptake and translocation of the pharmaceuticals, reflected in the transpiration stream and root concentration factors, were reasonably predicted from their physicochemical properties, including octanol-water partitioning coefficients. These findings suggest the removal of pharmaceuticals as an unrecognized ecosystem service provided by riparian vegetation and especially the inundation tolerant sandbar willow. This encourages the conservation of riparian willows that line riverbanks, to remove pharmaceuticals and other contaminants. This phytoremediation also encourages the preservation of complex, braided channels and islands, which increase the extent of stream shorelines and riparian willows.

AB Environmental concerns have become an important decision-making determinant for consumers. Hundreds of emerging pollutants and their metabolites are listed as present in European aquatic environments and human settlements are blamed as major sources of water pollution. It was assumed that as long as water treatment is not totally effective and it requires a high amount of energy and resources, household's contribution through correct behaviour in relation to the load of waste they discharge in the sewage system can reduce efforts towards wastewater treatment. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to investigate households' perception and behaviour related to wastewater treatment services. Results are based on a random survey with a sample of 125 Romanian consumers of water supply and sewage services. A key finding is that investigated wastewater services consumers perceive the effect of discharging untreated wastewater in the environment as highly negative both on human health and on the environment, thus pointing out the importance associated by them to water treatment. This research argues that understanding wastewater services consumer behaviour enlarges the way toward reducing environmental disturbances.

AB The availability of water resources is limited, and rising consumption has increased pressure on natural resources. Therefore, reclaimed water represents an alternative option for use in urban areas, industry and, in particular, agriculture. Recent research has shown that some pharmaceutical compounds are not fully removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may eventually be released into agricultural systems through the application of wastewater-based resources (sludge and effluent).
   The present study develops an intelligent expert system (based on a feed forward neural network trained via an extreme learning machine algorithm) for predicting the carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) content in lettuce tissues irrigated with reclaimed water from WWTPs. This reduces laboratory costs, mitigates the negative impacts on the environment and leads to more effective, safer decisions on the use of reclaimed water in agriculture. The results obtained, which were validated through statistical testing, demonstrate that the intelligent expert system is well calibrated and reliable. Finally, this system was used to predict maps of CBZ and DCF accumulation in lettuce crops if they were watered with effluent from 10 WWTPs located in the Region of Murcia (Spain). In conclusion, our system provides highly accurate predictions of the amount of CBZ and DCF contained in different lettuce tissues (roots and leaves) and the predicted concentrations do not present any health risk.

AB The area of Cebala-Borj-Touil, located in northeastern Tunisia, is irrigated with treated wastewater (TWW) for over 26years. The objectives of this study were to investigate the state of the hydrochemical characteristics and the heavy metals content and their spatial and seasonal variability. This area is affected by a shallow saline groundwater. Depth of this groundwater has been measured and water samples from 16 sites have been collected during two periods, September 2014 and March 2015, which correspond, respectively, to the post-irrigation period and before new cycle of irrigation, after the rainy season. Water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major ions as well as the trace elements Zn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Mn. Concerning the hydrological condition, the depth average was 1.31m in the summer and 0.70m in the winter and a maximum 2.01m at the end of the summer and a coefficient of variability (CV) about 35% in the summer and 78% in the winter indicating more high variability in the winter than in the summer. These values highlight bad drainage condition of the area. For chemical parameters, the water from both sampling periods is characterized by abundance of the major ions in the following order: Na+>>Mg2+>Ca2+>K+ and Cl->SO42->HCO3-. The mineral content of the groundwater is controlled by different factors: the water source, dilution in the wet season (March), and evaporation in the dry season (September). Spatially, the northeast and the southwest of the sector are more affected due to their relative low altitude. The content of heavy metals exceeds in some sites the values of the Tunisian standards of reuse. During both campaigns, the content of Cobalt (Co), Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe) exceeds the limits in the groundwater. For lead (Pb), the exceeding varies between September 2014 and March 2015. Cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) did not exceed Tunisian standards.

AB This study investigates the removal of selected pharmaceuticals, as recalcitrant organic compounds, from synthetic wastewater using an electro-membrane bioreactor (eMBR). Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ), and amoxicillin (AMX) were selected as representative drugs from three different therapeutic groups such as anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, and antibiotic, respectively. An environmentally relevant concentration (10g/L) of each compound was spiked into the synthetic wastewater, and then, the impact of appending electric field on the control of membrane fouling and the removal of conventional contaminants and pharmaceutical micropollutants were assessed. A conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated as a control test. A reduction of membrane fouling was observed in the eMBR with a 44% decrease of the fouling rate and a reduction of membrane fouling precursors. Humic substances (UV254), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), and orthophosphate (PO4-P) showed in eMBR removal efficiencies up to 90.68 +/- 4.37, 72.10 +/- 13.06, and 100%, respectively, higher than those observed in the MBR. A reduction of DCF, CBZ, and AMX equal to 75.25 +/- 8.79, 73.84 +/- 9.24, and 72.12 +/- 10.11%, respectively, was found in the eMBR due to the enhanced effects brought by electrochemical processes, such as electrocoagulation, electrophoresis, and electrooxidation.

AB Trash fish feeding of cage fish can result in marine pollution. Whole and chopped trash fish can leach pollutants such as ammonia, phosphate and protein into surrounding waters. Reduction of pollution can be achieved by recycling the wastewater generated from trash fish feeding for cultivation of microalgae. Microalgae are potent candidates for the production of renewable and sustainable products such as feed and food, health and pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, industrial products, and biofuel. Two microalgae, Chlorella saccharophila and Nannochloropsis sp., have the potential to produce high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, high oil content ranging from 10.7 to 13.6% is found in Chlorella saccharophila and up to 9.3% for Nannochloropsis sp. Moreover, these microalgae can also be utilized as a biofuel to give a mean calorific value of 5364 Cal/g which is higher than that of wood for Chlorella saccharophila and 6132 Cal/g which is equivalent to that of coal for Nannochloropsis sp. An alternative biofuel derived from microalgae is feasible due to the fact that they do not compete for arable land for cultivation and land crops for feed and food. This study discusses the synergistic coupling of microalgae mass production with wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration potential for mitigation of environmental impacts and a technically viable alternative energy resource. Additionally, the de-oiled biomass byproduct after oil extraction or its whole biomass can be converted into sustainable and renewal industrial products such as bioplastic, biopaint, bioasphalt, and biobuilding components.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is a typical type of wastewater with high concentrations of organic pollutants, but research on this subject is limited. The aeration tanks of three different pharmaceutical wastewater treatment systems were seeded with the same inocula and stably operated for 40 days. Then, aerobic sludge samples from the three aeration tanks were collected to provide insight into the bacterial community composition of the activated sludges. Additionally, we investigated the effects of wastewater characteristics and the type and operation of the technological system on the microbial communities. High-throughput sequencing analysis demonstrated that the communities enriched in the three reactors had differing. The dominant phyla detected were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and candidate division TM7, while the dominant clones were uncultured Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium, uncultured Saprospiraceae bacterium, PHOS-HE51(AF314433.1), uncultured Anaerolineaceae bacterium and Blastocatella, suggesting their importance in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. According to the wastewater parameters and canonical correspondence analyses, we can conclude that uncultured Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium, uncultured Anaerolineaceae bacterium and Blastocatella contribute to ammonium nitrogen () removal; uncultured Saprospiraceae bacterium plays an important role in treating nitrogen; and chemical oxygen demand and PHOS-HE51 contribute to total phosphorus removal.

AB A long-term investigation, which covered 10 sampling campaigns over 3 years, was performed to evaluate the occurrence, removal and risk of 10 pharmaceuticals in 2 full-scale sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Guangdong, South China. Target pharmaceuticals except for clofibrate and ibuprofen were detected in every sample, with mean concentrations of 12.5-685.6 and 7.9-130.3ng/L in the influent and effluent, respectively. Salicylic acid was the most abundant compound in both the influents and effluents in the two STPs. For most pharmaceuticals, the seasonal variation in the influent showed the highest concentrations in January and lowest concentrations in July due to their consumption and rainfall. Ibuprofen and fenoprofen presented high removal rates (>90%) and some of the targets such as gemfibrozil, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid and diclofenac were detectable with significantly higher mass loads in effluents than in influents. Studies of the five efficiently eliminated pharmaceuticals show that the primary treatment and secondary treatment contributed to most pharmaceutical removal, the anoxic tank made a negligible contribution to their elimination. According to the results produced from the calculation of the risk quotient, only diclofenac might pose a risk to the aquatic environment.

AB Untreated organic contaminants in municipal wastewater, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have become a significant issue in aquatic ecosystems, particularly in freshwater bodies that receive wastewater discharge. This has raised concerns about the accumulation of EDCs in aquatic species via continuous exposure. This study evaluated the uptake of EDCs by quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), an invasive species in a water supply reservoir. The field sampling results showed that steroid hormones were not detected in the water samples, and only pharmaceuticals and personal care products were present (0.49 to 36ng/L). Additionally, testosterone was the most abundant steroid in the mussel tissue (6.3 to 20ng/g dry weight), and other synthetic chemicals (i.e., bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid) were also detected in the mussel tissue (24 to 47ng/g dry weight). After being exposed to exogenous EDCs for 7, 21, and 42days under controlled laboratory conditions, testosterone was not detected in the mussel anymore, but bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid were found at relatively high levels in the mussel tissue, although the concentrations did not increase over time. Overall, the study demonstrated the uptake of EDCs in quagga mussels, which suggests that this species can be used to reflect water quality deterioration in aquatic ecosystems.

AB An updated version of FATEMOD, a multimedia fugacity model for environmental fate of organic chemicals, was set up to assess environmental behaviour of three pharmaceuticals in northern Lake Paijanne, Finland. Concentrations of ibuprofen, diclofenac, and carbamazepine were estimated at various depths at two sites: near a wastewater treatment plant and 3.5 km downstream the plant. When compared with environmental sampling data from corresponding depths and sites, the predicted concentrations, ranging from nanograms to hundreds of nanograms per litre, were found to be in good agreement. Weather data were utilised with the model to rationalise the effects of various environmental parameters on the sampling results, and, e.g. the roles of various properties of lake dynamics and photodegradation were identified. The new model also enables simultaneous assessment of transformation products. Environmentally formed transformation product concentrations were estimated to be at highest an order of magnitude lower than those of the parent compounds, and unlikely to reach a detectable level. However, a possibility that conjugates of ibuprofen are present at higher levels than the parent compound was identified. Simulation results suggest that environmental degradation half-lives of the inspected contaminants under stratified lake conditions are in the range of some weeks to months.

AB The study presented the occurrence of antibiotics in 16 different hospital effluents, the removal of antibiotics in urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and the potential ecotoxicological risks of the effluent discharge on the aquatic ecosystem. The total concentration of antibiotics in hospital effluents was ranged from 21.2 +/- 0.13 to 4886 +/- 3.80ng/L in summer and from 497 +/- 3.66 to 322,735 +/- 4.58ng/L in winter. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were detected the highest concentrations among the investigated antibiotics. The total antibiotic load to the influent of the WWTP from hospitals was 3.46g/day in summer and 303.2g/day in winter. The total antibiotic contribution of hospitals to the influent of the WWTP was determined as 13% in summer and 28% in winter. The remaining 87% in summer and 72% in winter stems from the households. The total antibiotic removal by conventional physical and biological treatment processes was determined as 79% in summer, whereas it decreased to 36% in winter. When the environmental risk assessment was performed, azithromycin and clarithromycin in the effluent from the treatment plant in winter posed a high risk (RQ>10) for the aquatic organisms (algae and fish) in the receiving environment. According to these results, the removal efficiency of antibiotics at the WWTP is inadequate and plant should be improved to remove antibiotics by advanced treatment processes.

AB The increasing consumption of medications by humans has negative effects such as the increased disposal of these compounds in the environment. Little is known about how the disposal of a drug mix (DM) in aquatic ecosystems can affect their biota. Thus, we evaluated whether the exposure of Lithobates casteibeianus tadpoles to a DM composed of different medication classes (antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antacid drugs)at environmentally relevant concentrationsmay change their oral morphology, trigger behavioral disorders, and have mutagenic effects on erythrocyte cells. Based on our data, animals exposed to the DM showed changes in mandibular sheath pigmentation, dentition, and swimming activity, as well as atypical behavior in the social aggregation test [with co-specific and interspecific (Physalaemus cuvieri) individuals] and antipredatory defensive response deficit (chemical stimulus from Odonata larvae), after 15 exposure days. The mutagenic analysis revealed higher frequency of nuclear abnormalities in the erythrocytes of tadpoles exposed to the DM (e.g., multilobulated, blebbed, kidney-shaped, notched nucleus, binuclear, and micronucleated erythrocytes). Given the chemical complexity of the DM, we assumed that several organic functions may have been affected, either by the isolated, synergistic, antagonistic, or additive action of DM compounds. Finally, our study confirms the toxicological potential of DM in L. catesbeianus tadpoles, with emphasis to impacts that can affect the fitness of individuals and their natural populations. Thus, we suggest that more attention should be given to the disposal of medications in the environment and reinforce the need of improving water and sewage treatment systems.

AB The ability of a soil to sustain infiltration rates and to attenuate pollutants is critical for the design and operation of Managed Aquifer Recharge/Soil Aquifer Treatment and phyto-treatment schemes, also referred to as Blue Infrastructures. We investigated the buffering capacity of a sediment sample and a peat soil sample for nutrients and selected pharmaceutical compounds and its evolution under continuous infiltration of secondary treated wastewater (TWW) in column experiments. Samples were obtained from two blue infrastructures, the Sant'Alessio Induced River Bank Filtration plant and the San Niccol large-scale phyto-treatment plant in Italy, and were mainly different in their organic carbon contents (0.9 and 48%, respectively). In the column experiments, a constant infiltration rate of about 0.5L/d was maintained for 6months. After 4months of operation, diclofenac and carbamazepine were spiked into the TWW to evaluate their fate. Water quality was monitored by periodic water sampling from the column inflow, at sampling ports along the column length, and at the outflow. Hydraulic conductivity (K) was also monitored. The hydraulic conductivity of the Sant'Alessio sediment decreased by a factor of 10 during the first 10days of infiltration and then stabilized, while for the San Niccol K (initially lower) remained constant for 50days until it decreased following a change of the redox condition in the column. The different redox conditions, due to the two different soils tested, influenced also the concentration and mobility of PO43-, Fe, Mn, and NPOC, and the speciation of the redox sensitive elements (nitrogen and sulfur). NOPC and phosphate were enriched during the filtration through San Niccol peat soil (from 2 to 4 times, respectively), while they were buffered by the Sant'Alessio sediment (from 0.2 to 0.4 times, respectively). Diclofenac removal (69% and below 20% for San Niccol and Sant'Alessio, respectively) was related to sorption and degradation processes and it was lower than the removal of carbamazepine in both soils (76 and 35%). The buffer capacity differences between the two soils were higher for diclofenac (62%) than carbamazepine (35%). Nevertheless, since no apparent degradation of carbamazepine was detected in both soils, its persistence in the soil may have a larger impact in case of desorption, posing contamination risk to groundwater. The results highlight the importance of the soils or sediments to be used as medium in such nature-based solutions for their operations. They also offer an approach to, e.g., tailor man-made soil layers in infiltration basins. We strongly suggest that soil characteristics and test duration are carefully considered in designing these infrastructures, when nature-based processes are the choice for dealing with reuse of treated wastewater management issues.

AB The role of soluble microbial products (SMP), the most important component of effluent organic matter from municipal wastewater treatment plants, in sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) remains substantially unclear. In this study, we first utilized a suite of macro- and microanalytical techniques to characterize the SMP from a membrane bioreactor for its fundamental molecular, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties. The degradation kinetics of three representative pharmaceuticals (i.e., naproxen, gemfibrozil, and sulfadiazine) in the presence of SMP was significantly reduced as compared to in its absence. Possible mechanisms for the interference by SMP in degrading these target compounds (TCs) were investigated. The low percentage of bound TCs to SMP ruled out the cage effect. The measurement of steady-state O-1(2) concentration indicated that formation of O-1(2) upon UV irradiation on SMP was not primarily responsible for the degradation of TCs. However, the comparative and quenching results reveal that SMP absorbs UV light acting as an inner filter toward the TCs, and meanwhile scavenges SO4 center dot- with a high second-order rate constant of 2.48 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1).

AB New emerging contaminants are being released into the environment. Some of these are not removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate a pilot-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) as a technology applicable to the removal of emerging pollutants. The work focused on two pharmaceutical compounds in particular (carbamazepine and sildenafil citrate) and a personal care product (methylparaben). The behavior of the system was evaluated for the individual addition and mixture of the three compounds, using organic loads similar to those of secondary and tertiary treatment effluent. The working flow rate was 70mL/min, and the concentration of the compounds was 200g/L. The organic load was evaluated at different times. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity and pH were measured in situ on each sampling. Removal efficiencies greater than 98% were achieved for methylparaben, but less than 20% for pharmaceuticals. The average removal efficiency was 95% for the organic matter in the different tests. In this investigation, it was observed that the RBC allowed the effective removal of emerging contaminants which have flat molecular geometry and essential chemical elements, such as methylparaben. However, its effectiveness was poor in removing contaminants formed from more complex structures such as carbamazepine and sildenafil citrate. The operational stability of the system was not affected when these compounds were incorporated in amounts similar to those found in wastewater.

AB This study investigated the performance of five different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in some rural areas in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, through an assessment of the physicochemical qualities of the effluents and their removal capacity for selected phenolic compounds. Water samples were collected on a monthly basis (February-July 2016), and temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), electrical conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured on-site using standard methods. Phenolic compounds were determined using the solid-phase extraction technique followed by derivatization and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Recorded temperatures for all the WWTPs effluents were 29-30 degrees C in summer, 20-27 degrees C in autumn and 12-17 degrees C in winter, and the pH was between 6.8 and 9.1. The treatment processes increased only the DO of the final effluents, while TDS, EC, turbidity and TSS were considerably reduced. Out of the nine phenolic compounds investigated, 2,4-dimethylphenol (2,4-DMP), 4-chloro-3-methylphenol (4-C-3MP), 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were prominent in the influent (17.3-42.1 mu g/L) and concentrations of phenolic compounds in the effluents and receiving water bodies were mostly below the tolerable limits allowed internationally for a safe aquatic environment. Generally, the WWTPs removal capacities range between 33 and 96%, however, South Africa standard limits for discharged effluents were occasionally exceeded especially with some WWTPs. This poses health challenges to rural communities that rely heavily on surface water for domestic use.

AB In this study, the flow dynamic behavior of cylindrical electrochemical reactor (CER) has been investigated for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluent. The residence time distribution is considered as a tool to investigate the flow dynamic behavior of the electrolyte within the reactor. The reactor is operated at fixed current density of 2.5 A/dm(2) with lead oxide/titanium as electrode by varying flow rates such as 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 L/h. Impacts of various flow rates on flow dynamics were examined. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the presence of a dead volume and short circuiting in the reactor were reduced for the optimum flow rate of 70 L/h in the reactor. The potential of the CER was experimentally validated by analyzing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, color, total dissolved solids, suspended solids and odor emanating from the effluent. Findings of this study reveal that maximum COD reduction of about 85.71% with minimum energy consumption of 63.82 kW h/kg COD at a flow rate of 70 L/h, which has good mixing and less backmixing condition inside the reactor. The experimental findings prove that the CER with a cylindrical mesh electrode can be used for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents and is capable of achieving the quality of pharmaceutical effluents treated wastewater to the reuse standard prescribed for pharmaceutical industries.

AB Wastewater contains a large range of biological and chemical markers of human activity and exposures. Through systematic collection and analysis of these markers within wastewater samples it is possible to measure the public health of whole populations. The analysis of effluent and biosolids can also be used to understand the release of chemicals from wastewater treatment plants into the environment. Wastewater analysis and comparison with catchment specific data (e.g. demographics) however remains largely unexplored. This manuscript describes a national wastewater monitoring study that combines influent, effluent and biosolids sampling with the Australian Census. An archiving program allows estimation of per capita exposure to and consumption of chemicals, public health information, as well as per capita release of chemicals into the environment. The paper discusses the study concept, critical steps in setting up a coordinated national approach and key logistical and other considerations with a focus on lessons learnt and future applications. The unique combination of archived samples, analytical data and associated census-derived population data will provide a baseline dataset that has wide and potentially increasing applications across many disciplines that include public health, epidemiology, criminology, toxicology and sociology.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment and their removal by conventional wastewater treatment methods has proven to be ineffective. This research aimed to develop a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOA) for the removal of diclofenac in aqueous solution. The preparation of rGOA involved facile self-assembly of graphene oxide under a reductive environment of L-ascorbic acid. Characterisation of rGOA was performed by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The developed rGOA had a measured density of 20.39 +/- 5.28 mg/cm(3), specific surface area of 132.19 m(2)/g, cumulative pore volume of 0.5388 cm(3)/g and point of zero charge of 6.3. A study on the simultaneous interactions of independent factors by response surface methodology suggested dosage and initial concentration as the dominant parameters influencing the adsorption of diclofenac. The highest diclofenac adsorption capacity (596.71 mg/g) was achieved at the optimum conditions of 0.25 g/L dosage, 325 mg/L initial concentration, 200 rpm shaking speed and 30 degrees C temperature. The adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted to the Freundlich model with correlation coefficient (R-2) varying from 0.9500 to 0.9802. The adsorption kinetic data were best correlated to the pseudo-first-order model with R-2 ranging from 0.8467 to 0.9621. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the process was spontaneous (Delta G = - 7.19 to - 0.48 kJ/mol) and exothermic (Delta H = - 12.82 to - 2.17 kJ/mol). This research concluded that rGOA is a very promising adsorbent for the re mediation of water polluted by diclofenac.

AB Urban, hospital and pharmaceutical industry wastewater effluents are among the main sources of antibiotics' and other antimicrobial agents' contamination in soil and water ecosystems, especially in countries where wastewater reuse is applied. Ampicillin (AMP), which is the first semi-synthetic broad spectrum penicillin that was released on the market in 1961 has been detected in treated wastewater effluents worldwide, at concentrations ranging from sub-ng/L up to 27 mu g/L, as well as in various environmental aqueous matrices up to 13.7 mu g/L, highlighting its recalcitrance to conventional biological treatment. Nevertheless, the degradation potential of AMP via advanced chemical oxidation processes, which are widely considered as promising alternatives of conventional technologies, hardly has been investigated. Thus, this study aims at assessing the efficiency of solar photo-Fenton process at degrading AMP from secondary-treated wastewater effluents under various experimental conditions. The degradation rate of AMP via solar photo-Fenton oxidation fitted well the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. AMP was completely degraded after 30 min of treatment at various H2O2 doses (25-100 mg/L) under acidic pH, while its degradation was pronounced at mild alkaline conditions (inherent pH) (100% removal after 5 min). Total cultivable and AMP-resistant E. coli was completely inactivated after 180 min of treatment at the optimum operational conditions, and no regrowth was observed. Finally, the ecotoxicity results showed that the process was capable of eliminating the toxicity towards Daphnia magna after 180 min, providing thus a more complete evaluation of the overall efficiency of the process.

AB Herein, we introduced simple, cheap, cost-effective and sustainable kitchen waste tea residue as an adsorbent. As per the literature survey, all the adsorbents have been used for wastewater treatment only as activated form. The first time, we have used similar material without any complicated activation process for the removal of pharmaceutical pollutant and it shows superior results than the existing materials which are the most attractive part of this work. It has shown an effective, low cost bio-sorbent to remove Hydralazine hydrochloride pharmaceutical pollutant from wastewater in aqueous media. The adsorbent waste tea residue was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effect of pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial concentration on Hydralazine hydrochloride removal were also systematically studied. The adsorption process was studied using experimental data were fitted in both isotherms models. The maximum adsorption capacity of waste tea residue was found to be q(e) = 131.63 mg g(-1) which is higher than the reported value. Furthermore, developed adsorbent was practically used to remove pharmaceutical pollutants from real samples (hospital and river wastewater) spiked with Hydralazine hydrochloride. Therefore, the waste tea residue displays the great potential to improve the quality of water contaminated with different type's pharmaceuticals in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The shortage of water resource in the developing countries induced the search for alternative sources. Greywater alongside storm and ablution water might represent the best source of water because these waters have less contaminant than sewage. However, the separation of this water from the source point is the first step in the proper management which facilitates the treatment process. The selection of treatment technologies for greywater depends on the economic status and standards limits required for disposal or reuse of greywater which differs from one country to the others. In many of the developing countries, the treatment of greywater aims at achieving the basic requirements which lie in the reduction of the main parameters of greywater. The utilisation of flocculation and coagulants process might be effective for this purpose. Many of the natural coagulants have been reported to reduce the main parameters of greywater. In the developed countries, advanced technologies are used for removing of xenobiotics organic compounds (XOCs) and to produce high quality of the treated greywater. This chapter focuses on the treatment technology used for the treatment of greywater and their efficiency in the reduction of XOCs.

AB Recent evidence has revealed that cities with pharmaceutical manufacturers have elevated concentrations of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in their receiving water bodies. The purpose of this study was to gather information on direct sewer discharges of APIs during their manufacturing and processing from five pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canada. Drug classes and maximum reported concentrations (ng/L) for which APIs were directly discharged included: antidepressants (paroxetine - 3380 and sertraline - 5100); mood stabilizer (carbamazepine - 575,000); antibiotics (penicillin - 14,300); analgesics (acetaminophen 461,000; codeine - 49,200; ibuprofen - 344,000; naproxen - 253,000 and oxycodone 21,000); cardiovascular drugs (atorvastatin - 893 and metoprolol - 7,333,600) and those drugs used for blood pressure control (amlodipine - 22,900; diltiazem - 1,160,000; furosemide - 1,200,000 and verapamil - 7340). Based on flow and water usage data from the individual facilities, the maximum concentrations for acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, diltiazem and metoprolol correlate to approximately 200, 220, 390, 420 and 14,200 g respectively, of lost product being directly discharged to the sewers daily during active manufacturing. This survey demonstrates that direct point source discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturers represent a key source of pharmaceutical pollution to receiving sewersheds. Onsite recovery of product or treatment at pharmaceutical manufacturing or processing facilities to reduce the sewage loadings to receiving treatment plants, product loss and potential environmental loadings is strongly recommended.

AB Parabens are widely used as antimicrobial and preservative in pharmaceutical and personal products. Their presence has been detected in rivers and wastewater treatment plants. Photocatalytic ozonation process using a low amount of 0.1 wt% Ag-TiO2 proved to be efficient on the degradation of a mixture of five parabens using a low transferred ozone dose (TOD). The pH effect was analyzed under acidic and neutral conditions. Also, the effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger on parabens degradation and on by-products formation was discussed. Hydroxyl radical present a significant role over parabens degradation and also on by-products formation. The reaction mechanism was analyzed using municipal wastewater as a matrix to infer about the behavior of the process at actual conditions. Municipal wastewater as a matrix clearly enhanced the parabens degradation when compared with the case where ultrapure water was used. In fact, the TOD required for total parabens degradation is lowered 10-20 mg/L of TOD. Therefore, to understand the main responsible species for this improvement, the effects of several ions naturally present in wastewater (HCO3-, Cl- and SO42-) were tested. According to the results it seems that sulfate radical improves the process, while chloride and bicarbonate radicals decrease the process efficiency. In terms of toxicity the luminescence inhibition for Vibrio fischeri was analyzed. The inhibition significantly decreased for treated spiked municipal wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study reports the synthesis of metal-free polymeric catalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), through sonochemical method followed by thermal treatment. The synthesized g-C3N4 was characterized using XRD, DRS, FESEM, TGA, EDX, etc. and the characterization results revealed that it possesses medium band-gap energy, high thermal and chemical stability. The photo-activity of the catalyst was also evaluated using degradation of 5-Fluorouracil under different experimental conditions. The results revealed that the addition of H2O2 during sonolysis process did not show any significant synergy. This is attributed to the low vapor pressure of H2O2 that does not allow it to diffuse into the cavitation bubble to produce (OH)-O-center dot radicals through sonolysis process. Using sono-hybrid process, more than 90% degradation was seen within 5 min of treatment with a rate constant of 3.95 x 10(-2) s(-1). In alkaline medium, 5-Fluorouracil degradation occurred through defluorination and subsequently substitution of -OH group to the aromatic ring leading to formation of intermediates such as 2-fluoro-3-oxopropanoic acid and urea. While sono-hybrid advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) helped towards complete mineralization through formation of smaller molecular compounds such as maleic acids, lactic acids, propanol, etc. On the other hand, the maximum synergy effect of similar to 2.4 was seen for sonocatalysis process followed by hybrid-AOPs of (US + g-C3N4 + H2O2 + UVC) with a synergy factor of similar to 2.2. Also, the synthesized catalyst exhibited the same catalytic activity even after 5 runs of sono-photocatalysis process for degradation of 5-Fluorouracil.

AB The emergence of resistance to antibacterial drugs and pesticides in water is unprecedented. This may have adverse consequences to human health and ecological systems. This paper first sought the identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in two secondary effluent wastewaters (SEW) of different quality characteristics, followed by their removal by ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI), FeO42-) Screening for 22 pharmaceuticals and 32 pesticides, revealed that 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides in SEW of plant A, and 14 pharmaceuticals and 5 pesticides in SEW of plant B were present at concentrations higher than the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method quantitation limit. The concentrations of pharmaceuticals and pesticides ranged from 0.15 ng/L-413.03 ng/L. Investigation of the removal of these pharmaceuticals and pesticides by Fe(VI) showed that some had recalcitrant activity towards their oxidation. Acid-activated Fe(VI) resulted in enhanced oxidation (12.6%-56.2% degradation efficiency) of 6 and 7 pharmaceuticals in SEW of plant A and plant B, respectively, at a shorter time than Fe(VI) without activation (i.e. 3-5 min versus 15-30 min).

AB Reducing human and ecological risks of groundwater nitrate contamination requires understanding the source of nitrate. Land use practices, such as agriculture and residential development, can increase groundwater nitrate concentrations. This study evaluated a chemical source-tracing suite that paired analysis of agricultural herbicide metabolites and human wastewater constituents. The source-tracing suite was tested in an area subject to nitrate from both agriculture and on-site waste ("septic") systems. Monitoring wells showed that agricultural contamination was deeper (>5 m) in the aquifer consistent with its origin a greater distance from wells and that on-site waste ("septic system") contamination was shallower in the aquifer (<3 m). Repeated sampling of seventeen household wells showed evidence of both agricultural and on-site waste contamination in wells with higher nitrate concentrations. The artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were the only septic system indicators consistently detected. Less persistent compounds, such as caffeine and acetaminophen, were never detected in the household wells indicating they were attenuated over the distance between septic system and well and reducing their utility as a tracer of septic system nitrate. Overall, there was a positive relationship between sucralose, acesulfame and nitrate in wells with low levels of agricultural contamination although the relationship varied between wells.

AB In this work, the sonochemical treatment (at 354 kHz and 88 W L-1) of six relevant antibiotics belonging to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), penicillins (oxacillin and cloxacillin) and cephalosporins (cephalexin and cephadroxyl) classes was evaluated. Firstly, the ability of the process to eliminate them was tested, showing that sonodegradation of these antibiotics is strongly chemical structure-dependent. Thus, correlations among initial degradation rate of pollutants (Rd), solubility in water (Sw), water-octanol partition coefficient (Log P) and topological polar surface area (TPSA) were tested. Rd exhibited a good correlation with Log P (i.e., the hydrophobicity degree of antibiotics). The considered penicillins had the fastest elimination and from the constitutional analysis using Lemke method was clear that the functional groups arrangement on these antibiotics made them highly hydrophobics. The penicillins were degraded closer at cavitation bubble than the fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins. The investigation of degradation products showed that sonogenerated hydroxyl radical primary attacked the beta-lactam ring of cloxacillin and cephalexin, whereas on norfloxacin induced a decarboxylation. On the other hand, the evolution of antimicrobial activity was also followed. It was evidenced the process capacity to remove antimicrobial activity from treated solutions, which was associated to the transformations of functional groups on antibiotics with important role for interaction with bacteria. Additionally, degradation of antibiotics having the highest (the most hydrophobic, i.e., cloxacillin) and lowest (the most hydrophilic, i.e., cephadroxyl) Rd, was performed in synthetic matrices (hospital wastewater and seawater). Ultrasound degraded both antibiotics; for cloxacillin in such waters higher eliminations than in distilled water were observed (probably due to a salting-out effect exerted by matrix components). Meanwhile, for cephadroxyl a moderate inhibition of degradation in hospital wastewater and seawater respect to distilled water was found, this was related to competition by hydroxyl radical of the other substances in the matrices. These results show the quite selectivity of high frequency ultrasound to eliminate antibiotics form different classes even in complex matrices.

AB One of the most common organic compounds which represents real challenges in the environmental pollution treatment is the xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs). They are complex organic compounds which have high persistence in the environment extend for several years due to their chemical structure. Meanwhile, its hazards risk lies in tier active poisons which directly affect aquatic life within a short exposure time. XOCs in the greywater are generated from utilisation of detergents and personal body care products and they have the potential to persist in nature for a long time and thus have long-term effects to the environment including toxicity and bioaccumulation in the organism's cells. There are many literatures discussing about the types of XOCs of greywater. For instance, some types of XOCs in greywater are toxic for aquaculture. This chapter will discuss the occurrence of XOCs in the greywater, chemical structure and bioassay for the toxicity of these compounds.

AB As with other emerging economies, the rapid economic development of Indonesia has led to a migration towards the cities. The coastal megacity Jakarta is one of the largest urban agglomerations worldwide. The uncontrolled increase in urban population results in increased pressure on public infrastructure such as sewage treatment facilities leading to severe pollution of surface waters. In this study, a mass flux approach was used to assess the transport of organic pollutants by the largest city bound river of Jakarta, the Ciliwung, into the adjacent coastal ecosystem. Mass flux approaches are useful to track the origin and transport of wastewater-borne pollution, but are mostly neglected in favor of solely concentration-based evaluations.
   Constituents of municipal sewage made up around 70-80% of the fluxes of the 32 quantified water pollutants. Personal care product ingredients, especially the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), exhibited the highest fluxes. Our first assessment revealed that the Ciliwung River transports around 5-17 tons year(-1) of the quantified pollutants into the Java Sea. Such huge pollutant fluxes from municipal sources -a problem that is also relevant in other coastal megacities-might severely affect vulnerable coastal habitats.

AB The release of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems from the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) is of great concern due to possible chronic toxic effects as well as contribution to antibiotic resistance spread. In the present work, the degradation of the antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) by ultraviolet (UV)/peracetic acid (PM) (an advanced oxidation process that has been poorly investigated so far) and UV/H2O2 processes as well as its transformation products were studied under different light sources. UV-C/PAA process was found to be effective in the degradation of CAP (half life time (t(1/n)) = 20 min, initial CAP concentration 25 mg/L), but not effective when solar radiation was used as light source. It is worthy to note that the presence of H2O2 in the commercial PAA solution significantly affected the removal efficiency of CAP by UV-C/PAA process. When H2O2 was quenched by catalase addition, t(1/2) increased to 99 min, meaning that PM can still produce hydroxyl radicals but at a lower rate compared to H2O2. Moreover, process efficiency further decreased in the presence of both solar simulated and natural solar irradiation, being CAP removal also the result of thermal decomposition. The transformation products detected during CAP degradation by UV-C/PAA were different respect to those produced during UV-C/H2O2 process. In particular, after 120 min most of the compounds detected presented a molecular weight >300 m/z., meaning that UV-C/PAA process needs more time to degrade the transformation products.

AB A novel self-sustaining monolithic photoelectrocatalytic/photovoltaic (SMPP) system is constructed with a FTO-glass-based WO3/BiVO4 photoanode, which was prepared by coating BiVO(4)on WO3 nanoplate array using simple wet chemical methods, a rear Si photovoltaic cell (PVC) and a counter Pt-black/Pt cathode. The optimum SMPP system shows an efficient and stable degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride with a rate constant 0.75 h(-1) and yields an open circuit voltage 1.35 V, a short circuit current 2900 mu A cm(-2), a power density 1112 mu W cm(-2), which is nearly 14 times that of theultimate conventional photocatalytic fuel cell to date, and a hydrogen generation rate 52.6 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2). This outstanding performance should be due to the efficient electron/hole separation and light exploitation, because, under stimulated sunlight illumination, the front WO3/BiVO4 photoanode absorbs short-wavelength photons and generates electron/hole pairs, in which the photogenerated holes can oxidize organics, while the rear Si PVC captures the transmitting longer-wavelength photons to generate photovoltage that drives photogenerated electrons to the cathode for reducing H+ to H-2 and generating electricity in the external-circuit. The results also demonstrate that various refractory organics can be efficiently decomposed along with the production of electricity and hydrogen by the SMPP system. This work provides a more efficient way to dispose organics and simultaneously produce clean energy than conventional technologies and serves well as a promising technology for wastewater recycling.

AB The capability of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles photo-deposited on BiVO4 (BV) nanosheets support to effectively activate persulfate (PS) and degrade pharmaceutical residues amiloride (AML) in aqueous solution under visible light was investigated. The removal efficiency of AML in Pd/BV/PS/vis system reached to 96.43% within 30 min as compared to only 50.73%, 70.87% and 77.70% in BV/vis, Pd/BV/vis and BV/PS/vis respectively under the identical experimental conditions. One inherent reason for the enhanced performance was possibly owing to the fact that visible light absorption of photocatalyst was improved through the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Pd nanoparticles. For another respect, the photo-induced electron-hole pairs separation rate was firstly strengthened with Pd as electron traps and then by PS oxidants as electrons acceptors. Influencing factors including PS dosage, AML concentration, humic acid (HA) concentration, coexisting anions and cations and water sources on the AML degradation in the Pd/BV/PS/vis system were explored in details. Higher photocatalytic activity was still maintained in raw wastewater containing dyes, phenols and antibiotics. More generation of oxidative species such as O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- were verified by radical quenching experiment and electron spin resonance (ESR) test. The major products of AML decomposition were identified and the correspondent degradation pathways were also proposed. This founding allows for the construction of highly efficient BV-based photocatalysts and provides a new opportunity for the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants by SO4 center dot- based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).

AB The pharmaceutical benzodiazepine diazepam and its metabolite oxazepam have been detected in wastewater treatment plants effluents, surface water and treated drinking water, but their transformation during chlorination process is not well understood. We investigated the reactions of diazepam and oxazepam with free available chlorine using a high-resolution mass analyzer and theoretical calculation to elucidate the fate of benzodiazepines during water chlorination process. The obtained apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) for chlorine reaction with diazepam and oxazepam varied from 0.01 to 1.7 M-1 s(-1) and 0.7 to 31.6 M-1 s(-1) in the pH range of 5.5-10.0, respectively. Under typical wastewater disinfection conditions of neutral pH values, free chlorine concentrations of 5 mg L-1 and contact times of up to 2 h, the corresponding half-lives for diazepam (similar to 180 min) and oxazepam (similar to 61 min) suggest that diazepam will be partly transformed during disinfection. Conversely, oxazepam will be considerably transformed during wastewater disinfection. The pH-dependency of k(app) for diazepam could be explained by the reactions between neutral diazepam and HClO species. The kinetic pattern for oxazepam can be well described by species-specific reactions involving oxazepam or Cl-2 and Cl2O species. In total, fifteen and eight transformation products were identified for chlorination of diazepam and oxazepam, respectively. The C-3 of 1,4-benzodiazepine structure was the main site of attack, leading predominantly to the oxidation and then cleavage of the C(3)-N(4) bond, as well as diazepine ring contractions. Based on mass balance estimation, the main chlorination product for diazepam and oxazepam are 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro- 2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2,3-dione and 6-chloro-4-phenyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone, respectively.

AB Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are producing a wide variety of antibiotics for human and veterinary use. Consequently, the water discharged from those facilities can contain residues of antibiotics, which could have adverse impact on the environment. However, studies on the occurrence of antibiotics in the wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are almost non-existent. In this study, water samples were collected at around the outlets of four pharmaceutical manufacturing plants as well as from a hospital and an aquaculture farm around Hanoi in 2016 and 2017. Fifteen antibiotics from four major classes (beta-lactam, quinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides) were monitored, using a validated LC-MS/MS method, based on their number of registrations at the Ministry of Health. Ten antibiotics, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were detected in the samples at different concentrations. Notably, sulfonamides and quinolones were occasionally detected at very high concentration, such as sulfamethoxazole (252 mu g/L), trimethoprim (107 mu g/L), ofloxacin (85 mu g/L), and ciprofloxacin (41 mu g/L). In this study, concentrations of antibiotic residues in effluent of pharmaceutical plants were higher than those from other sources. The antibiotic-resistance tests indicated the widespread resistance to common antibiotics like quinolone and sulfonamides in the collected samples. This finding suggests that wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers could be an important source of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment of Vietnam.

AB Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) can achieve the time-weighted-average (TWA) concentrations of analytes in the period of deployment. Here we developed an approach based on DGT with a novel binding gel using porous carbon material (PCM) derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) for in-situ measurement of antibiotics in water samples. The diffusion coefficients of 20 antibiotics (nine sulfonamides, ten fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim) in agarose diffusive gel were 1.41 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s to 4.75 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s at 25 degrees C. The capacity of PCM binding gel toward the antibiotics was similar to 100 mu g per gel disc. The masses of the antibiotics accumulated by PCM-based DGT increased linearly with time, and they were almost independent of pH (4.2-8.4) and ionic strength (1-500 mM). The performance of the novel DGT was evaluated using freshwater and synthetic seawater spiked with the antibiotics in laboratory. The results showed good agreement with the theoretical predications except sulfacetamide. The detection limits achieved by the DGT with three devices together for deploying up to seven days were 1.0-18.0 ng/L. Field deployment in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent and seawater showed that the TWA concentrations of antibiotics were 3.8-1342.5 ng/L and 5.6-43.3 ng/L, respectively, which were comparable to those measured by grab sampling. The proposed DGT was an efficient tool for the measurement of antibiotics in environmental waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the spatial and temporal-distribution of 41-multiclass organic compounds were assessed in three estuaries of the Basque Country, from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab (active) sampling methods and an extra campaign combining both, grab and passive sampling methods. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were also evaluated to assess their impact on the estuaries. Moreover, the physicochemical features (phosphate and nitrate concentrations, pH, etc.) of each site were measured and included in the statistical analysis. Anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and acetaminophen), hypertensive drugs (irbesartan and valsartan), a stimulant (caffeine), an artificial sweetener (acesulfame) and a corrosion inhibitor (2-hydroxybenzothiazole) were the most ubiquitous compounds. Due to the stratification of the waters in the estuary of Bilbao two independent sources were identified: WWTP and harbour activities. In the case of Gernika and Plentzia, both are estuaries with a high tidal dilution, and the main sources were localized in the effluents of the WWTPs. In addition to this, the use of POCIS provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long sampling period. Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined at each estuary and WWTP effluent for acute and chronic effects. In the case of acute toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were obtained for the angiotensin II receptor blockers (telmisartan, eprosartan, etc.), diuron and diclofenac. In the case of the chronic toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were estimated for caffeine, diclofenac, bezafibrate and sulfadiazine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by the UV/H2O2 and UV/chlorine processes was compared at practical concentrations in simulated drinking water and wastewater. In pure water, the UV/chlorine process performed better than the UV/H2O2 process for the degradation of 16 PPCPs among the investigated 28 PPCPs under neutral conditions. Interestingly, the UV/chlorine approach was superior to the UV/H2O2 approach for the removal of all PPCPs in simulated drinking water and wastewater at the same molar oxidant dosage. The radical sink by oxidants and/or H2O was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher in UV/chlorine than UV/H2O2 in pure water. Thus, the UV/chlorine process was less affected by the water and wastewater matrices than UV/H2O2. In UV/chlorine, the concentration of CIO center dot was calculated to be similar to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of HO center dot in pure water, and the reactivities of CIO center dot with some PPCPs were as high as > 10(8)M(-1) s(-1). CIO center dot was mainly scavenged by the effluent organic matter (EfOM) with a rate constant of 1.8 x 10(4) (mg L-1)(-1) s(-1) in wastewater. Meanwhile, secondary radicals such as Br-center dot, Br-2(center dot)-, CIBr center dot-and CO3 center dot-further contributed to PPCP degradation by the UV/chlorine process in wastewater, whose concentrations were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in UV/H2O2. Compared with the UV/H2O2 process, the UV/chlorine process saved 3.5-93.5% and 19.1%-98.1% electrical energy per order (EE/O) for PPCP degradation in simulated drinking water and wastewater, respectively.

AB This paper presents the analysis of caffeine and carbamazepine transport in the subsurface as a result of wastewater release in the Sorek creek over the outcrops of the carbonate, Yarkon-Taninim, aquifer in Israel. Both caffeine and carbamazepine were used as indicators of sewage contamination in the subsurface. While carbamazepine is considered conservative, caffeine is subject to sorption and degradation. The objective of the study was to quantify differences in their transport under similar conditions in the karst aquifer. Water flow and pollutant transport in a "vadose zone-aquifer" system were simulated by a quasi-3-D dual permeability numerical model. The results of this study show that each of these two pollutants can be considered effective tracers for characterization and assessment of aquifer contamination. Carbamazepine was found to be more suitable for assessing the contamination boundaries, while caffeine can be used as a contaminant tracer only briefly after contamination occurs. In instances where there are low concentrations of carbamazepine which appear as background contamination in an aquifer, caffeine might serve as a better marker for detecting new contamination events, given its temporal nature. The estimated caffeine degradation rate and the distribution coefficient of a linear sorption isotherm were 0.091 d(-1) and 0.1 L kg(-1), respectively, which imply a high attenuation capacity. The results of the simulation indicate that by the end of the year most of the carbamazepine mass (approximately 95 %) remained in the matrix of the vadose zone, while all of the caffeine was completely degraded a few months after the sewage was discharged.

AB Refractory organics in industrial wastewater are difficult to treat and pose a serious threat to the environment. Upflow anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and internal circulation (IC) reactors are most widely used in the world due to high efficiency, but the inside process remains unknown like a black box. In this study, spatial mass transfer conditions of a pilot-scale UASB reactor, being decomposed as the bottom, middle and top zones, treating pharmaceutical wastewater at organic loading rates (OLR) of 4.32-8.30 kg COD/(m(3).d) were investigated. In addition, the roles of external and internal factors such as organic loading rate and granule properties including size, density, porosity and permeability on mass transfer were investigated for the first time. The average molecular diffusion rates (F-MD) of reactor were 7.43 x 10(-8),1.4 x 10(-7), 2.0 x 10(-7) and 2.73 x 10(-7) mg/s respectively, while, average convective diffusion rates (F-CD) were 5.39 x 10(-1), 1.09, 1.32 and 1.42 mg/s at OLRs of 4.32, 5.70, 6.92 and 8.30 kg COD/(m(3).d) respectively. Interestingly, mass transfer rates increased with the increase of OLR and decreased with a height of the reactor, also, it is directly dependent on granule size. The novel results reveal that the bottom zone is of the fastest mass transfer as compared to middle and top zones of the reactor; furthermore, it is the main degradation zone due to not only high mass transfer but also low feed/sludge and high granule level. The performance of upflow reactors could be enhanced for higher biogas production by installation of biofilm zone in the top zone to replace granules of that zone. The results could facilitate understanding bioprocess in upflow reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water treated in advanced wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could be reused as potable water to address water shortages. Furthermore, sludge from WWTPs can be used to recover nutrients, energy and chemicals. Thus, the role of WWTPs could change from traditional pollution control facilities to sources of freshwater and other valuable resources. However, the economic viability of advanced wastewater and sludge treatment methods aimed at production of potable water and recovery of other resources is currently unknown. To address this gap and inform their future development, this paper considers life cycle costs of the following four wastewater treatment methods: granular activated carbon, nano filtration, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation. For recovery of resources from sludge, the following options are examined: agricultural application of anaerobically-digested and composted sludge, incineration, pyrolysis and wet air oxidation. Ozonation has the lowest life cycle costs, averaging 112 per 1000 m(3) of water treated, followed by nanofiltration at 134. Solar photo-Fenton is the most expensive option with 238/1000 m(3). These costs are significantly lower than water desalination and could be competitive in the future with conventional potable water production. For resource recovery from sludge, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and wet air oxidation can operate at a profit with the negative overall life cycle costs (-65 pound, -291 pound and -26 pound/1000 kg dry matter, respectively) if all their recovered products are fully utilised. The next best option is composting with the total life cycle costs of 35 pound/1000 kg dry matter. Incineration is the least preferred alternative with the cost of nearly 54 pound/1000 kg dry matter. Advanced wastewater and sludge treatment would increase the costs of conventional wastewater treatment by 1.5-2.1 times. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are widely used in food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products because they are excellent preservatives. Recently, the environmental fate of parabens has attracted attention owing to their similarity to some endocrine disrupters. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are both important sinks of parabens discharged from our daily activities and key pollution sources for the environment if the parabens are not completely removed. However, research in this area is scarce, especially in Asia. In this study, 6 commonly used parabens and 4 metabolites were analyzed in wastewater and sludge samples from two typical WWTPs with different treatment processes (the anaerobic-oxic (A/O) and cyclic activated sludge technology (CAST) treatment processes). The average concentrations of parabens in the A/O and CAST treatment processes were 1510 ng/L and 2180 ng/L, respectively, in the influent, and 70.5 ng/L and 19.7 ng/L, respectively, in the effluent. The paraben removal efficiencies in the A/O treatment process were between 56.8% and 100%, which is lower than the efficiencies for the CAST treatment process (97.7% to 100%). The average concentrations of metabolites in the A/O treatment process, which were much higher than paraben concentrations, were 35,200 ng/L in the influent, 334 ng/L in the effluent, and 146 ng/g in the sludge samples. The removal efficiencies for the 4 metabolites were >92% for the A/O treatment process. In total, for the A/O treatment process, 5.07 kg and 16.8 kg of parabens, and 24.4 kg and 16.0 kg of metabolites, were discharged into the environment annually via effluent and sludge, respectively. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the A/O and CAST treatment processes are both effective at removing parabens and their metabolites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of organic micropollutants (MPs) in the aquatic environment is strongly related to their difficult elimination by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, alternative treatment technologies are required to overcome this problem. In this domain, constructed wetlands (CWs) have gained increasing attention in the last years, mainly due to the low-cost, simple operation/maintenance and environmental friendliness of these systems. However, studies on the application of CWs to remove MPs from freshwater aquaculture effluents are still scarce. In this work, planted (Phragmites australis) vertical subsurface flow CWs, at microcosm scale, were investigated for the removal of MPs found in non-spiked freshwater aquaculture effluents, namely atrazine, isoproturon, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC). A wider multi-component set of 36 MPs was also studied by adding these MPs at 100 ng L-1 to the same matrix (alachlor, atrazine, chlorfenvinphos, isoproturon, PFOS, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diclofenac, methiocarb, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, EHMC, simazine, atorvastatin, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, cephalexin, ceftiofur, citalopram, clindamycin, clofibric acid, diphenhydramine, enrofloxacin, fluoxetine, ketoprofen, metoprolol, norfluoxetine, ofloxacin, propranolol, tramadol, trimethoprim, venlafaxine, and warfarin). High weekly removal efficiencies (N87%) were observed for all MPs in both non-spiked and spiked experiments, with the exception of EHMC (removal rates between 0 and 86%). These results emphasize the potential of CWs to remove MPs from freshwater aquaculture effluents, but also the need to enhance the performance of these systems for the elimination of some recalcitrant MPs, such as EHMC, which was found at high concentrations in the studied effluents.

AB The purpose of this work was to identify novel materials that could be used for the catalytic ozonation of wastewater for improved removal of micropollutants and disinfection. The materials chosen for investigation were selected based on their commercial availability and composition characteristics that suggested that they could act as catalysts. Synthetic wastewater (SWW) was used to mimic municipal secondary effluent wastewater while obtaining constant and reproducible matrix characteristics. Polonite (R), wollastonite, zeolite, TiO2-Al2O3 (8%/92%), and AL-1010S (AlO2-based) were tested for their potential impact on efficiency of disinfection, based on the removal of E. coli bacteria and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), relative to conventional ozonation. Atrazine (ATZ), ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), and gemfibrozil (GBZ) were used as indicator compounds. Zeolite and wollastonite did not promote disinfection and CECs removal; TiO2-Al2O3 and AL-1010S provided improvement for both criteria, but to a lesser extent in SWW than in Milli-Q water; and Polonite (R) did not enhance the removal of CECs but led to the higher E. coli inactivation. These results suggest that Polonite (R), AL-1010S, and TiO2-Al2O3 can act as catalysts and provide mechanisms to lower the ozone dose required to reach disinfection. The apparent kinetic constant of the reaction for the catalytic ozonation of ATZ, in the ultrapure water, was determined for Polonite (R), TiO2-Al2O3 and AL-1010S. The reusability of the catalysts was demonstrated over four consecutive cycles of 6 h of treatment in a continuous flow ozonation system. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial pollution of recreational waters poses a significant public health risk which, unless mitigated, will continue to increase with population growth. Water managers must implement strategies to accurately discriminate and source human from animal faecal contamination in complex urbanised environments. Our case-study used a new combination of chemical (i.e. ammonia) and microbial (i.e. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp.) faecal monitoring tools in a targeted multi-tiered approach to quickly identify pollution hot-spots and track high-risk subterranean stormwater drains in real-time. We successfully located three point sources of human faecal pollution (both episodic and constant pollution streams) within 11 catchments in a total monitoring time of four months. Alternative approaches for obtaining such fine-scale accuracy are typically labour intensive and require expensive equipment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BackgroundDue to the rising number of type 2 diabetes patients, the antidiabetic drug, metformin is currently among those pharmaceuticals with the highest consumption rates worldwide. Via sewage-treatment plants, metformin enters surface waters where it is frequently detected in low concentrations (mu g/L). Since possible adverse effects of this substance in aquatic organisms have been insufficiently explored to date, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of metformin on health and development in brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and its microbiome.ResultsBrown trout embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 mu g/L metformin over a period from 48days post fertilisation (dpf) until 8weeks post-yolksac consumption at 7 degrees C (156dpf) and 11 degrees C (143dpf). Chemical analyses in tissues of exposed fish showed the concentration-dependent presence of metformin in the larvae. Mortality, embryonic development, body length, liver tissue integrity, stress protein levels and swimming behaviour were not influenced. However, compared to the controls, the amount of hepatic glycogen was higher in larvae exposed to metformin, especially in fish exposed to the lowest metformin concentration of 1 mu g/L, which is environmentally relevant. At higher metformin concentrations, the glycogen content in the liver showed a high variability, especially for larvae exposed to 1000 mu g/L metformin. Furthermore, the body weight of fish exposed to 10 and 100 mu g/L metformin at 7 degrees C and to 1 mu g/L metformin at 11 degrees C was decreased compared with the respective controls. The results of the microbiome analyses indicated a shift in the bacteria distribution in fish exposed to 1 and 10 mu g/L metformin at 7 degrees C and to 100 mu g/L metformin at 11 degrees C, leading to an increase of Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.ConclusionsOverall, weight reduction and the increased glycogen content belong to the described pharmaceutical effects of the drug in humans, but this study showed that they also occur in brown trout larvae. The impact of a shift in the intestinal microbiome caused by metformin on the immune system and vitality of the host organism should be the subject of further research before assessing the environmental relevance of the pharmaceutical.

AB To further improve the electrochemical performance of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode, a two-dimensional, macroporous, Sb-doped SnO2 film is constructed on BDD to obtain a bifunctional electrode interface (denoted Mp-SnO2/BDD) with an ordered, monolayer, photonic-crystal template using a sol-gel method. SEM images confirm that the SnO2 film consisted of innumerable, uniform, nanosized SnO2 particles and numerous macropores with diameters of 200-300 nm, and some BDD polycrystallites are exposed in those macropores. The microstructure endows Mp-SnO2/BDD with a high oxygen evolution potential (2.23 V), good conductivity (175 O), and excellent electrocatalytic activity. To evaluate the degradation capability, the electrocatalytic oxidation of a high concentration of clofibric acid (CA) is studied in detail. The CA and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals on Mp-SnO2/BDD are above 90% after 240 min. The degradation rate constant on Mp-SnO2/BDD is 1.6 times that on BDD. Compared with BDD and traditional SnO2/Ti, Mp-SnO2/BDD exhibites a higher instantaneous current efficiency and lower electrochemical energy consumption. In addition, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the intermediates in the degradation process and proposed three possible oxidative decomposition pathways for CA. Mp-SnO2/BDD is expected to be a promising anode for organic wastewater treatment.

AB To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in the Karst river system in Kaiyang, Southwest China. Ten water samples were collected from the Karst river in Kaiyang, Southwest China. Thirty-five antibiotics, including nine sulfonamides, four tetracyclines, five macrolides, sixteen quinolones and chloramphenicol, were analyzed. The results suggest that antibiotics are widely prevalent in the Karst river, with macrolides and quinolones being the most dominant and occupying 47% and 43% of total antibiotic concentration, respectively. The maximum total concentrations of sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones were 30.4, 421, 884, and 1,807 ng/L, respectively. Lincomycin, roxithromycin, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were detected in all samples with a detection frequency of 100%. The main sources of antibiotics were wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rural dumps that did not contain sanitary treatment, which accounted for 33% and 40% of the total antibiotics present in the Karst river. Due to an increase in river flow quantity, the presence of WWTPs and rural dumps did not affect the concentration and distribution of antibiotics in the Karst river; however, the mass flux of antibiotics were significantly affected by the contamination source and the poor natural attenuation.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a sanitizer with increasing use in food, medical and water treatment industries. Amino acids are important components in targeted foods for PAA treatment and ubiquitous in natural waterbodies and wastewater effluents as the primary form of dissolved organic nitrogen. To better understand the possible reactions, this work investigated the reaction kinetics and transformation pathways of selected amino acids towards PAA. Experimental results demonstrated that most amino acids showed sluggish reactivity to PAA except cysteine (CYS), methionine (MET), and histidine (HIS). CYS showed the highest reactivity with a very rapid reaction rate. Reactions of MET and HIS with PAA followed second-order kinetics with rate constants of 4.6 +/- 0.2, and 1.8 +/- 0.1 M-1.s(-1) at pH 7, respectively. The reactions were faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to PAA speciation. Low concentrations of H2O2 coexistent with PAA contributed little to the oxidation of amino acids. The primary oxidation products of amino acids with PAA were [O] addition compounds on the reactive sites at thiol, thioether and imidazole groups. Theoretical calculations were applied to predict the reactivity and regioselectivity of PAA electrophilic attacks on amino acids and improved mechanistic understanding. As an oxidative disinfectant, the reaction of PAA with organics to form byproducts is inevitable; however, this study shows that PAA exhibits lower and more selective reactivity towards biomolecules such as amino acids than other common disinfectants, causing less concern of toxic disinfection byproducts. This attribute may allow greater stability and more targeted actions of PAA in various applications. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP) is one of the most common antipyretic analgesics used to treat common ailments throughout the world. Recently, APAP has been frequently detected in wastewater effluent and groundwater, resulting in potential risks to the environment. Current methods for eliminating APAP are complicated and cost-prohibitive. This study examined APAP degradation by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) and UV-C irradiation combined with activated sludge (UV/AS) to evaluate potential applications in wastewater treatment. The results of this study indicate that UV-C irradiation reached an APAP degradation efficiency of more than 52% and a degradation rate of 0.0012-0.0013 min(-1) during 720 min of exposure, while the initial APAP concentration exhibited only a nominal effect on the degradation rate. However, the UV/AS treatment demonstrated an APAP degradation rate that was 9.6 times the rate of the UV-C-only treatment, with a degradation efficiency of 99% over the same UV irradiation period. The results further indicated that APAP photolysis efficiency was more effective when applied to sterilized AS than when applied to unsterilized AS. Finally, excessive dosage of both AS and humic acid inhibited APAP photolysis efficiency.

AB Contamination of water resources by emerging contaminants, radionuclides, heavy metals and nitrate is a critical problem that adversely affects the biotope. Constructed wetlands, as one of the least energy consuming methods have become an interesting option for wastewater treatment. In this study, terrestrial plants were used for phytoremediation of important pollutants from waste water. Therefore, uptake rates of cesium, metformin, arsenic and nitrate in hydroponic mesocosem constructed wetland were studied. When initial Cs concentrations were 2.35, 7.90 and 19.75 mg l(-1) in mesocosem constructed wetland, 89.36 +/- 0.42, 88.56 +/- 0.19 and 84.72 +/- 0.15% of cesium were remediated by Amaranthus chlorostachys plants. In the same cesium concentrations in mesocosem constructed wetland, 18.43 +/- 2.76, 78.98 +/- 0.25 and 89.35 +/- 0.25% cesium found to be remediated by Calendula alata plants. When exposed to 20 and 50 mg l(-1) metformin solutions 63 +/- 14 and 58.4 +/- 8.60% metformin were remediated by Amaranthus retroflexus plants. When exposed to 0.3 mg l(-1) sodium arsenate solution, 85.5 and 93.1% of arsenic were remediated after 14 and 21 days by Vetiveria zizanioides. In the case that initial concentrations of nitrate in hydroponic mesocosem constructed wetland were 32.7, 40.08 and 47.37 mg l(-1), 40.27, 26.64 and 70.02% of nitrate were removed, respectively, after 14 days.

AB Activated sludge (AS) is the mainly used biological process in water treatment; therefore, assessing the influence of various operating conditions on this process is relevant. This study aimed to evaluate at laboratory-scale the influence of the gas-to-liquid volume ratio (RG) and the stirring speed (SS) on the biodegradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) by activated sludge. For this purpose, a central composite design (CCD) was used in association with response surface methodology (RSM). Batch cultures were carried out at room temperature for 21 days in a mineral medium of initial pH 7, containing CBZ at an initial concentration of 5 mg L-1 and a given amount of AS (achieving 0.05 AU at 600 nm). The two parameters SS and R-G/L have been varied in the ranges of 80 to 320 rpm and 0.2 to 5, respectively. The pH, the (600 nm)-absorbance and the concentration of CBZ in the medium were monitored and their kinetics were modeled and linked to the operating conditions using principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained results showed that a low content of oxygen has a high positive effect, while an extreme stirring speed has a tiny negative effect on the process yield.

AB The process of bank filtration acts as a barrier against many anthropogenic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and industrial products, leading to a substantial improvement of groundwater quality. The performance of this barrier is, however, affected by seasonal influences and subject to significant temporal changes, which have already been described in the literature. Much less is known about spatial differences when considering one field site. In order to investigate this issue, two undisturbed cores from a well-investigated bank filtration field site were sampled and operated in the course of a column study. The ultimate aim was the identification and quantification of heterogeneities with regard to the biodegradation of 14 wastewater derived micropollutants, amongst others acesulfame, gabapentin, metoprolol, oxypurinol, candesartan, and olmesartan. While six of the compounds entirely persisted, eight compounds were prone to degradation. For those compounds that were subject to degradation, degradation rate constants ranged between 0.2 day(-1) (gabapentin) and 31 day(-1) (valsartan acid). Further, the rate constants consistently diverged between the distinct cores. In case of the gabapentin metabolite gabapentin-lactam, observed removal rate constants differed by a factor of six between the cores. Experimental data were compared to values calculated according to two structure based prediction models.

AB The Karany waterworks supplies drinking water to about one-third of Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic with a population of more than 1 million. The combination of two technologiesbank infiltration and artificial rechargeare used for production of drinking water. The two-year monitoring of PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) at monthly intervals observed temporal changes in 81 substances in the source river and groundwater, and the efficacy of contamination removal depended on the treatment technology used. The results showed a very wide range of PPCPs discharged from the waste water treatment plant at Mlada Boleslav into the Jizera River at concentrations ranging from ng/L to g/L. Acesulfame and oxypurinol in concentrations exceeding 100 ng/L systematically occurred, and then a few tens of ng/L of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, primidone, and lamotrigine were regularly detected at the water outlet using the artificial recharge for production of drinking water. Bank infiltration was found more efficient in removing PPCP substances at the Karany locality where none of the monitored substances was systematically detected in the mixed sample.

AB Organic micropollutants enter effluent streams and then flow into receiving waters. The volume adversely affects aquatic biota substantially. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop methods for their elimination. The aim of this study was the removal of organic micropollutants with different properties from WWTP (wastewater treatment plant) effluent in fixed bed columns packed with several combinations of sand, granular activated carbon (GAC), and granular clay-carbonaceous composite. Two types of bentonite-powder activated carbon-based granules (Ben-AC) were prepared within this work, with different calcination temperature. It was found that higher calcination temperature enhanced the surface porosity and adsorption potential versus studied micropollutants due to dihydroxylation resulting in higher chemical activity. Introduction of these granules in the place of GAC in a fixed bed column enhances the removal degree of micropollutants and typical water quality parameters. For example, the reduction degree of color, phosphate, and nitrate concentrations increased from 83%, 69%, and 4% to 95%, 83%, and 24% for column I and II, respectively. The concentration of carbamazepine, octylphenol, nononylphenol, and anthracene was reduced by 75%, 83%, 72%, 99% in column I, while using column II or III their removal was: 86%, 97%, 99%, 99%, respectively. Independent of the column filling, the removal of carbamazepine was the lowest (75-86%), while the highest retention was obtained for anthracene (99%). The study of column performance in the treatment of effluent in time showed that column filled with Ben-AC-400 guaranteed high removal degree in the operating time. The batch adsorption data were better described by both the Langmuir model.

AB Assessment of the impact of pharmaceutical residues on living organisms is very complex subject. Apart from taking into account the toxicity of individual compounds also their presence in mixtures should be taken into account. In this work, attempts were made to assess the ecotoxicity of biologically active substances (with 50 % effective concentration (EC50 ) values growing from fluoxetine (EC50 = 4.431 nM) >> gemfibrozil approximate to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol approximate to ketorolac > indomethacin > theophylline approximate to progesterone > naproxen approximate to trypsin > 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid > chloramphenicol > acetylsalicylic acid > ibuprofen > ketoprofen > 19-norethindrone to bezafibrate as the least toxic drug among studied ones) to the ISO standardized Ostracodtoxkit F (TM) bioassay. The Ostracodtoxkit F (TM) was proven to be very sensitive tool with respect to responding to presence of pharmaceuticals. Results of studies justify the statement that more research is needed in field of assessment of chronic exposure to pharmaceuticals and other newly emerging pollutants especially when they are present in complex mixture.

AB This work describes a new, equipment-free, generic method for the determination of sulfur-containing compounds that is based on their ability to slow down the photoreduction kinetics of gold ions to gold nanoparticles. The method involves tracking the time required for a red coloration to appear in the tested sample, indicative of the formation of gold nanoparticles, and compare the measured time relative to a control sample in the absence of the target analyte. The method is applicable with minimal and simple steps requiring only two solutions (i.e., a buffer and a gold solution), a source of light (UV or visible), and a timer. The method responds to a large variety of sulfur-containing compounds including thiols, thioesters, disulfides, thiophosphates, metal-sulfur bonds, and inorganic sulfur and was therefore applied to the determination of a variety of compounds such as dithiocarbamate and organophosphorous pesticides, biothiols, pharmaceutically active compounds, and sulfides in different samples such as natural waters and wastewater, biological fluids, and prescription drugs. The analytical figures of merit of the method include satisfactory sensitivity (quantitation limits at the low mu M levels), good recoveries (from 93 to 109%), and satisfactory reproducibility (from 4.8 to 9.8%). The method is easily adoptable to both laboratory settings and nonlaboratory conditions for quantitative and semiquantitative analysis, respectively, is user-friendly even for the minimally trained user, and can be performed with limited resources at low cost.

AB Inefficient visible light photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, such as acetaminophen (ACE) and triclosan (TS), is one of the main limiting factors for implementing cost-effective metal oxide photocatalyst for large-scale deployment. Here, a highly efficient CuO thin film photocatalyst is developed through rapid thermal annealing. The CuO thin film is decorated with Pd nanostructures for enhanced visible light degradation of ACE and TS. It is shown that compared to the as-deposited thin CuO film photocatalyst, the rapid thermal assisted CuO photocatalyst can significantly enhance charge generation and separation efficiency through improvement of crystallinity and reduction of recombination centres. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of Pd nanostructures can considerably increase optical absorption, which further improve the photocatalytic performance through the enhancement of surface plasmon resonance. The CuO film with the 40 s of Pd sputtering (Pd40-CuO) shows the highest performance for photocatalytic degradation of both ACE and TS. The Pd40-CuO film shows good stability and does not show any considerable reduction in photocatalytic activity after five cycles. This indicates the high potential of Pd40-CuO for water and wastewater treatment on industrial scale.

AB A pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 435 days in this study, aiming to treat pharmaceutical solvent wastewater containing m-Cresol (MC), isopropanol (IPA) and N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) pollutants at different temperatures of 35 +/- 3 degrees C, 25 +/- 3 degrees C, 15 +/- 3 degrees C and 25 +/- 3 degrees C, respectively. The reactor reached average total removal efficiencies of about 96%, 97.2% and 98% of MC, IPA and DMF at psychrophilic condition (15 +/- 3 degrees C). Higher physical removal rate was obtained at 15 +/- 3 degrees C due to the important contribution of membrane filtration. At this stage, the biogas production, methane content and specific methanogenic activity and extracellular polymeric substances of suspended sludge were observed with the lowest level. Moreover, the kinetic models for solvent degradation were established at different temperatures, results showed the smaller maximum specific substrate degradation rate of MC and IPA, besides, the lowest degradation rate of three solvents were obtained at 15 +/- 3 degrees C.

AB We propose to investigate the effect of recovery rates ranging from 50 to 90% on rejection of selected Pharmaceutical actives compounds wastewater (PhACs) by nanofiltration (NF) and the further treatment of NF concentrate by photocatalysis. In agreement with the literature, our results indicate that the chemical properties and composition of the effluent depend on the volume reduction factor. Then, the study focuses on the photocatalytic degradation of the selected molecules. The efficiency of photocatalytic treatment according to incident radiant flux density and the volumetric reduction factor (VRF) have been done to evaluate the global TOC destruction and the degradation of each contaminant. The degradation of target molecules in the concentrate (VRF = 2) by photocatalysis ranged from 20% to 80%. However, for higher VRF, competition with organic matter and alkalinity effects led to low degradation yields. The study of the influence of incident radiant flux density on degradation rate confirmed results already obtained by the authors and, this time, generalizes them for a complex matrix. Results show that coupling photocatalysis with a membrane process seems to be a complementary processes to classical waste water treatment in order to oxidized persistent molecules.

AB In this study, a novel recyclable Co-doped UiO-66 nanoparticle was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method. A high adsorption capacity of 224.1 mg g(-1) was obtained by the CoUiO-1 nanoparticle, then the adsorbed tetracycline (TC) molecules could be removed more than 94% of initial concentration under simulative sunlight irradiation. The adsorptive ability and photocatalytic performance of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle were about 7.6 and 6.9 times higher than the pristine UiO-66, respectively. The adsorption capacity of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle was sensitive to adsorbent dosage, coexisting ions, solution pH values and initial TC concentrations. Pseudosecond- order and Freundlich models fitted well with the adsorption process. Thermodynamic study indicated the TC adsorption on CoUiO-1 nanoparticle was a spontaneous and exothermic process. TC photodegradation experiment showed that the Co-doped modification expanded light absorption and facilitated charge separation of UiO-66, which was beneficial to enhance photocatalytic performance. The mechanism of TC photodegradation by Co-doped UiO-66 nanoparticle was investigated. Moreover, a plausible degradation pathway for TC was proposed. The high removal efficiencies of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle were obtained towards real samples including tap water, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater. Therefore, the novel Co-doped MOFs photocatalytic adsorbent showed great potential in wastewater treatment.

AB The effect of neat and modified nanodiamond (ND) nanoparticles on the structure and performance of PVDF membranes was studied. ND was first oxidized (O-ND) thermally, then silanized (S-ND) using the esterification reaction by vinyltrimethoxysilane, and finally was PVP functionalized (P-ND) via surface initiated free-radical polymerization method. The results of FTIR analysis revealed that PVP was successfully immobilized onto ND nanoparticles. Different percentages of ND and P-ND nanoparticles were then embedded into PVDF membranes. The results showed that the hydriphilicity and water flux of membranes improved as the percentage of nanoparticles increased. Moreover, the number of pores on the surface of PVDF/P-ND membrane increased in comparison to neat PVDF and PVDF/ND membranes even though the pore size distribution curve of PVDF/P-ND membrane was shifted towards smaller pores. In addition, the presence of ND and P-ND nanoparticles within PVDF membranes increased the portion of beta-phase in the PVDF structure which resulted in abrasion and fouling resistant membranes. The performance of neat PVDF, 1.5 wt. % PVDF/ND and 1.5 wt. % PVDF/P-ND membranes was studied in MBR system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed and it was found that antifouling properties PVDF/P-ND membrane were better than that of PVDF/ND membrane.

AB Aqueous-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) has been scarcely explored in the literature for the removal of chlorinated micropollutants. The aim of this work is to prove the feasibility of this technology for the fast and environmentally-friendly degradation of such kind of compounds. Diclofenac (DCF), a highly consumed anti-inflammatory drug, has been selected as the target pollutant given its toxicity and low biodegradability. The commercial Pd/Al2O3 (1% wt.) catalyst has been used due to its prominent role on this field. Complete degradation of DCF was achieved in a short reaction time (20 min) under ambient conditions (25 degrees C, 1 atm) at [DCF](0) = 68 mu M; [Pd/Al2O3](0) = 0.5 g L-1 and H-2 flow rate of 50 N mL min(-1). Remarkably, the chlorinated intermediate (2-(2-chloroanilino)-phenylacetate (CI-APA)) generated along reaction was completely removed at the same time, being the chlorine-free compound 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA) the only final product. A reaction scheme based on this consecutive pathway and a pseudo-first-order kinetic model have been proposed. An apparent activation energy of 43 kJ mol(-1) was obtained, a comparable value to those previously reported for conventional organo-chlorinated pollutants. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited a reasonable stability upon three successive uses, achieving the complete degradation of the drug and obtaining APA as the final product in 30 min. The evolution of ecotoxicity was intimately related to the disappearance of the chlorinated organic compounds and thus, the final HDC effluents were non-toxic. The versatility of the system was finally demonstrated in different environmentally-relevant matrices (wastewater treatment plant effluent and surface water). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, has been widely used in pharmaceutical and personal care products. It undergoes limited degradation during wastewater treatment and is present in biosolids, most of which are land applied in the United States. This study assessed the impact of triclosan (0-100 mg kg(-1)) with and without biochar on soil bacterial communities. Very little C-14-triclosan was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 (<7%) over the course of the study (42 days). While biochar (1%) significantly lowered mineralization of triclosan, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that biochar impacted very few OTUs and did not alter the overall structure of the community. Triclosan, on the other hand, significantly affected bacterial diversity and community structure (alpha diversity, ANOVA, p < 0.001: beta diversity, AMOVA, p < 0.01). Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM) modeling and complete linkage clustering (CLC) revealed a dose-dependent impact of triclosan. Non-Parametric Metastats (NPM) analysis showed that 150 of 734 OTUs from seven main phyla were significantly impacted by triclosan (adjusted p < 0.05). Genera harboring opportunistic pathogens such as Flavobacterium were enriched in the presence of triclosan, as was Stenotrophomonas. The latter has previously been implicated in triclosan degradation via stable isotope probing. Surprisingly, Sphingomonads, which include well-characterized triclosan degraders were negatively impacted by even low doses of triclosan. Analyses of published genomes showed that triclosan resistance determinants were rare in Sphingomonads which may explain why they were negatively impacted by triclosan in our soil.

AB Among the release solutions for reducing the discharge of organic and persistent contaminants in the aquatic environment, the use of a tertiary treatment in addition to existing conventional wastewater treatment processes is considered. The use of micro-grain activated carbon in a fluidized bed is a promising technique investigated in this study. The effluents from a large-scale pilot system were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (QToF). Several strategies were deployed, namely molecular fingerprint comparison, suspected and non-target analyses, identification of refractory compounds to treatment, and finally, quantification of identified compounds. The evaluation of the molecular fingerprints provided evidence of the overall effect of the tertiary treatment on the treated wastewater quality. The suspected approach highlighted the presence of 83 pharmaceuticals and pesticides as well as transformation products in the effluents. The non-target approaches also highlighted compounds refractory to tertiary treatment, such as illicit drugs or some pharmaceuticals. The identification and quantification of identified compounds underscored the suitability of micro-grain activated carbon in eliminating many classes of pharmaceuticals with various physicochemical properties, such as anti-hypertensive, analgesic, anti-viral, antidepressant and even various pesticides.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of organic-carbon-deficient wastewater containing benzotriazole (BTA) in lab-scale aerated biofilters filled with natural manganese oxide ore, sand coated with synthetic manganese oxides and sand (as a control material) in terms of BTA removal efficiency, its transformation products and ecotoxicological impact of the treated wastewater. Additionally, the effect of Mn(II) feeding was tested. The removal of BTA in all the biofilters was >= 97%. The contribution of the biotic removal of this compound was 15%, 50%, and 75% in the systems filled with sand, synthetic and natural manganese oxides, respectively. Only the columns filled with natural manganese oxides provided significant removal of DOC and decrease of UV254 and SUVA(254), with even more pronounced effect with Mn(II) feeding. The presence of Mn(II) was also found to enhance the removal of N-NH4 in the systems filled with either form of manganese oxides, otherwise the removal of N-NH4 was negligible or negative. The transformation reactions of BTA were methylation, hydroxylation, and triazole ring cleavage. Based on the number of compounds and their relative abundance, the methylated transformation products were predominant in the effluent. The reduction of the ecotoxicity (Microtox bioassay) of the effluents was positively correlated with the decrease of UV254, SUVA and DOC and only moderately with the removal of BTA. This study has shown that the natural manganese oxide ore provides the broadest set of services as a filtering material for aerated biofilters treating carbon-deficient wastewater containing BTA.

AB Antibiotics as the severe contaminants of aqueous environments were received growing attention during the last decades. The current work is the first report on investigating the potency and efficiency of electrocoagulation process in the successful removal of metronidazole (MNZ) from pharmaceutical wastewater using response surface methodology based on central composite design. The applied method by optimizing the independent and combined effects of significant variables which affecting the EC process enhanced the removal efficiency of MNZ. Analysis of variance was applied to verify the significance of independent variables solely and their interactions. The best removal efficiency of 100% found under the optimal operating condition of initial MNZ concentration 21.6 mg L-1, pH 8.2, current density 6.0 mA cm(-2), inter-electrode distance 3 cm, and reaction time of 14.6 min. Isotherm investigations revealed that the Langmuir model with the R-2 of 0.994 best fitted to the obtained experimental equilibrium results. The fast adsorption of MNZ on the surface of Fe(OH)(3) and [Fe(OH)2] with the equilibrium time of 15 min confirmed that the kinetics of the electrocoagulation process follow the pseudo second-order model (R-2 = 0.962). The electrocoagulation process under the optimal operating condition revealed that the electrical energy consumption per each m(3) of treated pharmaceutical wastewater, per each g of MNZ, removed, and per each kg of Fe electrode consumed, were found to be 0.516 kWh m(-3), 0.0234 kWh g(-1), and 0.0436 kWh kg(-1), respectively.

AB In order to develop an efficient electrode to remove pharmaceutical and personal care products from wastewater, copper and antimony doped Ti/SnO2 electrode were prepared by thermal decomposition. Electrochemical characterization was undertaken on Ti/SnO2-Cu using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, indicating an ultra-high 2.1 V of oxygen evolution potential, better stability, and superior corrosion resistance rather than traditional Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Competitive degradation experiments showed more efficient removal rate was achieved on Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode, which could remove more than 90% ceftazidime within 60 min. The microstructure and crystal orientation of the modified electrodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, which indicated that the crystal of the Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode grew in more porous and uniform condition, covered with closely arranged layers of the coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffractions suggested that Cu2O was successfully coated on the Ti/SnO2-Cu electrode surface. The operating parameters of electrochemical degradation process were also investigated, including current density, initial concentration, electrode distance, stirring rate and supporting electrolyte. Consequently, the intermediate products of electrochemical degradation were monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and a major degradation pathway was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sustainable and closed-loop nutrient cycling require the recovery of valuable resources from wastewater. Resource recovery from diluted wastewater streams is limited by diluted concentrations and unfavorable reaction kinetics. In comparison, source separated urine allows resource recovery from a highly concentrated nutrient stream, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient recovery practice. Different nutrient recovery methods from urine have been studied in lab-scale, but pilot or full-scale process evaluations remain sparse. In this study, recovery of struvite and ammonium sulfate from urine of pregnant women was demonstrated at a pilot-scale treatment facility by means of precipitation and air stripping/acid scrubbing. The system achieved 94% struvite precipitation efficiency but merely 55% of the crystals were removed and recovered. The low phosphorus recovery was due to the washout of small crystals that escaped the sieve and settling tank, hence requiring an improved method for crystals capture. The removal and recovery efficiencies for nitrogen were 93% and 85%, respectively. Composition analysis of the produced fertilizers indicated that struvite was the dominated precipitate and quality of the ammonium sulfate met European standards. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were added in the urine to measure the fate of pharmaceuticals in the treatment system. Very little of the spiked pharmaceuticals (<0.01%) accumulated in the produced struvite and ammonium sulfate. The overall energy demand of the pilot system was 1066 MJ per m(3) urine processed or 198 MJ per kg N removed. Energy efficiency was not optimized and can be improved in many ways.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence and removal of 10 steroid hormones (4 androgens, 3 progestagens and 3 estrogens) in two WSP systems, Mafisa and Mzumbe in Morogoro, Tanzania. All 10 steroid hormones were detected in the influent of both WSP systems in the dry as well as in the rainy season. The concentrations of steroids in influent wastewater ranged from 0.1 ng/L for 17-OH-pregnenolone to 445 ng/L for estrone and from below limit of detection for 17-OH-pregnenolone to 45 ng/L for estrone in effluent. During dry season, the overall mean standard deviation removal efficiency for the 10 steroids were 70 +/- 21% for Mzumbe WSP and 97 +/- 3% for Mafisa WSP. During the rainy season the overall mean removal efficiency for all the steroid hormones were 52 +/- 32% for Mzumbe WSP and 94 +/- 8% for Mafisa WSP. Risk was characterized by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) for fish and humans. 46% of the total RQs calculated were above one, indicating high risk. Low RQs were estimated for androgens and progestagens but the estrogen concentrations measured in the WSP systems and Morogoro River indicated a high risk for fish. However, estrogens appeared not to pose an appreciable risk to human health from water intake and fish consumption. The results indicated that WSP systems are quite effective in removing steroid hormones from wastewater. Thus, low technology systems such as WSP systems are suitable techniques in low income counties due to relatively low costs of building, operating and maintaining these systems.

AB The steadily increasing production of pharmaceutical substances, their widespread use in health care for people and animals and inadequate disposal methods have attracted much interest in risks involved in the presence of these substances and their metabolites in the environment. Drugs present in wastewater are often resistant to biodegradation and can disturb biological processes of removing contaminants from wastewater. It should be emphasized that conventional wastewater treatment plants are not adapted to disposal of such contaminants as pharmaceutical substances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of erythromycin on changes in dehydrogenase activity in activated sludge and oxygen uptake rate of the whole population of microorganisms of active sludge, heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifying bacteria of the first and second phase. A decline in activity of dehydrogenases of activated sludge in the presence of erythromycin was observed. With the concentration of this antibiotic of 150 mg/L, the lowest value of dehydrogenase activity was 35.5 mu mol TF/gSS, whereas the degree of inhibition for this concentration reached 33.7%. It was also found that oxygen uptake rate declined for the entire population of microorganisms of active sludge in the presence of the antibiotic. The highest value of the inhibition degree for this oxygen uptake rate was 28.8%. Furthermore, an insignificant decline in the degree of inhibition of oxygen uptake rate was observed for heterotrophic bacteria (13.7%). The most sensitive to erythromycin were nitrifying bacteria. Degree of inhibition of oxygen uptake rate in the presence of this antibiotic for nitrifying bacteria of the first phase reached 40-64.5%, whereas for the bacteria of second phase, this value was 28.2-62%.

AB Pharmaceuticals are quite common but very harmful environmental contaminants. Major part of them are non-steroidal compounds. Data on the risk connected with the presence of such contaminants in surface waters are scattered; however, it was confirmed that one of the important sources of these micropollutants are wastewater treatment plants. Because of this preventive action not only monitoring should be recommended. For recommendation, detailed knowledge not only on effects but also on removal efficiencies is necessary. The aim of this study is to describe the possibilities of degradation and removal of 10, the most frequently present in surface waters, non-steroidal pharmaceuticals. Removal effectiveness of pharmaceutical can be in the range from several to even 100% and is affected by properties of individual compounds, treatment technology, and technological parameters. The most effective processes seem to be advanced oxidation processes.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are an integral part of societal health yet their presence in various environmental compartments, including treated wastewaters, has sparked concerns towards possible human and ecological health effects. The current study aims to characterize human health risks posed by ten pharmaceuticals quantified in wastewater treatment plant effluents where water is reused mainly for landscape irrigation. Receptors were identified as children playing in green areas, adult landscape workers, and adult users of athletic and golf courses irrigated by treated wastewater. The human health risk assessment model exhibited safe exposure (RQ < 1) to all pharmaceuticals for all receptors through both dermal and ingestion exposure pathways. RQs were highest for the landscape worker followed by children playing in green areas and then adult using the athletic fields. RQs were highest to lowest in the following order of pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, metoprolol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, risperidone, and sulfamethazine. Such risk assessment findings aid in supporting decisions to optimize wastewater treatment and reuse strategies, as well as safeguard public and environmental health.

AB Wastewater, especially anaerobic treatment effluent, contains high ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and inorganic orthophosphate (PO4-P), which necessitate additional treatment to meet stringent discharge regulations. Ion exchange regeneration is a process that can be adopted for not only removing but also recovering nutrients. However, recovering nutrients by ion exchange from nutrient-rich effluents that also contain micropollutants (which typically pass through anaerobic treatment as well) may result in subsequent problems, since micropollutants could end up in ion exchange effluent, regenerant, or recovered fertilizer products. Micropollutant removal by a nonselective adsorbent, such as biosolids-derived biochar, before nutrient recovery processes would mitigate potential risks. The objective of this research was to evaluate the capability of biosolids-derived biochar as a pretreatment step for separating micropollutants from nutrient-rich water before ion exchange for nutrient recovery. In the presence of ammonium and phosphate, both pristine and regenerated biosolids-derived biochar could effectively adsorb triclosan (TCS) and estradiol (E2), and to a lesser extent, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in batch sorption experiments. On the other hand, nutrient ions were not effectively adsorbed by biosolids-derived biochar. A continuous flow-through system consisting of columns in series filled with biochar, LayneRT, and then clinoptilolite was operated to test selective removal of micropollutants and nutrients in a flow-through system. The biochar column achieved more than 80% removal of influent TCS and E2, thereby reducing the chances of micropollutants being adsorbed by ion exchangers. Sulfamethoxazole removal through the biochar column was only 50%, indicating that biosolids-derived biochar would have to be optimized in the future for hydrophilic micropollutant removal. Influent nutrients were not effectively removed by the biochar column, but were captured in their respective selective ion exchanger columns. This research revealed that biosolids-derived biochar could be employed before ion exchange resins for removal of micropollutants from nutrient-rich water.

AB Human pharmaceutical residues are a serious environmental concern. They have been reported to have eco, geno, and human toxic effects, and thus their importance as micropollutants cannot be ignored. These have been studied extensively in Europe and North America. However, African countries are still lagging behind in research on these micropollutants. In this study, the wastewaters of the University Teaching Hospital of Yaounde (UTHY) were screened for the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients and their metabolites. The screening was carried out using two methods: high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole analyzer (LC/QQQ) and high-performance coupled to a mass spectrometer with a time of flight analyzer (LC/Q-TOF). A total of 19 active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites were identified and quantified. The compounds identified include paracetamol (211.93g/L), ibuprofen (141g/L), tramadol (76g/L), O-demethyltramadol (141g/L), erythromycinanhydrate (7g/L), ciprofloxacin (24g/L), clarinthromycine (0.088g/L), azitromycine (0.39g/L), sulfamethoxazole 0.16g/L), trimetoprime (0.27g/L), caffeine (5.8g/L), carnamaeepine (0.94g/L), atenolol (0.43g/L), propranolol (0.3g/L), cimetidine (34g/L), hydroxy omeprazole (5g/L), diphenhydramine (0.38g/L), metformine (154g/L), and sucralose (13.07g/L).

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug that is frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants, soil and plants after irrigation with treated wastewater or application of biosolids. However, little information is available on the fate and uptake of CBZ in edible vegetables. In this study, radioautographic visualization of the C-14 distribution revealed that C-14-CBZ can be taken up by all three ready-to-eat vegetables. Furthermore, a mass-balance study was conducted to evaluate the dynamic processes of the uptake and translocation of CBZ by C-14 labeling. C-14-CBZ was gradually taken up with the growth of vegetables, with maximum uptake ratios of 2.19 +/- 0.15, 2.86 +/- 0.24 and 0.25 +/- 0.05% of applied C-14 in celery, carrot and pak choi, respectively. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) based on C-14 measurements ranged from 7.6 to 26.1 for celery, 3.6-12.9 for carrot, and 4.4-44 for pak choi. C-14-CBZ was easily translocated from the roots to the leaves and/or stems. The amendment of biosolids had a significant inhibitory effect on the uptake and translocation of C-14-CBZ from soil.

AB The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in waste sludge, especially for the pharmaceutical waste sludge, presents great potential risks to human health. Although ARGs and factors affecting their spreading are of major importance for human health, the factors influencing the fate of ARGs during sludge treatment, especially for pharmaceutical sludge treatment are not yet well understood. In order to be able to minimize ARGs spreading, it is important to find what is influencing their spreading. Therefore, certain factors, such as the sludge characteristics, bacterial diversity and community composition, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the advanced AD of pharmaceutical sludge with different pretreatments were studied, and their affinity with ARGs was elucidated by Spearman correlation analysis. Furthermore, multiple linear regression was introduced to evaluate the importance of the various factors. Results showed that 59.7%-88.3% of the variations in individual ARGs and total ARGs can be explained by the corresponding factors. Bacterial diversity rather than specific bacterial community composition affected the fate of ARGs, whereas alkalinity was the most important factor on ARGs among all sludge characteristics investigated in this study. Besides, 66.4% of variation of total ARGs was driven by the changes of MGEs. Multiple linear regression models also reveal the collective effect of these factors on ARGs, and the contributions of each factor impact on ARGs. This study provides more comprehension about the factors impact on the fate of ARGs during pharmaceutical sludge treatment, and offers an approach to evaluate the importance of each factor, which method could be introduced for evaluation of factors influencing ARGs during other types of sludge or wastewater treatment.

AB A high-efficient, low-cost, and practical biochar implementation method is desired to extend biochar's powerful adsorption performance for environmental remediation. This study presents novel results with advanced biochar application by integrating biochar with biofilter for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from stormwater. Biochars derived from wood dust (BC0) at different pyrolytic temperatures (300, 500, and 700 degrees C, referred as, BC300, BC500, and BC700, respectively) were characterized and investigated for their adsorption of BPA under different pH levels and humic acid (HA) concentrations by batch sorption and fixed-bed column experiments. Microcosm biofilters vegetated with phragmites australis and amended with different biochars were constructed and used for BPA removal under different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Compared with other biochars, BC700 showed a high adsorption rate and capacity due to high specific surface area and pore volume. As a consequence, fixed-bed columns amended with BC700 can remove BPA more efficiently than columns with BC0, BC300, and BC500 from synthetic stormwater, though the treatment performance was affected relatively by pH change and HA concentration. A high correlation (r(2) = 0.899) between the breakthrough time and the product of adsorption rate (k(2)) and capacity (Q(max)) was found, which suggests that batch sorption experiments could be an efficient tool for prediction of breakthrough time. The BPA removal efficiency of microcosm biofilters amended with BC0, BC300, BC500 and BC700 for real stormwater containing 200 mu g/L BPA at HLR of 40 cm/h averaged 4.1, 10.8, 80.3, and 98.4%, which were about 6, 15, 115, and 141 times, respectively, compared to bilfitlers without biochar amendment. Moreover, biochar amendment not only enhanced the BPA removal but also promoted phragmites australis growth, elevated nutrients and increased the E. coli removal efficiency. Hence, biochar-amended biofilters could be a promising approach for enhancing the elimination of endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as BPA from aqueous environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High concentrations of antibiotic compounds within pharmaceutical wastewater have hazardous impacts toward environment and human health. Therefore, there is an immediate requirement of efficient treatment method for removal of antibiotics from aquatic environment. In the present study, the cryptomelane catalyst-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (K-OMS-2) was synthesized in the presence of benzyl alcohol as a reducing agent and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a structure-directing agent and then utilized to reduce the metronidazole. The central composite design method was the experimental design adopted. The FESEM analysis revealed that the K-OMS-2 surface contained many uniformly cylindrical aggregates less than about 40nm in diameter and about 80-100nm in length. Besides, a high specific surface area of 129m(2)/g and average pore size of 45.47nm were recorded. According to the TGA/DTA analysis, the prepared catalyst revealed high thermal stability. The maximum metronidazole degradation (95.36%) was evident at conditions of pH = 3, catalyst mass = 0.97g/L, contact time = 200min, and metronidazole concentration = 20mg/L. Metronidazole did not form a complex with nitrate, fluoride, sulfate, or hardness. These ions exerted a negligible effect on metronidazole reduction using the K-OMS-2 catalyst, except for hardness, which reduced the removal efficiency of metronidazole by 17%. The FTIR and LC-MS revealed a complex mechanism involved in the metronidazole degradation by the K-OMS-2 involving the formation of an amino group, a hydroxyelated compound via N-denitration, and hydrogenation process on the K-OMS-2 catalyst surface.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not able to remove completely some emerging contaminants, such as residual pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) with potential ecotoxicity to water bodies. An advanced bio-oxidation process (ABOP) using white-rot fungi (WRF) has been proposed as alternative biological treatment for degradation of non-biodegradable compounds. A synthetic and real wastewater spiked with 12 PCs at 50 mu g L-1 was treated by means of ABOP based on WRF in a rotating biological contactor (RBC) at 1 day of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The ABOP achieved a remarkable biological performance in terms of TOC removal and reduction of N-NH4+ and P-PO43- nutrients. Likewise, 5 of the 12 PCs were eliminated with removal efficiencies ranging from 80 to 95%, whereas 6 of 12 PCs were eliminated with removal values ranging from 50 to 70%. The anaerobic digestion of the fungal sludge generated upon the treatment was also evaluated, obtaining a methane yield of 250 mL CH4 g(VS)(-1). These results evidenced that the proposed ABOP is a promising alternative for the sustainable wastewater treatment of urban effluents, combining advanced oxidation with biological operation for the removal of emerging PCs and energy recovery.

AB In this paper, for the first time, faujasite Y zeolite impregnated with iron (III) was employed as a catalyst to remove a real cocktail of micropollutants inside real water samples from the Meurthe river by the means of the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process. The catalyst was prepared by the wet impregnation method using iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as iron precursor. First, an optimization of the process parameters was conducted using phenol as model macro-pollutant. The hydrogen peroxide concentration, the light wavelength (UV and visible) and intensity, the iron loading immobilized, as well as the pH of the solution were investigated. Complete photo-Fenton degradation of the contaminant was achieved using faujasite containing 20 wt.% of iron, under UV light, and in the presence of 0.007 mol/L of H2O2 at pH 5.5. In a second step, the optimized process was used with real water samples from the Meurthe river. Twenty-one micropollutants (endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and perfluorinated compounds) including 17 pharmaceutical compounds were specifically targeted, detected, and quantified. All the initial concentrations remained in the range of nanogram per liter (0.8-88 ng/L). The majority of the micropollutants had a large affinity for the surface of the iron-impregnated faujasite. Our results emphasized the very good efficiency of the photo-Fenton process with a cocktail of a minimum of 21 micropollutants. Except for sulfamethoxazole and PFOA, the concentrations of all the other microcontaminants (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, clarithromycin, diclofenac, estrone, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, lidocaine, naproxen, PFOS, triclosan, etc.) became lower than the limit of quantification of the LC-MS/MS after 30 min or 6 h of photo-Fenton treatment depending on their initial concentrations. The photo-Fenton degradation of PFOA can be neglected. The photo-Fenton degradation of sulfamethoxazole obeys first-order kinetics in the presence of the cocktail of the other micropollutants.

AB Interaction of ciprofloxacin with the activated sludge of the sewage treatment plant is of importance for the ciprofloxacin migration and risk control. More than 96.0% ciprofloxacin was removed through the sludge adsorption. The sludge surface charge varied little with ciprofloxacin since most ciprofloxacin was dissociated into the neutral one. No obvious shift was observed for the soluble carbohydrate concentration and composition with the addition of ciprofloxacin, indicating the weak interaction between the carbohydrates and ciprofloxacin. The introduction of ciprofloxacin resulted in a reduction of the soluble protein concentration, a marked increase of the extracellular protein fluorescence intensities, and a dramatic emergence of new extracellular proteins. The alteration of the proteins highlights the strong interaction between the extracellular proteins and ciprofloxacin, and the consequent integration of certain soluble proteins and original unextractable inner layer extracellular proteins into the extractable extracellular proteins. Different types of interactions are suggested to dominate between the extracellular proteins and the differently dissociated ciprofloxacin.

AB Trans-ferulic acid (FA), extensively used in pharmaceutical and olive oil industries, causes huge risks to ecological environment due to its biotoxicity and phytotoxicity, leading to the difficulty of biochemical processes in treating FA wastewater. In this study, synergistic degradation of FA via dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and O-3 (plasma-ozone) was studied. The results showed that FA degradation efficiency reached 96.9% after a 40-min treatment by plasma-ozone process, and the energy efficiency of FA degradation was increased by 62.5 and 24.5% compared to single DBD plasma and ozonation treatment. Moreover, FA degradation rate constant in plasma-ozone process was 41% higher compared with the sum of single DBD plasma and ozonation, indicating a significant synergistic effect. Radical diagnosis experiments reveal that a profound increase of center dot OH yield through peroxone (H2O2/O-3) and UV/O-3 pathways is the important mechanism of synergistic degradation of FA in plasma-ozone process, while e(aq)(-) played little role in FA degradation. A degradation pathway of FA by plasma-ozone was also proposed according to the detected intermediates from EEM and LC-MS. This work revealed that plasma-ozone process is an alternative process for FA treatment, and the findings are helpful for understanding FA degradation characteristics and synergistic mechanisms in plasma-ozone process.

AB This study assessed the ability to remove micro-pollutants from wastewater using herbaceous species (Phragmites australis L.) and trees (Salix matsudana Koidz.) in constructed wetland (CW) systems. The targets of the study were as follows: (i) pharmaceuticals like diclofenac, ketoprofen, and atenolol; (ii) 4-n-NP (4-n-nonylphenol) and the ethoxylated derivatives monoethoxylated nonylphenol (NP1EO) and diethoxylated nonylphenol (NP2EO); (iii) triclosan, a bactericide used in personal care products. The 12 CW systems, filled with clay and gravel, were irrigated with wastewater from municipal area of Pagnana (Tuscany, Italy) and influent and effluent water samples analyzed periodically by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The removal efficiency of CWs planted with willow and common red ranged from 8.4 up to 100%, with the higher removal efficiency for triclosan. On the contrary, the removal efficiency of NPs and NPEOs appears lower than pharmaceuticals. Data demonstrated that P. australis efficiently removed NP, diclofenac, and atenolol, while S. matsudana preferentially removed NP1EO, NP2EO, ketoprofene, and triclosan. A specific selection of plants used in CWs could be exploited for the removal of specific xenobiotics from wastewater.

AB Since the inception of global industrialization, the growth of steroid estrogens becomes a matter of emerging serious concern for the rapid population. Steroidal estrogens are potent endocrine-upsetting chemicals that are excreted naturally by vertebrates (e.g., humans and fish) and can enter natural waters through the discharge of treated and raw sewage. Steroidal estrogens in plants may enter the food web and become a serious threat to human health. We evaluated the uptake and accumulation of ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17-estradiol (17-E2) in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) grown under controlled environmental condition over 21days growth period. An effective analytical method based on ultrasonic liquid extraction (ULE) for solid samples and solid phase extraction (SPE) for liquid samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been developed to determine the steroid estrogens in lettuce plants. The extent of uptake and accumulation was observed in a dose-dependent manner and roots were major organs for estrogen deposition. Unlike the 17-E2, EE2 was less accumulated and translocated from root to leaves. For 17-E2, the distribution in lettuce was primarily to roots after the second week (13%), whereas in leaves it was (10%) over the entire study period. The distribution of EE2 at 2000gL(-1) in roots and leaves was very low (3.07% and 0.54%) during the first week and then was highest (12% in roots and 8% in leaves) in last week. Bioaccumulation factor values of 17-E2 and EE2 in roots were 0.33 and 0.29 at 50gL(-1) concentration as maximum values were found at 50gL(-1) rather than 500 and 2000 in all observed plant tissues. Similar trend was noticed in roots than leaves for bioconcentration factor as the highest bioconcentration values were observed at 50gL(-1) concentration instead of 500 and 2000gL(-1) spiked concentration. These findings mainly indicate the potential for uptake and bioaccumulation of estrogens in lettuce plants. Overall, the estrogen contents in lettuce were compared to the FAO/WHO recommended toxic level and were found to be higher than the toxic level which is of serious concern to the public health. This analytical procedure may aid in future studies on risks associated with uptake of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in lettuce plants.

AB The presence of various classes of pharmaceutical drugs in different environmental compartments has been reported worldwide. In South Africa, the detection of pharmaceuticals especially the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is recent, and more studies are being done in order to fully understand their fate in the aquatic environment. With considerations for the need of better sample preparation techniques, this study synthesized a molecularly imprinted polymer for the selective extraction of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, fenoprofen in aqueous environmental samples. Batch adsorption studies showed that adsorption of fenoprofen onto the cavities of the polymer followed a Langmuir isotherm as well as a pseudo second order model implying formation of a monolayer on the surface through chemisorption. The polymer had a maximum adsorption capacity of 38.8mgg(-1) and a Langmuir surface area of 1607m(2)g(-1). The imprinted polymer was then used as the selective sorbent for solid phase extraction in the analysis of fenoprofen from wastewater followed by chromatographic determination. The analytical method gave a detection limit of 0.64ngmL(-1) and recovery of 99.6%. The concentration of fenoprofen detected in influent and effluent samples from two wastewater treatment plants ranged from 24 to 58ngmL(-1). The ability of the treatment plants to remove fenoprofen during wastewater processing based on the difference in concentrations in influent and effluent samples was found to be 41%. This work has shown that there is a possibility of release of fenoprofen from wastewater treatment plants into surface water sources.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds in wastewater released from human consumption have received considerable attention because of their possible risks for aquatic environments. In this study, the occurrence and removal of 10 pharmaceuticals in three municipal wastewater treatment plants in southern China were investigated and the environmental risks they posed were assessed. Nifedipine, atenolol, metoprolol, valsartan and pravastatin were detected in the influent wastewater. The highest average concentration in the influents was observed for metoprolol (164.6 ng/L), followed by valsartan (120.3 ng/L) in August, while median concentrations were higher in November than in August. The total average daily mass loadings of the pharmaceuticals in the three plants were 289.52 mg/d/person, 430.46 mg/d/person and 368.67 mg/d/person, respectively. Elimination in the treatment plants studied was incomplete, with metoprolol levels increasing during biological treatment. Biological treatment was the most effective step for PhACs removal in all of the plants studied. Moreover, the removal of PhACs was observed with higher efficiencies in August than in November. The WWTP equipped with an Unitank process exhibited similar removals of most PhACs as other WWTPs equipped with an anoxic/oxic (A/O) process or various anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(2)/O) process. The environmental risk assessment concluded that all of the single PhAC in the effluents displayed a low risk (RQ < 0.1) to the aquatic environments.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) are two critical sulfonamide antibiotics with enhanced persistency that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. Recently, more scholars have showed interests in how SMX and TMP antibiotics are biodegraded, which is seldom reported previously. Novel artificial composite soil treatment systems were designed to allow biodegradation to effectively remove adsorbed SMX and TMP from the surface of clay ceramsites. A synergy between sorption and biodegradation improves the removal of SMX and TMP. One highly efficient SMX and TMP degrading bacteria strain, Bacillus subtilis, was isolated from column reactors. In the removal process, this bacteria degrade SMX and TMP to NH4+ , and then further convert NH4+ to NO3- in a continuous process. Microbial adaptation time was longer for SMX degradation than for TMP, and SMX was also able to be degraded in aerobic conditions. Importantly, the artificial composite soil treatment system is suitable for application in practical engineering.

AB BACKGROUND Stevensite and biochar were investigated to covalently immobilize laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) and Pleurotus eryngii (PeL) through the sequential application of aminopropyltriethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. The immobilized preparations were tested to remove three tetracyclines and six sulfonamides at 0.1 mmol L-1 of each antibiotic. Degradation experiments were conducted both in the absence and in the presence (0.2 mmol L-1) of ABTS, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), syringaldehyde or violuric acid. The residual antibiotic activity was tested towards five bacterial species and a bacterial consortium from wastewater. RESULTS Higher values of activity yields (74% and 70.3%) and catalytic capabilities (1426 and 1405 IU g(-1)) were obtained with PeL on stevensite and biochar than with MtL. Stevensite enabled higher reusability and storage stability than biochar. Best removals of tetracyclines and sulfonamides were obtained with immobilized-laccase systems coupled to ABTS or syringaldehyde. Immobilized-laccase/ABTS systems removed 100% of tetracyclines while only chlortetracycline was completely removed in the presence of syringaldehyde. With ABTS, the most effectively removed sulfonamides were sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine (up to 100% and 54%), while syringaldehyde best supported the removal of sulfanilamide, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole (up to 42%, 45% and 46%, respectively). In some cases, an effective antibiotics removal led to either low or no residual antibiotic activity.
   CONCLUSION MtL and PeL were immobilized successfully on biochar and stevensite. The addition of either ABTS or syringaldehyde enhanced significant removals, up to 100%, of tetracyclines and sulfonamides by the immobilized laccase systems. Noteworthy, biochar-immobilized laccases/ABTS led to complete suppression of the antibiotic activity of tetracyclines. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB BACKGROUND Nowadays, due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics, significant quantities have been detected in environmental samples. Therefore there is a need for a technology to eliminate the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in receiving water bodies. In recent years electrochemical oxidation showed superior efficiency for the purification of water from pharmaceuticals. RESULTS CONCLUSIONS boron doped diamond (BDD) showed better efficiency than platinum electrode and stainless steel for the degradation of 500 mu g L-1 tetracycline (TC) with 0.1 mol L-1 center dot Na2SO4. The presence of 200 mg L-1 bicarbonates decreased the apparent kinetic constant from 0.328 to 0212 min(-1). Instead, the addition of 200 mg L-1 NaCl increased the kinetic constant by almost four times, while the presence of 10 mg L-1 of humic acid decreased the kinetic constant by 18%. The process was favored in real environmental matrices like bottled water and wastewater in comparison with ultrapure water. The use of BDD as both anode and cathode enhanced the efficiency by almost 20%. The presence of UVA or solar radiation increased the decomposition of tetracycline by 14%. Changes in toxicity to Vibrio fisheri bacteria during treatment of TC in the secondary effluent are mainly attributed to the formation of intermediates of the water matrix itself and does not follow the TC removal. Electrochemical oxidation was favored for removal of TC in real water matrices due to the presence of chlorides. The use of BDD as both anode and cathode with simultaneous solar irradiation is a promising technology for water remediation from TC. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This study aims at investigating the photocatalytic treatment of bisphenol-A (BPA) under various irradiation sources in order to identify cleaner and more sustainable technologies compared to conventional photocatalytic wastewater treatment systems. For this purpose, parallel experimental runs were carried out in two batch-operated slurry photoreactors under UVA irradiation provided by either a light-emitting diode (UV-LED) or a UV blacklight lamp (UV-BL), as well as in a solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor under natural sunlight. The effect of key operating parameters, such as the initial BPA and TiO2 concentrations, water matrix, and treatment time, on the efficiency of the three photocatalytic systems was evaluated. The photocatalytic degradation of BPA was found to fit well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. BPA removal rate increased with catalyst concentration and with decreasing the initial concentration of BPA. The addition of humic acids was found to be inhibitory for all photocatalytic systems. At the best conditions assayed (C-0 = 2.5 mg/L, TiO2 250 mg/L), BPA was completely degraded within 20, 30, and 120 min under UV-LED, solar, and UV-BL irradiation, respectively. The corresponding reaction rates were 0.230, 0.151, and 0.025 min(-1), and TOC removal was 88, 67, and 33% after 90 min of treatment. In all cases. TiO2/UV-LED achieved the highest removal efficiency and it was found to be significantly more energy-efficient than the TiO2/UV-BL system. All in all, LED-driven photocatalysis was found to be advantageous over conventional TiO2/UV-BL systems in terms of performance and sustainability, and an appropriate alternative to solar photocatalysis in areas where sunlight is inadequate.

AB Treatment with non-thermal plasma (NTP) is a promisingmethod to remove potentially harmful pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent An application-oriented pilot-scale study was conducted to investigate the performance of an innovative process combining ultrafiltration (UF) and an NTP unit alternative to previously investigated thin-film designs. The studied NTP generator produces the plasma air separately and a specially designed turbine distributes the oxidizing species in the wastewater to be treated. The process was used for the treatment of effluents from a conventional activated sludge WWTP in Bad Reichenhall, Germany. Different set-ups in terms of hydraulic retention time and NTP composition (overall number of ions and ozone concentration) were tested to examine the removal efficiency of the target pharmaceuticals Diclofenac (DCF), Carbamazepine (CBM) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), as well as chemical and physical wastewater parameters. The reduction of DCF, CBM and SMX with optimal set-up was found to exceed 90% with initial concentrations in the WWTP effluent in the microgram per litre-range (0.80-15.15 mu g L-1). Traces of ozone in the range of 120/200 ppm within the NTP increased the overall performance of the process. Pre-treatment with UF removed fractions of pharmaceuticals and other oxidable substances, which led to a decrease in ozone demand and an enhancement of the overall removal efficiency of the process during varying influent loadings. Treatment via UF or NTP alone removed the pharmaceuticals by 46-67% and 54-71%, respectively, but did exceed the 90%-threshold. The studied NTP technology in combination with UF could be a viable as fourth treatment step, as it is highly energy-efficient, according to energy yield calculations, and larger amounts of wastewater can be treated.

AB Fibrous silica-titania (FST) catalysts were synthesized by microemulsion followed by silica seed-crystal crystallization methods under various molar ratios of toluene to water (T/W). The catalysts were characterized by XRD, UV-DRS, FESEM, TEM, AFM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR, and ESR. The results revealed that altering the T/W ratio affected the growth of the silica and titania and led to different size, fiber density, silica-titania structure, and number of hydroxyl groups, as well as oxygen vacancies in the FSTs, which altered their behavior toward subsequent application. Photodegradation of ibuprofen (IBP) are in the following order: FST(6:1) (90%) > FST(5:1) (84%) > FST(7:1) (79%) > commercial TiO2 (67%). A kinetics study using Langmuir-Hinshelwood model illustrated that the photodegradation followed the pseudo-first-order and adsorption was the rate-limiting step. Optimization by response surface methodology (RSM) showed that the pH, initial concentration, and catalyst dosage were the remarkable parameters in photodegradation of IBP. The FST (6:1) maintained its photocatalytic activities for up to five cycles reaction without serious catalyst deactivation, and was also able to degrade other endocrine-disrupting chemicals, indicating its potential use for the treatment of those chemicals in wastewater.

AB Microalgae is considered the most promising source of oils for biodiesel production. Beside microalgae contain proteins and pigments, which have large applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Combining the cultivation of microalgae for the production of these compounds with wastewater treatment renders the overall process very attractive and economically feasible. However, the selection of the most suitable application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment depends on the composition of the harvested microalgae. In the present work, the effectiveness of Chlorella sp. for the degradation of p-cresol have been evaluated at a concentration ranging from 35 to 330 mg/L. The effect of initial concentration on the contaminants removal, biomass productivity and the chemical composition of microalgae has been determined. Results shows that, Chlorella sp. can degrade p-cresol at concentration up to 330 mg/L, and use it for biomass growth. Biochemical assay showed an improvement in the lipid productivity at higher concentrations, combined with the reduction in the protein content. The highest pigment composition was obtained at the optimum biomass growth, at 150 mg/L. These results give deep understanding of the factors that must be considered when integrating wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications.

AB Three types of anaerobic granular sludge for treating chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater were compared: (1) an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) filled with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads (UASB-PVA); (2) a UASB filled with traditional anaerobic granular sludge; and (3) a UASB filled with traditional anaerobic granular sludge and granular active carbon (UASB-GAC). The domestication times for the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC reactors were 30, 47, and 47 days, respectively. When the organic loading rate (OLR) was up to 7 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/ (m(3).d), the COD efficiency of the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC stayed in the range of 69% to 75% (deviation 1.8%), 46% to 69% (deviation 8.6%), and 61% to 73% (deviation 4.0%), respectively. The highest OLRs reached for the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC were 12, 7, and 8 kg COD/(m(3).d), respectively. The performance of the UASB-PVA was the best of the three, the UASB-GAC was second, and the UASB was the worst. High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis showed that Levilinea, Syntrophorhabdus, Desulfovibrio and Acetobacterium were the dominant bacteria in the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC reactors' granular sludge. The abundance and diversity of the microbial community in the UASB-PVA sludge were higher than for the UASB and UASB-GAC granular sludge.

AB One of the current global issues of increasing environmental-health concern is the ubiquitous occurrence of emerging micropollutants (EMPs) in aquatic environments. Among these EMPs, bisphenol A (BPA), technical 4-nonylphenol (NP), tonalide (AHTN), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF) and galaxolide (HHCB) find their way into aquatic environments as a result of their ever increasing production and consumption coupled with their incomplete removal in conventional water and wastewater treatment plants. This study fabricated silicon dioxide (silica) (SiO2) and germanium dioxide (GeO2) embedded polyethersulfone (PES) blend membranes using phase inversion method for the removal of EMPs from water samples collected from North West Province, South Africa. The EMPs were extracted and enriched by auto-trace solid-phase extraction and analyzed using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). The fabricated membranes' permeation properties were determined by computing the pure water flux and EMPs' rejection. The water flux was observed to increase with increase in transmembrane pressure as well as increase in SiO2 and GeO2 nanoparticle loadings in the polymer matrices. Compared to the pristine PES, the contact angles for the SiO2/PES and GeO2/PES membranes were much lower, showing increased hydrophilicity of the membranes with increase in SiO2 and GeO2 nanoparticle loadings in the matrices. The mean EMPs' concentrations (ng/L) ranges in the feed were found to be: BPA (5.19 +/- 0.8 to 53.60 +/- 4.25), CAF (6.09 +/- 0.00 to 49.96 +/- 3.45), CBZ (0.68 +/- 0.00 to 3.06 +/- 0.74), HHCB (21.31 +/- 4.24 to 13.31 +/- 14.8), AHTN (8.31 +/- 2.23 to 141.82 +/- 21.70), and NP (0-174.99 +/- 14.5). Even though SiO2/PES membranes showed slightly higher EMPs' removal efficiencies than their GeO2/PES counterparts, both membranes showed the highest and lowest removal efficiencies range of 97.85-99.00% (for HHCB) and 87.42-93.00% (for CAF), respectively. The results showed superiority in capability of the fabricated nanocomposite membranes in removing EMPs from water.

AB Ten infrequently monitored antibiotics in biosolids were examined in archived American sewage sludges (n=79) collected as part of the 2006/2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey. This study inspected the occurrence of amoxicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone [ proxy metabolite: 3-(2-nitrobenzylidenamino)-2-oxazolidinone (NP-AOZ)], nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline, spiramycin, sulfadimidine, and sulfadimethoxine in sewage sludges after nearly a decade in frozen storage. Six antibiotics were detected at the following average concentrations (ng/g dry weight): amoxicillin (1.0), nalidixic acid (19.1), oxolinic acid (2.7), erythromycin (0.6), oxytetracycline (4.5), and ampicillin (14.8). The remaining four were not detected in any samples (bmethod detection limit, ng/g dry weight): sulfadimethoxine (<0.5), sulfadimidine (<1.0), spiramycin (<2.0), and NP-AOZ (<20.0). This study provides the first data on spiramycin, NP-AOZ, and nalidixic acid in U.S. sewage sludges.

AB Enantiomeric profiling was used in this study to investigate the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine in regional and urban Southeast Queensland, Australia over a period of seven years. S(+) methamphetamine was predominantly consumed in both urban and regional areas, showing a two and three fold increase in urban and regional catchments respectively between 2011 and 2017. The ratio of amphetamine to methamphetamine (AMP/METH) in waste water reflected the expected excretion profile of methamphetamine consumption indicating the presence of amphetamine in this study was primarily the result of methamphetamine metabolism. However, the occasional occurrence of R(-) amphetamine in samples containing higher AMP/METH ratios, suggested the consumption of racemic amphetamine. The R(-) methamphetamine enantiomer was also identified in several samples, possibly indicative that the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) synthesis process rather than the more typical reduction of ephedrines was also being used to manufacture methamphetamine. Furthermore, we identified two samples with a significantly different enantiomer ratio for the METH and AMP as well as a much lower AMP/METH concentration ratio suggesting contribution from direct disposal of methamphetamine into the sewer. This study demonstrated that enantiomeric profiling in waste water-based epidemiology can provide valuable information for evaluating the origin of amphetamine in waste water as either a metabolite of methamphetamine consumption or amphetamine itself.

AB Aquatic system contamination is a subject of concern due to the high number of contaminants with the potential to be hazardous for plant and animal species, including humans. A large number of analytical methods have been developed to evaluate the extension of water resource pollution, most of them focused on target residue analysis. Screening methods for potential target and non-target compounds are a potential alternative and could be used for a comprehensive evaluation of samples composition. Liquid chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-qTOF-MS/MS) was developed to provide full-spectrum data and high mass resolution with appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for monitoring of 300 pharmaceuticals and pesticides in environmental water samples. The validation was based on anti-doping analysis validation protocols, using three different concentration levels (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mu g L-1). Confirmation analysis was achieved using two fragment ions monitoring for each analyte. Samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-qTOF-MS/MS. The final method was able to detect 170 chemicals in wastewater treatment plant effluent and 198 chemicals in surface water. The advantage of using post-acquisition data processing provided by a qTOF-MS/MS system allowed for non-target analysis for an illicit drug metabolite determination. The method was successfully applied to real samples of wastewater and surface water.

AB The removal and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water treatment systems is of interest given the widespread occurrence of CECs in water supplies and increase in direct potable reuse of wastewater. In this study, CEC removal was investigated in pilot-scale biologically-active granular activated carbon (GAC)-sand and anthracite-sand filters under different hydraulic loading rates and influent CEC concentrations over a 15-month period. Eight of the most commonly detected compounds in a survey of CEC occurrence in drinking water were selected for this study: atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, metolachlor, sulfamethoxazole and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). GAC-sand biofilters provided superior CEC removal for all compounds (mean removal efficiencies: 49.1-94.4%) compared to anthracite-sand biofilters (mean removal efficiencies: 0-66.1%) due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation. Adsorption was determined to be the dominant removal mechanism for most selected CECs, except fluoxetine, which had the greatest biodegradation rate constant (0.93 0.15 min(-1) at 20-28 degrees C). The mean removal efficiency decreased by 16.5% when the loading rate increased from 2 to 4 gpm/ft(2) (4.88-9.76 m/h). A significant reduction in CEC removal was observed after 100,000 bed volumes when the influent CEC concentration was low (100-200 ng/L), whereas no significant reduction was observed during spike dosing (1000-3000 ng/L). A regression analysis suggested that biodegradation rate, hydraulic loading rate, influent CEC concentration, throughput, influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and CEC charge are important parameters for predicting CEC removal performance in GAC-sand biofilters.

AB The present study investigated the influence of electric field on the removal of quorum sensing (QS) and emerging contaminants using an electrochemical membrane bioreactor (eMBR). A significant reduction of N-octanoyl- L-homoserine lactone signal molecules (similar to 76%) was achieved in the eMBR, with respect to the level observed in the conventional MBR as the control. Furthermore, the intermittent electric current supply (0.5 mA/cm(2)) was found to be effective for the removal of atrazine and estrone. The degradation of key pharmaceutical compounds, such as diclofenac, carbamazepine, and amoxicillin, was also possible, confirming the applicability of the eMBR system for removing the priority chemical compounds of public health concern.

AB Knowledge on the sorption behavior of cationic organic substances in aquatic systems is vital for their risk assessment due to the increasing detection of such chemicals in the hydrosphere. Their sorption behavior is strongly influenced by sorption processes onto mineral surfaces (e.g., oxides, clays). To contribute to the development of prediction tools, the impact of sorbent characteristics on the sorption strength was studied in a highly-idealized model system. In addition to the properties of the solid phase, the concentration of other ions in direct competition for sorption sites and the molecular structure of the sorbate were changed to separate ion exchange and non-ion exchange processes. The study includes in total 120 systematic column experiments using five extensively characterized synthetic oxides (three silica gels, two aluminum oxides), three probe molecules (two structurally related cationic substances, one neutral compound), and four distinctively different NaCl concentrations. The results show that the concentration of OH groups on the sorbent surface is a meaningful descriptor for the observed variations in sorption capacity onto different oxides. Compound-specific linear correlations were obtained, enabling the prediction of sorption coefficients. In addition, a more complex sorption behavior of organic cations compared to uncharged molecules were observed as demonstrated by the sorption results at different electrolyte concentrations. Thus, the study provides an important step towards a better principal mechanistic understanding of organic cation sorption. However, further work using other sorbents including natural ones and other probe molecules is needed to verify the identified relationships within the scope of developing reliable prediction models for cation sorption.

AB In this study, the removal rates of eight anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic pharmaceuticals, AIAPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, codeine, indomethacin and propyphenazone) were assessed in a pilot-scale A(2)O system (including anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic zones), long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. qPCR was used to quantify the absolute abundances of total Bacteria, total Archaea, mycolic-acid containing filamentous Actinobacteria (Mycolata) and Fungi within the activated sludge microbial community developed in the system. Multivariate analyses and Spearman correlation coefficients were used in search of significant links among the removal rates of the AIAPs, the abundances of the targeted microbial groups in the activated sludge, and the changes of environmental/operating variables in the A(2)O system. Improved removal efficiencies of several of the AIAPs analyzed (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen) were correlated to higher organic load in the influent water, higher concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), lower temperature and lower food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M). Removal efficiencies of several pharmaceuticals correlated with increased abundances of Mycolata in the A(2)O system, pointing at this group of bacteria as candidate key players for AIAPs removal in activated sludge.

AB The presence of acetaminophen (APAP) in water and wastewater indicates its low susceptibility to conventional treatment. The application of new TiO2 nanocomposites containing pristine carbon nanotubes (MWCNT, 0.15-8.78 wt%) prepared by solgel method in acetaminophen removal from water was tested. The studied nanocomposites possessed a high surface area (348-421 m(2).g(-1)) with uniform framework-confined mesopores (primary mesopores) with an average pore width of about 3 nm. TiO2 was present as anatase with crystal size similar to 5-6 nm. The nanocomposites had an exposed more graphitized MWCNT surface with a lower content of C-O and O=C-O- surface groups.
   The addition of MWCNT reduced the band gap of TiO2 from 3.2 eV to 2.82 eV. Dark adsorption resulted in insignificant changes in APAP concentration. The greatest changes in APAP concentration during Vis irradiation over the tested nanocomposites were observed using CNT10 (Fig. 108). The highest efficiency was exhibited by the nanocomposite containing 1.72 wt% of MWCNT that enabled 81.6 +/- 0.6% removal of APAP from water. Generally, an increase of MWCNT concentration up to 1.72 wt% in the nanocomposites induced APAP removal. The nanocomposites possessing higher MWCNT addition were, however, not so efficient (63.2 +/- 2.4% and 62.2 +/- 4.2% removal). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of different nanocomposites is observed only in the narrow range. The obtained results confirmed that photogenerated holes and, to a lower extent, O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot radicals played the key role in photocatalytic APAP removal over MWCNT-TiO2-SiO2. The studies using Vibrio fischeri have confirmed that photocatalytic oxidation is an effective method for reducing water toxicity.

AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have become material of special attention due to their high porosity and large surface area. Adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride using MOFs from aqueous waste and real wastewater has been studied in this work. The MOF-5 synthesized showed higher adsorption capacity as compared to activated charcoal. The adsorption satisfies the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and adsorption isotherm is very well explained by the Freundlich and the Sips isotherm. The adsorption mechanism may be explained by the electrostatic interactions of the pharmaceutical compounds and the MOF-5 surface. Finally, it can be concluded that MOF-5 has shown a great potential for their application in wastewater treatment technology development.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a multifunctional environmental technology capable of supporting plant and wildlife communities and removing excess nutrients and other pollutants. Tertiary treatment wetlands have also been proposed as one solution to remove persistent pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that remain after conventional wastewater treatment. Though aquatic wildlife is generally sensitive to environmental contaminants, it is unknown whether CWs can serve dual purposes supporting wildlife habitat and polishing wastewater. Our objective was to assess the capacity of a newly established CW for tertiary wastewater treatment to support amphibians. Specifically, we assessed adult anuran occupancy and tadpole and adult body size and condition relative to nearby unimpacted ponds. We found that a diverse community of adult anurans rapidly colonized the wetlands where successful reproduction was documented. Adult frogs and tadpoles were observed to have variable sizes among ponds with some life stages in better body condition at the tertiary treatment wetlands. Preliminary investigations suggest that tertiary treatment wetlands provide habitat for successful colonization and reproduction of anurans, but carryover effects need to be evaluated to determine if tertiary treatment wetlands serve as sinks or suitable habitat that supports stable populations.

AB The contamination of freshwater systems arises in many river basins due to industrialization and population growth, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Despite these concerns, the fate and potential impact of many emerging pollutants are currently unknown, especially when the compounds are released into surface waters from populations distributed across large spatial scales. In order to address this shortcoming, a spatially-explicit contaminant fate model was developed as an extension of the global, vector-based river routing model HydroROUT. HydroROUT operates at very high spatial resolution (similar to 500 m), simulates river and stream chemical transport with in-stream removal, and contains links to a set of lakes and reservoirs, which act as a partial sink during the transport. The chemical fate model was applied to China and includes a consumption and release module based on county-level population demographics, considers point-source contributions from 2547 wastewater treatment plants, and accumulates contributions of rural and urban populations not connected to sewage treatment plants. As a case study, the sources and fates of the estrogens estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3), as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were modelled in Chinese surface water bodies. Preliminary validation of the results showed predictions to be within the ranges of concentrations reported in literature, with exception of EE2. The total estrogenic mass in the entire river and lake system amounted to 370 tonnes of estrogens, with about 1.3 tonnes per year discharged to the ocean, neighboring countries or to inland sinks. Under a selected baseline scenario, eco-toxicological risk - i.e., contaminant concentrations in excess of the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) - is found in 23.6% of all analyzed rivers of China with an average flow > 0.1 m(3)/s. Out of these, about 4% of rivers showed a high level of risk of 10 times or more above PNEC. Medium-to-large rivers are disproportionally affected; for example, 23.6%, 37.3%, 29.0% and 21.6% of river length are at risk in rivers of 1-10, 10-100, 100-1,000, and 1,000-10,000 m(3)/s of discharge, respectively, whereas no risk was predicted in the largest rivers (i.e., >10,000 m(3)/s) of China. Wastewater treatment plants process 22.5% of the total hormone load and thus play an important role in water quality control by reducing the risk in substantial portions of the river network, which would otherwise show elevated risk. Releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Achromobacter denitrificans PR1 has previously shown potential to degrade the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, whereby sulfamethoxazole biotransformation was stimulated in the presence of biogenic substrates. This study examined the biotransformation kinetics of sulfamethoxazole and its two main conjugates, N-4-acetyl-SMX and SMX-N-1-Glucuronide, by activated sludge and activated sludge bioaugmented with A. denitrificans PR1. SMX biotransformation under both anoxic and aerobic conditions was tested, with and without the addition of acetate as growth substrate, to understand the range of applicable conditions for bioaugmentation purposes. Biological process models, such as the pseudo-first order kinetic and cometabolic models, were also applied and, following the estimation of kinetic parameters, could well describe data measured in bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented AS batch experiments under various test conditions. Experimental and modelling results suggest that (i) retransformation of the two conjugates to SMX in AS occurred under both aerobic and anoxic conditions, and (ii) biotransformation kinetics of SMX can vary significantly depending on redox conditions, e.g., SMX was biotransformed by AS only under aerobic conditions. Notably, SMX biotransformation was significantly enhanced when PR1 was bioaugmented in AS. Addition of acetate as biogenic substrate is not necessary, as PR1 was capable of enhancing the SMX biotransformation by using the carbon sources present in wastewater. Overall, bioaugmentation by means of A. denitrificans PR1 could be a viable strategy for enhancing SMX removal in AS wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

AB In this study, a forward osmosis coupled with electrochemical oxidation (FO-EO) process was used to achieve simultaneous rejection and degradation of 15 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. The influence of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) on PhACs removal was investigated. Sodium alginate (SA), humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as model organics to represent major constituents of EfOM. Results demonstrated that a generally negative influence of SA on PhACs rejection was observed due to membrane fouling in FO processes. During FO-EO processes, high rejection ( > 95%) and degradation efficiencies ( > 94%) of 15 PhACs were achieved simultaneously. With the presence of model organics in feed, adverse impacts on PhACs degradation were observed in the order of HA > BSA > SA. Results of UV and EEM fluorescence spectroscopy detection verified the competition of EfOM with PhACs for electrochemical oxidation, further proving the role of natural organic matter (NOM) and proteins in impeding the PhACs removal in FO-EO processes. Moreover, degradation products of PhACs were identified. And the acute toxicity of the feed was decreased after treated by FO-EO processes although the mineralization of PhACs was partially achieved. Furthermore, PhACs in actual secondary effluent were well removed by FO-EO processes, exhibiting a desirable application performance.

AB Acetaminophen (Ace) is a trace pollutant widely found in sewage treatment plant (STP) wastewater. We test the feasibility of coconut shell waste, a low cost adsorbent from coconut industry, for removing Ace from synthetic solution in a fixed-bed column adsorption. To enhance its performance, the surface of granular activated carbon (GAC) was pre-treated with NaOH, HNO3, ozone, and/or chitosan respectively. The results show that the chemical modification of the GAC's surface with various chemicals has enhanced its Ace removal during the column operations. Among the modified adsorbents, the ozone-treated GAC stands out for the highest Ace adsorption capacity (38.2 mg/g) under the following conditions: 40 mg/L of Ace concentration, 2 mL/min of flow rate, 45 cm of bed depth. Both the Thomas and the Yoon-Nelson models are applicable to simulate the experimental results of the column operations with their adsorption capacities: ozone-treated GAC (20.88 mg/g) > chitosancoated GAC (16.67 mg/g) > HNO3-treated GAC (11.09 mg/g) > NaOH-treated GAC (7.57 mg/g) > as-received GAC (2.84 mg/g). This suggests that the ozone-treated GAC is promising and suitable for Ace removal in a fixed-bed reactor.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of nine pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, caffeine, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, diclofenac, nitrofurazone, sulfamethoxazole. and triclosan) and to evaluate potential risks (human health and ecotoxicological) in Lui, Gombak and Selangor (Malaysia) rivers using commercial competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit assays. Physicochemical properties of these rivers showed the surface samples belong to Class II of Malaysian National Water Quality Standards which requires conventional treatment before consumption. All the pharmaceuticals were detected in all three rivers except for triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac which were not detected in few of sampling locations in these three rivers. Highest pharmaceutical concentrations were detected in Gombak river in line of being as one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were detected in all the sampling locations with the highest at 299.88 ng/L. While triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac concentrations were not detected in a few of sampling locations in these three rivers. All these nine pharmaceuticals were within the levels reported previously in literature. Pharmaceutical production, wastewater treatment technologies and treated sewage effluent were found as the potential sources which can be related with pharmaceuticals occurrence in surface water samples. Potential human risk assessment showed low health risk except for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone. Instead, ecotoxicological risk assessment indicated moderate risks were present for these rivers. Nevertheless, results confirmation using instrumental techniques is needed for higher degree of specificity. It is crucial to continuously monitor the surface water bodies for pharmaceuticals using a cost- effective prioritisation approach to assess sensitive sub-populations risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, the presence of 20 pharmaceuticals in wastewater from Colombia is investigated. Several widely consumed compounds have been detected in wastewater samples from different origins and geographical areas in Colombia. The studied pharmaceuticals included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering stain drugs, lipid regulators, and anti-depressants. The investigated samples were urban wastewater collected during one whole week before (influent) and after treatment (effluent) in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Bogota and Medellin. Raw wastewater from the Hospital of Tumaco and from the city of Florencia were also collected. Analyses performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that most of the target analytes were present in all the wastewater samples. The highest concentrations (up to 50 mu g/L) corresponded to acetaminophen, but several antibiotics, such as azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and antihypertensive drugs, such as losartan and valsartan, were commonly present in influent wastewater (IWW) at levels above 1 mu g/L. Moreover, the treatment applied in WWTPs seemed to not efficiently remove the compounds under study, because most pharmaceuticals were also present in effluent wastewater (EWW) at concentrations close to those of the IWW. Special emphasis was made in this work on the quality of data reported, performing a detailed study of quality control (QC) samples. The analytical approach used -direct injection of 5-fold diluted samples without any additional treatment - is simpler and faster than the commonly applied solid phase extraction (SPE). The use of 12 isotope-labelled internal standards ensured the satisfactory correction of matrix effects for the corresponding analytes. For the remaining 8 compounds, no drastic matrix effects were observed, and only four compounds (cloxacillin, doxycydine, losartan, tetracycline) presented QC recoveries near or slightly below 60%, revealing ionization suppression, particularly in the IWW. Data on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals reported in this paper are the basis for current studies that aim to develop efficient systems for the degradation/removal of these compounds from the aquatic environment.

AB Infiltration of treated wastewater (IWW) to recharge depleted aquifers, often referred to as managed aquifer recharge, is a solution to replenish groundwater resources in regions facing water scarcity. We present a mass balance approach to infer the amounts of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen) degraded in column experiments based on concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous and solid (sorbed) phases. Column experiments were conducted under three different conditions: continuous infiltration, wetting and drying cycles, and wetting and drying cycles with elevated concentrations of antibiotics (which may reduce microbially aided degradation of other compounds). A mass balance comparing pharmaceutical mass in the water phase over the 16-month duration of the experiments to mass sorbed to the soil was used to infer the mass of pharmaceuticals degraded. Results show sorption as the main attenuation mechanism for carbamazepine. About half of the mass of didofenac was degraded with wetting and drying cycles, but no significant degradation was found for continuous infiltration, while 32% of infiltrated mass sorbed. Fenoprofen was degraded in the shallow and aerobic part of the soil, but degradation appeared to cease beyond 27 cm depth. Gemfibrozil attenuated through a combination of degradation and sorption, with slight increases in attenuation with depth from both mechanisms. Naproxen degraded progressively with depth, resulting in attenuation of >90% of the mass. In the column with elevated concentrations of antibiotics, the antibiotics attenuated to about 50% or less of inflow concentrations by 27 an depth and within this zone, less degradation of the other compounds was observed.

AB Antibiotics are widely used in human medicine and veterinary production. Residues of these compounds reach the water sources through waste or direct application (e.g. aquaculture). The constant input of the parent drugs and their transformation products into the environment leads these pharmaceuticals to be considered as emerging pollutants. For some molecules, the pathway of degradation and formation in products is less known. To assess the impact of these substances in the environment and in the human health, it is necessary to elucidate the transformation products and their kinetic of degradation to evaluate the possible risks. In the present report, the characterization and the degradation kinetic of two widely used beta-lactams antibiotics - amoxidllin and ampidllin - was evaluated. Surface water samples containing these antibiotics were submitted to photolysis and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with Orbitrap detection in order to establish the profile of degradation and the formation of transformation products. Results showed that the degradation of amoxicillin and ampicillin is almost complete and reach their maximum at 48 h in river water. Moreover, a database containing >65 transformation products of amoxicillin and ampicillin was build and real samples of industrial wastewater were analyzed to investigate the occurrence of amoxicillin, ampicillin and their transformation products.
