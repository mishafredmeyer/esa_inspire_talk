AB This study assessed the potential of ozone for the degradation of nine commonly used veterinary antibiotics (five sulfonamides, three tetracyclines, and one macrolide) in swine wastewater pretreated by sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The apparent second-order rate constants for the reactions of selected antibiotics toward ozone in Milli-Q water (k(O3) at pH 7.0 and T = 20 degrees C) were determined by competition kinetics as follows: sulfonamides [(1.9-6.2) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)], tetracyclines (6.9 x 10(6) to 1.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1)), and tiamulin (3.8 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The antibiotics could be quickly degraded by ozone in the SBR effluent with degradation rates following the order of their k(O3) values. In the SBR effluent, the dissolved organic materials strongly competed for oxidants against antibiotics, while the suspended solids had insignificant influence on antibiotics degradation. The reaction mechanism was primarily direct oxidation via ozone rather than indirect oxidation via hydroxyl radicals. Overall, ozonation is a feasible polishing process, subsequent to biological treatment, for removal of residual antibiotics from swine wastewater. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000404.

Degradation of the studied antibiotic wastewater by direct photolysis indicated that, without application of additional factors, the process is not very effective, transferring the fate of antibiotics to the environment. For the studied antibiotic, wastewater ozonation was found to be the most effective among the three tested AOPs.

AB This study investigates the fate of trace organic chemicals (TrOCs) in three full-scale reclamation plants using ozonation followed by biological activated carbon (BAG) filtration to treat wastewater treatment plant effluents. Chemical analysis was used to quantify a wide range of TrOCs and combined with bioanalytical tools to assess non-specific toxicity (Microtox assay) and estrogenicity (E-SCREEN assay). Limited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal (<10%) was observed in the ozonation stages showing that oxidation leads to the formation of transformation products rather than mineralization. The quantified TrOCs were removed to a degree highly dependent on the compounds' structures and the specific ozone dose (mg(O3) mg(DOC)(-1)). Non-specific toxicity was reduced by 31-39%, demonstrating that the mixture of remaining parent compounds and their transformation products as well as newly formed oxidation by-products had an overall lower toxic potential than the mixture of parent compounds. Estrogenicity was reduced by more than 87% indicating that the transformation products of the estrogenic chemicals lost their specific toxicity potential. The subsequent BAG filtration removed between 20 and 50% of the DOG depending on the plant configuration, likely due to biodegradation of organic matter. The filtration was also able to reduce the concentrations of most of the remaining TrOCs by up to 99%, and reduce non-specific toxicity by 33-54%. Overall, the combination of ozonation and BAG filtration can achieve removals of 50% for DOC and more than 90% for a wide range of TrOCs as well as a reduction of 70% of non-specific toxicity and more than 95% of estrogenicity. This process combination is therefore suggested as an effective barrier to reduce the discharge of TrOCs into the environment or their presence in water recycling schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simultaneous analysis of 11 free estrogen hormones and five conjugated estrogens in water and municipal wastewater was studied. The analytical method was developed and tested for different types of solid-phase extraction adsorbents, eluents, sample containers and storage conditions, derivatization, and matrix effects. Varian Bond Elut C-18 solid-phase extraction adsorbent cartridge was selected based on its high recoveries for both free and conjugated estrogens. Sample storage conditions, as well as selection and pretreatment of sample container materials, can affect the trace level analysis of estrogens. Silanization of glassware is observed to provide low relative standard deviation (RSD) in the analysis and less percentage loss due to contacting with sample container materials. Light exposure during the test can significantly impact the results. The derivatized samples stored at -20A degrees C for at least 6 days showed less than 10.5% average RSD in the analysis. The recovery efficiency in clean water varies from 72% to 101% for free estrogens and 78% to 82% for conjugated estrogens. The method detection limits (MDL) for most of the compounds range from 30 to 870 ng/L using a sample volume of 200 mL. With a sample volume of 3 L, the most sensitive compound produces a MDL of 0.03 ng/L. Dilute methanol is used to wash the loaded cartridge as a cleanup step in order to remove interfering species during analysis of wastewater samples. Using the optimized analytical methods, the concentration level of free estrogens in the influent and effluent municipal wastewaters is tested.

AB Titanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system and, subsequently, enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids. This study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products, derives estimates of human exposure to dietary (nano-) TiO2, and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of TiO2 entering the environment. The foods with the highest content of TiO2 included candies, sweets, and chewing gums. Among personal care products, toothpastes and select sunscreens contained 1% to >10% titanium by weight. While some other cremes contained titanium, despite being colored white, most shampoos, deodorants, and shaving creams contained the lowest levels of titanium (<0.01 mu g/mg). For several high-consumption pharmaceuticals, the titanium content ranged from below the instrument detection limit (0.0001 mu g Ti/mg) to a high of 0.014 mu g Ti/mg. Electron microscopy and stability testing of food-grade TiO2 (E171) suggests that approximately 36% of the particles are less than 100 nm in at least one dimension and that it readily disperses in water as fairly stable colloids. However, filtration of water solubilized consumer products and personal care products indicated that less than 5% of the titanium was able to pass through 0.45 or 0.7 mu m pores. Two white paints contained 110 mu g Ti/mg while three sealants (i.e., prime coat paint) contained less titanium (25 to 40 mu g Ti/mg). This research showed that, while many white-colored products contained titanium, it was not a prerequisite. Although several of these product classes contained low amounts of titanium, their widespread use and disposal down the drain and eventually to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) deserves attention. A Monte Carlo human exposure analysis to TiO2 through foods identified children as having the highest exposures because TiO2 content of sweets is higher than other food products and that a typical exposure for a US adult may be on the order of 1 mg Ti per kilogram body weight per day. Thus, because of the millions of tons of titanium-based white pigment used annually, testing should focus on food-grade TiO2 (E171) rather than that adopted in many environmental health and safety tests (i.e., P25), which is used in much lower amounts in products less likely to enter the environment (e.g., catalyst supports, photocatalytic coatings).

AB Chemical-biological degradation of a widely spread antibacterial (nalidixic acid) was successfully obtained by an integrated membrane bioreactor (MBR)-ozonation process. The composition of the treated solution simulated the wastewater from the production of the target pharmaceutical, featuring high salinity and a relevant concentration of sodium acetate. Aim of treatment integration was to exploit the synergistic effects of chemical oxidation and bioprocesses, by adopting the latter to remove most of the COD and the ozonation biodegradable products. Integration was achieved by placing ozonation in the recirculation stream of the bioreactor effluent. The recirculation flow rate was three-fold the MBR feed. and the performance of the integrated system was compared to the standard polishing configuration (single ozonation step after the MBR). Results showed that the introduction of the ozonation step did not cause relevant drawbacks to both biological and filtration processes. nalidixic acid passed undegraded through the MBR and was completely removed in the ozonation step. Complete degradation of most of the detected ozonation products was better achieved with the integrated MBR-ozonation process than using the sequential treatment configuration, i.e. ozone polishing after MBR, given the same ozone dosage.

AB While the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in groundwater has typically been reported in bank filtration sites, irrigated fields, septic tanks, and sewage disposal practices, fewer studies have been conducted in highly urbanized areas, where infiltration of treated or untreated sewage is not supposed to be a source of groundwater recharge. Furthermore, little is known about the occurrence of various kinds of PPCPs in relation to microbial indicators in groundwater from different types of aquifers. Thus, we examined the city-wide occurrence of selected PPCPs (diethyltoluamide, crotamiton, ethenzamide, propyphenazone, carbamazepine, and caffeine) and E. coli in 50 groundwaters from unconfined aquifers (<30 m in depth) and confined aquifers (up to 500 m in depth) in Tokyo, where unintended groundwater contamination could take place due to decrepit sewer networks. PPCPs were detected in unconfined aquifers and springs (23/34 samples, 68%), and in confined aquifers (7/16 samples, 44%). Compared with published results for sewage influents, concentrations of PPCPs, excluding caffeine, were generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower, while in some samples concentrations were quite comparable. The high occurrence rate of PPCPs, even in confined aquifers, indicated that such aquifers are not always protected from pollution by sewage near the land surface. Among the PPCPs analyzed, carbamazepine and crotamiton were most frequently detected, which would appear to be owing to their high persistence, combined with the high concentration of crotamiton in sewage. Crotamiton was detected in all four E. coli-positive groundwaters, and thus may potentially serve as a precautionary indicator of E. coli contamination. Using carbamazepine as a sewage marker, we estimated that 0.8%-1.7% of the dry-weather flow of sewage was leaking out into the unconfined aquifers.

AB A pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was installed and operated for one year at a Swiss hospital. It was fed an influent directly from the hospital's sanitary collection system. To study the efficiency of micropollutant elimination in raw hospital wastewater that comprises a complex matrix with micropollutant concentrations ranging from low ng/L to low mg/L, an automated online SPE-HPLC-MS/MS analytical method was developed. Among the 68 target analytes were the following: 56 pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, antimycotics, antivirals, iodinated X-ray contrast media, antiinflamatory, cytostatics, diuretics, beta blockers, anesthetics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antidepressants, and others), 10 metabolites, and 2 corrosion inhibitors. The MBR influent contained the majority of those target analytes. The micropollutant elimination efficiency was assessed through continuous flow-proportional sampling of the MBR influent and continuous time-proportional sampling of the MBR effluent. An overall load elimination of all pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the MBR was 22%, as over 80% of the load was due to persistent iodinated contrast media. No inhibition by antibacterial agents or disinfectants from the hospital was observed in the MBR. The hospital wastewater was found to be a dynamic system in which conjugates of pharmaceuticals deconjugate and biological transformation products are formed, which in some cases are pharmaceuticals themselves.

AB This study examined effects of ozonation on thirteen fluoroquinolone, macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics present in municipal wastewater. Transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) caused by ozonation were characterized using absorbance/fluorescence spectroscopy and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Concentrations of aldehydes and carboxylic acids generated via the oxidation of EfOM were also determined. The absorbance and fluorescence of ozonated wastewater decreased with increasing ozone dose or treatment time. HPSEC data showed that these phenomena corresponded to the oxidation of all EfOM fractions, with some preference towards the degradation of the EfOM molecules with high apparent molecular weight. The removal of antibiotics and production of aldehydes and carboxylic acids were strongly correlated with the changes in both EfOM absorbance and fluorescence. Applications of a model describing the concurrent degradation of trace level contaminants and relative changes of EfOM emission allowed achieving a good fitting between the experimental and modeled Delta C/C-0 vs. Delta A/A(0) and Delta C/C-0, vs. Delta F/F-0 data.

AB The behaviour and effects of atorvastatin (ATO), carbamazepine (CBZ), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated in spiked lake sediments, at concentrations up to 56.5 mg kg(-1) dry weight (dw), with the benthic invertebrates Chironomus dilutus and Hyalella azteca. Desorption constants were calculated in the presence and absence of animals, using linear isotherms, yielding K-d values of 28.2, 189.0 and 125.1 L kg(-1) (ATO), 73.7, 201.7 and 263.2 L kg(-1) (CBZ), and 114.9, 114.2 and 519.2 L kg(-1) (EE2) for C. dilutus, H. azteca, and without animals, respectively. For ATO and CBZ, K-d values were smaller in the presence of C dilutus, indicating greater desorption to the overlying water from bioturbation, which is consistent with the predominantly benthic occurrence of C. dilutus compared to H. azteca. In contrast, due to its greater hydrophobicity, bioturbation did not significantly affect desorption of EE2. No significant toxicity was observed, indicating decreased bioavailability of the chemicals sorbed to sediments compared with water-only toxicity assays. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, removal efficiency and seasonal variation of 22 antibiotics, including eight fluoroquinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, were investigated in eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Beijing, China. A total of 14 antibiotics were detected in wastewater samples, with the maximum concentration being 3.1 ug L-1 in the influent samples and 1.2 mu g L-1 in the effluent samples. The most frequently detected antibiotics were ofloxacin, norfloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and roxithromycin; of these, the concentration of ofloxacin was the highest in most of the influent and effluent samples. Eighteen antibiotics were detected in the sludge samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10(-1) to 2.1 x 104 mu g kg(-1). The dominant antibiotics found in the sludge samples were the fluoroquinolones, with ofloxacin having the highest concentration in all the sludge samples. The antibiotics could not be removed completely by the STPs, and the mean removal efficiency ranged from -34 to 72%. Of all the antibiotics, the fluoroquinolones were removed comparatively more efficiently, probably due to their adsorption to sludge. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in the sludge samples was also studied. The concentrations of antibiotics in winter were higher than in spring and autumn. Since the total levels of the fluoroquinolones detected in the influent samples were lower than the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 8.0 mu g L-1, the residues of these antibiotics would be unlikely to have adverse effects on microorganisms involved in sewage treatment processes.

AB In this study, photo-Fenton oxidation was applied to degradation of sulfamonomethoxine sodium (SMMS) in aqueous solution. The operation parameters of pH, temperature, and concentrations of H2O2, Fe2+ and SMMS were investigated. The optimum conditions for the photo-Fenton process were determined as follows: [SMMS]=4.53 mg/L, pH 4.0, [H2O2]=0.49 mmol/L, [Fe2+]=19.51 mu mol/L and T=25 degrees C. Under these conditions 98.5% of the SMMS degraded. The kinetics were also studied, and degradation of SMMS by the photo-Fenton process could be described by first-order kinetics. The apparent activation energy was calculated as 23.95 kJ/mol. Mineralization of the process was investigated by measuring the chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the COD decreased by 99% after 120 min. This process could be used as a pretreatment method for wastewater containing sulfamonomethoxine sodium.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are commonly considered as the main source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters. Here, however, we show that an open-air festival, attracting approximately 10 000 visitors per year at the shores of River Fyris upstream of Uppsala WWTP, can temporarily result in a higher pharmaceutical input into the river water than the WWTP. Studying the influence of Uppsala Reggae festival on the occurrence of ten commonly used acidic and basic pharmaceuticals upstream, in the effluent, and downstream of the Uppsala WWTP, we found that occasional heavy rainfalls during the festival in 2008 severely increased the mass flows of all pharmaceuticals at the WWTP upstream site. Also, strong increases in ammonium (210-fold), nitrate (21-fold), and total nitrogen (21-fold) mass flows were observed. The pharmaceutical mass flows at the upstream site were up to 3.4 times higher than those observed in the WWTP effluent. In contrast, in 2009, the festival was not accompanied with rainfalls and no major additional input of pharmaceuticals and nitrogen was observed. The findings of this study give new insights into risk assessments and are relevant for monitoring programmes.

AB Cocoon cooking wastewater contains waste silkworm proteins including sericin, which is a valuable raw material for many industries including cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Sericin can be recovered via nanofiltration (NF) with high efficiency; however the process conditions need to be optimized to maximize separation. In this study, the effect of solution pH on NF performance was investigated for separation of silkworm proteins towards sericin enrichment. Solution pH (3.5-9.0) slightly influenced sericin rejection, which was higher than 80% in all cases. On the other hand, solution pH significantly influenced transmission of contaminant proteins, which was highest (0.52) at pH 3.5 and lowest (0.06) at pH 9.0. Increased transmission of contaminant proteins at acidic pH was attributed to possible effects of concentration polarization and increased ionic strength. Although acidic conditions (pH 4.5) favored sericin enrichment, the instantaneous purity of sericin in the retentate remained at 0.48-0.52 at pH 3.5-9.0. Furthermore, working at acidic pH caused severe fouling problems; more than threefold increase occurred in flux decline; with an increase of flux decline from 20% to 69% and fouling resistance from 3.8 x 10(13) m(-1) to 15.5 x 10(13) m(-1) (almost fourfold) when pH was reduced from 6.4 to 4.5. The contribution of fouling resistance to total resistance increased from 32-40% (pH 6.4) to 70% and 53% in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Concentrating the wastewater at pH 4.5 had adverse impacts on rejection performance of NF membrane; rejection of sericin and contaminant proteins decreased from 78% to 52% and from 33% to 9%, respectively, as volume reduction factor increased from 1.00 to 1.70. Correspondingly, sericin purity in the retentate decreased from 0.59 to 0.55. The pH adjustment had no benefit for separation of sericin from contaminant proteins, and hence it was decided not to apply pH adjustment in NF stage. Instead, a two-stage process, NF (at original pH of 6.4) plus ethanol-induced precipitation were adopted, which enabled enrichment of sericin 1 from 80.0% to 92.9%. The product was considered to be of high quality as it contained greater than 90% sericin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in waters at low levels is a concern due to its ability to act as an endocrine disruptor. Ozone (O-3) is commonly used in water treatment and reacts with EE2 to form by-products having characteristics that are mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the by-products of E2 and EE2 ozonation and determine their estrogenicity and toxicity relative to the parent compound. Ozonation by-products were identified via LC-MS analysis. The estrogenicity was measured using the YES assay, and toxicity was determined by monitoring effects on histology of fetal rat testes and testosterone secretion by these tissues. Two EE2 by-products were identified with open phenolic ring structures (masses 302 and 344 u). The Yeast Estrogen Screening (YES) assay showed a decreased but incomplete removal of estrogenicity after ozonation of EE2. Histological analysis of fetal testes revealed that neither E2 nor EE2, with or without ozonation, had any effect on seminiferous cord formation; however, a remarkable negative effect on testosterone secretion was observed, with EE2 by-products after ozonation showing the most rapid and extensive inhibition. These results show that the removal of EE2 via reaction with O-3 resulted in the formation of by-products that are less estrogenic (as demonstrated by the YES assay), but have a greater negative impact on testosterone secretion. Thus, the disappearance of the parent compound is not a sufficient endpoint, as the by-products created may be more toxic. Care should be taken when implementing oxidation applications such as ozone during waste water treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study considers the implications and research needs arising from anticancer (also referred to as antineoplastic) drugs being released into the aquatic environment, for the entire therapeutic classes used: cytotoxic, cytostatic and endocrine therapy drugs.
   A categorization approach, based on French consumption amounts, allowed to highlight parent molecules and several metabolites on which further occurrence and ecotoxicological studies should be conducted.
   Investigations of consumption trends at a national and a local scale show an increase in the use of anticancer drugs between 2004 and 2008, thus leading to increased levels released in the environment. It therefore appears necessary to continue surveying their presence in surface waters and in wastewater treatment plant (WWIP)) effluents.
   Furthermore, due to the rise of anticancer home treatments, most of the prescribed molecules are now available in town pharmacies. Consequently, hospital effluents are no longer the main expected entry route of anticancer drugs into the aquatic environment.
   Concerning ecotoxicological risks, current knowledge remains insufficient to support a definitive conclusion. Risk posed by cytotoxic molecules is still not well documented and it is not possible to conclude on their long-term effects on non-target organisms. To date, ecotoxicological effects have been assessed using standardized or in vitro assays. Such tests however may not be suitable for anticancer drugs, and further work should focus on full-life cycle or even multigenerational tests.
   Environmental significance (i.e. occurrence and effects) of cytostatics (protein kinases inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies), if any, is not documented. Protein kinases inhibitors, in particular, deserve further investigation due to their universal mode of action.
   Finally, concerning endocrine therapy drugs, molecules such as antiestrogen Tamoxifen and its active metabolites. could be of concern.
   Overall, to accurately assess the ecotoxicological risk of anticancer drugs, we discuss the need to break away from tests on isolated molecules and to test effects of mixtures at the low ng.l(-1) range. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The antiviral agent oseltamivir acid (OA, the active metabolite of Tamiflu) may occur at high concentrations in wastewater during pandemic influenza events. To eliminate OA and its antiviral activity from wastewater, ozonation and advanced oxidation processes were investigated. For circumneutral pH, kinetic measurements yielded second-order rate constants of 1.7 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) and 4.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for the reaction of OA with ozone and hydroxyl radical, respectively. During the degradation of OA by both oxidants, the antiviral activity of the treated aqueous solutions was measured by inhibition of neuraminidase activity of two different viral strains. A transient, moderate (two-fold) increase in antiviral activity was observed in solutions treated up to a level of 50% OA transformation, while for higher degrees of transformation the activity corresponded to that caused exclusively by OA. OA was efficiently removed by ozonation in a wastewater treatment plant effluent, suggesting that ozonation can be applied to remove OA from wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The groundwater downstream of a former sewage irrigation farm in Berlin is contaminated with ammonium (NH4 (+)) and para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), besides other anthropogenic pollutants. In the field, in situ removal of NH4 (+) by gaseous oxygen (O-2) and air injection is currently being tested. A laboratory column experiment using aquifer material and groundwater from the site was performed to determine whether this remediation technology is also feasible to reduce high p-TSA concentrations in the anoxic groundwater. First, the column was operated under anoxic conditions. Later, compressed air was introduced into the system to simulate oxic conditions. Samples were collected from the column outlet before and after the addition of compressed air. The experiment revealed that whereas p-TSA was not removed under anoxic conditions, it was almost fully eliminated under oxic conditions. Results were modelled using a transient one-dimensional solute transport model. The degradation rate constants for p-TSA increased from 2.8E-06 to 7.5E-05 s(-1) as a result of microbial adaption to the change of redox conditions. Results show that O-2 injection into an anoxic aquifer is a successful strategy for p-TSA remediation.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are known to be a source of surface water contamination by organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals. The objective of the present work was to study the suitability of the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) to monitor beta-blockers and hormones in effluents and surface waters. Four sampling campaigns were carried out in French rivers (the Saone, the Ardieres, the Bourbre, and the Seine) between November 2007 and September 2008. Passive samplers were exposed in surface waters, upstream and downstream of WWTP outflows, and in effluents. Exposures lasted for up to 24d to study the uptake kinetics directly in situ, and repeatability was assessed by exposure of triplicates. A good agreement was found between POCIS and water samples. With the exception of atenolol, beta-blockers showed a linear uptake during at least three weeks, and their sampling rates could be determined in situ. These sampling rates were then used to calculate time-weighted average concentrations of beta-blockers in the Seine River with an overall good accuracy and repeatability. Such calculations could not be performed for hormones because of their variable occurrences and low concentrations in water and POCIS. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler therefore seems to be a suitable tool for monitoring beta-blockers in surface waters impacted by WWTP effluents. Longer exposure durations would be necessary to determine the suitability of POCIS for monitoring hormones. Finally, preliminary assays on the use of several deuterated compounds as performance reference compounds showed promising results for deuterated atenolol. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:279-288.

AB Benzodiazepine derivatives are prescribed in large quantities globally and are potentially new emerging environmental contaminants. Unfortunately, a dearth of data exists concerning occurrence, persistence and fate in the environment. This paper redresses this by reviewing existing literature, assessing the occurrence of selected benzodiazepine anxiolytics (diazepam, oxazepam and bromazepam) in wastewater influent and effluent and surface water from Slovenia, evaluating their removal during water treatment and identifying the transformation products formed during water treatment. Their occurrence was monitored in hospital effluent, river water and in wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent. The study reveals the presence of benzodiazepine derivatives in all samples with the highest amounts in hospital effluents: 111 ngL(-1), 158 ngL(-1) and 72 ng L-1 for diazepam, bromazepam and oxazepam, respectively. Removal efficiencies with respect to biological treatment of diazepam were 16-18% (oxic), 18-32% (anoxic -> oxic), 53-76% (oxic -> anoxic) and 83% (oxic -> anoxic -> oxic -> anoxic cascade bioreactors), while the removal oxazepam was 20-24% under anoxic conditions. Coupled biological and photochemical treatment followed by the adsorption to activated carbon resulted in a removal efficiency of 99.99%. Results reveal the recalcitrant nature of benzodiazepine derivatives and suggest that only combinational treatment is sufficient to remove them. In addition, eight novel diazepam and four novel oxazepam transformation products are reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be found in urban wastewaters and which is not removed efficiently by conventional wastewater treatments. In this work, the removal of this pollutant by conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO) is studied.
   RESULTS: CDEO is able to degrade Metoprolol tartrate down to the 10 ppb level ( detection limit of the technique used) with a current charge requirement that increases with increase in the initial concentration of pollutant, although it is many times greater than the stoichiometric current charge required. CDEO also removed very efficiently the reaction intermediates. In terms of TOC the depletion follows a first-order kinetic, but the kinetic constant of Metoprolol decreases with concentration. NaCl increases significantly Metoprolol degradation rate, but it barely affects the TOC removal rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: CDEO can be used to remove Metoprolol from wastewaters, independently of the initial concentration of compound. Several reaction intermediates are formed during the electrolyses although their concentrations are very low and negligible compared with that of Metoprolol. The removal rate ( in terms of TOC) does not depend on the nature of the electrolyte used. The process is under mass transfer control for the complete range of concentrations studied.

AB BACKGROUND: The performance of a pilot membrane bioreactor system (MBR) was tested for the treatment of municipal wastewater, with emphasis on the capability for removal of selected pharmaceuticals
   RESULTS: The MBR showed excellent performance with regards to conventional pollutants. However, the removal of specific pharmaceuticals was not as high. Carbamazepine and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol showed the lowest removal, with mean removal rates of around 20%. Clofibric acid showed the highest removal 70%, while for 17 beta-estradiol the mean removal was 40%. In order to distinguish between the two basic mechanisms of removal, adsorption on biomass and biodegradation, adsorption studies on inactivated biomass were performed and mass balances were written for the four pharmaceuticals. The immediate removal observed for the three compounds during short hydraulic retention times may have been primarily due to adsorption.
   CONCLUSIONS: The removal of carbamazepine, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethynil estradiol, as well as half of the removal of chlofibric acid could be attributed to direct adsorption on biomass within the hydraulic residence time of the reactor. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The efforts were made in this study to decompose the herbal pharmaceutical industrial waste (HPIW) using earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny) under laboratory conditions. To achieve the objectives HPIW was mixed with cow dung (CD) in different ratios to produce five different waste mixtures for vermicomposting: T-1 - CD (100%), T-2 - HPIW (25%) + CD (75%), T-3 - HPIW (50%) + CD (50%), T-4 - HPIW (75%) + CD (25%) and T-5 - HPIW (100%). Vermicomposting caused significant changes in vermibed characteristics. In all waste mixtures, a decrease in pH, organic C, C:P ratio and C:N ratio, but increase total N, available P and exchangeable K was recorded. C:N ratio of end material (vermicompost) was within the agronomic preferable limit (> 15). T-3 and T-4 vermibeds showed better mineralization and waste decomposition rate during vermicomposting. E. fetida produced cocoons in the ranges of 81.0 +/- 9.54 (T-1)-306.33 +/- 14.31(T-4) in all vermibeds. Results clearly suggested that vermicomposting could be an efficient technology to convert HPIW into some value-added products for ecological restoration practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler) for the evaluation of river water quality downstream of wastewater treatment plants. POCIS proved well adapted to sampling alkylphenols and several pharmaceuticals. Concentration factors and the decrease in limits of quantification, compared to grab water sample analyses, were significant except for hormones, beta-blockers and bronchodilators. Promising preliminary results obtained in situ on deuterated atenolol used as a performance reference compound need to be confirmed in-lab. This work confirms that POCIS is a valuable tool for monitoring hydrophilic organic molecules in river and wastewaters.

AB Synthetic musk fragrances (SMFs) are considered micropollutants and can be found in various environmental matrices near wastewater discharge areas. These emerging contaminants are often detected in wastewater at low concentrations; they are continuously present and constitute a constant exposure source. Objectives of this study were to investigate the environmental fate, transport, and transformation of SMFs. Occurrence of six polycyclic musk compounds (galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide, phantolide, traseolide, cashmeran) and two nitro musk compounds (musk xylene and musk ketone) was monitored in wastewater, various surface waters and their sediments, as well as groundwater, soil cores, and plants from a treated wastewater land application site. Specifically, samples were collected quarterly from (1) a wastewater treatment plant to determine initial concentrations in wastewater effluent, (2) a storage reservoir at a land application site to determine possible photolysis before land application, (3) soil cores to determine the amount of sorption after land application and groundwater recharge to assess lack thereof, (4) a lake system and its sediment to assess degradation, and (5) non-effluent impacted local playa lakes and sediments to assess potential sources of these compounds. All samples were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC MS). Data indicated that occurrence of SMFs in effluent-impacted environments was detectable at ng/L and ng/g concentrations, which decreased during transport throughout wastewater treatment and land application. However, unexpected concentrations, ng/L and ng/g, were also detected in playa lakes not receiving treated effluent. Additionally, soil cores from land application sites had ng/g concentrations, and SMFs were detected in plant samples at trace levels. Galaxolide and tonalide were consistently found in all environments. Information on occurrence is critical to assessing exposure to these potential endocrine disrupting compounds. Such information could provide a scientific framework for establishing the need for environmental regulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB An ozone and ozone/peroxide oxidation process was evaluated at pilot scale for trace organic contaminant (TOrC) mitigation and NDMA formation in both drinking water and water reuse applications. A reverse osmosis (RO) pilot was also evaluated as part of the water reuse treatment train. Ozone/peroxide showed lower electrical energy per order of removal (EEO) values for TOrCs in surface water treatment, but the addition of hydrogen peroxide increased EEO values during wastewater treatment. TOrC oxidation was correlated to changes in UV254 absorbance and fluorescence offering a surrogate model for predicting contaminant removal. A decrease in N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential (after chloramination) was observed after treatment with ozone and ozone/peroxide. However, during spiking experiments with surface water, ozone/peroxide achieved limited destruction of NDMA, while in wastewaters net direct formation of NDMA of 6-33 ng/L was observed after either ozone or ozone/peroxide treatment. Once formed during ozonation, NDMA passed through the subsequent RO membranes, which highlights the significance of the potential for direct NDMA formation during oxidation in reuse applications.

The tested PPCPs included acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, metoprolol, dilantin, DEET, diclofenac, pentoxifylline, oxybenzone, caffeine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, naproxen, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol-A and trimethoprim. Transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) caused by Fenton oxidation were also quantified. All tested PPCPs, except atrazine and iopromide, were completely removed by Fenton treatment carried out using a 20 mg/L Fe (II) concentration and a 2.5 H2O2/Fe (II) molar ratio. Up to 30% on the total carbon concentration was removed during Fenton treatment which was accompanied by the oxidation of EfOM molecules and formation of oxidation products such as oxalic, formic and acetic acids and, less prominently, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and glycolaldehyde. The absorbance of EfOM treated with Fenton reagent at varying Fe (II) concentration and contact time underwent a consistent decrease. The relative decrease of EfOM absorbance was strongly and unambiguously correlated with the removal of all tested PPCPs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The first part of this study examined the effect of operating conditions on Fenton pretreatment of an antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin. The optimum H2O2/COD and H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratios were 2.5 and 20, respectively. Under the optimum operating conditions, complete degradation of the antibiotics occurred in 1 min. In the second part of this study, a bench-scale SBR was operated for 239 days and fed with Fenton-treated wastewater under different operating conditions. BOD5/COD ratio below 0.40 of the Fenton-treated wastewater had negative effect on the SBR performance. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h was found suitable for the SBR and increasing HRT to 24 and 48 h did not significantly improve the SBR efficiency. Statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA) was made on the results to optimize the H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio and Fenton reaction time and it was found possible to reduce the Fe' dose and increase the Fenton reaction time. Under the best operating conditions (H2O2/COD molar ratio 2.5, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio 150, Fenton reaction time 120 min and HRT 12 h), the combined Fenton-SBR process efficiency was 89% for sCOD removal and the SBR effluent met the discharge standards. Combined Fenton-SBR is a feasible process for antibiotic wastewater treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the production of an antibacterial drug (nalidixic acid) was investigated employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR) integrated with either ozonation or UV/H2O2 process. This was achieved by placing chemical oxidation in the recirculation stream of the MBR. A conventional configuration with chemical oxidation as polishing for the MER effluent was also tested as a reference. The synergistic effect of MBR when integrated with chemical oxidation was assessed by monitoring (i) the main wastewater characteristics, (ii) the concentration of nalidixic acid, (iii) the 48 organics identified in the raw wastewater and (iv) the 55 degradation products identified during wastewater treatment. Results showed that MBR integration with ozonation or UV/H2O2 did not cause relevant drawbacks to both biological and filtration processes, with COD removal rates in the range 85-95%. Nalidixic acid passed undegraded through the MBR and was completely removed in the chemical oxidation step. Although the polishing configuration appeared to give better performances than the integrated system in removing 15 out of 48 secondary organics while similar removals were obtained for 19 other compounds. The benefit of the integrated system was however evident for the removal of the degradation products. Indeed, the integrated system allowed higher removals for 34 out of 55 degradation products while for only 4 compounds the polishing configuration gave better performance. Overall, results showed the effectiveness of the integrated treatment with both ozone and UV/H2O2.

AB The majority of previous research investigating the fate of endocrine-disrupting compounds has focused on single processes generally in controlled laboratory experiments, and limited studies have directly evaluated their fate and transport in rivers. This study evaluated the fate and transport of 4-nonylphenol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone in a 10-km reach of the Redwood River in southwestern Minnesota. The same parcel of water was sampled as it moved downstream, integrating chemical transformation and hydrologic processes. The conservative tracer bromide was used to track the parcel of water being sampled, and the change in mass of the target compounds relative to bromide was determined at two locations downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent outfall. In-stream attenuation coefficients (k(stream)) were calculated by assuming first-order kinetics (negative values correspond to attenuation, whereas positive values indicate production). Attenuation of 17 beta-estradiol (k(stream) = -3.2 +/- 1.0 day(-1)) was attributed primarily due to sorption and biodegradation by the stream biofilm and bed sediments. Estrone (k(stream) = 0.6 +/- 0.8 day(-1)) and 4-nonylphenol (k(stream) = 1.4 +/- 1.9 day(-1)) were produced in the evaluated 10-km reach, likely due to biochemical transformation from parent compounds (17 beta-estradiol, 4-nonylphenolpolyethoxylates, and 4-nonyphenolpolyethoxycarboxylates). Despite attenuation, these compounds were transported kilometers downstream, and thus additive concentrations from multiple sources and transformation of parent compounds into degradates having estrogenic activity can explain their environmental persistence and widespread observations of biological disruption in surface waters.

AB The beta-blocker atenolol (ATEN), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine (VEN) are found in municipal wastewater effluents, but little is known about the effect of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic animals. We tested the hypothesis that VEN and ATEN disrupt acute stress mediated glucose production in fish liver. To this end, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes were exposed in vitro to different concentrations (0, 0.1, 10,1000 nM) of VEN or ATEN and glucose production in response to either cortisol or epinephrine (two key stress hormones) was ascertained. Both VEN and ATEN did not affect either the unstimulated or cortisol (100 ng/mL)-stimulated glucose release over a 24 h period. The acute (3 h) unstimulated glucose production by isolated hepatocytes in suspension was also not modified by ATEN, while VEN (100 and 1000 nM) reduced basal glucose release. However, ATEN, even at concentration as low as 0.01 nM completely abolished epinephrine (1 mu M)-induced glucose production in trout hepatocytes. Interestingly, VEN also suppressed epinephrine-induced glucose production but only at higher concentrations (100 and 1000 nM). Neither VEN nor ATEN significantly impacted the glucose production in response to either 8-bromo-cAMP (cAMP analogue) or glucagon (a metabolic hormone that increases glucose production) stimulation. ATEN but not VEN attenuated the epinephrine-induced increase in glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) mRNA abundance in trout hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the impact of ATEN and VEN on glucose production involves inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor signaling in trout hepatocytes. Overall, VEN and ATEN are beta-blockers and may disrupt the adaptive acute glucose response to a secondary stressor in rainbow trout. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is often detected in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface waters within the ng/l range. There is, however, insufficient research evaluating potential hazards of fluoxetine in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. Taking into account that several SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) act as spawning inducers in bivalves, this study aimed at investigating the effects of fluoxetine exposure in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by assessing its potential to induce spawning at environmentally relevant concentrations (20 and 200 ng/l), as well as alterations of endogenous levels of testosterone and estradiol. Histological analyses of female and male gonads showed a concentration dependent decrease of oocyte and spermatozoan density, with a reduction in the number of oocytes per follicle of 40-70%, and spermatozoan density of 21-25%, relative to controls, following exposure to 20 and 200 ng/l of fluoxetine for 6 days, respectively. There was also a significant increase (1.5-fold) in the endogenous level of esterified estradiol in organisms exposed to 200 ng/l fluoxetine. Overall, the study shows that exposure to low levels of fluoxetine may effectively induce gamete liberation in the zebra mussel as well as alter endogenous levels of estradiol, and evidences the need of further investigating the potential of fluoxetine to alter the endocrine system of molluscs at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB The fate and behaviour of two groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals, steroid estrogens and nonylphenol ethoxylates, have been evaluated during the anaerobic digestion of primary and mixed sewage sludge under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Digestion occurred over six retention times, in laboratory scale reactors, treating sludges collected from a sewage treatment works in the United Kingdom. It has been established that sludge concentrations of both groups of compounds demonstrated temporal variations and that concentrations in mixed sludge were influenced by the presence of waste activated sludge as a result of transformations during aerobic treatment. The biodegradation of total steroid estrogens was >50% during primary sludge digestion with lower removals observed for mixed sludge, which reflected bulk organic solids removal efficiencies. The removal of nonylphenol ethoxylates was greater in mixed sludge digestion (>58%) compared with primary sludge digestion and did not reflect bulk organic removal efficiencies. It is apparent that anaerobic digestion reduces the concentrations of these compounds, and would therefore be expected to confer a degree of protection against exposure and transfer of both groups of compounds to the receiving/re-use environment.

AB Effective and sustainable treatment of hospital wastewater containing high concentration of pharmaceutical compounds presents a pivotal challenge to wastewater and environmental engineers worldwide. In this study, a titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanofiber based wastewater treatment process was assessed as a pre-treatment system to treat and enhance the biodegradability of a representative pharmaceutical compound, 5000 mu g/L of carbamazepine (CBZ), in synthetic hospital wastewater. Results showed that the stand-alone TiO2 pre-treatment system was capable of removing 78% of CBZ, 40% of COD and 23% of PO4 concentrations from the influent wastewater within a 4 h reaction time. High performance size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that a simultaneous biodegradability enhancement of hospital wastewater was observed, whereby an apparent shift in molecular weight from higher fraction (>10-1000 kDa) to a lower fraction (<10 kDa) was induced after 0.5 h of photocatalytic treatment. Eventually, it was found that the photodegradation profile for high concentration CBZ in synthetic hospital wastewater was perfectly fitted to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics model. It is anticipated that this TiO2 pre-treatment process can be further integrated with a biological wastewater treatment process to deliver treated hospital effluent of better quality that can minimise the associated human health and environmental risks.

AB The very large number of emerging contaminants entering the water supply makes it desirable to assess these chemicals' environmental fate and behavior without direct measurements. Structure-property prediction models are promising in this regard, and quantitative molecular similarity assessment (QMSA) is one particularly appealing option. This study has two objectives related to QMSA modeling of emerging contaminants: (1) demonstrating that QMSA models can be used to accurately predict an environmental engineering parameter of interest, e.g., in vitro estrogenicity measurements, for highly diverse chemical classes; and (2) assessing the extent to which QMSA approaches can be used to prioritize among unmeasured chemicals and determine which additional measurements will result in maximally increased model accuracy. The results of this study are promising in both regards. QMSA models were found to predict the test parameter, estrogenicity, with cross validation coefficients (q(2)) as high as 0.84. Results of a paired t-test to evaluate the difference in increased model accuracy associated with QMSA-selection versus random-selection of additional compounds yielded statistically significant P-values < 0.0001. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that QMSA could dramatically reduce the number of laboratory and field measurements required to characterize as-yet unknown environmental fate and behavior parameters for diverse emerging contaminants of regulatory interest. Additional preliminary work points to the promise of QMSA for prediction of fundamental adsorption parameters; e.g., distribution coefficient (K-d) for selected pharmaceuticals onto activated sludge during municipal wastewater treatment.

AB Electrochemical oxidation effects of the tube type electrolysis module system were investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater. The tube type electrolysis module consisted of a rod anode and an outer tube cathode. Materials used for the anode were titanium electroplated with RuO2 and IrO2 respectively. Stainless steel was used for the cathode. Chlorate production was one of major factors in electrochemical oxidation of tube type electrolysis module system used in this research. Chlorine conversion from chloride to chlorate occurred at a rate of 66.8 mg/L for the textile wastewater and 75.7 mg/L for the pharmaceutical wastewater over a 60 min retention period. Chlorine gas concentration was 360 ppm for the textile wastewater and 500 ppm for the pharmaceutical wastewater after a 60 min electrolysis period. Specific energy consumption was measured during the electrolytic process with the Ti/RuO2 anode and the Ti/IrO2 anode. The range of specific energy consumption was 0.064-0.108 kW h/gCOD(Cr) for the Ti/RuO2 anode over the variation range of hydraulic retention time. The Ti/RuO2 anode had advantages in the electrolytic wastewater treatment with lower specific energy consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The chemical stock of emerging contaminants in Brazilian drinking water is of great interest due to the poor water quality at surface water intakes. In addition, little is known about the effect of some contaminants, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may be present in both raw and treated water. The aim of this work was to evaluate selected emerging contaminants in Brazilian waters using both chemical and biological analyses. Sampling sites were established in different municipalities based upon raw water quality data. Estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, 4-n-octylphenol and 4-n-nonylphenol were determined in the samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A yeast assay using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae bioluminescent bioreporter was used to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the water samples. The first integrated results revealed similarities between the two individual approaches, since higher values for the bioassay were accompanied by significant concentrations of some selected compounds in surface water samples. No estrogenicity was observed for drinking water samples. Our results also indicate that the usual paradigm of evaluating water quality by measuring selected EDCs in a given water sample via chemical analysis, needs to be reviewed since the observed estrogenicity of a water sample is now a better guiding parameter to the selection of samples and substances to be chemically investigated in further analysis. So far, the data bank produced in this work, i.e., the comparison between chemical burden and observed estrogenicity, is not yet sufficiently robust to fully guide this decision.

AB The diverse mixture of contaminants frequently present in estuaries complicates their assessment by routine chemical or biological analyses. We investigated the use of gene expression to assess contaminant exposure and the condition of southern California estuarine fish. Liver gene expression, plasma estradiol concentrations, and gonad histopathology were used to study biological condition in longjaw mudsuckers (Gillichthys mirabilis). Metals, legacy organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, and contaminants of emerging concern were detected in sediments and whole fish. Overall gene expression patterns were characteristic to each of four sites investigated in this study. Differentially expressed genes belonged to several functional categories including xenobiotic metabolism, detoxification, disease, and stress responses. In general, plasma estradiol concentrations were similar among fish from all areas. Some fish gonads had pathologic changes (e.g., infection, inflammation) that could indicate weakened immune systems and chronic stress. The differential expression of some genes involved in stress responses correlated with the prevalence of histologic gonad lesions. This study indicates that gene expression is a promising tool for assessing the biological condition of fish exposed to environmental contaminants.

AB Removal of a large suite of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) was measured through both pilot- and full-scale riverbank filtration (RBF) facilities. The pilot-scale RBF effectively reduced low ng/L concentrations of most compounds by greater than 90% following a 36-day experiment. Breakthrough of the conservative tracer occurred after 10 days and reached 90% recovery after 28 days. Only four compounds (diazepam, meprobamate, phenytoin and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) were between 20 and 80% removed, and three compounds (atrazine, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole) were less than 20% removed by the pilot. Removal of compounds through the pilot-scale RBF is consistent with results from two full-scale RBF systems: atrazine, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and sulfamethoxazole persisted through infiltration into drinking water, whereas caffeine, DEET, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, TCEP, triclosan and trimethoprim were removed. Removal during RBF was attributed to (1) microbial degradation for compounds which were either negatively charged or were neutrally charged and had low log K-ow values (such as acetaminophen, caffeine, and trimethoprim), or (2) adsorption for neutrally-charged compounds with high log K-ow values (including estradiol, estrone, ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine, oxybenzone, progesterone, testosterone, and triclosan).

AB The quality and safety of reverse osmosis (RO)-treated secondary wastewater (WW), for indirect potable re-use, was assessed using a dataset of 375 chemicals measured in RO-treated WW. A screening health risk assessment indicated that four N-nitrosamines were of potential concern, although median concentrations of these chemicals were always below health values. The most frequently detected chemicals in RO-treated water were disinfection by-products, volatile organic compounds, metals and complexing agents, in contrast to many monitoring programmes that focus on pharmaceuticals, personal care products and hormones. Frequent detections in RO-treated WW were most related to high concentrations in secondary WW, relative to limit of reporting, and the potential for chemicals to form or be added during the treatment process, rather than poor rejection by RO membranes. Between 3.7 and 10.7 mu g/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RO permeate could be attributed from chemicals detected on at least one occasion, with the majority of this total attributed to chemicals detected in less than 25% of samples. While chemicals below detection may contribute a significant component of DOC, it is likely that natural organic matter and soluble microbial products still contribute the majority of DOC to RO permeate. A high degree of safety is demonstrated for the use of RO-treated WW as an indirect source of potable water.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in the aquatic environment has become well established, and their presence is of potential concern because they are designed to produce biological response in the target receptor, may bear intrinsic toxicity (e.g. cytostatic agents, antibiotics) and they possess the potential to foster and maintain drug resistance. For both risk assessment and risk management purposes, it is important to identify the major sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Healthcare facilities may be major sources of the discharges of these compounds into municipal sewers. In this study, we investigated the contributions to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from two hospitals and two long-term care homes of nine compounds. Twenty-four hour composite samples were collected over 5 consecutive days from the effluents of these facilities. The WWTPs receiving sewage from these facilities were also sampled on the same days to facilitate mass balance calculations. The results showed that the healthcare facilities contributed a greater proportion of the antibiotic compounds to the WWTPs than the other target compounds; with maximum contributions of ciprofloxacin by hospitals and long-term care homes of 26.7 and 37%, respectively.

AB Growing attention is given to pharmaceutical residue in the water environment. It is known that pharmaceuticals are able to survive from a series of wastewater treatment processes. Concerns regarding pharmaceutical residues are attributed to the fact that they are being detected in water and sediment environment ubiquitously. Pharmaceutical treatment using a series of wastewater treatment processes of the DAF (dissolved air flotation)-MBR (membrane bioreactor)-ozone oxidation was conducted in the study. DAF, without addition of coagulant, could remove CODcr (chemical oxygen demand by Cr) up to over 70%, BOD 73%, SS 83%, T-N 55%, NH4+ 23%, and T-P 65% in influent of municipal wastewater. Average removal rates of water quality parameters by the DAF-MBR system were very high, e.g. CODcr 95.88%, BOD5 99.66%, CODmn (chemical oxygen demand by Mn) 93.63%, T-N 69.75%, NH4-N 98.46%, T-P 78.23%, and SS 99.51%, which satisfy effluent water quality standards. Despite the high removal rate of the wastewater treatment system, pharmaceuticals were eliminated to be about 50-99% by the MBR system, depending on specific pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen was well removed by MBR system up to over 95%, while removal rate of bezafibrate ranged between 50 and 90%. With over 5 mg/l of ozone oxidation, most pharmaceuticals which survived the DAF-MBR process were removed completely or resulted in very low survival rate within the range of few micrograms per litre. However, some pharmaceuticals such as bezafibrate and naproxen tended to be resistant to ozone oxidation.

AB This work investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in raw sewage (from Belo Horizonte city, Minas Gerais state, Brazil) and assessed their behavior in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRT). The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The natural (estradiol) and synthetic (ethinylestradiol) estrogens were hardly detected; when present, however, their concentrations were lower than the method quantification limits. The concentrations of bisphenol A and miconazole in raw sewage were similar to that reported in the literature (around 200 ng L-1 and hardly detected, respectively). The antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (median 13.0 ng L-1) and trimethoprim (median 61.5 ng L-1), and the other pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac and bezafibrate, with median 99.9 and 94.4 ng L-1, respectively) were found in lower concentrations when compared with reports in the literature, which might indicate a lower consumption of such drugs in Brazil. The UASB reactors were inefficient in the removal of bisphenol A, and led to an increased concentration of nonylphenol in the effluent. The anaerobic reactors were also inefficient in the removal of diclofenac, and led to a partial removal of bezafibrate; whereas, for sulfamethoxazole there seemed to be a direct relationship between the HRT and removal efficiencies. For trimethoprim the sludge retention time (SRT) seemed to play an important role, although it was only partially removed in the UASB reactors.

AB Piggery wastewater was fractionated using three types of separation technologies including particle size fractionation, resin adsorption, and polar diversity separation. In polar diversity fractions, alkanes were the main non-polar components while phenol-like compounds such as phthalates acid esters (PAEs), and other non-polar esters accounted for more than 50% of the aromatic components. Sterols and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) accounted for more than 70% of the non-hydrocarbon components. Six hazardous pharmaceuticals, including dihydroxanthin, a-santonin, bulflomedil, zolpidem, flumazenil, and pimozide, were identified in the non-hydrocarbons fraction of the piggery wastewater.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active components in the aquatic environment has been recognised as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry. One key component, which is found in considerable concentrations in European natural waters and is only partially eliminated during biological wastewater treatment is ibuprofen (IBU). This paper studies the application of classic Fenton, photo-assisted Fenton, H2O2/UV and peroxymonosulphate (POMS) oxidation for degrading IBU from wastewater. It is seen that the applied advanced oxidation processes are capable of effectively degrading the IBU, with the photo-assisted Fenton oxidation having the highest efficiency. The IBU in the mixture (at an initial concentration of 22 mg/L) is completely removed by a H2O2 concentration of 0.024 and 0.03 mg/L for the photo-assisted Fenton and classic Fenton oxidation, respectively. A POMS concentration of 37mg/L is required to remove all IBU. No complete mineralization is obtained: a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal by 89 and 88% was obtained for a H2O2 concentration of 0.023 and 0.03 mg/L for photo-assisted Fenton and classic Fenton, respectively. A POMS concentration of 37 mg/L resulted in a 86% reduction of COD. Finally, the main degradation products produced during the Fenton oxidation are identified and are similar to those identified in other studies dedicated to oxidative IBU removal.

AB Passive samplers (SPMDs, semi-permeable membrane devices; POCIS, polar organic chemical integrative samplers) were deployed in Lake Ontario near Pickering, Ajax, and Port Hope, Ontario in 2008 and complemented with detailed water quality indicator and water current measurements. The intent was to examine the influences of source inputs and limnological features on the distribution and dilution patterns of several organic wastewater-associated chemicals (OWCs) in dynamic nearshore waters. Generally, concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 11 ng/L for most pharmaceuticals and up to 25 ng/L for gemfibrozil and 28 ng/L for caffeine based on previously determined POCIS sampling rates. Musk (HHCB and AHTN) and triclosan (TCS) concentrations were estimated using laboratory-derived sampling rates as part of this study (4.3-7.9 L/d) and ranged up to 10 ng/L for musks and 1.5 ng/L for TCS near Pickering-Ajax. Nitrate and conductivity maps indicated that alongshore currents were primary drivers of distribution and transport for tributary discharges and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents parallel to shore. Organic wastewater chemicals like HHCB, AHTN, TCS, gemfibrozil, and venlafaxine were greatest in the vicinity of the Pickering-Ajax WWTP and then dramatically declined. Ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and especially caffeine concentrations exhibited more uniform distributions both within and between the Pickering-Ajax and Port Hope study areas suggesting that transport via alongshore currents may contribute to a regional background of the relatively more persistent OWCs that may not be captured in onshore-offshore gradient studies.

AB The photocatalytic degradation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in aqueous suspension under ultraviolet irradiation was investigated using zinc oxide prepared through hydrothermal process. The as-prepared ZnO was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the three-dimensional structured ZnO microspheres were synthesized by assembly of nanorods with hexagonal wurtzite structure. The influence of initial ZnO doses and pH on EE2 degradation was firstly examined. The degradation efficiency of EE2 could reach the highest point at pH 9.0 with 0.5 g.L-1 ZnO. In addition, the effects of the presence of HCO3-, NO3- and HPO42- on EE2 removal were also revealed. It was found that the photocatalytic reaction was totally inhibited by NO3- and HPO42-, whereas the process was slightly promoted by HCO3-. The photocatalytic process of ZnO followed the pseudo-first order rate kinetics. The reaction rate constant for EE2 degradation by ZnO/UV was 0.156 min(-1), which was higher than 0.110 min(-1) of TiO2 (Degussa P25) suspension. This work can provide some useful information for the removal of EE2 by ZnO from wastewater for a water reclamation purpose.

The effect of process variables like gas flow rates (0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 m3 h-1), inlet concentration of ethyl acetate (1.75, 3.0, 7.0 and 10.5 g. m-3) and xylene (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.2. g.m-3) on the performance of biofilters was validated. The removal efficiency exceeded 97% for ethyl acetate at inlet concentrations up to 3.0 g.m-3 and 95% for xylene at inlet concentrations up to 0.4 g m-3. The maximum elimination capacity of 165 g m-3 h-1 and 66 g m-3 h-1 for the mixture of ethyl acetate and xylene were obtained. A steady state mathematical model was tested and proved to adequately describe the experimental results at the two operating regimes for both ethyl acetate and xylene.

AB Removal characteristics of sulfamethazine (SMZ) by sludge and a bacterial strain using an aerobic sequence batch reactor (ASBR) were studied. Operating conditions were optimized by varying the reaction time and sludge retention time (SRT). An Achromobacter sp. (S-3) with the ability to remove SMZ was isolated from the ASBR. The effects of different operating parameters (pH and temperature) on the biodegradation of SMZ by S-3 were determined. The results indicate that, between 0.5 and 4 hr, reaction time of the ASBR had a significant effect on the SMZ removal efficiency in the system. The SMZ removal efficiency also increased from 45% to 80% when SRT was prolonged from 5 to 25 days, although longer SRT had no impact on SMZ removal. The SMZ adsorption rate decreased with increasing temperature, which fitted Freundlich isotherm well. The removal of SMZ in the ASBR was due to the combined effects of adsorption and degradation, and degradation played a leading role.

AB In this work, a sensitive and highly selective method was developed and validated to study the degradation of two antibiotic compounds (ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP)), spiked in secondary treated domestic effluents, by the solar Fenton process. Three different chromatographic columns were tested on a ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) instrument working in the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode with twelve combinations of eluting solvents. Samples were enriched prior to the analysis by solid phase extraction using the hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) reversed phase polymeric sorbent. The method was optimized and showed very good performance characteristics and was successfully applied to study the degradation kinetics of the selected antibiotics during the solar Fenton process applied. The degradation was found to follow a pseudo first-order kinetics for both compounds at initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 with k = 0.0345 min(-1) for OFX and k = 0.0768 min(-1) for TMP, whereas the complete removal was achieved after 120 min of treatment for both compounds.

AB The biodegradation of five pharmaceutical ingredients (PIs) of different therapeutic classes, namely antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfametoxazole and ciprofloxacin), anti-inflammatory (diclofenac) and anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), by two distinct microbial consortia, was investigated. For the monitoring of biodegradation assays, a simple HPLC-DAD (High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Diode Array Detector) method was developed and validated. The separation of the target pharmaceuticals was performed using an environmental friendly mobile phase in a gradient mode of 0.1% triethylamine (TEA) in water acidified at pH 2.23 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) and ethanol as organic solvent. The method revealed to be selective, linear and precise in the range of 1.0 to 30.0 mu g/mL for all PIs. Biodegradation assays were performed using activated sludge and a bacterial consortium (able to degrade fluoroaromatic compounds) supplemented with the target PIs at a final concentration of 25 mu g/mL. The results revealed that activated sludge removed the target compounds more efficiently than the bacterial consortium.

AB In this study, the presence of twelve antibiotics, total cultivable bacteria and fecal coliforms were investigated in the influent and effluent in a wastewater treatment plant as well as the water from the upstream and downstream of the relevant receiving water. The twelve antibiotics were detectable in these waters except for Erythromycin, which was not detected in the receiving water. 58.17-97.35% of the antibiotics can be removed during the wastewater treatment process. Among these antibiotics, the highest concentration was detected for Cephalexin in the influents, followed by the Amoxycillin, Sulfamethoxazole and Tetacyclines. Besides, no significant differences were found in the concentrations of these antibiotics between the upstream and downstream of the receiving river. The total cultivable bacteria and fecal coliforms in influent were higher than that in effluent in WWTP while the same items of downstream were a little higher than that of upstream. With respect to the influent, the highest resistance was found for Trimethoprin/ sulfamethoxazole (SXT), followed by Tetracycline (TET), Chloramphenicol (CHL) and Ampicillin (AMP) while the lowest resistance was Ciprofloxacin (32%). In the effluent, the highest resistance was found for SXT, followed by CHL, Erythromycin and TET. The wastewater treatment process increased the level of antibiotic resistant among the isolated fecal coliform. Consequently, the substantial concern should be paid to the multi-antibiotic resistant isolates.

AB The paper mainly focused on illustrating the merit of respirometric analysis in assessing the inhibitory/toxic impact of xenobiotics on substrate biodegradation. It also evaluated biodegradation characteristics of these chemicals at continuous exposure through acclimation of the microbial culture. The nature and role of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) profiles were discussed in conjunction with appropriate modelling, which should incorporate dissolved oxygen as an indispensable component for respirometric evaluation. Emphasis was placed upon differentiating acute effects from chronic impact, which may be totally different as it involves biodegradation of the chemical due biomass acclimation. Three case studies, each involving OUR measurements and process modelling, were presented for this purpose. The first one related to the inhibitory action of pharmaceutical effluent when mixed with plain-settled tannery wastewater. The second investigated the fate of H-acid, a commercially important naphthalene sulfonate, which exerted no adverse effect on substrate biodegradation, while remaining intact before and after a long acclimation period. The third one involved 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a naturally occurring organic compound in olive oil wastewater, which became biodegradable after acclimation by the development of a specific microbial biomass fraction, while it heavily inhibited substrate biodegradation at first exposure. Model evaluation of the experimental data could provide related information on process stoichiometry and kinetics in all studies.

AB Minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, commonly used veterinary pharmaceuticals, were searched in four urban, two livestock and two slaughterhouse effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the north of Portugal. A simple method that includes solid-phase extraction followed with analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector was established and applied to the simultaneous determination of the five pharmaceuticals in WWTP effluents. This method, which is expeditious, inexpensive and available in most laboratories, showed to be useful for screening for problematic levels of drugs in WWTP effluents. It is known that several livestock and slaughterhouse effluents (pre-treated or treated) are discharged to the urban network before discharge into the environment. The presence of these drugs in such effluents can constitute a significant environmental problem that should be addressed, by the monitoring of these drugs and by implementation of methodologies that contribute to their decrease/elimination from wastewaters. Minocycline (<= 6 mu g L-1), oxytetracycline (<= 7 mu g L-1), tetracycline (<= 6 mu g L-1) and enrofloxacin (<2 mu g L-1) could be detected and/or quantified in three urban effluents. Detectable levels of enrofloxacin (<2 mu g L-1) and quantifiable levels of tetracycline (<= 15 mu g L-1) were found in the slaughterhouse effluents.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants with damaging effects to the environment and human health. Their presence in surface and especially groundwaters is regarded as detrimental, as they can ultimately reach drinking water. The aim of this work was to monitor pharmaceutical contamination of the Danube River and its tributaries in Serbia, and to assess the potential of their passing through all natural filtrations and reaching the groundwater. A total of 70 surface and groundwater samples was collected at 38 sampling sites at the Danube in Serbia. They were taken in five sampling campaigns performed in summer and autumn of 2009 and winter, spring and autumn of 2010. Samples were analyzed using a previously developed method which includes solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

AB Four drugs, erythromycin, fluoxetine, naproxen and gemfibrozil, belonging to different therapeutic classes, were chosen to examine their toxicity to selected plankton organisms from different trophic levels: algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Ankestrodesmus falcatus), protozoa (Paramecium caudatum), rotifera (Brachionus calyciflorus) and cladocera (Daphnia longispina). LC50 values for three of the drugs were between 12 and 82 mg l(-1), with algae and protozoans being most sensitive. Fluoxetine showed LC50 values between 40 and 830 mu g l(-1), algae again being most sensitive. The lower test concentrations of fluoxetine enhanced the growth rates of both B. calyciflorus and D. longispina. Even at low test concentrations, erythromycin decreased the growth rates of all the tested organisms. Paramecium caudatum was the species most sensitive to naproxen exposure. After 24 h, gemfibrozil had the least effect on all tested organisms. All the surviving tested organisms underwent oxidative stress to different degrees as a result of drug exposure. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase was reduced, and lipid peroxidation levels were elevated in all tested species after exposure, compared to their levels in the control group. Although the test concentrations were above those commonly found in the environment, the occurrence of sublethal effects at all test concentrations suggests that the potential risk for non- target organisms warrants further investigation.

AB The alcohol distilleries are growing extensively worldwide due to widespread industrial applications of alcohol such as in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, beverages, food and perfumery industry, etc. The industrial production of ethanol by fermentation results in the discharge of large quantities of high-strength liquid wastes. Distillery wastewater is one of the most polluted waste products to dispose because of the low pH, high temperature, dark brown colour, high ash content and high percentage of dissolved organic and inorganic matter with high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values. Its characteristics are depending on the feed stock and various aspects of ethanol production process. Spent wash polluted the water bodies into ways; first, the highly colored nature which can block out sunlight, thus reducing oxygenation of the water by photosynthesis and hence becomes detrimental to aquatic life. Second, it has a high pollution load which would result in eutrophication of contaminated water sources. Distillery wastewater, without any treatment can result in depletion of dissolved oxygen in the receiving water streams and poses serious threat to the aquatic flora and fauna. This review presents an account of the problems associated with distillery wastewater and a detailed study of existing biological treatment approaches. The role of various microorganisms and their enzymes in the wastewater treatment has been discussed to develop a better understanding of the phenomenon.

AB Human antidepressants have been shown to have a wide variety of effects on aquatic mollusks. The antidepressants venlafaxine ("Effexor'') and citalopram ("Celexa'') are human pharmaceuticals detected in effluent from wastewater treatment plants. We report on the acute effects of venlafaxine and citalopram on the attachment ability of two freshwater snails, Leptoxis carinata and Stagnicola (=Lymnaea) elodes. In laboratory experiments, venlafaxine induced significant foot detachment from the substrate in L. carinata at nominal concentrations as low as 313 pgL(-1) (10(-12) M) and in S. elodes at 31.3 ng L-1. Citalopram was equally potent in L. carinata, inducing significant foot detachment in 405 pgL(-1) (10(-12) M), but slightly less potent in S. elodes inducing significant foot detachment in 4.05 mu gL(-1). In all cases of foot detachment from the substrate, snails were not able to reattach while exposed to the drugs. The lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) for venlafaxine (313 pgL(-1)) and citalopram (405 pg L-1) are about 700x and 25,000x, respectively, lower than the concentrations of these two antidepressants recently reported from North American and European wastewater treatment plants. These are the lowest concentrations of any antidepressant reported to have a detrimental effect on any aquatic animal. The possible physiological mechanism of this toxicity and the potential ecological impacts of these and other antidepressants on aquatic snails and their communities are discussed.

AB Agricultural irrigation using raw wastewater is a popular practice in developing countries. However, as endocrine disrupting chemicals have been found in this water, the potential pollution of soil and water sources has become a source of concern. Such pollutants may be removed during the passage of wastewater through the soil by degradation and/or sorption. In this study the sorption and mobility of bis-2-ethyl(hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) in three different soils (Leptosol, Phaeozem and Vertisol) was compared. The distribution coefficients showed that DEHP is rapidly sorbed onto the three tested soils (K-d between 1.8 x 10(4) and 4.2 x 0(4) L/kg), while sorption of 4-NP (K-d between 15 and 80 L/kg) was weaker. In batch experiments the soil sorption capacity observed was as follows: Vertisol > Phaeozem > Leptosol for both compounds. However, in column experiments the retardation factor (R-F) for 4-NP was higher than for the DEHP in the three soils. This suggests the possible migration of DEHP through the soil via colloids. The column results were found consistent with those observed in the field. It was concluded that the risk of groundwater contamination is higher for Leptosol soil than for Phaeozem and Vertisol soils and that DEHP can reach the aquifer prior to 4-NP.

AB Owing to high levels of residual antibiotics, antibiotic manufacturing waste is hazardous to the environment. As a result, such wastes are usually treated by expensive incineration. The high organic content of antibiotic manufacturing biowaste suggests its feasibility for anaerobic treatment, but the presence of ammonia and antibiotics in the waste may be inhibitory factors. After evaluating the peak concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ammonia and lincomycin in 10 d bio-liquefaction, different methods for the removal of ammonia from hydrolysate and removal of lincomycin from biowaste were employed to relieve ammonia and lincomycin inhibition respectively. Prior to ammonia elimination on the tenth day, 38.0% of the organic carbon was degraded into hydrolysate. Water replacement, struvite precipitation and nitrogen stripping removed 100, 76 and 30% of the ammonia, respectively. The hydrolysate obtained from the water replacement could be immediately utilized for liquefaction. Lincomycin elution through butanol and water prior to liquefaction removed a large amount of carbohydrate and protein, resulting in poor liquefaction efficiency. The residual lincomycin in the bio-liquefaction process could be co-treated with lincomycin manufacturing wastewater, which made it suitable for the treatment of lincomycin manufacturing biowaste.

AB The paper expresses an attempt to tackle the problem due to the presence of micropollutants in wastewater which may be able to disrupt the endocrine system of some organisms. These kinds of compounds are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The aim of this paper is to compare the fate of the alkylphenols-APs (4-(tert-octyl)) phenol, t-nonylphenol and 4-p-nonylphenol and the hormones (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) pilot plant and in a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (CTP). The obtained results are also compared with the results obtained in a previous study carried out in an aerobic MBR pilot plant. The results showed that the APs soluble concentrations in the SAMBR effluent were always significantly higher than the CTP ones. Moreover, the analyses of the suspended fraction revealed that the AP concentrations in the SAMBR reactor were usually higher than in the CTP reactor, indicating that under anaerobic conditions the APs were accumulated in the digested sludge. The aerobic conditions maintained both in the CTP system and in the aerobic MBR favoured the APs and hormones degradation, and gave rise to lower concentrations in the effluent and in the reactor of these systems. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the degradation of APs under aerobic conditions was enhanced working at high solid retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) values.

AB Simultaneous Escherichia coli inactivation and oxidation of pharmaceuticals in simulated wastewater treatment plant effluents has been investigated using a photocatalytic treatment with TiO2 in suspension and immobilised onto a fixed-bed reactor. Non-photocatalytic reference experiments of dark adsorption and photolysis showed a higher sensitivity of E. coli towards the chemical composition of water in comparison with the concentration of pharmaceuticals that remains unaffected. Moreover, it must be underlined that the presence of pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics) did not seem to affect the bacterial viability at such low concentrations. Concerning photocatalytic experiments, both suspended and immobilised TiO2 were able to simultaneously inactivate and oxidise both kinds of pollutants (bacteria and pharmaceuticals). The fixed-bed reactor showed similar activity to that of the slurry without deactivation after several cycles of reuse. That makes TiO2 photocatalysis a quite interesting technology for the treatment of drinking water supplies or wastewater plant effluents, allowing the removal of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals during the disinfection treatment.

AB The kinetics of the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PW), pretreated in a first stage by electrocaogulation (EC), using an anaerobic fixed-film fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The experimental results for the substrate removal kinetics were found to be in good agreement with those of the Monod model and the modified Stover-Kincannon model, with a high regression value (R-2 > 0.9). For the modified Stover-Kincannon model, the constants U-max and K-B were found to be 13.1 and 13.87 kg COD/(m(3) . d) respectively. With reference to the biomass kinetics, the increase in organic loading rate (OLR) is attributed to the increased biomass growth rate (mu) and decrease in the biological constant K-mu. The corresponding constants for the modified Monod's model, i.e. 'mu(max) and decay constant K-d, were found to be 0.159 and 0.0113 d(-1) respectively. Finally, the gas production kinetics was interpreted in relation to the Kincannon-Stover model.

AB The presence of an ionized carboxyl group in the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug diclofenac potassium results in a high mobility of diclofenac and in its low sorption under conditions of slow sand filtration or subsoil passage. No diclofenac degradation was detected in pure water or sludge during one month. Tertiary treatments of wastewater indicated that the effective removal of diclofenac was by reverse osmosis, but the removal by activated carbon was less satisfactory. This study presents an efficient method for the removal of diclofenac from water by micelle-clay composites that are positively charged, have a large surface area and include large hydrophobic domains. Adsorption of diclofenac in dispersion by charcoal and a composite micelle (otadecyltrimethylammonium [ODTMA] and clay [montmorillonite]) was investigated. Analysis by the Langmuir isotherm revealed that charcoal had a somewhat larger number of adsorption sites than the composite, but the latter had a significantly larger binding affinity for diclofenac. Filtration experiments on a solution containing 300 ppm diclofenac demonstrated poor removal by activated carbon, in contrast to very efficient removal by micelle-clay filters. In the latter case the weight of removed diclofenac exceeded half that of ODTMA in the filter. Filtration of diclofenac solutions at concentrations of 8 and 80 ppb yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of 30 and 60 mL min(-1). One kilogram of ODTMA in the micelle-clay filter has been estimated to remove more than 99% of diclofenac from a solution of 100 ppb during passage of more than 100 m(3).

AB Cytostatics are a major class of chemotherapy drugs with great potential to cause genotoxic and/or mutagenic effects in all organisms. Currently, hospital wastewater treatment systems (HWTS) are not able to remove these compounds and they are discharged to the environment. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the oxidative degradation of the cytostatic drugs doxorubicin ( DOXO) [(8s, 10s)-10-(4-amino-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-tetrahydro-2h-pyran-2-yloxy)-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrotetracene-5,12-dione] and methotrexate (METHO) {N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid} by ozonolysis alone and using a combined sonolysis/ozonolysis process on bench-scale at different pH values. Besides determining the degradation efficiency, a kinetic approach was applied to determine the reaction order and rate constants for different oxidative processes carried out at pH 7.0, which is the normal pH of hospital wastewater. The results showed that the removal efficiency of these compounds is pH-dependent. A combination of sonolysis and ozonolysis processes is more efficient than the ozonolysis process alone for the degradation of doxorubicin at all pH values, while methotrexate can easily be degraded by ozonolysis alone or sonolysis/ozonolysis methodologies at any pH.

AB Municipal wastewaters are major sources of pollution for the aquatic biota. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of some pharmaceutical products and the immunotoxic potential of a municipal wastewater aeration lagoon for the treatment of the domestic wastewaters of a small town with wastewater inputs from a 400-bed hospital complex. Endemic mussels were collected, caged and placed in the final aeration lagoon and at sites 1 km upstream and 1 km downstream of the effluent outfall in the receiving river for a period of 14 days. The results showed that the final aeration lagoon contained high levels of total coliforms, conductivity and low dissolved oxygen (2.9 mg/L) as well as detectable amounts of trimethoprim, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and norfloxacin at concentrations exceeding 50 ng/L. The lagoon effluent was indeed toxic to the mussel specimens, as evidenced by the appearance of mortality after 14 days (10% mortality), decreased mussel weight-to-shell-length ratio and loss of hemocyte viability. The number of adhering hemocytes, phagocytic activity, total nitrite levels and arachidonic cyclooxygenase activity were significantly higher in mussels placed in the final aeration lagoon. A multivariate analysis also revealed that water pH, conductivity, total coliforms and dissolved oxygen were the endpoints most closely linked with phagocytic activity, the amount of adhering hemocytes and loss of hemocyte viability. In conclusion, exposure of mussels to treated aerated lagoon wastewater is deleterious to freshwater mussels where the immune system is compromised.

AB A heteropolyacid Zr(IV) tungstate-based cation exchanger has been synthesized. An amorphous sample, prepared at pH 1.2 and having a Na+ ion exchange capacity of 0.92 meq g(-1), was selected for further studies. Its physicochemical properties were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, and scanning electron studies. To understand the cation exchange behavior of the material, distribution coefficients (K-d) for metal ions in various solvent systems were determined. Some important binary separations of metal ions, namely Mg2+-Bi3+, Cd2+-Bi3+, Fe3+-Bi3+, Th4+-Bi3+, and Fe3+-Zn2+, were achieved on such columns. The practical utility of these separations was demonstrated by separating Fe3+ and Zn2+ ions quantitatively in commercial pharmaceutical formulation. The cation exchanger has been successfully applied also for the treatment of industrial wastewater and a synthetic mixture. All the results suggests that Zr(IV) tungstate has excellent potential for the removal of metals from aqueous systems using packed columns of this material.

AB Removal of six active pharmaceutical ingredients in wastewater was investigated using chlorine dioxide (ClO2) or peracetic acid (PAA) as chemical oxidants. Four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid) and two lipid-regulating agents (gemfibrozil and clofibric acid, a metabolite of clofibrate) were used as target substances at 40 mu g/L initial concentration. Three different wastewaters types originating from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used. One wastewater was collected after extended nitrogen removal in activated sludge, one after treatment with high-loaded activated sludge without nitrification, and one from the final effluent from the same plant where nitrogen removal was made in trickling filters for nitrification and moving-bed biofilm reactors for denitrification following the high-loaded plant. Of the six investigated compounds, only clofibric acid and ibuprofen were not removed when treated with ClO2 up to 20 mg/L. With increasing PAA dose up to 50 mg/L, significant removal of most of the pharmaceuticals was observed except for the wastewater with the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD). This indicates that chemical oxidation with ClO2 could be used for tertiary treatment at WWTPs for active pharmaceutical ingredients, whereas PAA was not sufficiently efficient.

AB The rapid increase in demand and development of industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals to sustain and improve quality of life worldwide have resulted in the contamination and high prevalence of these chemicals in air, water and soils, posing a potential threat to the environment. Pesticides are a common hazard around the world, as these chemicals are leaching into soils, groundwater and surface water and creating health concerns in many communities. The persistence of pesticides makes their removal and detoxification a more urgent undertaking. The toxicity or the contamination of pesticides can be reduced by the bioremediation process which involves the use of microbes or plants. Bioremediation technologies have been successfully employed in the field and are gaining more and more importance with increased acceptance of eco-friendly remediation solutions. Owing to complex nature of pesticides, more versatile and robust techniques need to be developed which can produce the desired result in a very cost-effective manner.

AB This paper presents the results of application of TiO2 photocatalysis in advanced wastewater treatment to simulate the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (i.e., bisphenol A, nonylphenol, estrone, and 17 alpha-estradiol) and estrogenic activity from secondary effluents of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, aiming to evaluate the possibility of application of photocatalysis for advanced wastewater treatment. The removal efficiencies of alkyl-hydroxybenzene (bisphenol A, nonylphenol) by traditional process in wastewater treatment plant are more sensitive to temperature than steroid hormones (estrone, and 17 alpha-estradiol), resulting in a risk of effluent insecurity. All the targeted EDCs in secondary effluent could be totally degraded by TiO2 photocatalysis within 60 min except BPA (92% removal), following pseudo first-order kinetics. The estrogenic activity, expressed as the E2 equivalent concentration (EEQ), was also totally removed during the same process. The mechanisms for the photocatalytic removal of EDCs and estrogenic activity were proposed according to the experimental results. When EDCs reacted with hydroxyl radicals, aromatic rings were cleaved, resulting in a decreased estrogenic activity. The findings suggest that TiO2 photocatalysis is an effective method for removal of certain EDCs and estrogenic activity from secondary effluents and can be used for advanced wastewater treatment.

   Biphenyl-2-ol (BPh), chloramine T (ChT), 4-chloro-3-methylphenol (4C3M-Ph), triclosan (TCS), and triclocarban (TCC) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Chromatographic analyses were carried out on a Develosil RP Aqueous AR-5 RP-30 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5.0 mu m particles) with gradient elution of mobile phase including methanol and water, and with a DAD detector. Satisfactory resolution of the determined substances was obtained in 10 minutes. The linearity ranges of the calibration curves (in matrix) of examined disinfectants ranged from 0.10 to 10.00 mu g.mL(-1) for ChT, 4C3MPh and TCC, and from 0.25 to 10.00 mu g.mL(-1) for BPh and TCS. The developed method was applied to determine of mentioned compounds in water samples.
   Water samples were prepared for chromatography analyses by using C18 solid phase extraction discs. The recoveries of analyzed substances ranged from 82 to 101% (except for Chloramine T, which is unstable in water medium). Analyses were operated after extraction of analytes from 3 L of real water samples. The method detection limits in samples of water were: 1.6 ng.mL(-1) for BPh, 0.6 ng.mL(-1) for ChT, 1.4 ng.mL(-1) for 4C3MPh, 1.9 ng.mL(-1) for TCS, and 1.0 ng.mL(-1) for TCC.
   This method was successfully applied to analyze examined disinfectants in surface water samples collected from rivers and wastewater in Poland. Four of five compounds were detected in the tested samples in the concentration ranging from 5.05 to 30.36 mu g.L-1.

AB An analytical method was developed for the simultaneous extraction and determination of 18 fluoroquinolones (FQs), tetracyclines (TCs) and sulfonamides (SAs) antibiotics from soils using solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The soils were extracted by different solvents with the help of mechanical shaking and ultrasonic treatment at 59 kHz, followed by a strong anion exchange (SAX) cartridge to clean up soil samples and a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge as enrichment. The method was evaluated by testing the following variables: extraction solvents, the type of SPE cartridges, solvent volumes, initial spiking levels and soil types (silty clay loam and clay loam soils). The soil extraction method was validated using these two types of soils, representing two typical agricultural soils in northern China. For 2 g soil, the extraction steps with the mixture of potassium phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (ACN) (1/1, v/v, pH 3.2) provided satisfactory recoveries. In the clay loam soil, the recoveries of all the compounds were from 56% to 89% at the spiking level of 50 mu g kg(-1) soil, and from 69% to 97% at the spiking level of 200 mu g kg(-1) soil, respectively. Recoveries in silty clay loam soil were similar to that in clay loam. The method was successfully employed using soil samples collected from a farmland and afforestion area irrigated with sewage in northern China. The result indicates that trace antibiotics in sewage may accumulate in soil irrigated by river water containing sewage.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is among the top 100 drugs prescribed annually in the United States and the United Kingdom and is one of many pharmaceutical products that have been detected in global surface waters. Our study used sublethal concentrations to assess the impact of FLX exposure on sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) locomotor behavior. Exposures lasted for 56 hours, and fish were recorded for locomotor behavior assessment at six timepoints between 1-56 h post-dose. Behavior was recorded to quantify locomotor activity using line crossing counts. Animals treated with 300 mu g L-1 FLX exhibited reduced locomotor activity at 1, 25, 32, 49 and 56 h post-dose. An EC25 value of 2 mu g L-1 (lower and upper 95 % confidence limits at 1.3, 43 mu g L-1, respectively) was determined for locomotor activity at 32 h of exposure. Changes in locomotor activity due to FLX exposure may have implications for the ecological response of populations to other natural and anthropogenic stressors.

AB An anaerobic multichamber bed reactor (AMCBR) was effective in removing both molasses-chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC). The maximum COD and OTC removals were 99% in sequential AMCBR/completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at an OTC concentration of 300 mg L-1. 51%, 29% and 9% of the total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) was composed of acetic, propionic acid and butyric acids, respectively. The OTC loading rates at between 22.22 and 133.33 g OTC m(-3) d(-1) improved the hydrolysis of molasses-COD (k), the maximum specific utilization of molasses-COD (k(mh)) and the maximum specific utilization rate of TVFA (k(TVFA)). The direct effect of high OTC loadings (155.56 and -177.78 g OTC m(-3) d(-1)) on acidogens and methanogens were evaluated with Haldane inhibition kinetic. A significant decrease of the Haldane inhibition constant was indicative of increases in toxicity at increasing loading rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different UVA radiation and advanced oxidation systems, most of them involving ozone, have been applied to remove mixtures of three contaminants of pharmaceutical type: diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMT) and caffeine (CFF), both in ultrapure and secondary treated wastewater. The influence of the water matrix has been studied in terms of individual compound concentration and TOC removal. Also, biodegradability of the treated wastewater before and after the advanced oxidation process, as BOD/COD ratio, the partial oxidation yield, the increment of average state of carbon oxidation and ozone consumption have been determined. For mgL(-1) to 100 mu gL(-1) concentrations and regardess of the ozone process and water type, DCF and SMT are removed in less than 10 min mainly by direct reaction with ozone, especially in the case of DCF CFF, on the contrary, is mainly removed through hydroxyl radicals. For lower concentration (<= 100 mu gL(-1)), ECF still disappears by direct ozonation, CFF by hydroxyl radicals oxidation and SMT through both direct zonation and hydroxyl radical oxidation. Once DCF and SMT have disappeared, TOC is removed by reacting with hydroxyl radicals, regardless of the water matrix. Photocatalytic ozonation allows the highest TOC degradation rate, partial oxidation yield, increment of average state of carbon oxidation and biodegradability together to the lowest ozone consumption per mg TOC eliminated.

AB The aim of this paper is to determine the ozone dosages needed to oxidize bulk and trace organics. Treated effluent from eight full-scale wastewater treatment plants was collected and subjected to lab-scale zonation. Because both organics and inorganics exert ozone demand, an approach was developed to calculate only the ozone demand associated with organics. This method allowed normalization of dosing parameters to correlate with removal of color, UV absorbance, plus oxidation of trace organics and nitrosamine precursors. We also showed that zonation effectively reduces the fraction of organic matter characterized as "colloidal organic matter," thereby reducing the potential for membrane fouling.

AB During the 2009 influenza type A(H1N1) pandemic, the antiviral drug oseltamivir (OP, Tamiflu (R)) was extensively used for treatment and prophylaxis after recommendation from World Health Organisation (WHO). Previous studies have indicated that the pharmaceutically active metabolite of OP, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is not readily degraded in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and therefore will be released into receiving waters in elevated concentrations during a pandemic outbreak of influenza. A method for analyzing OP and OC in wastewater by UPLC-TOF has been developed and validated. This analytical method has been used to study the release of OP and OC from a sewage treatment plant outside Oslo, Norway during the 2009 pandemic. Daily flow-proportional influent and effluent samples from 11 weeks covering the main wave of the influenza pandemic were analyzed, and the observed trend in OP and OC concentrations closely followed the trend in percentage of medical consultations caused by influenza-like illness. Concentrations in wastewater influent were in the range of 5-529 ng/L and 28-1213 ng/L for OP and OC, respectively. Concentration data from the 54 influent/effluent sample sets suggest STP removal in the range of -0.8% to 8% for OP and -14% to 0.6% for OC. Statistical analysis of the data sets was inconclusive in determining a removal rate different from 0. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewaters are increasingly being reused in public spaces to supplant the use of potable water. In this study we investigated possible trace organic contaminants in wastewater from a dairy factory applied to a recreation reserve. Samples were taken of recycled dairy factory wastewater used to irrigate the reserve and from the subsurface drainage system after irrigation and after rainfall. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, it was found that irrigation drainage mostly contained different compounds to those in rainfall drainage. This drainage water was found to contain residues of three agrochemicals (dicamba, 0.4 +/- 0.07 mu g/l; (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-acetic acid, 0.4 +/- 0.05 mu g/l; and tetrachloronitroanisole, 0.4 +/- 0.09 mu g/l). Pharmaceuticals were also detected in the wastewater applied to the reserve as was an isomer of dicamba. However these compounds appear to have come from urban or agricultural runoff rather than the factory wastewater. Compounds detected of a possible natural origin included syringicaldehyde (0.06-0.2 mu g/l), and the metabolites 3-methoxy-4-acetoxycinnamic acid (0.1-1.0 mu g/l) and tau-oxo-benzene butanoic acid (0.09-0.1 mu g/l). The reuse of appropriately treated wastewater from the dairy factory can be benign to the reserve and downstream environment but understanding the source of any contaminants is important.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics have been detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents, surface and ground water and even in drinking water all over the world, and therefore have developed as compounds of concern. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment has gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective for an advanced removal of these pollutants. This paper evaluates the treatment of wastewater containing three NSAIDs (acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen) and three antibiotics (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) performed in two MBRs with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 15 (MBR-15) and 30 (MBR-30) days over a period of four weeks. It was observed that NSAIDs were removed with higher efficiencies than the antibiotics for both MBRs, and the MBR-30 presented higher removal efficiencies for all the compounds than obtained by MBR-15. Removal rates ranged from 55% (sulfamethoxazole) up to 100% (acetaminophen, ketoprofen). Besides mineralisation biological transformation products of ketoprofen and naproxen produced by wastewater biocoenosis were identified in both MBR permeates using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results indicated the importance of investigating the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products reaching the environment.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the secondary effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are of great concern in the process of water reuse. Ozonation has been reported as a powerful oxidation technology to eliminate rnicropollutants in water treatment. Due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix, orthogonal experiments and single factor experiments were conducted to study the influence of operational parameters on the degradation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the synthetic secondary effluent. The results of the orthogonal experiments indicated that the initial ozone and natural organic matter (NOM) concentration significantly affected EE2 degradation efficiency, which was further validated by the single factor confirmation experiments. EE2 was shown to be effectively degraded by ozonation in the conditions of low pH (6), NOM (10 mg/L), carbonate (50 mg/L), but high suspended solid (20 mg/L) and initial ozone concentration (9 mg/L). The study firstly revealed that the lower pH resulted in higher degradation of EE2 in the synthetic secondary effluent, which differed from EDCs ozonation behavior in pure water. EE2 degradation by ozone molecule instead of hydroxyl radical was proposed to play a key role in the degradation of EDCs by ozonation in the secondary effluent. The ratio between O-3 and TOC was identified as an appropriate index to assess the degradation of EE2 by ozonation in the synthetic secondary effluent.

AB This research investigated the biological transformation of trimethoprim (TMP). Partial TMP removal was observed in the presence of ammonia and toluene, and increasing the solids retention time from 20 days to 60 days improved TMP removal in both the nitrifying and heterotrophic bioreactors. Two TMP-related metabolites were identified, the first (5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, 5-hydroxyl) showing that a hydroxylation reaction took place, and the second (5-(1-carboxyl, 1-methoxy, 5-methoxy 1-,4-pentene) pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, 5-hydroxyl) showing that the trimethoxybenzyl ring was cleaved. This research is the first that we are aware of to report these two TMP-related byproducts. TMP metabolites show that initiating reactions take place where the electron density is highest, and that these initiating reactions shift the electron density of TMP, likely affecting the course of transformation.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed to have physiological effects on target organisms. Their presence and effect in aquatic ecosystems in the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia is relatively unknown. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are continually introduced to aquatic ecosystems through treated sewage effluent outflows into rivers and other bodies of water. Fouracidic and two neutral pharmaceuticals were monitored in the effluents from nine sewage treatment plants in the Annapolis Valley and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in Nova Scotia. Naproxen and ibuprofen, two highly used OTC drugs, were the most prominent and were detected at high ng/L to low mu g/L levels. Caffeine, salicylic acid (a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid) and cotinine were detected in the ng/L range. Warfarin was not detected above the detection limits. The urban sewage treatment plant in Mill Cove, HRM showed much higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals than rural facilities in the Annapolis Valley, despite the fact that more advanced facilities are used at the urban plant. Receiving waters both downstream and upstream from STP effluent outfalls were also studied, and trace levels of caffeine at several sites indicate some degree of pollution propagation into surrounding aquatic ecosystems.

AB The activated sludge process is the most common method of secondary municipal wastewater treatment; solids retention time (SRT) is the key control parameter for this process. Typically, operating at long SRT is considered only for nitrification, but there are additional benefits of high SRT operation. This paper presents experimental and literature evidence to demonstrate three major additional benefits of long SRT operation: increased oxygen transfer efficiency; improved biomass particle size distribution, which results in more efficient clarification with fewer effluent particles and suspended solids; and enhanced removal of many emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting compounds. This paper presents experimental results from several treatment plants that showed increasing oxygen transfer efficiency and particle size with increasing SRT, and evidence documenting improved removal of emerging contaminants and biodegradable organic carbon. A long-term survey of three treatment plants concludes that operating at higher SRT is not as energy intensive as typically assumed. Water Environ. Res., 84, 42 (2012).

AB Psychoactive pharmaceuticals are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, contributing to persistent measurable concentrations in aquatic systems. Typically, it is assumed that such contaminants have no human health implications because they exist in extremely low concentrations. We exposed juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to three pharmaceuticals, fluoxetine, venlafaxine and carbamazepine, individually and in a mixture, and measured their effect on the induction of gene expression in fish brains using microarray analysis. Gene expression changes were accompanied by behavioral changes and validated by qPCR analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to perform gene-class analysis of gene expression. testing for enrichment of gene sets known to be involved in human neuronal development, regulation and growth. We found significant enrichment of gene sets for each of the treatments, with the largest induction of expression by the mixture treatment. These results suggest that the psychoactive pharmaceuticals are able to alter expression of fish genes associated with development, regulation and differentiation of synapses, neurons and neurotransmitters. The results provide a new perspective for the consideration of potential consequence for human health due to environmental exposure to unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals.

AB The production of pharmaceuticals has increased rapidly during the last several decades as they have been used for the health of both humans and animals. Routes of environmental exposure include the release of treated wastewater, the land disposal of livestock manures and municipal biosolids (i.e. sewage sludge), as well as the use of medicated aquaculture feed. This study deals with application of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes for removing of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone and febantel) and their mixture. According to the results obtained in this work the use of RO (LFC-1 and XLE) and the tight NF (NF90) membranes are recommended to achieve a high level of retention (>95%) of all selected veterinary antibiotics (VAs). Nanofiltration NF270, NF and HL membranes showed a lower rejection of individual components, but much higher in a mixture solution, due to the synergistic effect.

AB Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a toxic and carcinogenic compound that is commonly released from pharmaceutical, chemical and related industry wastewater. Currently, the effects of THF contamination on wastewater are unknown and a better understanding of THF toxicity toward biological processes in wastewater treatment is critical. In this study, we firstly investigated the toxic effects of THF on enzymatic activity and the microbial diversity in activated sludge from a sequencing batch reactor during long-term exposure to 10 mM THF. The activity of five enzymes (catalase, dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and protease) was remarkably decreased in the presence of 10 mM THF during a period of 85 days. Of these five affected enzymes, dehydrogenase activity was close to detection level limits and was nearly completely inhibited. Analysis of the microbial community demonstrated that THF, at a concentration of 10 mM, altered the distribution of microbes within the community and significantly decreased microbial diversity during long-term contamination, according to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. The fraction of Actinobacteria increased in the community, while the fraction of Proteobacteria significantly decreased after THF exposure.

AB Purpose This study was designed to assess the fate and the overall potential impacts of the widely prescribed drugs ranitidine and tramadol after their introduction into the aquatic environment.
   Methods The probability to detect these two drugs in the aquatic environment was studied by analyzing their abiotic and biotic degradation properties. For this purpose, samples were irradiated with different light sources, and three widely used biodegradability tests from the OECD series, the closed bottle test (OECD 301 D), the manometric respirometry test (OECD 301 F) and the Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B), were conducted. The ecotoxicity of the photolytically formed transformation products was assessed by performing the bacterial growth inhibition test (EN ISO 10712). Furthermore, quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis and a risk analysis based on the calculation of the predicted environmental concentrations have also been conducted to assess the environmental risk potential of the transformation products. The possible formation of stable products by microbial or photolytical transformation has been investigated with DOC and LC-MS analytics.
   Results In the present study, neither ranitidine, nor tramadol, nor their photoderivatives were found to be readily or inherently biodegradable according to test guidelines. The photolytic transformation was faster under a UV lamp compared to the reaction under an Xe lamp with a spectrum that mimics sunlight. No chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for ranitidine or its photolytic decomposition products, but a low toxicity was detected for the resulting mixture of the photolytic transformation products of tramadol.
   Conclusions The study demonstrates that transformation products may have a higher environmental risk potential than the respective parent compounds.

AB Eleven selected antibiotics in the East River, South China, were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-EI-MS-MS). Erythromycin, roxitromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine and trimethoprim were detected with frequencies of more than 75%, and average concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 67.4 ng l(-1). The other three compounds' (sulfathiazole, sulfacetamide and spiramycin) concentrations were below detection limits. In general, the concentrations of sulfonamides and trimethoprim were higher than those of macrolides. The concentrations of macrolides showed a spatial distribution pattern of delta > lower reach > middle reach (or urban area > agriculture area), while sulfonamides and trimethoprim did not have a significant spatial pattern. Principal component analysis and comparison with wastewater were further used to explore source information of the antibiotics. The results suggested that macrolides in the East River were mainly associated with domestic sewage, while sulfonamides and trimethoprim may be more related to agriculture wastewater, especially livestock industrial wastewater. It is suggested that to ensure/improve the drinking water quality in the region, a better pollution control of livestock industry in the lower and middle reaches is of critical importance.

ID PRETREATMENT; DEGRADATION; MECHANISM; SYSTEM
AB A multilayer internal electrolysis reactor treating actual pharmaceutical wastewater was established to evaluate the ecological safety and feasibility of internal electrolysis processes. Our findings showed that about 20 % COD of the pharmaceutical wastewater was removed by the internal electrolysis reactor. The COD removal efficiencies increased initially and then decreased with the increase in influent concentrations. The best COD removal was observed at pH 4. Additionally, injection of air into the reactor can promote COD removal compared with non-aeration conditions. All eta(B/C) and eta(ROUR) values under every condition were positive, which indicated the enhancement effects on the wastewater biodegradability after treatment. The effects of influent COD concentrations on eta(B/C) and eta(ROUR) showed a similar trend with that of COD removal, suggesting that the biodegradability enhancement was mainly caused by COD removal in wastewater. High pH helped to improve the wastewater biodegradability while aeration lowered the biodegradability enhancements.

AB Water samples from streams, brooks and storm sewer outfall pipes that collect storm waters across the Island of Montreal were analyzed for caffeine, carbamazepine and fecal coliforms. All samples contained various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and caffeine levels ranged over several orders of magnitude with a modest correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R-2 value of 0.558). An arbitrary threshold of 400 ng caffeine L-1 allows us to identify samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than 200 colony-forming units per 100 mL (cfu 100 mL(-1)) of fecal coliforms. Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban environment, is widely contaminated by domestic sewers as indicated by the ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and carbamazepine. Caffeine concentrations were relatively well correlated to fecal coliforms, and could potentially be used as a chemical indicator of the level of contamination by sanitary sources. The carbamazepine data was not significantly correlated to fecal coliforms and of little use in this dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photolysis of caffeine was studied in solutions of fulvic acid isolated from Suwannee River, GA (SRFA) and Old Woman Creek Natural Estuarine Research Reserve, OH (OWCFA) with different chemical amendments (nitrate and iron). Caffeine degrades slowly by direct photolysis (>170 h in artificial sunlight), but we observed enhanced photodegradation in waters containing the fulvic acids. At higher initial concentrations (10 mu M) the indirect photolysis of caffeine occurs predominantly through reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH.) generated by irradiated fulvic acids. Both rate constant estimates based upon measured OH. steady-state concentrations and quenching studies using isopropanol corroborate the importance of this pathway. Further, OH center dot generated by irradiated nitrate at concentrations present in wastewater effluent plays an important role as a photosensitizer even in the presence of fulvic acids, while the photo-Fenton pathway does not at neutral or higher pH. At lower initial concentrations (0.1 mu M) caffeine photolysis reactions proceed even more quickly in fulvic acid solutions and are influenced by both short- and long-lived reactive species. Studies conducted under suboxic conditions suggest that an oxygen dependent long-lived radical e.g., peroxyl radicals plays an important role in the degradation of caffeine at lower initial concentration.

AB The aim of this work is to establish baseline levels of pharmaceuticals in three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) streams in the greater Dublin region to assess the removal efficiency of the selected WWTPs and to investigate the existence of any seasonal variability. Twenty compounds including several classes of antibiotics, acidic and basic pharmaceuticals, and prescribed medications were selected for investigation using a combination of membrane filtration, solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Fourteen of the selected compounds were found in the samples. Increased effluent concentrations, compared to influent concentrations, for a number of compounds (carbamazepine, clotrimazole, propranolol, nimesulide, furosemide, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, metoprolol, and gemfibrozil) were observed. The detected concentrations were generally below toxicity levels and based on current knowledge are unlikely to pose any threat to aquatic species. Mefenamic acid concentrations detected in both Leixlip and Swords effluents may potentially exert ecotoxicological effects with maximum risk quotients (i.e., ratio of predicted exposure concentration to predicted no effect concentration) of 4.04 and 1.33, respectively.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical substances in the municipal effluents is currently considered the principal source of bio-active molecule emissions into aquatic environments. This study analyzes the genotoxic damage caused by gemfibrozil and atorvastatin, two regulators of the hematic level of lipids, and sildenafil citrate, a vasodilator, on the teleost Danio rerio. The genotoxicity of these three compounds was evaluated using the comet assay, diffusion assay, and RAPD-PCR. The alkaline version (pH 12.1) of the comet assay was used for the erythrocytes of the zebrafish to evaluate the presence of single strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, the diffusion assay was used to estimate the number of apoptotic cells. The fish were treated with the three pharmacological agents at the average concentrations previously found at some Italian treatment plants and were then sacrificed from 5 to 35 days after exposure. The data of the comet assay showed a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity after 5 days of exposure to atorvastatin and after one week of exposure to gemfibrozil. This damage was, however, repaired after 14 days. Sildenafil citrate produced, instead, a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity at the concentrations found only after 35 days of exposure. The genotoxicity at the molecular level was tested by RAPD-PCR. The results from this investigation are in agreement with those from two other tests, confirming the efficacy of the use of the three experimental approaches for the complete evaluation of genotoxic damage.

AB There is increasing concern about chemical pollutants that have the ability to mimic hormones, the so-called endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). One of the main reasons for concern is the possible effect of EDCs on human health. EDCs may be released into the environment in different ways, and one of the most significant sources is industrial wastewater. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the treatment performance of different wastewater treatment procedures (biological treatment, filtration, advanced oxidation processes) for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand and seven selected EDCs (dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from wastewaters from a mill producing 100% recycled paper. Two pilot plants were running in parallel and the following treatments were compared: (i) anaerobic biological treatment followed by aerobic biological treatment, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO), and (ii) anaerobic biological treatment followed by membrane bioreactor and RO. Moreover, at lab-scale, four different advanced oxidation processes (Fenton reaction, photo-Fenton reaction, photocatalysis with TiO2, and ozonation) were applied. The results indicated that the concentrations of selected EDCs from paper mill wastewaters were effectively reduced (100 %) by both combinations of pilot plants and photo-Fenton oxidation (98 %), while Fenton process, photocatalysis with TiO2 and ozonation were less effective (70 % to 90 %, respectively).

AB Surface sediments from 12 different locations of the Istanbul Strait and Marmara Sea, Turkey were analysed for five antibiotics belonging to two different groups of widely used pharmaceuticals, tetracyclines (TCs) and fluoroquinolones (FQs), by solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography. These two groups of antibiotics, mainly used to prevent or treat illness for humans as well as for animals, are frequently detected in the effluent of municipal sewage plants, in the aquatic environments and in soils after being spread by liquid manure. The results of analysis revealed that measured concentrations of individual antibiotics were significantly different depending on sampling location. Chlortetracycline (CTC) was not detected in any of the samples. High concentrations were mainly found in urbanized regions of the Strait. The concentrations of the two tetracyclines ranged from not detectable to 27.3 mu g kg(-1) in freeze-dried marine sediments. Comparable results were obtained for the two fluoroquinolones with concentration levels from 1.3 mu g kg(-1) up 34.1 mu g kg(-1). This study is the first attempt to show the contamination degree of the Istanbul Strait sediments by emerging contaminants. Particular concern should be given concerning their potential side effects caused by the frequent consumption of mussels and fishes captured in the Istanbul Strait.

AB Antibiotics are biologically active compounds that are routinely detected in the environment and usually associated with treated wastewater discharge. Due to their high biological activity, antibiotics may have more environmental impacts than other pharmaceuticals. Wetlands are often used to treat or polish wastewater, with the goals of reducing nutrient and carbon loading into the environment. Nitrogen and carbon processing in wetlands is largely associated with microbial activity, however impacts to microbial activity due to antibiotic loading into treatment wetlands is relatively unknown. Two wetland soils (mineral and peat) were individually spiked with ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline ranging from 1-1000 ppb to examine effects on microbial mediated evolution of CH4, CO2 and N-2. The antibiotics both positively and negatively affected microbial respiration (a proxy for microbial activity) rates in the two wetland soils depending on soil properties and concentration. Sulfamethoxazole reduced CO2 and N2O respiration rates at higher concentrations (500, 1000 ppb) in the mineral soil. However, the CO2 rates recovered within 48 hours, while N2O suppression continued through the end of the incubation. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole also demonstrated the ability to suppress respiration at low spiking concentrations (1, 50 ppb) for several treatments. The results demonstrate the ability of antibiotics to impact soil respiration at environmentally relevant concentrations. Parameters that appear to affect the impacts of antibiotics were sorption, length of exposure and soil carbon content. Future studies are needed to provide further insight into antibiotic effects to microbial community structure.

AB Detection of estrogenic disrupting compounds (EDCs) in drinking waters around China has led to rising concerns about health risks associated with these compounds. There is, however, a paucity of studies on the occurrence and identification of the main compounds responsible for this pollution in the source waters. To fill this void, we screened estrogenic activities of 23 source water samples from six main river systems in China, using a recombinant two-hybrid yeast assay. All sample extracts induced significant estrogenic activity, with E2 equivalents (EEQ) of raw water ranging from 0.08 to 2.40 ng/L. Additionally, 16 samples were selected for chemical analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EDCs of most concern, including estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estriol (E3), diethylstilbestrol (DES), estradiol valerate (EV), 4-t-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-nonylphenols (4-NP) and bisphenol A (BPA), were determined at concentrations of up to 2.98, 1.07, 2.67, 4.37, 2.52, 1.96, 89.52, 280.19 and 710.65 ng/L, respectively. Causality analysis, involving comparison of EEQ values from yeast assay and chemical analysis identified E2, EE2 and 4-NP as the main responsible compounds, accounting for the whole estrogenic activities (39.74% to 96.68%). The proposed approach using both chemical analysis and yeast assay could be used for the identification and evaluation of EDCs in source waters of China.

AB Municipal water recycling may expose humans and the environment to trace organic contaminants. We assessed biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration for removal of organic micropollutants (MPs). Adsorption experiments were carried out in batch reactors containing secondary effluent and new granular activated carbon (GAC) and preloaded BAC media. Results show that BAC has good potential for removal of dissolved organic carbon (40%) and MPs (60-95%). The primary objective was to better understand removal mechanisms of representative MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations. Adsorption and biodegradation of 20 compounds of varying physico-chemical properties were investigated by inhibiting the biomass with azide. Average removal of compounds by adsorption on GAC was 88 +/- 5% with no influence of azide. Average BAC removal was 72 +/- 15%, reduced to 59 +/- 20% after azide addition, showing that biological activity is important for MP removal. Comparison of MP removal by BAC and BAC + azide showed a more important impact of the inhibition on the removal of negatively charged compounds. Sustained removal of recalcitrant compounds showed that BAC maintained sorption capacity. These results highlight the advantage of a combination of adsorption and biodegradation as compared to other biofiltration techniques for the long-term attenuation of MPs.

   aquifer treatment (SAT)
AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is considered to be an alternative technique able to enhance recharged water quality for aquifer recharge purposes. It allows the reuse of treated wastewater, which usually contains some recalcitrant organic micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This study reports the removal capacity for a selection of organic micropollutants during SAT and the characterisation of the recharge system for the interpretation of the data. The experiment was performed in Angerville (France), where the treated wastewater effluent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is directly infiltrated through an excavated infiltration pond after biological treatment. The system was instrumented by installing piezometers downgradient of the infiltration pond, which were monitored, together with other reference points, and analysed for detailed interpretation. Results on the site characterisation allowed the quantification of the mixing proportion of the recharge water and groundwater and identification of the redox conditions encountered within the aquifer. With respect to the targeted micropollutants, results showed that they exhibited different behaviour during infiltration. Examples of atrazine, gemfibrozil and carbamazepine are discussed as a representation of the most characteristic patterns of organic contaminant fate after recharge.

AB In membrane processes, various agents are used to enhance, protect, and recover membrane performance. Applying these agents in membrane modification could potentially be considered as a simple method to improve membrane performance without additional process. Citric acid (CI) and sodium bisulfite (SB) are two chemicals that are widely used in membrane feed water pretreatment and cleaning processes. In this work, preadsorptions of CI and SB were developed as simple methods for polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane modification. It was found that hydrogen bonding and Van Der Waals attraction could be responsible for the adsorptions of CI and SB onto membranes, respectively. After modification with CI or SB, the membrane surfaces became more hydrophilic. Membrane permeability improved when modified by SB while decreased a little when modified by CI. The modified membranes had an increase in PEG and BSA rejections and better antifouling properties with higher flux recovery ratios during filtration of a complex pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, membrane chlorine tolerance was elevated after modification with either agent, as shown by the mechanical property measurements.

AB Azo dyes constitute the largest and most versatile class of synthetic dyes used in the textile, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries and represent major components in wastewater from these industrial dying processes. Biological decolorization of azo dyes occurs efficiently under low oxygen to anaerobic conditions. However, this process results in the formation of toxic and carcinogenic amines that are resistant to further detoxification under low oxygen conditions. Moreover, the ability to detoxify these amines under aerobic conditions is not a wide spread metabolic activity. In this study we describe the use of Brevibacterium sp. strain VN-15, isolated from an activated sludge process of a textile company, for the sequential decolorization and detoxification of the azo dyes Reactive Yellow 107 (RY107), Reactive Black 5 (RB5), Reactive Red 198 (RR198) and Direct Blue 71 (DB71). Tyrosinase activity was observed during the biotreatment process suggesting the role of this enzyme in the decolorization and degradation process, but no-activity was observed for laccase and peroxidase. Toxicity, measured using Daphnia magna, was completely eliminated.

AB The Leca River and two beaches close to the north and south margins of the estuary, nowadays an important seaport harbor, show signs of contamination. However, the chemical nature of that contamination is uncertain. Therefore, this study checked for the presence of 11 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) of animal (17 beta-estradiol and estrone), pharmaceutical (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol), and industrial (alkylphenols, alkylphenol ethoxylates, and bisphenol A) origins in water samples collected from six points at the river gradient and at two sites in the coastline (Atlantic Ocean). Along with the EDCs, evaluated by gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) during spring, summer, and autumn, physico-chemical parameters were also assessed and particular attention was given to dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Data showed the presence of high amounts of estrogens (up to 10 ng L-1 for estrone) and industrial compounds (up to 2 mu g L-1 for the nonylphenol ethoxylates) at both river and seacoast. Along with this, clear signs of hypoxia were found in the river (DO < 3 mg L-1 at several sampling sites). Taking into account these issues, it was concluded that there are local conditions for the occurrence of endocrine disruption in aquatic animals.

AB The present study demonstrates the high potential for the application of a novel self assembled positively charged nanofiltration membrane, PA6DT-C, in processes such as the recovery of valuable cationic macromolecules in the bioprocess and pharmaceutical industries or removal of multi-valent cations such as dyes and heavy metals in the paper and pulp, textiles, nuclear, and automotive industries. The nanofiltration membrane, prepared in this laboratory, is further characterised and then tested for the removal and recovery of Methylene Blue from a synthetic dye house wastewater. The characterisation process involved the construction of a rejection profile for NaCl over a wide range of pH and concentration, which illustrates that the optimal process conditions for the removal of small cations using this membrane is in the region pH <8.0 and concentration less than 15 mol rn(-3). The salt rejection data was used to calculate the magnitude of the effective membrane charge density and this was found to be significantly higher for the PA6DT-C membrane than two commercially available membranes (Desal-DK and Nanomax-50). The membrane flux for this new membrane is also superior to the commercial membranes with an approximate increase of 3-4 fold. The PA6DT-C membrane was successful in removal of methylene Blue dye from synthetic dye house wastewaters achieving 98% rejection and a membrane flux of similar to 17 LMH bar(-1). Thus, this new membrane both adds to and complements the existing short supply of positively charged NF membranes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The growing demand on water resources has increased the interest in wastewater reclamation for multiple end-use applications such as indirect and direct potable reuse. In these applications, the removal of organic micropollutants is of a greater concern than in conventional wastewater treatment. This article presents a collection of data of trace organic micropollutants in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in North East Spain using reverse osmosis (RO) membrane treatment. The RO rejection values of the organic molecules studied with a wide range of solute size and hydrophobicity were determined. Several chromatographic methods monitoring different endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were used. Results indicated that secondary effluents from this Spanish WWTP contained most of the studied organic compounds indicating incomplete removal of organics in the conventional treatment of the plant. However, the rejection of most micropollutants was high for all three RO membrane types (low energy, high rejection, fouling resistant) tested. It was observed that some selected micropollutants were less efficiently removed (e.g. the small and polar and the more hydrophobic) and the molecular weight and membrane material influenced removal efficiencies.

AB A study was carried out by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies to establish the efficiency of adsorption of fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLU), onto a crosslinked beta-cyclodextrin-carboxymethylcellulose (beta-CD-CMC) polymer. The adsorption was performed in mixtures containing aqueous FLU solution at 20 mg/L and 0.01-0.30 g of the beta-CD-CMC polymer, at 25 degrees C, and atmospheric pressure under stirring. The results have revealed that the adsorption is a rapid process and the polymer possesses a high affinity for FLU with an adsorption capacity of 5.076 mg of FLU/g of polymer. This adsorption may involve the formation of a stable inclusion compound beta-CD-CMC/FLU through the penetration of the FLU aromatic ring (A and/or B) into the beta-CD cavity, and a physical adsorption with the polymer network. The inclusion compound can be stabilized by the formation of H-bonds between the -CF3 group of FLU and the 6'-OH group of beta-CD, and van der Waals interactions between the FLU aromatic ring and beta-CD cavity. The data from a kinetic study have also indicated that the adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, in which the initial adsorption rate and constant were estimated at 1.938 mg/g min and 0.075 g/mg min, respectively. Moreover, the results of adsorption equilibrium fitted the Freundlich isotherm, indicating a multilayer coverage and heterogeneous surface. Together, these results suggest that the adsorption of FLU onto the crosslinked beta-CD-CMC polymer could constitute an advantageous technology for removing this commonly used antidepressant drug from wastewater due to the high adsorption capacity of the polymer and non-toxic character of beta-CD to humans and environment.

AB During the last decade, several screening programs for pharmaceuticals at Swedish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been conducted by research institutes, county councils, and wastewater treatment companies. In this study, influent and effluent concentrations compiled from these screening programs were used to assess the occurrence and reduction of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals for human usage. The study is limited to full-scale WWTPs with biological treatment. Based on the data compiled, a total of 70 non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals have been detected, at concentrations ranging from a few ng/L to several mu g/L, in the influent water. The influent concentrations were compared with the sale volumes and for many pharmaceuticals it was shown that only a small fraction of the amount sold reaches WWTPs as dissolved parent compounds. Pharmaceuticals with low reduction degrees at traditional WWTPs were identified. Further comparison based on the biological treatment showed lower reduction degrees for several pharmaceuticals in trickling filter plants compared with activated sludge plants with nitrogen removal.

AB In recent years, worldwide awareness of an aquatic environment polluted by organic trace pollutants, e. g. pharmaceutical residues and industrial chemicals, has risen tremendously. The present paper outlines similarities and differences in how to face the organic trace pollutants occurring in the natural and urban water cycles in Germany and China. Our joint review clearly shows that this emerging environmental problem is in both countries being widely discussed on a scientific level and it is evidently perceived in a comparable way. However, while the state of knowledge, which is still unsatisfactory, induces further investigations in China, the research activities in Germany have already led to first full-scale applications to remove trace pollutants. While Germany seems to be one step ahead, China possibly is in a better position for a later trace pollutants removal due to the massively increasing use of membrane bioreactors as a key technology for the necessary expansion of wastewater treatment capacities.

AB Emerging wastewater treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have attracted a significant amount of interest internationally due to their ability to produce high quality effluent suitable for water recycling. It is therefore important that their efficiency in removing hazardous trace organic contaminants be assessed. Accordingly, this study investigated the removal of trace organic chemical contaminants through a full-scale, package MBR in New South Wales, Australia. This study was unique in the context of MBR research because it characterised the removal of 48 trace organic chemical contaminants, which included steroidal hormones, xenoestrogens, pesticides, caffeine, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results showed that the removal of most trace organic chemical contaminants through the MBR was high (above 90%). However, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, omeprazole, sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim were only partially removed through the MBR with the removal efficiencies of 24-68%. These are potential indicators for assessing MBR performance as these chemicals are usually sensitive to changes in the treatment systems. The trace organic chemical contaminants detected in the MBR permeate were 1 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than guideline values reported in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. The outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of the levels and removal of trace organic contaminants by MBRs.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micropollutants at the microgram per litre range. During the present work more than 100 substances were analysed through on-site mass balances over 19 municipal wastewater treatment lines. The most relevant substances according to their occurrence in raw wastewater, in treated wastewater and in sludge were identified, and their fate in wastewater treatment processes was assessed. About half of priority substances of WFD were found at concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g/L in wastewater. For 26 substances, potential non-compliance with Environmental Quality Standard of Water Framework Directive has been identified in treated wastewater, depending on river flow. Main concerns are for Cd, DEHP, diuron, alkylphenols, and chloroform. Emerging substances of particular concern are by-products, organic chemicals (e. g. triclosan, benzothiazole) and pharmaceuticals (e. g. ketoprofen, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine). About 80% of the load of micropollutants was removed by conventional activated sludge plants, but about two-thirds of removed substances were mainly transferred to sludge.

Ciprofloxacin inhibits active and growing microorganisms and therefore can represent an important risk for the environment, especially for soil microbial ecology and microbial ecosystem services. We investigated the biodegradation of C-14-ciprofloxacin in water and soil following OECD tests (301B, 307) to compare its fate in both systems. Ciprofloxacin is recalcitrant to biodegradation and transformation in the aqueous system. However, some mineralisation was observed in soil. The lower bioavailability of ciprofloxacin seems to reduce the compound's toxicity against microorganisms and allows its biodegradation. Moreover, ciprofloxacin strongly inhibits the microbial activities in both systems. Higher inhibition was observed in water than in soil and although its antimicrobial potency is reduced by sorption and aging in soil, ciprofloxacin remains biologically active over time. Therefore sorption does not completely eliminate the effects of this compound. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using diclofenac (DFC) as a template, 2-vinylpyridine (2-VP) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker, and toluene as porogen. The MIP showed outstanding affinity toward DFC in aqueous solution with a binding site capacity (Q(max)) of 324.8 mg/g (1.09 mmol/g) and was used as solid-phase extraction (SPE) material for the quantitative enrichment of DFC in environmental water samples and off-line coupled to a reversed-phase HPLC/DAD. Various parameters including washing solvent, elution solvent and breakthrough volume affecting the extraction efficiency of the polymers have been evaluated to achieve the selective preconcentration of DFC from water samples and to reduce nonspecific interactions. Recoveries of DFC extracted from tap water, river water and wastewater samples were higher than 95%, and no significant DFC recovery difference was obtained among the different water matrix. The stability of MIP was tested by consecutive percolation of water sample, and it was shown that the performance of the MIP did not vary even after 30 adsorption and desorption cycles. Furthermore, the MISPE was used for the analysis of DFC in river water and wastewater samples and revealed DFC concentrations of 0.69 +/- 0.002 mu g/L (n = 3) and 0.31 +/- 0.004 mu g/L (n = 3), respectively. The results were in good agreement with corresponding LC-MS/MS data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A full-scale novel combined anaerobic/micro-aerobic and two-stage aerobic biological process is used for the treatment of an actual chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing amoxicillin. The anaerobic system is an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), the micro-aerobic system is a novel micro-aerobic hydrolysis acidification reactor (NHAR) and the two-stage aerobic process comprised cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) and biological contact oxidation tank (BCOT). The influent wastewater was high in COD, NH3-N varying daily 4016-13,093 mg-COD L-1 and 156.4-650.2 mg-NH3-N L-1, amoxicillin varying weekly between 69.1 and 105.4 mg-amoxicillin L-1, respectively; Almost all the COD, NH3-N, amoxicillin were removed by the biological combined system, with removal percentages 97%, 93.4% and 97.2%, respectively, leaving around 104 mg-COD L-1, 9.4 mg-NH3-N L-1 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 mg-amoxicillin L-1 in the final clarifier effluent. The performance evaluation of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) by mathematical statistic methods shown that at most of time effluent can meet the higher treatment discharge standard. In addition, the fate of amoxicillin in the full-scale WWTP and the amoxicillin removal rate of each different removal routes in UASB, NHAR, CASS, BCOT and final clarifier processes are investigated in this paper. The results show that biodegradation, adsorption and hydrolysis are the major mechanisms for amoxicillin removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eighty-six water samples were collected in early 2009 from Costa Rican surface water and coastal locations for the analysis of 34 pharmaceutical and personal care product compounds (PPCPs). Sampling sites included areas receiving treated and untreated wastewaters, and urban and rural runoff. PPCPs were analyzed using a combination of solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The five most frequently detected compounds were doxycycline (77%), sulfadimethoxine (43%), salicylic acid (41%), triclosan (34%) and caffeine (29%). Caffeine had the maximum concentration of 1.1 mg L-1, possibly due to coffee bean production facilities upstream. Other compounds found in high concentrations include: doxycycline (74 mu g L-1), ibuprofen (37 mu g L-1), gemfibrozil (17 mu g L-1), acetominophen (13 mu g L-1) and ketoprofen (10 mu g L-1). The wastewater effluent collected from an oxidation pond had similar detection and concentrations of compounds compared to other studies reported in the literature. Waters receiving runoff from a nearby hospital showed higher concentrations than other areas for many PPCPs. Both caffeine and carbamazepine were found in low frequency compared to other studies, likely due to enhanced degradation and low usage, respectively. Overall concentrations of PPCPs in surface waters of Costa Rica are inline with currently reported occurrence data from around the world, with the exception of doxycycline. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The efficiency of homogeneous Fenton oxidation induced by simulated solar radiation to remove 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen hormone, from secondary treated effluents was investigated. Solar radiation was simulated with a 150W xenon lamp and experiments were conducted varying initial effluent pH (3-8), EE2 concentration (70-315 mu g/L), H2O2 concentration (1.5-86 mg/L) and Fe2+ concentration (1-5 mg/L). Changes in estrogen concentration were followed by high performance liquid chromatography. EE2 was readily oxidizable at acidic conditions (pH = 3) with complete conversion typically occurring in 5-10 min of irradiation at, e.g. 5 mg/L Fe2+, 4.3-15 mg/L H2O2 and 200 mu g/L EE2 concentration. The process involves two distinct kinetic regimes, a fast one during the very first minutes followed by a far slower one. The contribution of dark Fenton reactions to degradation was found to be considerable, particularly at higher concentrations of Fenton's reagents: nonetheless, the beneficial role of simulated solar irradiation was noticeable at lower concentrations and even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, as well as for the mineralization of the effluent organic matter. Two natural hormones, namely estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were also tested and their reactivity values were nearly equal to EE2. The implications for tertiary wastewater treatment (removal of pathogens and estrogenicity) are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread occurrence of feminized male fish downstream of some UK Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTWs) has been associated with exposure to estrogenic and potentially antiandrogenic (AA) contaminants in the effluents. In this study, profiling of AA contaminants in WwTW effluents and fish was conducted using HPLC in combination with in vitro androgen receptor transcription screens. Analysis of extracts of wastewater effluents revealed complex profiles of AA activity comprising 21-53 HPLC fractions. Structures of bioavailable antiandrogens were identified by exposing rainbow trout to a WwTW effluent and profiling the bile for AA activity using yeast (anti-YAS) and mammalian-based (AR-CALUX) androgen receptor transcription screens. The predominant fractions with AA activity in both androgen receptor screens contained the germicides chlorophene and triclosan, and together these contaminants accounted for 51% of the total anti-YAS activity in the fish bile. Other AA compounds identified in bile included chloroxylenol, dichlorophene, resin acids, napthols, oxybenzone, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A. Pure standards of these compounds were active in the androgen receptor screens at potencies relative to flutamide of between 0.1 and 13.0. Thus, we have identified, for the first time, a diverse range of AA chemicals in WwTWs that are bioavailable to fish and which need to be assessed for their risk to the reproductive health of these organisms and other aquatic biota.

AB As forward osmosis (FO) gains attention as an efficient technology to improve wastewater reclamation processes, it is fundamental to determine the influence of fouling in the rejection of emerging contaminants (micropollutants). This study focuses on the rejection of 13 selected micropollutants, spiked in a secondary wastewater effluent, by a FO membrane, using Red Sea water as draw solution (DS), differentiating the effects on the rejection caused by a clean and fouled membrane. The resulting effluent was then desalinated at low pressure with a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, to produce a high quality permeate and determine the rejection with a coupled forward osmosis - low pressure reverse osmosis (FO-LPRO) system. When considering only FO with a clean membrane, the rejection of the hydrophilic neutral compounds was between 48.6% and 84.7%, for the hydrophobic neutrals the rejection ranged from 40.0% to 87.5%, and for the ionic compounds the rejections were between 92.9% and 96.5%. With a fouled membrane, the rejections were between 44.6% and 95.2%, 48.7%-91.5% and 96.9%-98.6%, respectively. These results suggest that, except for the hydrophilic neutral compounds, the rejection of the micropollutants is increased by the presence of a fouling layer, possibly due to the higher hydrophilicity of the FO fouled membrane compared to the clean one, the increased adsorption capacity of hydrophilic compounds and reduced mass transport capacity, membrane swelling, and the higher negative charge of the membrane surface, related to the foulants composition, mainly NOM acids (carboxylic radicals) and polysaccharides or polysaccharide-like substances. However, when coupled with RO, the rejections in both cases increased above 96%. The coupled FO-LPRO system was an effective double barrier against the selected micropollutants.

AB An assessment of the sewage occurrence and biodegradability of seven parabens and three halogenated derivatives of methyl paraben (MeP) is presented. Several wastewater samples were collected at three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during April and May 2010, concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). The performance of the QTOF system proved to be comparable to triple-quadrupole instruments in terms of quantitative capabilities, with good linearity (R(2) > 0.99 in the 5-500 ng mL(-1) range), repeatability (RSD < 5.6%) and LODs (0.3-4.0 ng L(-1) after SPE). MeP and n-propyl paraben (n-PrP) were the most frequently detected and the most abundant analytes in raw wastewater (0.3-10 mu g L(-1)), in accordance with the data displayed in the bibliography and reflecting their wider use in cosmetic formulations. Samples were also evaluated in search for potential halogenated by-products of parabens, formed as a result of their reaction with residual chlorine contained in tap water. Monochloro- and dichloro-methyl paraben (ClMeP and Cl(2)MeP) were found and quantified in raw wastewater at levels between 0.01 and 0.1 mu g L(-1). Halogenated derivatives of n-PrP could not be quantified due to the lack of standards; nevertheless, the monochlorinated species (ClPrP) was identified in several samples from its accurate precursor and product ions mass/charge ratios (m/z). Removal efficiencies of parabens and MeP chlorinated by-products in WWTPs exceeded 90%, with the lowest percentages corresponding to the latter species. This trend was confirmed by an activated sludge biodegradation batch test, where non-halogenated parabens had half-lives lower than 4 days, whereas halogenated derivatives of MeP turned out to be more persistent, with up to 10 days of half-life in the case of dihalogenated derivatives. A further stability test performed with raw wastewater also showed that parabens degrade rapidly in real sewage, with half-lives lower than 10 h for n-butyl-paraben, while dihalogenated species again turned out to be more stable, with half-lives longer than a week.

AB A new sorbent was prepared by loading rhodamine B on Amberlite IR-120. Various physico-chemical parameters such as effects of adsorbate concentration, contact time, pH, and temperature on the sorption of the dye have been studied. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) were also evaluated for the sorption of dye. Kinetic studies revealed that the sorption of the dye was best fit for pseudo-second-order kinetic. The metal ion uptake in different solvent systems has been explored through column studies. On the basis of distribution coefficient (K-d), some heavy metal ions of analytical interest from binary mixtures have been separated. The limit of detection (LOD) for the Ni2+ and Fe3+ metal ions was 0.81 and 0.60 mu gL(-1), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 2.72 and 2.0 mu gL(-1). This sorbent has also been successfully applied in the analysis of multivitamin formulation. The applicability of the modified resin in the separation of heavy metals constituting real and synthetic samples has been explored.

AB In the present study, aquatic concentrations of seven parabens were determined in urban streams highly affected by treated or untreated domestic sewage in Tokushima and Osaka, Japan. The detected highest concentrations were 670, 207, and 163 ng l(-1) for methylparaben, n-propylparaben, and n-butylparaben, respectively in sampling sites with watershed area of no sewer system in Tokushima. Conventional acute/chronic toxicity tests were conducted using medaka (Oryzias latipes), Daphnia magna, and Psuedokirchneriella subcapitata for four parabens, which was consistent with our previous study on three parabens, n-butylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben. The aquatic toxicity on fish, daphnia, and algae was weaker for the parabens with a shorter alkyl chain than those with a longer alkyl chain as predicted by their hydrophobicity. Medaka vitellogenin assays and DNA microarray analysis were carried out for methylparaben and found induction of significant vitellogenin in male medaka at 630 mu g l(-1) of methylparaben, while the expression levels of genes encoding proteins such as choriogenin and vitellogenin increased for concentrations at 10 mu g l(-1) of methylparaben. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of seven parabens in Tokushima and Osaka were divided by predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) and hazard quotient (MEC/PNEC) was determined for individual parabens. The MEC/PNEC was highest for n-propylparaben and was 0.010 followed by n-butylparaben (max. of 0.0086) and methylparaben (max. of 0.0042). The sum of the MEC/PNEC for the seven parabens was 0.0049. Equivalence factors were assigned for each paraben on the basis of the toxicity of n-butylparaben for each species, and n-butylparaben equivalence was calculated for the measured environmental concentrations. The MEC/PNEC approach was also conducted for the n-butyl-paraben-based equivalence values. The maximum MEC/PNEC was 0.018, which is lower than the trigger level for further detailed study such as large-scale monitoring for chronic toxicity tests including full-life cycle tests for fish.

AB Biocatalyst behavior was comparatively evaluated under diverse microenvironments viz., self-induced electrogenic (bioelectrochemical treatment, BET) and anaerobic treatment (AnT) microenvironments, with real-field pharmaceutical wastewater. Relatively higher treatment efficiency was observed with BET (COD removal, 78.70%) over AnT (32%) along with the power output. Voltammetric profiles of AnT showed persistent reduction behavior, while BET depicted simultaneous redox behavior. BET operation documented significantly higher bio-electrocatalytic activity (k(app), 245.22 s(-1)) than AnT (k(app) 7.35 s(-1)). The electron accepting conditions due to the presence of electrode in the BET might contributed to higher electrogenesis leading to enhanced substrate degradation along with the removal of multiple pollutants accounting for the effective reduction of toxicity levels of wastewater. Even at higher organic loads, BET operation showed good treatment efficiency without process inhibition. Introduction of electrode-membrane assembly in anaerobic microenvironment showed significant change in the electrocatalytic behavior of biocatalyst resulting in enhanced treatment of complex wastewater.

AB The present study investigated the growth inhibition effect of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin on four photoautotrophic aquatic species: the freshwater microalga Desmodesmus subspicatus, the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae, the monocotyledonous macrophyte Lemna minor, and the dicotyledonous macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum. Both antibiotics, which act by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase, demonstrated high toxicity to A. flos-aquae and L. minor and moderate to slight toxicity to D. subspicatus and M. spicatum. The cyanobacterium was the most sensitive species with median effective concentration (EC50) values of 173 and 10.2 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Lemna minor proved to be similarly sensitive, with EC50 values of 107 and 62.5 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. While enrofloxacin was more toxic to green algae, ciprofloxacin was more toxic to cyanobacteria. Calculated EC50s for D. subspicatus were 5,568 mu g/L and >8,042 mu g/L for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. These data, as well as effect data from the literature, were compared with predicted and reported environmental concentrations. For two of the four species, a risk was identified at ciprofloxacin concentrations found in surface waters, sewage treatment plant influents and effluents, as well as in hospital effluents. For ciprofloxacin the results of the present study indicate a risk even at the predicted environmental concentration. In contrast, for enrofloxacin no risk was identified at predicted and measured concentrations. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2786-2792. (C) 2011 SETAC

AB Purpose Although the ubiquity of pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater has now been well documented, their fate and risk during beneficial wastewater reuse are far less understood. Soil sorption and degradation are important processes affecting the leaching potential of trace contaminants in irrigated soil. To this end, we examined the sorption and attenuation of six psychoactive and antilipidemic drugs, i.e., carbamazepine, diazepam, Dilantin, meprobamate, primidone, and gemfibrozil, in a loam (LVL) and a loamy sand representative of golf course soils in the southwestern United States.
   Materials and methods Sorption of pharmaceuticals in the soils was measured using a batch equilibrium method at room temperature. Degradation experiments were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Pharmaceutical residues in soil samples were extracted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS.
   Results and discussion Except for diazepam in both soils and carbamazepine in LVL soil, sorption was mostly negligible for all other compound-soil combinations (K (d) = 0-2.5 L/kg). For the same soil, the sorption affinity generally followed a decreasing order diazepam > carbamazepine > gemfibrozil > Dilantin a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand meprobamate a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand primidone. While Dilantin, gemfibrozil, and meprobamate showed moderate persistence in the soils under aerobic conditions, with T (1/2) 27-99 days, the test compounds were recalcitrant to degradation in the other treatments.
   Conclusions The low sorption affinity and long persistence suggest that some of the wastewater-borne pharmaceutical compounds may be easily mobile with groundwater flow and pose groundwater contamination risks when the treated wastewater is dispersed in the environment through practices such as landscape irrigation.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) - based metabolomics has the potential to identify toxic responses of contaminants within a mixture in contaminated soil. This study evaluated the metabolic response of Eisenia fetida after exposure to an array of organic compounds to determine whether contaminant-specific responses could be identified. The compounds investigated in contact tests included: two pesticides (carbaryl and chlorpyrifos), three pharmaceuticals (carbamazephine, estrone and caffeine), two persistent organohalogens (Aroclor 1254 and PBDE 209) and two industrial compounds (nonylphenol and dimethyl phthalate). Control and contaminant-exposed metabolic profiles were distinguished using principal component analysis and potential contaminant-specific biomarkers of exposure were found for several contaminants. These results suggest that NMR-based metabolomics offers considerable promise for differentiating between the different toxic modes of action (MOA) associated with sub-lethal toxicity to earthworms.

AB Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors have been widely used for treatment of industrial wastewater. In this study, performance of a lab-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, was evaluated under different operating conditions. A (P.E) pipe with a diameter of 250 mm and total height of 120 cm and effective height of 100 cm with approximate volume of 49 liter was used as a reactor. The loading rates on reactor were increased in steps to assess the maximum loading capacity of the reactor to study the performance of reactor at different loading rates. The COD concentrations used in the present investigation ranges between 1850 mg/L to 15170 ing/L. The performance of the reactor up to 10.81 kg COD/m(3.)d was evaluated and the hydraulic retention times were examined. During this study, which lasted for 120 days, the temperature of the wastewater entering the reactor ranged from 30 to 35 degrees C and no heat exchanger was used. Finally the removal ratio of COD with hydraulic retention time of 33.7 hours and organic loading rate of 10.81 kg COD/m(3).day were 54 percent respectively.

AB Integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) processes are becoming more popular for both secondary and sidestream treatment in wastewater facilities. These processes are a combination of biofilm reactors and activated sludge processes, achieved by introducing and retaining biofilm carrier media in activated sludge reactors. A full-scale train of three IFAS reactors equipped with AnoxKaldnes media and coarse-bubble aeration was tested using off-gas analysis. This was operated independently in parallel to an existing full-scale activated sludge process. Both processes achieved the same percent removal of COD and ammonia, despite the double oxygen demand on the IFAS reactors. In order to prevent kinetic limitations associated with DO diffusional gradients through the IFAS biofilm, this systems was operated at an elevated dissolved oxygen concentration, in line with the manufacturer's recommendation. Also, to avoid media coalescence on the reactor surface and promote biofilm contact with the substrate, high mixing requirements are specified. Therefore, the air flux in the IFAS reactors was much higher than that of the parallel activated sludge reactors. However, the standardized oxygen transfer efficiency in process water was almost same for both processes. In theory, when the oxygen transfer efficiency is the same, the air used per unit load removed should be the same. However, due to the high DO and mixing requirements, the IFAS reactors were characterized by elevated air flux and air use per unit load treated. This directly reflected in the relative energy footprint for aeration, which in this case was much higher for the IFAS system than activated sludge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over 1.5 years continuous piloting of a municipal wastewater plant upgraded with a double membrane system (ca. 0.6 m(3) d(-1) of product water produced) have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high water quality with a water yield of 90% by combining a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a submerged ultrafiltration membrane followed by a reverse osmosis membrane (RO). The novelty of the proposed treatment scheme consists of the appropriate conditioning of MBR effluent prior to the RO and in recycling the RO concentrates back to the biological unit.
   All the 15 pharmaceuticals measured in the influent municipal sewage were retained below 100 ng L-1, a proposed quality parameter, and mostly below detection limits of 10 ng L-1. The mass balance of the micropollutants shows that these are either degraded or discharged with the excess concentrate, while only minor quantities were found in the excess sludge. The micropollutant load in the concentrate can be significantly reduced by ozonation. A low treated water salinity (< 10 mM inorganic salts; 280 +/- 70 mu S cm(-1)) also confirms that the resulting product has a high water quality.
   Solids precipitation and inorganic scaling are effectively mitigated by lowering the pH in the RO feed water with CO2 conditioning, while the concentrate from the RO is recycled to the biological unit where CO2 is stripped by aeration. This causes precipitation to occur in the bioreactor bulk, where it is much less of a process issue. SiO2 is the sole exception. Equilibrium modeling of precipitation reactions confirms the effectiveness of this scaling-mitigation approach for CaCO3 precipitation, calcium phosphate and sulfate minerals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   Residence time distributions as a guiding principle for sampling

AB The effect of mixing regimes and residence time distribution (RTD) on solute transport in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is well understood in environmental engineering. Nevertheless, it is frequently neglected in sampling design and data analysis for the investigation of polar xenobiotic removal efficiencies in WWTPs. Most studies on the latter use 24-h composite samples in influent and effluent. The effluent sampling period is often shifted by the mean hydraulic retention time assuming that this allows a total coverage of the influent load. However, this assumption disregards mixing regime characteristics as well as flow and concentration variability in evaluating xenobiotic removal performances and may consequently lead to biased estimates or even negative elimination efficiencies.
   The present study aims at developing a modeling approach to estimate xenobiotic removal efficiencies from monitoring data taking the hydraulic RTD in WWTPs into consideration. For this purpose, completely mixed tanks-in-series were applied to address hydraulic mixing regimes in a Luxembourg WWTP. Hydraulic calibration for this WWTP was performed using wastewater conductivity as a tracer. The RTD mixing approach was coupled with first-order biodegradation kinetics for xenobiotics covering three classes of biodegradability during aerobic treatment.
   Model simulations showed that a daily influent load is distributed over more than one day in the effluent. A 24-h sampling period with an optimal time offset between influent and effluent covers less than the half of the influent load in a dry weather scenario. According to RTD calculations, an optimized sampling strategy covering four consecutive measuring days in the influent would be necessary to estimate the full-scale elimination efficiencies with sufficient accuracy. Daily variations of influent flow and concentrations can substantially affect the reliability of these sampling results. Commonly reported negative removal efficiencies for xenobiotics might therefore be a consequence of biased sampling schemes. In this regard, the present study aims at contributing to bridge the gap between environmental chemistry and engineering practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The enantiospecific fate of three common pharmaceuticals was monitored in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The MBR was operated with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 8.6-10 g/L. Standard solutions of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen were dosed into the synthetic feed of the MBR. Influent and permeate samples were then collected for enantiospecific analysis. The individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the three pharmaceuticals were derivatised using a chiral derivatizing agent to form pairs of diastereomers, which could then be separated and analysed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Accurate quantitation of individual enantiomers was undertaken by an isotope dilution process. By comparing the total concentration (as the sum of the two enantiomers) in the MBR influent and permeate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen concentrations were observed to have been reduced as much as 99%, 43% and 68%, respectively. Furthermore, evidence of enantioselective biodegradation was observed for all three pharmaceuticals. (S)-Ibuprofen was shown to be preferentially degraded compared to (R)-ibuprofen with an average decrease in enantiomeric fraction (EF) from 0.52 to 0.39. In contrast, (R)-ketoprofen was preferentially degraded compared to (S)-ketoprofen with a relatively minor increase in EF from 0.52 to 0.63. The use of a relatively pure enantiomeric solution of (S)-naproxen resulted in a significant change in EF from 0.99 to 0.65. However, this experiment consistently revealed significantly increased concentrations of (R)-naproxen during MBR treatment. It is hypothesised that the source of this (R)-naproxen was the enantiomeric inversion of (S)-naproxen. Such enantiomeric inversion of chiral pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment processes has not previously been reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investigation on the toxic effects of pharmaceutical drugs namely clofibric acid (CA) and diclofenac (DCF) were studied in a common carp Cyprinus carpio at different concentrations such as 1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1 for a short-term period of 96 h under static bioassay method. At all concentrations, red blood cell (RBC), plasma sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) levels were decreased in fish treated with CA and DCF. Contrastingly, white blood cell (WBC), plasma glucose, protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gill Na+/K+-ATPase level were increased. However, a mixed trend was observed in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), plasma chloride (Cl-), mean cellular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels. There was a significant (P<0.01 and P<0.05) change in all parameters measured in fish exposed to different concentrations of CA and DCF. In summary, the alterations in hematological, biochemical, ionoregulatory and enzymological parameters can be used as biomarkers in monitoring the toxicity of CA and DCF in aquatic environment. However, more detailed studies on using of specific biomarkers to monitor the human pharmaceuticals are needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the results of a nationwide survey of commonly used human and veterinary antibiotics (7 sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and 4 macrolides) in 37 Japanese rivers. Concentrations of the sum of the 12 target antibiotics ranged from undetectable to 626 ng/L, with a median of 7.3 ng/L for the 37 rivers. Antibiotics concentrations were higher in urban rivers than in rural rivers and were correlated with those of molecular markers of sewage (crotamiton and carbamazepine). Macrolides were dominant over sulfonamides in urban rivers. Sulfonamides, especially sulfamethazine (used in animals), were dominant in a few rivers in whose catchment animal husbandry is active. However, these signals of veterinary antibiotics were overwhelmed by those of human antibiotics in lower reaches of most rivers. The analysis of the antibiotics in all 88 samples showed that the target antibiotics in Japanese rivers are derived mainly from urban sewage, even though larger amounts of antibiotics are used in livestock. Most of the livestock waste-derived antibiotics are unlikely to be readily discharged to surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sediment quality of Cadiz Bay, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (LPGC) Port, Santander Bay, Algeciras Bay, and Huelva Estuary (Spain) was evaluated by analysing a battery of biochemical biomarkersactivities of biotranformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD], dibenzylflourescein dealkylase [DBF], and glutathione S-transferase [GST]; activity of antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase [GR]; and lipid peroxidation [LPO] in the polychaete Arenicola marina after laboratory sediment exposure. Huelva Estuary polychaetes showed significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced LPO, GST, and EROD activities compared with control lugworms related to metals and presumably polychlorinated biphenyls. EROD activity significant (p < 0.05) induction was associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons after Santander Bay sediment exposure. Nickel appeared to significantly (p < 0.05) induce GR activity and LPO in LPGC Port sediment-exposed organisms. DBF activity significantly (p < 0.05) increased in polychaetes exposed to sediments from sewage-contaminated areas. A. marina was sensitive at the biochemical level. Integration of sediment characterization and biomarker results allowed the identification of polluted sites as well as the cause of possible sediment toxicity.

AB A variety of emerging chemicals of concern are released continuously to surface water through the municipal wastewater effluent discharges. The ability to rapidly determine bioaccumulation of these contaminants in exposed fish without sacrificing the animal (i.e. in vivo) would be of significant advantage to facilitate research, assessment and monitoring of their risk to the environment. In this study, an in vivo solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) approach was developed and applied to the measurement of a variety of emerging contaminants (carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bisphenol A, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and atrazine) in fish. Our results indicated in vivo SPME was a potential alternative extraction technique for quantitative determination of contaminants in lab exposures and as well after exposure to two municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), with a major advantage over conventional techniques due to its ability to non-lethally sample tissues of living organisms.

AB The present study investigated the feasibility of using modified attapulgites for the sorptive removal of beta-blocker propranolol. The attapulgites were modified by different reagents including hydrochloric acid, silane coupling agent and chotosan. And the modified attapulgites were characterized by N-2 sorption-desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, and X-ray diffraction technique. The as-made attapulgites were applied to removing propranolol from aqueous solution, and the effects of pH, ionic strength. sorbent dosage, and humic acid on sorption were investigated by batch experiments. The sorption capacity of the as-made attapulgites was compared with that of natural attapulgite, powdered activated carbon and other reported sorbent. The results suggested that the acid-activated attapulgite had a higher sorption capacity for propranolol than the other sorbents involved. The sorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms of propranolol onto acid-activated attapulgite were also studied. The sorption process followed the pseudo-second order equation and the sorption data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm equations. Both physisorption and chemisorption played important roles for propranolol sorption onto acid-activated ATP. Owing to its high sorption capacity and low cost, acid-activated attapulgite has potential value in the removal of propranolol from sewage and natural waters in engineering application.

AB Removal of pharmaceutical Carbamazepine (CBZ) compound from municipal wastewater has become an issue from the human health and environmental risks point of view, due to its latent recalcitrance and toxicity properties. This study investigated the photodegradation performance of a sequential batch annular slurry photoreactor (SB-ASP) system for the removal of CBZ compound from secondary municipal wastewater. Two different immobilised TiO(2) photocatalysts, namely anatase titanate nanofiber and mesoporous TiO(2) impregnated kaolinite catalyst were applied in the SB-ASP system. Various modes of sequential batch reactor (SBR) cycles, presence of effluent organic matter (EOM) and inorganic ions, mainly nitrate and phosphate that could affect the photodegradation performance of the SB-ASP system were evaluated during the removal of CBZ. High performance size exclusion chromatography revealed that the photocatalytic reaction will preferentially compete and attack on high molecular weight EOM prior to the photodegradation of CBZ. The presence of inorganic ions was found to affect the surface fouling of immobilised photocatalysts used to a different extent, without completely retarding their photoactivity. This study also highlighted that the operation of SB-ASP system was useful to enhance the photodegradation of CBZ compound in a semi-continuous operation without constant catalyst replacement. It is foreseeable that the integration of SB-ASP system with biological treatment systems could provide an advanced treatment option for the recycling and reuse of municipal wastewater.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of tertiary-treated municipal effluents on the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Caged mussels were immersed during 2 weeks in a river located North of Montreal Island, upstream/downstream the outfall and in one reference site located at the beginning of the Riviere des Prairies. A selection of biomarkers was analyzed to depict changes on various physiological systems: general physiology (mussel viability, condition index and gonado-somatic index), immune status (hemocyte viability, cellularity, phagocytosis efficiency, NM-like cytotoxic activity and lysozyme activity), inflammation (cyclo-oxygenase activity), detoxification (glutathione-S-transferases activity) and vitellogenesis (alkali-labile phosphate level). The analysis of total and fecal coliform counts in water and of heterotrophic bacteria levels in mussel tissues showed that the bacteriological quality of the water strongly decreased from the reference site to the downstream site. This was correlated with a significant loss of weight and an increase of mussel mortality. Cellularity and phagocytosis efficiency were significantly increased in the downstream site compared to the reference site. Though not statistically significant, lysozyme activity was also increased. NM-like cytotoxicity, activity of the pro-inflammatory enzyme COX and the levels of ALP and MT were not significantly changed. Conversely, the municipal effluents induced a significant increase of GST activity in downstream site, indicating a stimulation of detoxification metabolism. Altogether, these results confirm that a short-term exposure to a mixture of bacterial and chemical compounds released by the wastewater treatment plant La Piniere induces adverse physiological effects in E. complanata, as observed with the modulation of immune response and induction of detoxification metabolism.

AB The effects of controlled temperature variation in the range of 10-45 degrees C were assessed in a lab-scale MBR that treated synthetic municipal wastewater spiked with selected micropollutants. The effects were evaluated with respect to total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) removal, micropollutant removal, sludge growth, level of soluble microbial products (SMPs) in the mixed liquor and membrane fouling. Overall, the temperature shifts caused high variation in the TOC and TN levels in the reactor supernatant, however that in membrane-permeate was relatively more stable, substantiating the robustness of the MBR process. Results regarding the removal of micropollutants at ambient temperature (20 degrees C) demonstrate an apparent correlation between hydrophobicity, chemical structures and the removal of micropollutants. Temperature variation below and above 20 degrees C, especially the operation under 45 degrees C appeared to significantly influence the removal of certain less hydrophobic (log D<3.2) micropollutants possessing strong electron withdrawing functional groups. The removal of most hydrophobic compounds (log D > 3.2) was stable under the temperature range of 10-35 degrees C, however, deteriorated at 45 degrees C. The temperature shifts were also associated with higher levels of SMP in the mixed liquor which appeared to trigger membrane fouling as evidenced by a rapid increase in transmembrane pressure.

AB Diurnal variations in wastewater flows are common phenomena related to peak water use periods. However, few studies have examined high-resolution temporal variability in trace organic contaminant (TOrC) concentrations and loadings. Even fewer have assessed the impacts of a special event or holiday. This study characterizes the temporal variability associated with a major sporting event using flow data and corresponding mass loadings of a suite of prescription pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and illicit drugs. Wastewater influent and finished effluent samples were collected during the National Football League's Super Bowl, which is a significant weekend for tourism in the study area. Data from a baseline weekend is also provided to illustrate flows and TOrC loadings during "normal" operational conditions. Some compounds exhibited interesting temporal variations (e.g., atenolol), and several compounds demonstrated different loading profiles during the Super Bowl and baseline weekends (e.g., the primary cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine). Interestingly, the influent mass loadings of prescription pharmaceuticals were generally similar in magnitude to those of the illicit drugs and their metabolites. However, conventional wastewater treatment was more effective in removing the illicit drugs and their metabolites. Total influent and effluent mass loadings are also provided to summarize treatment efficacy and environmental discharges. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Secondary treated wastewater was infiltrated through a 9 m-thick calcareous vadose zone during a 39 month managed aquifer recharge (MAR) field trial to determine potential improvements in the recycled water quality. The water quality improvements of the recycled water were based on changes in the chemistry and microbiology of (i) the recycled water prior to infiltration relative to (ii) groundwater immediately down-gradient from the infiltration gallery. Changes in the average concentrations of several constituents in the recycled water were identified with reductions of 30% for phosphorous, 66% for fluoride, 62% for iron and 51% for total organic carbon when the secondary treated wastewater was infiltrated at an applied rate of 17.5 L per minute with a residence time of approximately four days in the vadose zone and less than two days in the aquifer. Reductions were also noted for oxazepam and temazepam among the pharmaceuticals tested and for a range of microbial pathogens, but reductions were harder to quantify as their magnitudes varied over time. Total nitrogen and carbamazepine persisted in groundwater down-gradient from the infiltration galleries. Infiltration does potentially offer a range of water quality improvements over direct injection to the water table without passage through the unsaturated zone; however, additional treatment options for the non-potable water may still need to be considered, depending on the receiving environment or the end use of the recovered water.

AB The occurrence of 43 pharmaceuticals belonging to predominant therapeutic classes and their distribution in surface water, suspended solids and sediments has been investigated in the Ebro river basin in the Northeast of Spain. WWTP effluents were found to be a main source of contamination and the spatial distribution was affected by the river flow at the sampling point and corresponding dilution factor, resulting in higher concentrations and higher loads in small tributary rivers than in the Ebro river. The study showed that some compounds are preferentially found bound to suspended solids and not detected in river water. Generally, compounds with basic characteristics (pKa > 7) showed higher tendency to bind to suspended solids. The sediment samples generally presented lower concentrations than suspended solids.

AB The aim of this study was to test if pharmaceuticals could explain observed responses of field collected and transplanted invertebrate species (Hydropsyche exocellata, Echinogammarus longisetosus, and Daphnia magna). The study was performed in the middle and lower course of Llobregat river basin, which is affected by pharmaceuticals and other pollutants coming from sewage treated effluents. Up to 10 different endpoints including enzyme activities related with detoxication mechanisms (i.e. glutathione S transferase, catalase, esterases), the oxidative stress damage marker (lipid peroxidation), and individual responses (mortality, post-exposure feeding rates) were assessed. Biological responses were complemented with a detailed chemical analysis of metals, detergents, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other general water quality variables to allow identifying causal abiotic factors. Estimated hazard indexes of measured pollutants indicated that pesticides and metals accounted for most of the predicted toxicity (>95%) in the most contaminated site and that the predicted toxicity of pharmaceuticals was marginal (<5%). The three species showed a clear impact across the studied gradient indicated by higher levels of feeding inhibition and of mortality towards lower reaches. Specific responses such as inhibition of cholinesterase activities were closely related to high and presumable toxic levels of diazinon, whereas unspecific responses such as enhanced levels of antioxidant defensive mechanism and of lipid peroxidation levels were associated with most pollutant classes as well as with high and presumable toxic levels of salt and ammonia. These results indicate that pesticides, salinity, ammonia probably had greater effects on the studied species than pharmaceuticals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Pharmaceuticals are an integral part of a dignified life. However, a lack of degradability and threats to the welfare of living beings cause concern due to their emission into the environment. There is also a lack of knowledge about cause and consequence. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the development of educational programmes which should increasingly include the topic 'pharmaceuticals in the environment'.
   Methods Considering the current literature, we developed a corresponding series of worksheets (Online Resource) and sample solutions on an introductory level and integrated them into our curriculum.
   Results The material compiled for the worksheets was arranged in a logical order and considers several subtopics. The worksheets aim to support the examination of related aspects such as environmental effects, emissions, wastewater treatment plants, degradation, degradation by-products, advanced oxidation processes, hydraulic retention times, half-life times, biosolids, exposition pathways, precautionary principle, classification schemes for pharmaceuticals and, related to the structure-activity relationship, the design for degradability. The students managed to work on the tasks in an appropriate manner and received a good overview of the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.
   Conclusions Tasks that were presented to students regarding the topic 'pharmaceuticals in the environment' contributed to a better understanding of the possible risks of medical care on an introductory level. The tasks have been incorporated into a logic series of worksheets (Online Resource) with sample solutions available. Alternatively, the material would be appropriate for the preparation of a corresponding lecture on this topic.

AB Occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in drinking water was investigated in southern China. Fifteen and twelve PPCPs were detected with concentrations of 036 ng L-1 in source water and of 0-20 ng L-1 in treated water, respectively. Four PPCPs were detected with concentrations of approximately 1 ng L-1 in drinking water of distribution network. Conventional water treatment processes removed the types and average concentrations of PPCPs by 30% and above 50%, respectively. Advanced water treatment processes were more efficient in the removal of most PPCPs, with the types and concentrations reduced by 50% and approximately 90%, respectively. Molecular properties of PPCPs had an important influence on their behaviors during water treatment. pK(a) (acidity coefficient) and K-oc (organic carbon partition coefficient) of PPCPs appeared to have a combined effect on PPCPs removal during coagulation and oxidation. Adsorption and biodegradation were two possible mechanisms responsible for PPCPs removal during sand filtration.

AB Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and oxidized MWCNTs (O-MWCNTs) were studied for the adsorption of ibuprofen (MU) and triclosan (TCS) as representative types of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) under different chemical solution conditions. A good fitting of sorption isotherms was obtained using a Polanyi-Manes model (PMM). IBU and TCS sorption was stronger for SWCNTs than for MWCNTs due to higher specific surface area. The high oxygen content of O-MWCNT further. depressed PPCP sorption. The sorption capacity of PPCPs was found to be pH-dependent, and more adsorption was observed at pHs below their plc values. Ionic strength was also found to substantially affect TCS adsorption, with higher adsorption capacity observed for TCS at lower ionic strength. In the presence of a reference aquatic fulvic acid (FA), sorption of IBU and TCS was reduced due to the competitive sorption of FA on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Sorption isotherm results with SWCNTs, MWCNTs and O-MWCNTs confirmed that the surface chemistry of CNTs, the chemical properties of PPCPs, and aqueous solution chemistry (pH, ionic strength, fulvic acid) all play an important role in PPCP adsorption onto CNTs.

AB This study investigates the feasibility of using the combination of TiO2 photocatalysis and a constructed wetland to treat polluted surface water for water reclamation. The treatment efficiency of the system was evaluated by varying the hydraulic retention time (HRT), light source wavelength, and quantity of photocatalyst. The experimental results show that the combined system with 2-day HRT had better treatment efficiency in terms of treated water quality than that obtained with 0.5-day HRT. The combined system effectively decreased the monitored water quality parameters; the removal percentages increased with increasing quantity of photocatalyst. Compared with constructed wetland treatment alone, the combined system improves the treatment efficiency of polluted water. An evaluation of the possibility of using the treated water for reclamation found that only the combined system effectively removed both trihalomethane (THM) and six haloacetic acid (HAA6) precursors, which decreased their formation to levels that meet the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) of drinking water. The proposed system is thus suitable for treating agricultural and domestic wastewater for water reclamation with low operating and maintenance costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A set of bioassays (acute toxicity to Daphnia, genotoxicity, estrogenic and antiestrogenic toxicity) was used to evaluate the safety of reclaimed water reuse in a lab-scale artificial groundwater recharge system. zonation of 1 mg O-3 . (mg DOC)(-1) was used as the pretreatment and was proved to be effective in removing the four toxicity, with removal ratios ranging from 56% to 99%. In the vadose layer, the responsible compounds for toxicity were less efficiently removed than the bulk organic compounds. However, they were preferentially removed during the saturated aquifer treatment, with all the toxic effects per carbon mass dropping by 20-50%. Therefore, more than one month traveling in the aquifer is suggested before water reuse. Since UV254 was significantly correlated with the toxicity data, it could serve as an indicator of the toxicity. With the bioassay-based safety evaluation, the combination of soil aquifer treatment and ozonation could provide new water sources with no higher toxic than the conventional natural drinking water source.

AB The artificial sweetener sucralose has recently been shown to be a widespread of contaminant of wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. In order to understand its occurrence in drinking water systems, water samples from 19 United States (U.S.) drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) serving more than 28 million people were analyzed for sucralose using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sucralose was found to be present in source water of 15 out of 19 DWTPs (47-2900 ng/L), finished water of 13 out of 17 DWTPs (49-2400 ng/L) and distribution system water of 8 out Of the 12 DWTPs (48-2400 ng/L) tested. Sucralose was only found to be present in source waters with known wastewater influence and/or recreational usage, and displayed low removal (12% average) in the DWTPs where finished water was sampled. Further, in the subset of DWTPs with distribution system water sampled, the compound was found to persist regardless of the presence of residual chlorine or chloramines. In order to understand intra-DWTP consistency, sucralose was monitored at one drinking water treatment plant over an 11 month period from March 2010 through January 2011, and averaged 440 ng/L in the source water and 350 ng/L in the finished water. The results of this study confirm that sucralose will function well as an indicator compound for anthropogenic influence on source, finished drinking and distribution system (i.e., tap) water, as well as an indicator compound for the presence of other recalcitrant compounds in finished drinking water in the U.S.

AB Mesoporous silica SBA-15 and its postfunctionalized counterparts with hydroxymethyl (HM-SBA-15), aminopropyl (AP-SBA-15), and trimethylsilyl (TMS-SBA-15) were prepared and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The removal of a mixture of 12 selected pharmaceuticals was investigated by batch adsorption experiments onto SBA-15 and the grafted materials. SBA-15 showed to have moderate adsorption affinity with amino-containing (atenolol, trimethoprim) and hydrophobic pharmaceuticals. but it displayed minimal adsorption affinity toward hydrophilic compounds. HM-SBA-15 was analogous with SBA-15 in terms of the adsorption efficiency toward all pharmaceuticals. AP-SBA-15 exhibited an increase in the adsorption of two acidic compounds (clofibric acid, diclofenac) but a decrease in the adsorption of estrone and the two amino-containing compounds. Among the grafted materials, TMS-SBA-15 had the highest adsorption affinity toward most pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the adsorption of nine pharmaceuticals to TMS-SBA-15 was significantly higher than that to SBA-15; seven of which showed the removal percentages from 70.6% to 98.9% onto TMS-SBA-15. The number of pharmaceuticals showing high adsorption efficiency onto TMS-SBA-15 did not alter significantly as the pH changed in the range of 5.5-7.6. The results suggest that TMS-SBA-15 is a promising material for the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous phase, especially for the treatment of wastewater from drug manufacturers.

AB The fates of several macrolide, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim antibiotics contained in the raw sewage of the Tel-Aviv wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated after the sewage was treated using either a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) system coupled with a subsequent ultrafiltration (UF) step or a pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) system. Antibiotics removal in the MBR system, once it achieved stable operation, was 15-42% higher than that of the CAS system. This advantage was reduced to a maximum of 20% when a UF was added to the CAS. It was hypothesized that the contribution of membrane separation (in both systems) to antibiotics removal was due either to sorption to biomass (rather than improvement in biodegradation) or to enmeshment in the membrane biofilm (since UF membrane pores are significantly larger than the contaminant molecules). Batch experiments with MBR biomass showed a markedly high potential for sorption of the tested antibiotics onto the biomass. Moreover, methanol extraction of MBR biomass released significant amounts of sorbed antibiotics. This finding implies that more attention must be devoted to the management of excess sludge.

AB The oxidation of trace pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater desalination streams by nonthermal plasma (NTP) was evaluated. Brines from a two stage-RO pilot plant process as well as two sources of tertiary effluents, ultrafiltrated secondary effluents and membrane biological reactor effluents, were comparatively tested with ultra-pure water. The nonionic and ionic iodinated contrast media (ICM) compounds, iopromide (IOPr) and diatrizoate (DTZ), respectively, were used as model compounds. The neurostabilizer drug carbamazepine (CBZ) was used for reference purposes. Based on deiodination profiles, two distinct patterns of initial oxidation could be established for the ICM. The time profile of deiodination and transformation paralleled for DTZ, indicating that transformation of the aromatic ring is the main initial pattern of transformation. For IOPr, a considerable lag phase of deiodination was observed, suggesting that oxidation of the alkyl chains rather than ring oxidation is the main pattern of initial transformation. Although transformation rate of IOPr was higher compared to DTZ, the rate and degree of deiodination was higher for DTZ than IOPr. Both ICM displayed a markedly lower susceptibility to NTP oxidation compared to CBZ. However, the kinetics of IOPr transformation seems to be less affected by the water matrixes, compared to DTZ and CBZ. Whereas NTP mediated oxidation of ICM followed first-order kinetics, a better fit to Harris model was found for CBz. As a result of the NTP oxidation, treated brines and effluents displayed a substantial increase in biodegradability (measured as BOD).

AB The results of the use of an expert system (ES) to control a novel multi-stage loop membrane bioreactor (MLMBR) for the simultaneous removal of organic substances and nutrients are reported. The study was conducted at a bench-scale plant for the purpose of meeting new discharge standards (GB21904-2008) for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater (1200-9600 mg/L COD, 500-2500 mg/L BOD5, 50-200 mg/L NH4+-LN and 105-400 mg/L TN in the influent water) by developing a distributed control system. The system allows various expert operational approaches to be deployed with the goal of minimizing organic substances and nitrogen levels in the outlet while using the minimum amount of energy. The proposed distributed control system, which is supervised by a Knowledge-Based Expert System (KBES) constructed with G2 (a tool for expert system development) and a back propagation BP artificial neural network, permits the on-line implementation of every operating strategy of the experimental system. A support vector machine (SVM) is applied to achieve pattern recognition. A set of experiments involving variable sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) was carried out. Using the proposed system, the amounts of COD, TN and NH4+-N in the effluent decreased by 55%, 62% and 38%, respectively, compared to the usual operating conditions. These improvements were achieved with little energy cost because the performance of the treatment plant was optimized using operating rules implemented in real time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The performance of a membrane bioreactor operating in a sequential mode (SMBR) using an external flat-plate membrane was investigated. After 200 days of operation, a single addition of 1 g L(-1) Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) was added directly into the mixed liquor in order to enhance the simultaneous removal of nutrients and pharmaceutical micropollutants from synthetic urban wastewater. Throughout the entire operation (288 days), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiencies were up to 95%, ammonium nitrogen removal was maintained over 70-80%, whereas phosphorus removal achieved only high values (around 80%) after PAC addition. During the operation of the SMBR without PAC addition, micropollutants which exerted a more recalcitrant behaviour were carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac and trimethoprim, with no significant removal. On the other hand, moderate removals (42-64%) were observed for naproxen and erythromycin, whereas ibuprofen, roxithromycin and fluoxetine were removed in the range of 71-97%. The addition of PAC into the aeration tank was a successful tool to improve the removal of the more recalcitrant compounds up to 85%. The highest removal with PAC was observed for carbamazepine, trimethoprim as well as for roxithromycin, erythromycin and fluoxetine. The latter four compounds have amine groups and pKa in the range 6.7-10.1, thus the interaction between PAC and the positively charged amino groups might be the cause of their comparatively better results. Microbial ecology present in the biomass showed a higher abundance of Accumulibacter phosphatis as well as the ammonium oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Nitrosomonas after PAC addition.

AB A LC tandem MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of four iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and 46 ICM biotransformation products (TPs) in raw and treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. Recoveries ranged from 70% to 130%, and limits of quantification (LOQ) varied between 1 ng/L and 3 ng/L for surface water, groundwater and drinking water, and between 10 ng/L and 30 ng/L for wastewater. In a conventional wastewater treatment plant, iohexol, iomeprol, and iopromide were transformed to >80%, while iopamidol was transformed to 35%. In total, 26 TPs were detected above their LOQ in WWTP effluents. A significant change in the pattern of ICM TPs was observed after bank filtration and groundwater infiltration under aerobic conditions. Predominately, these TPs are formed at the end of the microbial transformation pathways in batch experiments with soil and sediment. These polar ICM TPs, such as iohexol TP599, iomeprol TP643, iopromide TP701A, and iopromide TP643, were not or only partially removed during drinking water treatment. As a consequence, several ICM TPs were detected in drinking water, at concentration levels exceeding 100 ng/L, with a maximum of 500 ng/L for iomeprol TP687.

AB Stream flow in urban aquatic ecosystems often is maintained by water-reclamation plant (WRP) effluents that contain mixtures of natural and anthropogenic chemicals that persist through the treatment processes. In effluent-impacted streams, aquatic organisms such as fish are continuously exposed to biologically-active chemicals throughout their life cycles. The North Shore Channel of the Chicago River (Chicago, Illinois) is part of an urban ecosystem in which >80% of the annual flow consists of effluent from the North Side WRP. In this study, multiple samplings of the effluent and stream water were conducted and fish (largemouth bass and carp) were collected on 2 occasions from the North Shore Channel. Fish also were collected once from the Outer Chicago Harbor in Lake Michigan, a reference site not impacted by WRP discharges. Over 100 organic chemicals with differing behaviors and biological effects were measured, and 23 compounds were detected in all of the water samples analyzed. The most frequently detected and highest concentration (>100 mu g/L) compounds were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 4-nonylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxycarboxylic acids. Other biologically-active chemicals including bisphenol A. 4-nonylphenol, 4-nonylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxylates, 4-tert-octylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenolmono-to-tetraethoxylates were detected at lower concentrations (<5 mu g/L). The biogenic steroidal hormones 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, testosterone, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, and cis-androsterone were detected at even lower concentrations (<0.005 mu g/L). There were slight differences in concentrations between the North Side WRP effluent and the North Shore Channel, indicating minimal in-stream attenuation. Fish populations are continuously exposed to mixtures of biologically-active chemicals because of the relative persistency of the chemicals with respect to stream hydraulic residence time, and the lack of a fresh water source for dilution. The majority of male fish exhibited vitellogenin induction, a physiological response consistent with exposure to estrogenic compounds. Tissue-level signs of reproductive disruption, such as ovatestis, were not observed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Human urine has the potential to be a sustainable, locally and continuously available source of nutrients for agriculture. Phosphate can be efficiently recovered from human urine in the form of the mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O). However, struvite formation may be coupled with the precipitation of other constituents present in urine including pathogens, pharmaceuticals, and heavy metals. To determine if struvite fertilizer presents a microbiological health risk to producers and end users, we characterized the fate of a human virus surrogate (phage Phi X174) and the eggs of the helminth Ascaris suum during a low-cost struvite recovery process. While the concentration of phages was similar in both the struvite and the urine, Ascaris eggs accumulated within the solid during the precipitation and filtration process. Subsequent air-drying of the struvite filter cake partially inactivated both microorganisms; however, viable Ascaris eggs and infective phages were still detected after several days of drying. The infectivity of both viruses and eggs was affected by the specific struvite drying conditions: higher inactivation generally occurred with increased air temperature and decreased relative humidity. On a log log scale, phage inactivation increased linearly with decreasing moisture content of the struvite, while Ascaris inactivation occurred only after achieving a minimum moisture threshold. Sunlight exposure did not directly affect the infectivity of phages or Ascaris eggs in struvite cakes, though the resultant rise in temperature accelerated the drying of the struvite cake, which contributed to inactivation.

AB Enhanced coagulation (EC) using ferric chloride was evaluated as a pretreatment process to improve the efficiency of ozone (O-3) for the oxidation of trace organic contaminants in wastewater. At the applied dosages (10-30 mg/L as Fe), EC pretreatment removed between 10 and 47% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the three wastewaters studied. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that EC preferentially removed higher apparent molecular weight (AMW) compounds. Subsequent O-3 testing was performed using an O-3:DOC ratio of 1. Results showed that O-3 exposures were similar even though the required doses were reduced by 10-47% by the EC pretreatment process. Hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) exposure, measured by parachlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), showed 10% reduction when using a FeCl3 dose of 30 mg/L, likely due to the lower O-3 dose and decreased production of HO center dot during the initial phase of O-3 decomposition (t < 30 s). The oxidation of 13 trace organic contaminants (including atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, diclofenac, dilantin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, and trimethoprim) was evaluated after EC and O-3 treatment. EC was ineffective at removing any of the contaminants, while O-3 oxidation reduced the concentration of compounds according to their reaction rate constants with O-3 and HO center dot.

AB The occurrence of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds and personal care products was followed monthly for 12 months after various stages of treatment in an advanced wastewater reclamation plant in Gwinnett County, GA, U.S.A. Twenty-four hour composite samples were collected after primary clarification, activated sludge biological treatment, membrane filtration, granular media filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, and ozonation in the wastewater reclamation plant. Compounds were identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC MS) after solid-phase extraction. Standard addition methods were employed to compensate for matrix effects. Sixteen of the targeted compounds were detected in the primary effluent; sulfadimethoxine, doxycycline, and iopromide were not found. Caffeine and acetaminophen were found at the highest concentrations (similar to 10(5) ng/L), followed by ibuprofen (similar to 10(4) ng/L), sulfamethoxazole and DEET (similar to 10(3) ng/L). Most of the other compounds were found at concentrations on the order of hundreds of ng/L. After activated sludge treatment and membrane filtration, the concentrations of caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, DEET, tetracycline, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) had decreased by more than 90%. Erythromycin and carbamazepine, which were resistant to biological treatment, were eliminated by 74 and 88%, on average, by GAC. Primidone, DEET, and caffeine were not amenable to adsorption by GAG. Ozonation oxidized most of the remaining compounds by >60%, except for primidone and DEET. Of the initial 16 compounds identified in the primary effluent, only sulfamethoxazole, primidone, caffeine and DEET were frequently detected in the final effluent, but at concentrations on the order of 10-100 ng/L. Removal of the different agents by the various treatment processes was related to the physical chemical properties of the compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine, which is an anti-epileptic drug, is ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater. Owing to its recalcitrant chemical structure, carbamazepine is not significantly removed during conventional biological treatment or even by membrane bioreactor (MBR). With the ultimate aim of providing insights into the strategies to enhance carbamazepine removal, the effect of key operational parameters, namely, loading rate (2-750 mu g/L.d), pH (5-9), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration (1-15 g/L) and dissolved oxygen (DO) (<0.5-5 mg/L) on the removal of carabamazepine by MBR was systematically studied. Results obtained in this study revealed negligible influence of pH and of MLSS concentration (beyond 5 g/L) on the removal of carbamazepine. The removal rate, however, was significantly enhanced under a DO concentration of less than 0.5 mg/L, suggesting that an alternating anoxic-oxic environment in MBR would achieve high removal. Significantly enhanced (287 mg/g vs. 0.02 mg/g) adsorption of carbamazepine on powdered activated carbon (PAC) as compared to MBR sludge indicated that simultaneous PAC adsorption in MBR may achieve enhanced removal.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), Ibuprofen (IBU) and Bezafibrate (BEZ) were tested for their potential to bioaccumulate and provoke molecular changes in the non-target organism Dreissena polymorpha. mRNA changes of enzymes and other proteins involved in the prevention from protein damage (heat shock protein 70, hsp70) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; metallothionein, MT), biotransformation (pi-class glutathione S-transferase, piGST; aryl hydrocarbon receptor, AH-R), elimination (P-glycoprotein, P-gp) and reversible protein posttranslational modification (protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A) served as molecular biomarkers. Mussels were exposed in a flow-through system to increasing concentrations of the three substances (1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM). The two lower concentrations correspond to environmentally relevant concentrations detected in surface and effluent waters, respectively. Measuring tissue concentration after one, four and seven days the uptake of CBZ and IBU by the mussels could be evidenced, whereas no accumulation data could be achieved for BEZ. The bioconcentration factor was highest for mussels exposed to the lowest CBZ and IBU concentrations, with 90 and 460-fold higher tissue concentration, respectively, after seven days. CBZ was the only substance tested which caused a significant increase in gill mRNA level of hsp70 after only one day exposure, evidencing the potential of CBZ to immediately provoke a stress condition and assumingly protein damage in gills. After longer exposure, mussels displayed down-regulated mRNA levels of hsp70 and SOD in gills, as well as of MT and P-gp in the digestive gland, hinting on an inhibitory character of CBZ. In IBU exposed mussels increased oxidant stress conditions were evidenced by induced mRNA levels in the digestive gland of CAT and MT, as well as SOD after one and four days, respectively. A concentration as found at sewage treatment plant effluents provoked an increase in transcript levels of piGST, suggesting enhanced need for biotransformation of IBU or by-products derived from oxidative stress. Also exposure to an environmentally relevant BEZ concentration provoked an immediate increase in piGST transcript level in the digestive gland followed by up-regulated hsp70 after four and seven days evidencing a chronic stress condition for the mussels.

AB Discharge of sewage to the environment in the form of treated or untreated wastewater can have serious impacts on human health and quality of life and on ecosystem condition. Since a previous review in 1997, upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities, along with improved source control, have produced successes in reducing loadings of certain pollutants (e.g., mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls) to Canadian waters. However, nationally, loads of phosphorus discharged from wastewater treatment facilities have not changed in recent years (2003-2008), and releases of nitrogen have increased slightly. In some locations, wastewater discharges are contributors to bacterial contamination, toxicity from heavy metals and ammonia, and eutrophication, all of which continue to threaten public and environmental health. An increasing number of studies are also demonstrating developmental, reproductive, and behavioural changes in fish and other aquatic organisms from exposure to pharmaceuticals, personal-care products, or other pollutants in domestic wastewater, even after treatment. Minimizing wastewater discharge and mitigating its effects on the environment and human health will be a challenge. It is critical that gains achieved by improved wastewater treatment and other control measures not be reversed by relaxation of efforts or by failure to keep pace with population growth.

AB The effluents of wastewater treatment plants, usually directly emitted to the environment, often contain the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF). The paper investigates DCF elimination using irradiation technology. Hydroxyl radical and hydrated electron reactive intermediates resulting from water radiolysis effectively degrade DCF and strongly reduce the toxicity of the solutions. (center dot)OH attaches to one of the rings of DCF, and hydroxylated molecules, 2,6-dichloroaniline and quinoid type compounds are the products. Hydrated electron adds to the chlorine atom containing ring, in the reaction quinoid type compounds and 4-chloroacridine form. At a 0.1 mM DCF concentration, a similar to 1 kGy absorbed dose is needed for the degradation of DCF molecules, but for mineralization of the products (in presence of O(2)) an order of magnitude higher dose is required.
   For irradiation of wastewater after biological treatment a similar to 1 kGy dose is suggested. At this dose DCF and other drugs or metabolites present at mu g L(-1) level are eliminated together with microorganism deactivation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A review of the literature published in 2010 on topics related to activated sludge and other aerobic suspended growth processes is presented. The review encompasses modeling, nutrient removal, system design and operation, oxygen transfer and solids separation. Two topics that have seen an increase in activity compared to historical reviews are membrane bioreactors and fate and occurrence of hormones and pharmaceuticals, which are referred to as microconstituents following current WEF terminology. Microconstituents as they relate to suspended growth reactors are covered in this review, while membrane bioreactors are reviewed in another section in this journal. Other subsections from the Treatment Systems section that might also be related to this section include: Wastewater Collection Systems; Biological Fixed Film Systems; and Modeling, Instrumentation, Automation, and Optimization of Wastewater Treatment Facilities. Many of the subsections in the Industrial Wastes, Hazardous Wastes, and Fate and Effects of Pollutants sections could also have some overlap with this section.

AB This review covers selected 2010 articles on the biological, chemical and physical effects of natural and anthropogenic pollutants on marine and estuarine plants and animals. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (concentrations of contaminants, field surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers). Reviewed papers focus further on pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on oil spills due to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and ongoing cleanup. Several topical areas reviewed in the past were dropped this year due to circumstances beyond our control. Further, the focus is limited to effects, not on pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e. g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). As always, readers should only use this as a guide and must consult the original papers before citing them, including double-checking units.

AB Aspergillus niger broth culture on wheat bran was assessed for olive wastewater (OW) hydrolysis in order to release hydroxytyrosol (HT). The enzyme profiles of this culture broth gave essentially (1U/L): 3000 beta-glucosidase and 100 esterase. Hydrolysis activity of A. niger enzyme preparation was evaluated by using three substrates: raw OW, phenolic fraction extracted from OW by ethyl acetate and its corresponding exhausted fraction. Large amounts of free simple phenolics were released from exhausted fraction and raw OW after enzymatic treatment. HPLC analyses show that HT was the main phenolic compound. One step of ethyl acetate extraction of hydrolysed OW allowed the recovery of 0.8 g of HT per litre of OW. The antioxidant activity of extracts from OW and exhausted fraction, measured by DPPH method, was drastically enhanced after hydrolysis treatment. This study demonstrates that hydrolysed OW is a potential source of bioactive phenolic compounds with promising applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is a membrane separation technology that has been studied in recent years for application in water treatment and desalination. It can best be utilized as an advanced pretreatment for desalination processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) to protect the membranes from scaling and fouling. In the current study the rejection of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, plasticizers, and flame-retardants by FO and a hybrid FOR() system was investigated at both the bench- and pilot-scales. More than 30 compounds were analyzed, of which 23 nonionic and ionic TOrCs were identified and quantified in the studied wastewater effluent. Results revealed that almost all TOrCs were highly rejected by the FO membrane at the pilot scale while rejection at the bench scale was generally lower. Membrane fouling, especially under field conditions when wastewater effluent is the FO feed solution, plays a substantial role in increasing the rejection of TOrCs in FO. The hybrid FO-RO process demonstrated that the dual barrier treatment of impaired water could lead to more than 99% rejection of almost all TOrCs that were identified in reclaimed water.

AB The pervasiveness of pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the aquatic ecosystem through the discharge of wastewater, and their potential to biomagnify within this ecosystem, is now recognised. Residues of diclofenac and ibuprofen are currently being detected in surface waters and aquatic organisms throughout the UK and Europe. However, the levels of these residues in fish and other aquatic organisms, particularly lower trophic level prey species, have not yet been determined. While exposure to diclofenac is known to adversely affect fish, the degree to which other aquatic organisms are exposed and impacted through continuous ingestion of contaminated prey and interaction with the aquatic habitat remains unknown. The extent and effects of exposure to ibuprofen also remain largely unknown. As an exploratory subset of a broader study to investigate the detectability of diclofenac in alternative biological matrices, we analysed hair samples from Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra, n=28) for residues of the two NSAIDs using GC-MS. The otters were collected from six counties in England as part of an ongoing otter health monitoring project at the Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre in Chacewater, UK. Diclofenac was qualitatively detected in five hair wash and 15 extract samples, and ibuprofen was determined to be present in at least two of the hair extract samples. Here, we provide preliminary evidence that otters are exposed to both NSAIDs and argue for further studies to identify residue loads in the otters and their prey to fully assess the pervasiveness of these compounds and potential risks of ongoing exposure to them.

AB The artificial sweetener sucralose has been detected in municipal wastewater effluent and surface waters at concentrations ranging from ng/L to low mu g/L. Few chronic ecotoxicological data are available in the peer reviewed literature with respect to sucralose. To address this data gap, 21 d Daphnia magna and 28 d Americamysis bahia (mysid shrimp) studies were conducted to assess the effects of sucralose on the survival, growth and reproduction of these organisms. Concentrations <= 1800 mg/L resulted in no statistically significant reduction in D. magna survival or reproduction. Survival, growth and reproduction of mysid shrimp were unaffected by <= 93 mg/L sucralose. The no observable effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) for the D. magna study were 1800 and >1800 mg/L, respectively. The NOEC and LOEC for the mysid study were 93 and >93 mg/L, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that the concentrations of sucralose detected in the environment are well below those required to elicit chronic effects in freshwater or marine invertebrates.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as personal care products are detected in increasing prevalence in different environmental compartments such as surface water, groundwater and soil. Still little is known about the environmental fate of these substances. The type II antidiabetic drug Metformin has already been detected in different surface waters worldwide, but concentrations were significantly lower than the corresponding predicted environmental concentration (PEC). In human and mammal metabolism so far no metabolites of Metformin have been identified, so the expected environmental concentrations should be very high.
   To assess the aerobic biodegradability of Metformin and the possible formation of degradation products, three Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test series were performed in the present study.
   In the Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D), a screening test that simulates the conditions of an environmental surface water compartment, Metformin was classified as not readily biodegradable (no biodegradation). In the Manometric Respiratory test (OEDC 301 F) working with high bacterial density, Metformin was biodegraded in one of three test bottles to 48.7% and in the toxicity control bottle to 57.5%. In the Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B) using activated sludge, Metformin was biodegraded in both test vessels to an extent of 51.3% and 49.9%, respectively.
   Analysis of test samples by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to multiple stage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) showed in the tests vessels were biodegradation was observed full elimination of Metformin and revealed Guanylurea (Amidinourea, Dicyandiamidine) as single and stable aerobic bacterial degradation product. In another Manometric Respiratory test Guanylurea showed no more transformation. Photodegradation of Guanylurea was also negative.
   A first screening in one of the greatest sewage treatment plant in southern Germany found Metformin with high concentrations (56.8 mu g L-1) in the influent (PEC = 79.8 mu g L-1), but effluent concentration was much lower (0.76 mu g L-1) whereas Guanylurea was detected in a low influent and high effluent concentration (1.86 mu g L-1). These data support the experimental findings in the OECD tests and analytical results of other studies, that Metformin under aerobic conditions can bacterially be degraded to the stable dead-end transformation product Guanylurea.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are important sources of settleable particulate material (SPM), heading to sediments with natural suspended solids. To date, there is little information about the fate of pharmaceuticals in sediment systems. In this study, the objective was to determine if pharmaceuticals are detected in SPM at locations near WWTPs or even in rural areas, thus being susceptible for sedimentation.
   SPM samples were collected from 10 sites in Finland, grouped as reference, rural and wastewater effluent sites. SPM collectors were placed about 35 cm above bottom for about 2 months during summer. After extraction. a set of 17 pharmaceuticals was analyzed.
   Several pharmaceuticals were detected in SPM accumulated at sites next to WWTPs. The concentration of citalopram was notably high (300-1350 ng g(-1) dw). Also bisoprolol and ciprofloxacin were detected at high concentrations (6-325 and 9-390 ng g(-1) dw, respectively). In contrast, none of the pharmaceuticals were detected from reference sites and only two were found from a single rural site.
   There is no previous information about the presence of pharmaceuticals in SPM. The results showed that pharmaceuticals are sorbed to particles in WWTP and nearby, eventually ending up in sediments. These results also indicate that pharmaceuticals are not markedly contaminating sediments of rural areas in Finland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An intensive sampling campaign has been carried out in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to assess the dynamics of the influent pharmaceutical active compounds (PhAC) and musks. The mass loadings of these compounds in wastewater influents displayed contrasting diurnal variations depending on the compound. The musks and some groups of PhACs tended to follow a similar diurnal trend as compared to macropollutants, while the majority of PhACs followed either the opposite trend or no repeatable trend. The total musk loading to the WWTP was 0.74 +/- 0.25 g d(-1), whereas the total PhAC mass loading was 84.7 +/- 63.8 g d(-1). Unlike the PhACs, the musks displayed a high repeatability from one sampling day to the next. The range of PhAC loadings in the influent to WWTPs can vary several orders of magnitude from one day or week to the next, representing a challenge in obtaining data for steady-state modelling purposes.

AB A detailed study of the free and conjugated estrogen load discharged by the eight major sewage treatment plants into the Yodo River basin, Japan was carried out. Sampling campaigns were focused on the winter and autumn seasons from 2005 to 2008 and the free estrogens estrone(E1), 17 beta-estradiol(E2), estriol(E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol(EE2) as well as their conjugated (sulfate and glucuronide) forms. For both sewage effluent and river water E2 and El concentrations were greatest during the winter period (December March). This coincides with the period of lowest rainfall and lowest temperatures in Japan. El was the dominant estrogenic component in effluent (means of 10-50 ng/L) followed by E2 (means of 0.5-3 ng/L). The estrogen sulfate conjugates were found intermittently in the 0.5-1.7 ng/L concentration range in the sewage effluents. The greatest estrogen exposure was found to be in the Katsura River tributary which exceeded 1 ng/L E2-equivalents during the winter period. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of 21 antibiotics in six different groups was investigated in coastal water of the Bohai Bay. Meantime, to illuminate the potential effects caused by the river discharge and aquaculture activities, wastewater from three breeding plants and surface water from six rivers flowing into the Bohai Bay were also analyzed for the selected antibiotics. The result revealed that measured antibiotics in the North Bobai Bay were generally higher than those in the South, highlighting the remarkable effects of high density of human activities on the exposure of antibiotics in environment. The antibiotics found in the six rivers were generally higher than those in the Bohai Bay reflecting the important antibiotics source of river discharge. This study reveals that the high consumption of some antibiotics in aquaculture activities may pose high ecological risk to the bay. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As part of a regional screening to evaluate the risk, for the health of populations, to certain classes of emerging substances, several families of pharmaceuticals and hormones were looked for in waters intended to drinking. Thus, 52 substances were investigated in 71 surface waters and 70 groundwaters. Results indicate that no water was free of pollutants, regardless of its origin (surface or groundwater) and the season of collect. The pharmaceuticals most frequently detected and with the highest concentration levels were salicylic acid, carbamazepine and acetaminophen. Among hormones, testosterone, androstenedione and progesterone were detected in almost all the samples. Globally the groundwaters were less contaminated than surface waters in regards pharmaceuticals frequencies and levels. On the other side, androgens and progestagens were present with comparable frequencies and levels in both compartments. The risk linked to the presence of these substances on human health is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater analysis is a promising monitoring tool to estimate illicit drug consumption at the community level. The advantage of this technique over traditional surveys and other surveillance methods has been emphasized in recent studies. However, there are methodological challenges that can affect reliability. The objectives of this study were to systematically reduce and assess uncertainties associated with sampling (through a stringent optimization of the sampling method) and the back calculation of per capita drug consumption (through a refined estimation of the number of people actively contributing to the wastewater in a given period). We applied continuous flow-proportional sampling to ensure the collection of representative raw wastewater samples. Residues of illicit drugs, opioids, prescription pharmaceuticals and one artificial sweetener were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. A parameter estimating the number of people actively contributing to wastewater over a given period was calculated from the measured loads of prescription pharmaceuticals, their annual consumption and relative excretion data. For the calculation of substance loads in sewage, uncertainties were propagated considering five individual components: sampling, chemical analysis, flow measurements, excretion rates and the number of people contributing to the wastewater. The daily consumption per 1000 inhabitants was estimated to be almost 1000 mg for cannabis and several hundred mg for cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy. With the best sampling practice and current chemical analysis, we calculated the remaining uncertainty to be in the range of 20-30% (relative standard deviation, RSD) for the estimation of consumed drug masses in the catchment; RSDs for the per capita consumption were lower (14-24%), as one of the biggest uncertainty components (i.e. error in flow measurements) cancels out in the proposed method for the estimation of the number of people contributing to the daily wastewater volume. In this study, we provide methodological improvements that substantially enhance the reliability of the estimation method a prerequisite for the application of this technique to meaningfully assess changes in drug consumption and the success of drug intervention strategies in future studies.

AB Factors controlling photolysis and UV/H2O2 photooxidation rates of the biochemically active compounds (BACs) sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, bisphenol A, and diclofenac were determined. Experiments were conducted with a quasi-collimated beam apparatus equipped with low-pressure UV lamps. The effects of pH, H2O2 concentration, and background water matrix (ultrapure water, lake water, wastewater treatment plant effluent) on BAC transformation rates were evaluated. For the sulfa drugs, solution pH affected direct photolysis rates but had little effect on the hydroxyl radical oxidation rate. For sulfamethoxazole, the neutral form photolyzed more easily than the anionic form while the reverse was the case for sulfamethazine and sulfadiazine. For trimethoprim, the hydroxyl radical oxidation rate was higher for the cationic form (pH 3.6) than for the neutral form (pH 7.85). Quantum yields and second order rate constants describing the reaction between the hydroxyl radical and BACs were determined and used together with background water quality data to predict fluence-based BAC transformation rate constants (k'). For both the lake water and wastewater treatment plant effluent matrices, predicted k' values were generally in good agreement with experimentally determined k' values. At typical UV/H2O2 treatment conditions (fluence = 540 mJ cm(-2), H2O2 dose = 6 mg L-1), BAC transformation percentages in North Carolina lake water ranged from 43% for trimethoprim to 98% for diclofenac. In wastewater treatment plant effluent, BAC transformation percentages were lower (31-97%) at the same treatment conditions because the hydroxyl radical scavenging rate was higher.

AB Sorption of 75 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to three different types of sludge (primary sludge, secondary sludge with short and long sludge age respectively) were investigated. To obtain the sorption isotherms batch studies with the APIs mixture were performed in four nominal concentrations to water containing 1 g of sludge. The range of APIs concentrations was between ng L-1 to mu g L-1 which are found in the wastewater effluents. Isotherms were obtained for approximately 45 of the APIs, providing distribution coefficients for linear (K-d), Freundlich (K-f) and Langmuir (K-L) isotherms. K-d, K-f and K-L ranging between 7.1 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(-2) and 6.1 x 10(4) and 9.2 x 10(-3) and 1.1 L kg(-1), respectively. The obtained coefficients were applied to estimate the fraction of APIs in the water phase (see Abstract Graphic). For 37 of the 75 APIs, the predicted presence in the liquid phase was estimated to >80%. 24 APIs were estimated to be present in the liquid phase between 20 and 80%, and 14 APIs were found to have <20% presence in the liquid phase, i.e. high affinity towards sludge. Furthermore, the effect of pH at values 6, 7 and 8 was evaluated using one way ANOVA-test. A significant difference in K(d)s due to pH changes were found for 6 of the APIs (variation 10-20%).

AB Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is an important environmental pollution problem, especially in the Mediterranean, which is the main olive oil production region worldwide. Environmental impact of OMW is related to its high organic load and particularly to the phytotoxic and antibacterial action of its phenolic content. In fact, polyphenols are known as powerful antioxidants with interesting nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. In the present work, the efficiency of OMIV Micellar Enhanced Ultrafiltration (MEUF) treatment for removal and concentration of polyphenols was investigated, using an anionic surfactant (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate salt, SDS) and a hydrophobic poly(vinyldene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. The effects of the process experimental conditions on the permeate flux were investigated, and the secondary membrane resistance created by SDS molecules was evaluated. The initial fluxes of OMW processing by MEUF using SDS were 25.7 and 44.5 l/m(2) h under transmembrane pressures of 3.5 and 4.5 bar, respectively. The rejection rate of polyphenols without using any surfactant ranged from 5 to 28%, whereas, it reached 74% when SDS was used under optimum pH (pH 2). The MEUF provides a slightly colored permeate (about 88% less dark), which requires clearly less chemical oxygen demand (COD) for its oxidation (4.33% of the initial COD). These results showed that MEUF process can efficiently be applied to the treatment of OMW and for the concentration and recovery of polyphenols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of removing 9 different pharmaceuticals, 5 carbamazepine metabolites, and 1 personal care product through wastewater treatment plants and constructed wetlands was investigated. The compound concentrations were measured using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. For extraction confirmation and better accuracy, isotopic dilution and standards addition methods were employed. The reporting limits for the investigated compounds were less than 10 ng/L except TCEP (24 ng/L). The removal efficiencies were found to be inversely proportional to the octanol-water partition coefficients (log K(ow)) after modification with ionizable functional groups (log D(ow)); compounds with a higher hydrophilicity were more efficiently removed in the engineered processes through biological treatment mechanisms. Carbamazepine metabolites that were formed in the early stages of certain metabolic reactions exhibited enhanced removal efficiencies due to a decreased log D(ow) values. However, the removal efficiency of those formed in later stages did not increase, but rather fluctuated with large standard deviations. The removal behaviors of metabolites in biologically operating engineered systems need to be more extensively examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pyrolysis of meat and bone meal material has been studied in an auto-thermal pilot scale unit with a fluidised bed reactor based on Bioware Technology. The heating value of the bio-oil samples is around 33-36 MJ/kg, whilst the nitrogen content is between 7.3 wt.% and 9.0 wt.%. Liquid fractionation with solvents of the bio-oil has been carried out. Chemical analyses of the fractions have shown that the main components in the bio-oil samples are alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated components (as alcohols) and nitrogen compounds (as nitriles) which are identified in the water insoluble fraction. Knowing the chemical composition of the bio-oils is important for assessing possible chemical and pharmaceutical applications of these bio-oils. The char samples have a notable ash content (63 wt.% to 77 wt.%) and its high Ca content could make it suitable for use as a catalyst in gasification processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is used in water and wastewater treatment as well as water recycling applications, treating micropollutants such as hormones. Due to their potential health risk it is critical to develop effective treatment processes. Polymeric NF membranes should be effective in removing such micropollutants based on molecular size. However, the occurrence of adsorption onto the membranes results in unpredictable performance. It is hence important to understand NF retention mechanisms.
   The focus of this study was to understand how estrone and estradiol adsorption and retention are affected by membrane operational parameters such as pressure. Reynolds numbers (based on channel height Re(h)) and feed concentration for the NF270 membrane. These variables are known to contribute to concentration polarisation, and therefore affect sorption and retention by NF membranes.
   The total mass adsorbed of both hormones was found to be governed by the initial concentration at the membrane surface. For example, for estradiol the increase of Re(h) number (427-1450) and pressure (3-17 bar) caused the total mass adsorbed to decrease (0.7-0.5 ng cm(-2)) and increase (0.4-0.8 ng cm(-2)), respectively. The same trends were obtained for estrone.
   Steady-state retention however was found to be dependent on the initial polarisation modulus, given by the ratio between the initial concentration at the membrane surface and the initial feed concentration. For estradiol at the same pressure conditions as above, the polarisation modulus increased from 1.1 to 1.9, causing a decrease of retention from 80% to 51%, whilst for the above Re(h) conditions, the polarisation modulus decreased from 1.5 to 1.0 causing an increase in retention from 69% to 83%.
   Following on from these results, a model based on a first order sorption kinetics was developed for this membrane allowing the prediction of the transient feed and permeate concentrations for the two hormones estrone and estradiol and a wide range of filtration parameters.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including antibiotics, hormones, and several other miscellaneous pharmaceuticals (analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics, antihypertensives, antiseptics, and stimulants) were investigated in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Ulsan, the largest industrial city of Korea. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that acetaminophen, atenolol and lincomycin were the main individual pollutants usually found in concentrations over 10 mu g/L in the sewage influent. In the WWTPs, the concentrations of analgesic acetaminophen, stimulant caffeine, hormones estriol and estradiol decreased by over 99%. On the contrary, the antibiotic sulfamethazine, the antihypertensive metoprolol, and the antiepileptic carbamazepine exhibited removal efficiencies below 30%. Particularly, removal of antibiotics was observed to vary between -11.2 and 69%. In the primary treatment (physicochemical processes), the removal of pharmaceuticals was insignificant (up to 28%) and removal of majority of the pharmaceuticals occurred during the secondary treatment (biological processes). The compounds lincomycin, carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol, and triclosan showed better removal in WWTPs employing modified activated sludge process with co-existence of anoxic-oxic condition. Further investigation into the design and operational aspects of the biological processes is warranted for the efficient removal of PPCPs, particularly antibiotics, to secure healthy water resource in the receiving downstream, thereby ensuring a sustainable water cycle management.

AB A wet air oxidation (WAO) process was applied to four selected pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) individually dissolved in ultra-pure water, varying the temperature and oxygen pressure. Due to the moderate (amoxicillin) or low (metoprolol, naproxen, and phenacetin) efficiency found in the oxidation of these pollutants, a catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) process was then tested using a platinum catalyst supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT). In this CWAO process, the pharmaceuticals were dissolved together in ultra-pure water and in four natural water matrices-a reservoir water, a groundwater, and two waters from different municipal wastewater treatment plants. On the basis of the measurements of their removals, a discussion is given of the influence of the main operating variables: the presence or absence of catalyst, type of catalyst (the synthesized Pt/CNT or a commercial Pt/AC), catalyst dosage (0.005-0.050 g), temperature (120-140 degrees C), and oxygen pressure (20-40 bar). In most experiments, the removals were in the sequence: amoxicillin > naproxen > phenacetin. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) removal measurements were made of some of the natural waters tested. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Bioreactors are often an integral part of dairy factory efforts to reduce the biological oxygen demand of their wastewater. In this study, infeed, mixed liquor and supernatant samples of an aerobic bioreactor used by a dairy factory in South-Eastern Australia were analyzed for nutrients and organic compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and physicochemical analyses. Despite different concentrations of organic inputs into the bioreactor, nutrients and trace organic compounds were reduced significantly (i.e. average concentration of trace organic compounds: infeed = 1681 mu g/L: mixed liquor = 257 mu g/L; supernatant = 23 mu g/L). However, during one sampling period the bioreactor was adversely affected by the organic loading. Trace organic compounds in the samples were predominantly fatty acids associated with animal products. The analyses suggest that it is possible to trace a disruptive input (i.e. infeed with high organic carbon concentrations) into an aerobic bioreactor by measuring concentrations of fatty acids or ammonia.

TI DICLOFENAC IN FISH: BLOOD PLASMA LEVELS SIMILAR TO HUMAN THERAPEUTIC

AB Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug frequently found in the aquatic environment. Previous studies have reported histological changes in the liver, kidney, and gills of fish at concentrations similar to those measured in treated sewage effluents (approximately 1 mu g/L). Analyses or predictions of blood plasma levels in fish allow a direct comparison with human therapeutic plasma levels and may therefore be used to indicate a risk for pharmacological effects in fish. To relate internal exposure to a pharmacological interaction, we investigated global hepatic gene expression together with bioconcentration in blood plasma and liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to waterborne diclofenac. At the highest exposure concentration (81.5 mu g/L), the fish plasma concentration reached approximately 88% of the human therapeutic levels (C-max) after two weeks. Using an oligonucleotide microarray followed by quantitative PCR, we found extensive effects on hepatic gene expression at this concentration, and some genes were found to be regulated down to the lowest exposure concentration tested (1.6 mu g/L), corresponding to a plasma concentration approximately 1.5% of the human C-max. Thus, at concentrations detected in European surface waters, diclofenac can affect the expression of multiple genes in exposed fish. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed effects on biological processes such as inflammation and the immune response, in agreement with the mode of action of diclofenac in mammals. In contrast to some previously reported results, the bioconcentration factor was found to be stable (4.02 +/- 0.75 for blood plasma and 2.54 +/- 0.36 for liver) regardless of the water concentration.

AB Phytoremediation technologies such as constructed wetlands have shown higher efficiencies in removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters than conventional wastewater treatment processes, and plants seem to have an important role in the removal of some of those compounds. In this context, a study was conducted to assess tolerance, uptake, and metabolism of the epilepsy drug, carbamazepine, by the macrophyte Typha spp. This evaluation was conducted in hydroponic solutions with 0.5-2.0 mg/L of this pharmaceutical for a maximum period of 21 days. The removal of carbamazepine from nutrient solutions by the plants reached values of 82% of the initial contents. Furthermore, a metabolite (10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxycarbamazepine) was detected in leaf tissues indicating carbamazepine translocation and metabolism inside plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and guaiacol peroxidase generally increase (after some mild initial inhibition in the case of the latter enzyme) as result of the abiotic stress caused by the exposure to carbamazepine, but ultimately Typha seemed able to cope with its toxicity. The results obtained in this study suggest the ability of Typha spp., to actively participate in the removal of carbamazepine from water when used in phytotreatment systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Transfer of bioactive organic compounds from soil to plants might represent animal and human health risks. Sewage sludge and manure are potential sources for bioactive compounds such as human- and veterinary drugs. In the present study, uptake of the anti-diabetic compound, metformin, the antibiotic agent ciprofloxacin and the anti-coccidial narasin in carrot (Daucus carota ssp. sativus cvs. Napoli) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were investigated. The pharmaceuticals were selected in order to cover various chemical properties, in addition to their presence in relevant environmental matrixes. The root concentration factors (RCF) found in the present study were higher than the corresponding leaf concentration factors (LCF) for the three test pharmaceuticals. The uptake of metformin was higher compared with ciprofloxacin and narasin for all plant compartments analyzed. Metformin was studied more explicitly with regard to uptake and translocation in meadow fescue (Festuca pratense), three other carrot cultivars (D. carota ssp. sativus cvs. Amager, Rothild and Nutri Red), wheat cereal (Triticum aestivum) and turnip rape seed (Brassica campestris). Uptake of metformin in meadow fescue was comparable with uptake in the four carrot cultivars (RCF 2-10, LCF approximately 1.5), uptake in wheat cereals were comparable with barley cereals (seed concentration factors, SCF, 0.02-0.04) while the accumulation in turnip rape seeds was as high as 1.5. All three pharmaceuticals produced negative effects on growth and development of carrots when grown in soil concentration of 6-10 mg kg(-1) dry weight. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Triclosan, a common antimicrobial agent, may react during the disinfection of wastewater with free chlorine to form three chlorinated triclosan derivatives (CTDs). This is of concern because the CTDs may be photochemically transformed to tri- and tetra-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins when discharged into natural waters. In this study, wastewater influent, secondary (pre-disinfection) effluent, and final (post-disinfection) effluent samples were collected on two occasions each from two activated sludge wastewater treatment plants, one using chlorine disinfection and one using UV disinfection. Concentrations of triclosan and three CTDs were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with isotope dilution methodology. Triclosan and the CTDs were detected in every influent sample at levels ranging from 453 to 4530 and 2 to 98 ng L-1, respectively, though both were efficiently removed from the liquid phase during activated sludge treatment. Triclosan concentrations in the pre-disinfection effluent ranged from 36 to 212 ng L-1, while CTD concentrations were below the limit of quantification (1 ng L-1) for most samples. In the treatment plant that used chlorine disinfection, triclosan concentrations decreased while CTDs were formed during chlorination, as evidenced by CTD levels as high as 22 ng L-1 in the final effluent. No CTDs were detected in the final effluent of the treatment plant that used UV disinfection. The total CTD concentration in the final effluent of the chlorinating treatment plant reached nearly one third of the triclosan concentration, demonstrating that the chlorine disinfection step played a substantial role in the fate of triclosan in this system.

AB Concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the order of ng L-1 to sg L-1 have been reported worldwide in waste, fluvial and even drinking water, raising concern about the efficacy of the currently employed waste water treatments in the elimination of this kind of compounds. Despite ranking 29th in terms of population. Spain is currently the 8th country on pharmaceutical prescription with an expense of 14 x 10(9) euros in 2008. In this context, the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 33 pharmaceutically active compounds in specific points of the main rivers of the Madrid Region (MR) as well as tap water samples from the metropolitan area of Madrid. Additionally, a screening level risk characterization by means of the Hazard Quotient (HQ.) method was applied. A total of 25 pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites were detected in the 10 sampling points downstream the outlet of the major STPs of the MR. The highest concentrations were detected for the anticonvulsant carbamazepine and the stimulant caffeine. Concentrations for most of the analyzed compounds exceed levels previously reported in the literature. Moreover, we report the highest concentration of the cytostatic ifosfamide, detected for the first time in Spain in surface water. Preliminary risk characterization shows that a total of 16 compounds represent at least a low potential hazard based on their scored HQs, with five of them present in a concentration that exceeds the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Toxic Units calculation indicates that for all the selected sampling points high hazard is anticipated from the presence of the analyzed compounds in the measured concentrations (TUs > 10). Caffeine and cotinine were detected in all (10) the analyzed tap water samples. Carbamazepine and nicotine were detected in six and venlafaxine in two samples. No studies venlafaxine in drinking water have been reported. These results clearly pinpoint the need for water quality monitoring and research in urban rivers, as well as the need for improved water treatment techniques able to eliminate this kind of compounds from the effluent waters as well as from drinking water sources.

AB Carbamazepine is a psychiatric pharmaceutical widely detected in aquatic environments. Due to its generalized occurrence and environmental persistence it might be considered as an anthropogenic pollution indicator. In this research, a previously developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on a commercial monoclonal antibody, was applied to the quantification of carbamazepine in ground, surface and wastewaters and results were validated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   The performance of the applied ELISA methodology was tested in the presence of high concentrations of sodium chloride and dissolved organic matter. The method was not significantly affected by matrix effects, being adequate for the quantification of carbamazepine in environmental samples, even without sample pre-treatment. This method allows the quantification of carbamazepine in the range of 0.03-10 mu g L(-1), with a relative error lower than 30%. Due to a pH dependent cross-reactivity with cetirizine, an antihistaminic drug, the assay also enabled the quantification of cetirizine in the samples.
   The application of the developed method to the quantification of carbamazepine was performed by using environmental samples with very different matrices, collected in the geographical area of Ria de Aveiro, an estuarine system located in the North of Portugal. Carbamazepine was detected in all analyzed wastewater samples and in one surface water with concentrations between 0.1 and 0.7 mu g L(-1). Validation with LC-MS/MS revealed that results obtained by ELISA are 2-28% overestimated, which was considered highly satisfactory due to the absence of sample pre-treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Among pharmaceuticals and personal care products released into the aquatic environment, antibiotics are of particular concern, because of their ubiquity and health effects. Although scientists have recently paid more attention to the threat of antibiotics to coastal ecosystems, researchers have often focused on relatively few antibiotics, because of the absence of suitable analytical methods. We have therefore developed a method for the rapid detection of 36 antibiotic residues in coastal waters, including tetracyclines (TCs), sulfanilamides (SAs), and quinolones (QLs). The method consists of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. The SPE was performed with Oasis HLB and Oasis MCX cartridges. Chromatographic separation on a C18 column was achieved using a binary eluent containing methanol and water with 0.1% formic acid. Typical recoveries of the analytes ranged from 67.4% to 109.3% at a fortification level of 100 ng/L. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), was below 14.6% for all the compounds. The limits of detection (LODs) varied from 0.45 pg to 7.97 pg. The method was applied to determine the target analytes in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea in Liaoning, China. Among the tested antibiotics, 31 were found in coastal waters, with their concentrations between the LOD and 212.5 ng/L. These data indicate that this method is valid for analysis of antibiotics in coastal waters. The study first reports such a large number of antibiotics along the Yellow Sea coast of Liaoning, and should facilitate future comprehensive evaluation of antibiotics in coastal ecosystems.

ID PRETREATMENT
AB Actual pharmaceutical wastewater was treated using a combined ultrasonic irradiation (US) and iron/coke internal electrolysis (Fe/C) technology. A significant synergetic effect was observed, showing that ultrasonic irradiation dramatically enhanced the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies by internal electrolysis. The effects of primary operating factors on COD removal were evaluated systematically. Higher ultrasonic frequency and lower pH values as well as longer reaction time were favorable to COD removal. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) of the wastewater increased from 0.21 to 0.32 after US-Fe/C treatment. An acute biotoxicity assay measuring the inhibition of bioluminescence indicated that the wastewater with overall toxicity of 4.3 mg-Zn2+center dot L-1 was reduced to 0.5 mg-Zn2+center dot L-1 after treatment. Both the raw and the treated wastewater samples were separated and identified. The types of compounds suggested that the increased biodegradability and reduced biotoxicity resulted mainly from the destruction of N,N-2 dimethyl formamide and aromatic compounds in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The occurrence of bioactive trace pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in natural waters is an emerging issue. Numerous pharmaceuticals are not completely removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Advanced oxidation processes may represent an interesting alternative to completely mineralize organic trace pollutants. In this article, we show that sulfate radicals generated from peroxymonosulfate/Co(II) are more efficient than hydroxyl radicals generated from the Fenton's reagent (H(2)O(2)/Fe(II)) for the degradation of the pharmaceutical compound, carbamazepine. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of SO(4) (center dot-) with carbamazepine is 1.92 center dot 10(9) M(-1) s(-1). In laboratory grade water and in real urban wastewater, SO(4) (center dot-) yielded a faster degradation of carbamazepine compared to HO(center dot) . Under strongly oxidizing conditions, a nearly complete mineralization of carbamazepine was achieved, while under mildly oxidizing conditions, several intermediates were identified by LC-MS. These results show for the first time in real urban wastewater that sulfate radicals are more selective than hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of an organic pollutant and may represent an interesting alternative in advanced oxidation processes.

AB Advanced treatment techniques, like ozone, activated carbon and TiO2 in combination with UV, are proposed to improve removal efficiency of micropollutants during wastewater treatment. In a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature, we found significantly reduced overall ecotoxicity of municipal wastewaters treated with either ozone (n=667) or activated carbon (=113), while TiO2 and UV was not yet assessed. As comparative investigations regarding the detoxification potential of these advanced treatment techniques in municipal wastewater are scarce, we assessed them in four separate Gammarus-feeding trials with 20 replicates per treatment. These bioassays indicate that ozone concentrations of approximately 0.8 mg ozone/mg DOC may produce toxic transformation products. However, referred effects are removed if higher ozone concentrations are used (1.3 mg ozone/mg DOC). Moreover, the application of 1 g TiO2/I and ambient UV consistently reduced ecotoxicity. Although activated carbon may remove besides micropollutants also nutrients, which seemed to mask its detoxification potential, this treatment technique reduced the ecotoxicity of the wastewater following its amendment with nutrients. Hence, all three advanced treatment techniques are suitable to reduce the ecotoxicity of municipal wastewater mediated by micropollutants and may hence help to meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB Over the last years, extensive research has documented endocrine-disrupting activities for a significant number of substances including, among others, hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and surfactants. Nonetheless, for most endocrine disruptors, toxicological profiles are still incomplete or even lacking. A systematic review has shown that a number of endocrine disruptors with steroid-modulating effects may also exert mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. For trenbolone, an androgenic compound, there is controversy about its genotoxic properties in the literature, apparently with a strong dependence on the choice of the test system. Since fish and other aquatic animals are at risk of exposure to run-offs from cattle feedlots or sewage-discharge sites containing trenbolone, potential consequences to aquatic ecosystems need to be assessed. To this end, the potential genotoxic hazard of trenbolone was tested in vitro in the permanent rainbow trout-liver cell-line RTL-W1, as well as in primary cell cultures derived from zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after in vivo exposure. In either test system, a potential genotoxic hazard characterized by biphasic dose-response curves could be documented even at exposure concentrations of 30 mu g/L. These results thus confirm the conclusion that the steroid trenbolone may act as a genotoxic substance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to identify commercial pharmaceuticals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (P&B) and that were not being considered in current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. We developed a database of 3193 pharmaceuticals from two U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases and some lists of top ranked or selling drugs. Of the 3193 pharmaceuticals, 275 pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment and 399 pharmaceuticals were, based upon production volumes, designated as high production volume (HPV) pharmaceuticals. All pharmaceuticals that had reported chemical structures were evaluated for potential bioaccumulation (B) or persistence (P) using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) or scientific judgment. Of the 275 drugs detected in the environment, 92 were rated as potentially bioaccumulative, 121 were rated as potentially persistent, and 99 were HPV pharmaceuticals. After removing the 275 pharmaceuticals previously detected in the environment, 58 HPV compounds were identified that were both P&B and 48 were identified as P only. Of the non-HPV compounds, 364 pharmaceuticals were identified that were P&B. This study has yielded some interesting and probable P&B pharmaceuticals that should be considered for further study.

AB The effect of seasonal changes, ionic strength, effluent dilution, transmembrane pressure and spiked concentration on the rejection of the pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) by reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF), was studied. They represent two families of compounds owning low/medium hydrophobicity and relatively high stability to biological transformation at wastewater treatment plant conditions, frequently present in effluents. Experiments were performed with membrane bioreactor effluents and ultrapure water (UPW) to test the influence of background matrix on the rejection. Three RO (BW. SW and XLE) and two NF (NF90 and NF270) membranes were tested. RO exhibited high rejection of both the compounds (> 98%) regardless of membrane resolution or conditions tested. The loosest membrane tested, NF270, displayed a marked seasonal influence on CBZ rejection from effluents (up to 92% in summer and down to 50% in winter), whereas its rejection from UPW was steady (74 +/- 7%). These findings strongly suggest that interactions between low/medium hydrophobicity-PhACs and effluent organic matter (EfOM) took place which markedly changed rejection efficiencies. These interactions seem to be highly correlated to EfOM quality, being enhanced during summer, increasing the removal of small PhACs even by loose nonporous membranes, but decreasing during winter, thus reducing rejection.

AB Removal of numerous classes of pharmaceuticals from the municipal and industrial wastewater, using conventional wastewater treatment, is incomplete and several studies suggested that improvement of this situation would require the application of advanced treatment techniques. This is particularly important for the treatment of industrial effluents, released from pharmaceutical industries, which can contain rather high concentrations of antimicrobials. The aim of this work was to evaluate membrane bioreactors (MBRs), nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and ozonation, as well as their combinations, for the removal of antimicrobials from a synthetic wastewater which simulated highly contaminated industrial effluents. The study was performed using a mixture of four important classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides (SA), fluoroquinolones (FQ), macrolides (MAC) and trimethoprim (TMP). Performance of two different types of MBRs, Kubota and Zenon, was evaluated under different regimes regarding hydraulic retention time, total organic load and total nitrogen load. It was shown that elimination of SA in MBR treatment was very efficient, while the elimination of MAC, FQ and TMP was incomplete. A mass balance of these contaminants in MBR suggested that microbial transformation represented the main mechanism, while only a small percentage was eliminated from the aqueous phase by adsorption onto sludge particles. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis achieved high elimination rates however produced highly contaminated concentrate. High removal was achieved using ozonation, but further research is needed to characterize formed ozonation products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an environmentally recalcitrant compound highly stable in soil and during wastewater treatment. In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus metabolizes CBZ in liquid culture using a physiological approach. P. ostreatus PC9 was grown in media known to support different levels of a multiplicity of enzyme systems such as cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). When both CYP450 and MnP systems were active, 99% of the added CBZ was eliminated from the solution and transformed to 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine. High removal of CBZ was also obtained when either MnP or CYP450 was active. When both CYP450 and MnP were inactivated, only 10 to 30% of the added CBZ was removed. In this latter system, removal of CBZ might be partially attributed to the activity of versatile peroxidase. P. ostreatus was able to eliminate CBZ in liquid culture even when CBZ was added at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g L-1). On the basis of our study, we suggest that two families of enzymes are involved in the oxidation of CBZ in liquid culture: MnP in a Mn2+-dependent or independent manner and CYP450. Our study also highlights the potential of using P. ostreatus for bioremediation systems.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) were investigated as a source of iodine in the formation of iodo-trihalomethane (iodo-THM) and iodo-acid disinfection byproducts (DBPs), both of which are highly genotoxic and/or cytotoxic in mammalian cells. ICM are widely used at medical centers to enable imaging of soft tissues (e.g., organs, veins, blood vessels) and are designed to be inert substances, with 95% eliminated in urine and feces unmetabolized within 24 h. ICM are not well removed in wastewater treatment plants, such that they have been found at elevated concentrations in rivers and streams (up to 100 mu g/L). Naturally occurring iodide in source waters is believed to be a primary source of iodine in the formation of iodo-DBPs, but a previous 23-city iodo-DBP occurrence study also revealed appreciable levels of iodo-DBPs in some drinking waters that had very low or no detectable iodide in their source waters. When 10 of the original 23 cities' source waters were resampled, four ICM were found-iopamidol, iopromide, iohexol, and diatrizoate-with iopamidol most frequently detected, in 6 of the 10 plants sampled, with concentrations up to 2700 ng/L. Subsequent controlled laboratory reactions of iopamidol with aqueous chlorine and monochloramine in the absence of natural organic matter (NOM) produced only trace levels of iodo-DBPs; however, when reacted in real source waters (containing NOM), chlorine and monochloramine produced significant levels of iodo-THMs and iodo-acids, up to 212 nM for dichloroiodomethane and 3.0 nM for iodoacetic acid, respectively, for chlorination. The pH behavior was different for chlorine and monochloramine, such that iodo-DBP concentrations maximized at higher pH (8.5) for chlorine, but at lower pH (6.5) for monochloramine. Extracts from chloraminated source waters with and without iopamidol, as well as from chlorinated source waters with iopamidol, were the most cytotoxic samples in mammalian cells. Source waters with iopamidol but no disinfectant added were the least cytotoxic. While extracts from chlorinated and chloraminated source waters were genotoxic, the addition of iopamidol enhanced their genotoxicity. Therefore, while ICM are not toxic in themselves, their presence in source waters may be a source of concern because of the formation of highly toxic iodo-DBPs in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water.

AB Global concern about the persistence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in the freshwater environment is more evident due to their possible disruptive effects. Even at nanogram levels these compounds increase the risk of cancer, decrease egg and sperm production, reduce gamete quality and tend complete feminization of the male fish. The present study demonstrated the potential of activated charcoal as adsorbent in removing synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) from aqueous phase by sorption process employing both agitated batch and column adsorption experiments. Batch sorption studies showed good removal of EE2 and dependent on the concentration loaded. Equilibrium data of EE2-charcoal sorption system showed a reasonably good fit with pseudo first-order kinetic plot. Intra-particle diffusion plot indicated the complex nature of EE2-charcoal sorption system involving both boundary layer and intra-particle diffusions. Experimental data confirmed to linear Langmuir's isotherm model. Highest EE2 sorption capacity of activated charcoal was observed at neutral conditions. Fixed bed column studies were performed with EE2 spiked untreated domestic sewage. Based on the data derived by fixed bed column studies, rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) methodology was used to design full-scale GAC system. Total EE2 concentration was quantitatively estimated by direct competitive immuno-enzymatic colorimetric method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study focused on the degradation of the worldwide Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IBP) by gamma irradiation. Factors affecting IBP degradation efficiency were examined. The results showed that IBP concentration decreased with an increasing absorbed dose. When IBP concentration of 28.3 mg/L and an absorbed dose of 1.1 kGy were chosen, IBP degradation value was 100%. The degradation process of IBP could be depicted by first order reaction kinetics when the absorbed dose was less than 0.9 kGy. 0.1% H2O2 and humic acid additives enhanced IBP degradation process, while 0.5% H2O2 additive restrained the degradation of IBP. The additions of CO32-, NO3-, CH3OH and thiourea restrained the degradation process. The pH value affected the IBP degradation. The degradation efficiency was more efficient under acidic condition than in neutral or alkaline media. The solution pH value became lower with increasing absorbed dose after gamma irradiation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESMS) techniques were employed to identify the IBP derivatives. The mono- and quadric-hydroxylated of IBP and the products due to the oxidation of propanoic acid, and isobutyl substituents of IBP were identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments has been of increasing concern in developed and developing countries. The major sources of pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems are waste streams from hospital effluents and excretion (in both metabolized and un-metabolized forms) from humans and animals. This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of four beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol and acebutolol) and four beta-agonists (tulobuterol, salbutamol, clenbuterol and ractopamine) from three hospital effluents and four rivers in southern Taiwan. Analysis was performed via solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. All targets were detected at least once in all collected samples. The most frequently detected compounds were propranolol, atenolol, acebutolol, and ractopamine, which were found in >70% of the collected samples. 83% of water samples contained three or more target compounds. Metoprolol was found in relatively higher concentrations (up to 592 ng/L) in one hospital effluent, although most target compounds were detected in ng/L-range. The concentrations of beta-blockers and beta-agonists observed here were comparable to those reported in previous studies around the world.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have raised considerable concern around the world due to their potential toxicity for ecological system and human health. PPCPs are ineffectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes and thus occur widely in aqueous environments. This study investigated the occurrence and removal of 28 often-used PPCPs (including selected antibiotics, estrogens, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and lipid regulators) in the primary, secondary and tertiary (ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (UF/RO)) treatment processes of the Water Resource Recycling Center (WRRC) and surface waters in Taiwan. We have demonstrated 20 target PPCPs in WRRC influents; sulfamethoxazole (1353 ng/L), caffeine (6823 ng/L) and acetaminophen (2716 ng/L) were found at high concentrations. Secondary and chlorination processes showed inefficient removal for PPCPs (12 PPCPs had <80% removal). However, most target compounds were removed effectively (with similar to 90% removal) in the tertiary process (UF/RO) except for oxytetracycline and caffeine, and the overall removal efficiency by WRRC was >99%. More than 10 compounds were detected in the surveyed surface waters (from reservoirs, river waters and dams). Caffeine had the highest observed concentration (1,813 ng/L) while others were present at <260 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine and caffeine were detected most frequently (>70%). Some of the PPCPs found originated from discharges from conventional wastewater treatment plants. In conclusion, RO demonstrated good overall performance and could be used to process wastewater to better ensure the health of humans and wildlife.

AB The removal efficiency of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater (dissolved and particulate phases) was evaluated for the first time in a hybrid pilot plant consisting of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor followed by two sequentially connected horizontal flow constructed wetlands: a surface flow wetland (SF CW) and a subsurface flow wetland (SSF CW). Whereas the PPCP removal associated with the dissolved phase exhibited a seasonal pattern, the fraction associated with the suspended solids showed less seasonality. In the dissolved phase, the overall removal efficiency in summer ranged from 70% to 85% for salicylic acid (SAL), methyl dihydrojasmonate, caffeine (CAF), ketoprofen and triclosan, whereas in winter it declined for most of the PPCPs to between 30% and 50%, except for CAF and SAL (>80%) and carbamazepine and butylated hydroxyl toluene (11-18%). In the suspended solids, the removal exceeded 80% for most of the target PPCPs. The efficiency of the different treatment steps was also compound-dependent, but the SF CW generally exhibited the highest removal efficiency for most of the contaminants analyzed. The characterization of the organic matter retained in the wetland gravel beds revealed the occurrence of hydrophobic contaminants such as phthalate esters and fragrances at moderate concentrations (i.e., up to 3.5 mu g kg(-1)), which declined strongly over the course of the different treatment steps. In the SF CW, the net mass accumulation rates of tonalide and galaxolide were 4 and 23 g y(-1) respectively, whereas in the SSF CW they were 0.3 and 1.8 g y(-1) respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The basis for the tool was a selection of so-called anchor molecules and a multidimensional chemical map of drugs. The map was constructed using principal component analysis covering 899 drugs described by 67 diverse calculated chemical descriptors. The anchor molecules (diclofenac, trimethoprim, and carbamazepine) were selected to represent drugs of known environmental concern. In addition 12 chemicals listed by the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants were used representing typical environmental pollutants. Chemical similarity was quantified by measuring relative Euclidean distances in the five-dimensional chemical map, and more than 100 nearest neighbors (kNNs) were found within a relative distance of less than 10% from each drug anchor. The developed chemical similarity approach not only identified persistent or semipersistent drugs but also a large number of potentially persistent drugs lacking environmental fate data.

AB Hospital effluent and connected waste water treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent were sampled daily to determine the levels and inter-day variations of three naturally occurring steroid estrogens: estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and synthetic 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. After solid phase extraction, interferences were removed with a silica gel clean-up step and the samples analysed using gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MSD). The determined inter-day concentrations in hospital effluent were between 8.6 to 31.3 ng L(-1) for estrone, <LOD (limit of detection) to 4.2 ng L(-1) for 17 beta-estradiol and 6.4 to 385.5 ng L(-1) for estriol. In the WWTP influent concentrations were 18.9 to 49.7 ng L(-1) for estrone, 2.4 to 12.7 ng L(-1), for 17 beta-estradiol and <LOQ (limit of quantitation) to 63.9 ng L(-1) for estriol. Reduced levels were found in the WWTP effluent: <7.1 ng L(-1) for estrone, <LOQ for 17 beta-estradiol and <5.2 ng L(-1) for estriol. 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was detected in only one influent sample. Calculated estradiol equivalents (EEQ) were 33.4, 22.4, 1.7 ng (EEQ) L(-1) in the hospital effluent, WWTP influent and WWTP effluent, respectively. Interestingly, the estrone : 17 beta-estradiol : estriol ratio in the hospital effluent (1 : 0.1 : 9.4) is comparable to that found in the urine of pregnant women (1 : 0.3 : 20) indicating the most likely source of steroid estrogens. In WWTP influent the ratio was similar to that found in the non-pregnant population. Our result recognise estriol as being one of the most important steroid estrogens, accounting for up to 92% of the total EEQ present in hospital samples and 37% and 46% in WWTP influent and effluent samples, respectively. The study reveals how concentrations of steroid estrogens vary on a daily basis and concludes that careful sampling strategies must be adopted when making a risk assessment. In addition, the low potency steroid estrogens that contribute towards overall estrogenicity of the sample, e.g. estriol, should be incorporated into environmental monitoring programs.

AB This study investigated the removal of parabens, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and phthalates by ozonation. The second-order rate constants for the reaction between selected compounds with ozone at pH 7 were of (2.2 +0.2) x 10(6) to (2.9 +0.3) x 10(6) M-1/s for parabens, (2.1 +/- 0.3) to (3.9 +/-0.5) M-1/s for phthalates, and (5.2 +/-0.3) M-1/s for DEET. The rate constants for the reaction between selected compounds with hydroxyl radical ranged from (2.49 +/-0.06) x 10(9) to (8.5 +/-0.2) x 10(9) M-1/s. Ozonation of selected compounds in secondary wastewater and surface waters revealed that ozone dose of 1 and 3 mg/L yielded greater than 99% depletion of parabens and greater than 92% DEET and phthalates, respectively. In addition, parabens were found to transform almost exclusively through the reaction with ozone, while DEET and phthalates were transformed almost entirely by hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH).

AB The present study investigates the biodegradation of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by active biomass in activated sludge. Active heterotrophs (X-bh) which are known to govern COD removal are suggested as a determining factor for biological PhAC removal as well. Biodegradation kinetics of five polar PhACs were determined in activated sludge of two wastewater treatment plants which differed in size, layout and sludge retention time (SRT).
   Results showed that active fractions of the total suspended solids (TSS) differed significantly between the two sludges, indicating that TSS does not reveal information about heterotrophic activity. Furthermore, PhAC removal was significantly faster in the presence of high numbers of heterotrophs and a low SRI. Pseudo first-order kinetics were modified to include Xbh and used to describe decreasing PhAC elimination with increasing SRT. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol tartrate and propranolol hydrochloride was studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF). Solutions of 10 L of 100 mg L(-1) of total organic carbon of each drug in 0.1 M Na(2)SO(4) with 0.5 mM Fe(2+) of pH 3.0 were treated in a recirculation flow plant with an electrochemical reactor coupled with a solar compound parabolic collector. Single Pt/carbon felt (CF) and boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion electrode (ADE) cells and combined Pt/ADE-Pt/CF and BDD/ADE-Pt/CF cells were used. SPEF treatments were more potent with the latter cell, yielding 95-97% mineralization with 100% of maximum current efficiency and energy consumptions of about 0.250 kWh g TOC(-1). However, the Pt/ADE-Pt/CF cell gave much lower energy consumptions of about 0.080 kWh g TOC(-1) with slightly lower mineralization of 88-93%, then being more useful for its possible application at industrial level. The EF method led to a poorer mineralization and was more potent using the combined cells by the additional production of hydroxyl radicals ((center dot)OH) from Fenton's reaction from the fast Fe(2+) regeneration at the CF cathode. Organics were also more rapidly destroyed at BDD than at Pt anode. The decay kinetics of beta-blockers always followed a pseudo first-order reaction, although in SPEF, it was accelerated by the additional production of (center dot)OH from the action of UV light of solar irradiation. Aromatic intermediates were also destroyed by hydroxyl radicals. Ultimate carboxylic acids like oxalic and oxamic remained in the treated solutions by EF, but their Fe(III) complexes were photolyzed by solar irradiation in SPEF, thus explaining its higher oxidation power. NO(3)(-) was the predominant inorganic ion lost in EF, whereas the SPEF process favored the production of NH(4)(+) ion and volatile N-derivatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Permethrin entered use in the 1970s as an insecticide in a wide range of applications, including agriculture, horticultural, and forestry, and has since been restricted. In the 21st century, the presence of permethrin in the aquatic environment has been attributed to its use as a human and veterinary pharmaceutical, in particular as a pedeculicide, in addition to other uses, such as a moth-proofing agent. However, as a consequence of its toxicity to fish, sources of permethrin and its fate and behavior during wastewater treatment are topics of concern. This study has established that high overall removal of permethrin (approximately 90%) was achieved during wastewater treatment and that this was strongly dependent on the extent of biological degradation in secondary treatment, with more limited subsequent removal in tertiary treatment processes. Sources of permethrin in the catchment matched well with measured values in crude sewage and indicated that domestic use accounted for more than half of the load to the treatment works. However, removal may not be consistent enough to achieve the environmental quality standards now being derived in many countries even where tertiary treatment processes are applied.

AB Although biotransformation is generally considered to be the main process by which to remove pharmaceuticals, both in sewage treatment plants and in aquatic environments, quantitative information on specific compounds is scarce. In this study, the transformations of diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX), and bisoprolol (BSP) were studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using inocula taken from activated and digested sludge processes, respectively. Whereas concentration decays were monitored by LC-tandem mass spectrometry, oxygen consumption and methane production were used for the evaluation of the performance of overall conditions. DCF was recalcitrant against both aerobic and anaerobic biotransformation. More than one third of the BSP disappeared under aerobic conditions, whereas only 14% was anaerobically biotransformed in 161 days. Under aerobic conditions, complete removal of NPX was evident within 14 days, but anaerobic transformation was also efficient. Formation of 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, a previously reported aerobic metabolite, was also detected under anaerobic conditions and persisted for 161 days.

AB Triclosan, a common antimicrobial agent, may react during the disinfection of wastewater with free chlorine to form three chlorinated triclosan derivatives (CTDs). This is of concern because the CTDs may be photochemically transformed to tri- and tetra-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins when discharged into natural waters. In this study, wastewater influent, secondary (pre-disinfection) effluent, and final (post-disinfection) effluent samples were collected on two occasions each from two activated sludge wastewater treatment plants, one using chlorine disinfection and one using UV disinfection. Concentrations of triclosan and three CTDs were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with isotope dilution methodology. Triclosan and the CTDs were detected in every influent sample at levels ranging from 453 to 4530 and 2 to 98 ng L-1, respectively, though both were efficiently removed from the liquid phase during activated sludge treatment. Triclosan concentrations in the pre-disinfection effluent ranged from 36 to 212 ng L-1, while CTD concentrations were below the limit of quantification (1 ng L-1) for most samples. In the treatment plant that used chlorine disinfection, triclosan concentrations decreased while CTDs were formed during chlorination, as evidenced by CTD levels as high as 22 ng L-1 in the final effluent. No CTDs were detected in the final effluent of the treatment plant that used UV disinfection. The total CTD concentration in the final effluent of the chlorinating treatment plant reached nearly one third of the triclosan concentration, demonstrating that the chlorine disinfection step played a substantial role in the fate of triclosan in this system.

AB A robust multi-residue method was developed for the analysis of a selection of pharmaceutical compounds, illicit drugs and personal care product bactericides in sediments and sludges. Human pharmaceuticals were selected for analysis in Scottish sewage sludge and freshwater sediments based on prescription, physico-chemical and occurrence data. The method was suitable for the analysis of the selected illicit drugs amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, and methamphetamine, the pharmaceuticals atenolol, bendroflumethiazide, carbamazepine, citalopram, diclofenac, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and salbutamol, and the bactericides triclosan and triclocarban in sewage sludge and freshwater sediment. The method provided an overall recovery of between 56 and 128%, RSDs of between 2 and 19% and LODs of between 1 and 50 ng g(-1). Using the methodology the human pharmaceuticals atenolol, carbamazepine and citalopram and the bactericides triclosan and triclocarban were detected in Scottish sewage sludge. The illicit drugs cocaine, its metabolite benzoylecgonine, amphetamine and methamphetamine were not detected in any of the samples analysed. Triclosan and triclocarban were present at the highest concentrations with triclocarban detected in all but one sample and showing a pattern of co-occurrence in both sludge and sediment samples.

AB The adsorptive removal of five sulfa drugs (sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethizole, sulfadimidine and sulfamethoxazole) from an aqueous solution using a high-silica zeolite (HSZ-385) was investigated. pH greatly affected adsorption efficiency, and the amounts of all sulfa drugs adsorbed on HSZ-385 decreased at pH levels below and above their pK(a,1) and pK(a,2) values, respectively. We hypothesized that sulfa drugs in the neutral form would more readily adsorb onto HSZ-385 compared to those in the cationic and anionic forms, with adsorption predominately occurring via hydrophobic interactions. The Langmuir model was suitable for describing the adsorption of neutral sulfa drugs on HSZ-385, and a pH-dependent adsorption model was developed by considering the acid-base equilibria of the sulfa drugs. The calculated and experimental results corresponded well, strongly supporting our suggestion that the dominant adsorbed species was the neutral form and that the adsorption mechanism was based on hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the adsorption rate of the sulfa drugs on the zeolite was kinetically evaluated using a pseudo-second-order model, and a high adsorption rate was observed. The adsorption of sulfa drugs reached equilibrium within 15 min, indicating that HSZ-385 is a promising adsorbent for removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous media. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study two pilot scale Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetlands (HSFCWs) near Lecce, Italy, planted with different macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia) and an unplanted control were assessed for their effectiveness in removing paracetamol. Residence time distributions (RTDs) for the two beds indicated that the Typha bed was characterized by a void volume fraction (porosity) of 0.16 and exhibited more ideal plug flow behavior (Pe = 29.7) than the Phragmites bed (Pe = 26.7), which had similar porosity. The measured hydraulic residence times in the planted beds were 35.8 and 36.7 h when the flow was equal to 1 m(3)/d. The Phragmites bed exhibited a range of paracetamol removals from 51.7% for a Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR) of 240 mm/d to 87% with 120 mm/d HLR and 99.9% with 30 mm/d. The Typha bed showed a similar behavior with percentages of removal slightly lower, ranging from 46.7% (HLR of 240 mm/d) to >99.9% (hydraulic loading rate of 30 mm/d). At the same HLR values the unplanted bed removed between 51.3% and 97.6% of the paracetamol. In all three treatments the paracetamol removal was higher with flow of 1 m(3)/d and an area of approx. 7.5 m(2) (half bed) than in the case of flow equal to 0.5 m(3)/d with a surface treatment of approx. 3.75 m(2). A first order model for paracetamol removal was evaluated and half lives of 5.16 to 10.2 h were obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Toxic effects evidenced in the environment are most often caused by mixtures of known and unknown pollutants. One of the key challenges in environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology is to characterize and identify those toxicants in relation with the effect. However, many of the current bottlenecks in the assessment of organic contaminants in our environment are related to the difficulty of evaluating various chemical classes and biological effects within complex mixtures and more precisely to link both approaches. To tackle these analytical challenges, the bioanalytical concept has emerged during the last decade. In this article, we describe through some outstanding examples the current limitations in the chemical-driven approach such as problems encountered for a correct evaluation of water quality when the continuous introduction of new chemicals has to be taken into account in monitoring for correct evaluation of this quality and could led to tremendous analytical costs or some of the integrated bioanalytical approaches as promising powerful tools to improve environmental risk assessment by taking into account the link presence/effect.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) has been used as an antimicrobial compound for many decades due to its sanitising properties. Recent studies showed that TCC is toxic and causes disruption to the endocrine system. In this work, ozone oxidation of TCC was studied in 70% acetonitrile:30% water solutions. Ozone degraded TCC effectively and the reaction rates increased substantially with ozone gas concentration, pH and temperature. Second-order-reaction kinetics was suitable to describe the chemical reaction. The effect of temperature was described by the Arrhenius equation and the activation energy was found equal to 31.0 kJ/mol. The stoichiometry of the reaction was one and the value of the rate constant at pH 7 was 5 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Guadalquivir River (South of Spain) is among the major freshwater sources of the European Atlantic basin. Until now scientific efforts have been focused on contamination by heavy metals and some priority pollutants in Guadalquivir River. However, the presence of "emerging contaminants", such as pharmaceutically active compounds, has not yet been studied. In this work the occurrence and risk assessment of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds, belonging to different therapeutic groups, in Guadalquivir River during its course through Seville city are reported. Wastewater effluents from four wastewater treatment plants discharging into Guadalquivir River and river water samples were analyzed. All studied pharmaceutically active compounds, except sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, estrone and clofibric acid, were detected in effluent wastewaters at concentration levels up to 28.9 mu g L(-1). Among the pharmaceutically active compounds found in effluent wastewater, seven were present in Guadalquivir River samples at concentration levels up to 0.75 mu g L(-1), which indicated an important dilution from effluent discharge. Environmental risk assessment reveals that potential ecotoxicological risk cannot be expected on Guadalquivir River at measured concentration levels. Only, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil showed a medium risk for the environment. The risk for acute toxic effects in the environment with the current use of active pharmaceutical ingredients is unlikely. However, the results do not rule out the potential for chronic environmental effects.

AB In recent years, sludge generated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and solid waste from livestock being utilized is useful for circulation of nourishment in farmlands as recycled organic manure (ROM). In this study, we determined the residue levels and patterns of 12 pharmaceutical products generated by human activity in the ROMs produced from human waste sludge (HWS), sewage sludge (SS), cattle manure (CM), poultry manure (PM), swine manure (SM) and horse manure (HM).
   The kind and number of pharmaceutical products detected in ROMs were different. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) were detected at high levels in HWS and SS samples. In addition, the detection frequency and concentration levels of sulfonamides (SAs) in PM and SM were high. Moreover, high concentrations of chlortetracycline (CTC) were found in only SM. These differences reflect specific adherence adsorption of the pharmaceutical products to different livestock and humans. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of pharmaceutical products and fermentation levels of ROMs had significant positive correlation (r = 0.41, p = 0.024).
   When the fermentation test of ROM was conducted in a rotary fermentor in a lab scale test, the residue levels of pharmaceutical products decreased effectively except carbamazepine (CBZ). The rates of decrease were in the case of tetracyclines (TCs): 85-92%, FQs: 81-100%, erythromycine: 67%, SAs: 79-95%, trimethoprim: 86% and CBZ: 37% by 30 d. Pharmaceutical products that can be decomposed by fermentation process at the lowest impact of residual antibiotic activities may therefore be considered as environmentally friendly medicines.

AB N-Nitrosamines such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) are organic compounds of environmental concern in groundwater, wastewater and potable water due to their potent carcinogenicity in laboratory animal studies and probable human carcinogenicity. While passive sampling techniques have become a widely used tool for providing time-averaged estimates of trace pollutant concentration, for chemicals such as NDMA that have relatively high water solubility, the selection of a suitable sorbent is difficult. This work is a proof of principle study that investigated for the first time the use of coconut charcoal as a passive sampler sorbent. Apparent charcoal/water sorption coefficients for NDMA were >551 mL g(-1) at environmentally relevant aqueous concentrations of less than 1 mu g L-1. Under the experimental conditions employed, a sampling rate of 0.45 Ld(-1) was determined and for an aqueous concentration of 1000 ng L-1, it is predicted that the sampler remains in the linear uptake stage for approximately 4 d, while equilibrium attainment would require about 26 d. The presence of humic acid, used as a surrogate for DOC, enhanced NDMA sorption on the coconut charcoal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methyl orange is used in textile, printing, paper, manufacturing, pharmaceutical or food industries and in research laboratories. Because of its structure, this dye is rather difficult to degrade and is used as reference for advanced removal of dyes from the textile industry. Wastewater removal using second raw materials for substrates development represents a novel trend that complies with the sustainability requirements. As substrates ash, especially fly ash is investigated but attempts were done also for the use of raw wood wastes. The potential capacity of sawdust as adsorbent for the methyl orange (MO) dye was tested in our work. Three types of sawdust were tested: oak wood (Querqus robur), white poplar (Populus alba) and willow (Salix alba L.) along with their mixtures with fly ash. The adsorption efficiency of MO was tested from 0.1 mMol/L solution. We evaluate the effects of various parameters such as contact time, initial dye concentration, pH. The equilibrium data were modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and the adsorption mechanisms was discussed, correlated with the substrates structure and morphology. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model.

AB The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of the combined process of biofiltration with ozonation to improve the quality of secondary effluent. The secondary effluent from the Dinapur Sewage Treatment Plant Varanasi, India was used in this work. The process of biofiltration with the plant species of Eichornia crassipes and Lemna minor, at a flow rate of 262 ml min(-1) and plant density of 30 mg L(-1) for 48 h, in combination with the process of ozonation with ozone dose of 10 mg L(-1) and contact time of 5 min was applied. Results revealed that combined process was statistically most suitable for the highest degradation of physico-chemical and microbial parameters with improving BDOC value. The biofiltration process is able to remove highest percentage of toxic heavy metals from the secondary effluent without production of toxicity. This technique is highly recommendable for tropical wastewater where sewage is mixed with industrial effluents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to demonstrate that integrating biological process and photocatalytic oxidation in a system operated in recycling mode can be a promising technology to treat pharmaceutical wastewater characterized by simultaneous presence of biodegradable and refractory/inhibitory compounds. A lab-scale system integrating a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a TiO2 slurry photoreactor was fed on simulated wastewater containing 10 mg/L of the refractory drug Carbamazepine (CBZ). Majority of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed by the MBR, while the photocatalytic oxidation was capable to degrade CBZ. CBZ degradation kinetics and its impacts on the biological process were studied. The adoption of a recycling ratio of 4:1 resulted in removal of up to 95% of CBZ. Effluent COD reduction, sludge yield increase and respirometric tests suggested that the oxidation products were mostly biodegradable and not inhibiting the microbial activity. These results evidenced the advantages of the proposed approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater and similar industrial effluents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals have been reported in wastewater effluent at the nanogram to low microgram-per-liter range, and include bupropion (BUP), fluoxetine (FLX), sertraline (SER), and venlafaxine (VEN). To assess the effects of antidepressants on reproductive anatomy, physiology, and behavior, adult male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 21 days either to a single concentration of the antidepressants FLX, SER. VEN, or BUP, or to an antidepressant mixture. The data demonstrated that exposure to VEN (305 ng/L and 1104 ng/L) and SER (5.2 ng/L) resulted in mortality. Anatomical alterations were noted within the testes of fish exposed to SER and FLX, both modulators of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Additionally, FLX at 28 ng/L induced vitellogenin in male fish a common endpoint for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Significant alterations in male secondary sex characteristics were noted with single exposures. Effects of single compound exposures neither carried over, nor became additive in the antidepressant mixtures, and reproductive behavior was not affected. Analysis of brain tissues from the exposed fish suggested increased uptake of FLX, SER and BUP and minimal uptake of VEN when compared to exposure water concentrations. Furthermore, the only metabolite detected consistently in the brain tissues was norfluoxetine. Similar trends of uptake by brain tissue were observed when fish were exposed to antidepressant mixtures. The present study demonstrates that anatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants. The observation that antidepressant uptake into fish tissues is selective may have consequences on assessing the mode-of-action and effects of these compounds in future studies.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have emerged as a group of potential environmental contaminants of concern. PPCPs in soil may enter terrestrial food webs via plant uptake. We evaluated uptake of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and triclosan in bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown in sand and soil. The extent of uptake and accumulation of EE2 and triclosan in plants grown in sand was higher than in plants grown in soil. In sand (conditions of maximum contaminant bioavailability), bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of EE2 and triclosan in roots (based on dry weights) were 1424 and 16,364, respectively, whereas BCFs in leaves were 55 for EE2 and 85 for triclosan. In soil, the BCF of EE2 decreased from 154 in the first week to 32 in the fourth week while it fluctuated in leaves from 18 to 20. The BCF for triclosan in plants grown in soil increased over time to 12 in roots and 8 in leaves. These results indicate that the potential for uptake and accumulation of PPCPs in plants exists. This trophic transfer pathway should be considered when assessing exposure to certain PPCPs, particularly with the use of recycled wastewater for irrigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were calibrated in situ for selected illicit drugs and their metabolites at a sewage treatment works. Eleven out of 13 target compounds were detected and eight of those exhibited linear uptake kinetics with sampling rates between 0.035 and 0.150 L d(-1). Subsequently POCIS were deployed for 2 week periods over the course of a whole year, in order to examine trends in drug usage. Amphetamine and methamphetamine showed several similar peaks in concentration during the course of the year as did cocaine and two of its metabolites. Low levels of ecstasy were observed, with a prominent peak in May and a steady increase toward the end of the year. The antihistamine Cetirizine showed a clear increase in use during the summer months as expected and back calculation of the yearly dosage from POCIS accumulations yielded very similar results to that registered in the Norwegian prescription database. Estimations of cocaine usage using the parent compound averaged between 0.31 and 2.8 g d(-1) per 1000 inhabitants. POCIS is a cost-effective technique for the long-term monitoring of drug usage of a defined population and may overcome the difficulties of representative sampling associated with autosampling equipment.

AB To decrease the load of pharmaceuticals to the environment, decentralized wastewater treatment has been proposed for important point-sources such as hospitals. In this study, a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was used for the dehalogenation of the iodinated X-ray contrast medium diatrizoate. The presence of biogenic palladium nanoparticles (bio-Pd) in the cathode significantly enhanced diatrizoate removal by direct electrochemical reduction and by reductive catalysis using the H-2 gas produced at the cathode of the MEC. Complete deiodination of 3.3 mu M (2 mg L-1) diatrizoate from a synthetic medium was achieved after 24 h of recirculation at an applied voltage of -0.4 V. An equimolar amount of the deiodinated metabolite 3,5-diacetamidobenzoate (DAB) was detected. Higher cell voltages increased the dehalogenation rates, resulting in a complete removal after 2 h at -0.8 V. At this cell Voltage, the MEC was also able to remove 85% of diatrizoate from hospital effluent containing 0.5 mu M (292 mu g L-1), after 24 h of recirculation. Complete removal was obtained when the effluent was continuously fed at a volumetric loading rate of 204 mg diatrizoate m(-3) total cathodic compartment (TCC) day(-1) to the MEC with a hydraulic retention time of 8 h. At -0.8 V, the MEC system could also eliminate 54% of diatrizoate from spiked urine during a 24 h recirculation experiment. The final product DAB was demonstrated to be removable by nitrifying biomass, which suggests that the combination of a MEC and bio-Pd in its cathode offers potential to dehalogenate pharmaceuticals, and to significantly lower the environmental burden of hospital waste streams.

AB The concentrations of six sulfonamides (SAs) and three tetracyclines (TCs) were investigated in Jiulongjiang River during the low water season and the high water season. They were monitored in both surface water and sediment. Total concentrations of all these antibiotics varied from 31 to 25 771 ng g(-1) in sediment samples. In water they ranged from 60 to 2607 ng L-1 during the low water season and from ND (not detected) to 134 ng L-1 during the high water season. At the sites nearby breeding farms, chlorotetracycline was found to have the highest concentration of 1036 ng L-1 in water and 14 666 ng g(-1) in sediments. According to the published data, the concentrations of sulfamethazine, sulfameter and TCs at these sites were higher than that in most rivers. The concentrations during the low water season were tens to hundreds of times higher than that in the high water season. The lower concentrations of TCs in the high water season might result from both dilution and photo-degradation, while dilution and bio-degradation might lead to the lower concentrations of SAs. However, further study is needed to clarify the specific reasons. Concerning the relationship between sediment and water samples, the pseudo-partitioning values of TCs were much higher than SAs. It indicates that the TCs are prone to accumulate in the sediment.

AB Ozone application is an effective tool to reduce loads of (micro)pollutants in wastewater, however, its ecotoxicological implications are largely unknown. Therefore, the feeding rates of a leaf-shredding invertebrate (Gammarus fossarum) exposed to secondary (=non-ozone) or ozone treated wastewater were investigated to assess potential ecotoxicological effects. Two repetitive experiments resulted in significantly higher feeding rates for gammarids exposed to ozone compared to non-ozone treated wastewater sampled from a treatment plant equipped with a full-scale ozonation. A further experiment confirmed these results also for wastewater from the same treatment plant, when ozonation was conducted at the lab-scale. However, the deviations in dissolved organic carbon profiles of ozone and non-ozone wastewater did not seem to be the driving factor for the effects observed. Two additional experiments displayed on the one hand a higher feeding rate of G. fossarum if exposed to ten-fold enriched eluates from solid phase extraction cartridges loaded with ozone compared to non-ozone treated wastewater. On the other hand, the mean feeding rate of gammarids exposed to non-ozone treated wastewater, which contained hardly any (micro)pollutants (i.e. pharmaceuticals), was at the same level as wastewater from the same source additionally treated with ozone. These results suggest that not an alteration in the organic matrix but a reduction in the load of micropollutants most likely triggered the effects in the bioassay applied. Hence, the feeding rate of G. fossarum appears to be a well-suited bioassay to indicate alterations in ecotoxicological properties of wastewater due to the application of advanced oxidation processes like ozonation.

AB Urban watersheds are susceptible to numerous pollutant sources and the identification of source-specific indicators can provide a beneficial tool in the identification and control of input loads, often times needed for a water body to achieve designated beneficial uses. Differentiation of wastewater flows from other urban wet weather flows is needed in order to more adequately address such environmental concerns as water body nutrient impairment and potable source water contamination. Anthropogenic compounds previously suggested as potential wastewater indicators include caffeine, carbamazepine, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), gemfibrozil, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, and TCEP. This paper compares the suitability of a variety of anthropogenic compounds to sucralose, an artificial sweetener, as wastewater indicators by examining occurrence data for 85 trace organic compounds in samples of wastewater effluents, source waters with known wastewater point source inputs, and sources without known wastewater point source inputs. The findings statistically demonstrate the superior performance of sucralose as a potential indicator of domestic wastewater input in the U.S. While several compounds were detected in all of the wastewater effluent samples, only sucralose was consistently detected in the source waters with known wastewater discharges, absent in the sources without wastewater influence, and consistently present in septic samples. All of the other compounds were prone to either false negatives or false positives in the environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of sorption to the removal of two commonly used antibiotics (amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin) from wastewater. These antibiotics are excreted in large quantities with more than 75% of them being unmetabolized and are therefore likely to end up in domestic wastewater in significant quantities. The specific objectives were to determine the sorption behavior in synthetic wastewater (SWW), the effect of pH and contribution of microbial surfaces, to the sorption of these antibiotics. The SWW, adjusted to various pH levels, was used and sorption kinetics conducted at 100 and 250 mu g L-1 concentrations. Adsorption isotherms were determined at different pH levels. The SWW (pH 6.6) was inoculated with Rhodococcus sp. B30 strain to determine the contribution of microbial surfaces to sorption. Generally, both antibiotics revealed a decrease in sorption with pH increase, suggesting that lowering the solution pH of the wastewater may reduce their amounts in wastewater solution. Comparatively, ciprofloxacin exhibited higher sorption than amoxicillin. The sorption distribution coefficient (K (d)) values for ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.4356 to 0.8902 L g(-1), with pH = 5.5 exhibiting the highest K (d), while that for amoxicillin ranged from 0.1582 to 0.3858 L g(-1) with the highest K (d) at pH = 3.5. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in K (d) values between various pH levels for both antibiotics except between the pH of 5.5 and 6.6. Both antibiotics were not degraded within 48 h by Rhodococcus sp. B30 strain. These results indicate that degradation may not be the major process of removal of compounds from wastewater treatment plants and hence the importance of sorption as an intervention technique.

AB The Fenton-like degradation of sulfasalazine solution is studied in this work. The effects of reaction parameters such as Fe3+ concentration, initial H2O2 dosage and the reaction temperature are evaluated. For sulfasalazine of 100 mg/L, the removal of sulfasalazine, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 99.5%, 84.2% and 41% in 60 min with 0.20 mM Fe3+ and 16 mM H2O2 at 35 degrees C, respectively. The complexed Fe3+ presents a reaction constant of 0.062 min(-1) mM(-1) while that of free Fe3+ is 2.526 min(-1) mM(-1) for sulfasalazine degradation. LC-MS technology was used to analysis the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation of sulfasalazine principally begins with the attack of hydroxyl radical on the azo-group as well as the sulfanilamido group. Both intramolecular rearrangement and bimolecular reaction occur simultaneously after the hydroxyl radical attack. Further attack of the active oxidative species results in the cleavage of the aromatic rings and the production of CO2. The degradation of industrial sulfasalazine wastewater with a COD of 3425 mg/L has also been achieved by Fenton reaction with different dosage of H2O2. Relatively better removal efficiency is observed at moderate Fe/H2O2 molar ratio from 1/5 to 2/5 for industrial sulfasalazine wastewater treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The adsorption of ampicillin onto natural and organo-bentonite was studied. Organo-bentonite was obtained by modifying the natural bentonite obtained from Ponorogo. Indonesia, using CTAB surfactant by microwave heating. The temperature dependent form of the Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Toth equations was employed to correlate equilibrium data. Based on the evaluation of the physical meaning of fitted isotherm parameters of each model, it is clear that Toth equation can represent the equilibrium data better than other models. The adsorption performance of natural and organo-bentonite for the removal of ampicillin from pharmaceutical company wastewater was also studied. In real wastewater, both adsorbents could not completely remove the ampicillin due to the sorption competition with other substances which also present in the wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI Evaluation of Contaminant Removal of Reverse Osmosis and Advanced
   Oxidation in Full-Scale Operation by Combining Passive Sampling with

AB Advanced water treatment of secondary treated effluent requires stringent quality control to achieve a water quality suitable for augmenting drinking water supplies. The removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, industrial chemicals, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCP) is paramount. As the concentrations of individual contaminants are typically low, frequent analytical screening is both laborious and costly. We propose and validate an approach for continuous monitoring by applying passive sampling with Empore disks in vessels that were designed to slow down the water flow, and thus uptake kinetics, and ensure that the uptake is only marginally dependent on the chemicals' physicochemical properties over a relatively narrow molecular size range. This design not only assured integrative sampling over 27 days for a broad range of chemicals but also permitted the use of a suite of bioanalytical tools as sum parameters, representative of mixtures of chemicals with a common mode of toxic action. Bioassays proved to be more sensitive than chemical analysis to assess the removal of organic micropollutants by reverse osmosis, followed by UV/H(2)O(2) treatment, as many individual compounds fell below the quantification limit of chemical analysis, yet still contributed to the observed mixture toxicity. Nonetheless in several cases, the responses in the bioassays were also below their quantification limits and therefore only three bioassays were evaluated here, representing nonspecific toxicity and two specific end points for estrogenicity and photosynthesis inhibition. Chemical analytical techniques were able to quantify 32 pesticides, 62 PCPPs, and 12 EDCs in reverse osmosis concentrate. However, these chemicals could explain only 1% of the nonspecific toxicity in the Microtox assay in the reverse osmosis concentrate and 0.0025% in the treated water. Likewise only 1% of the estrogenic effect in the E-SCREEN could be explained by the quantified EDCs after reverse osmosis. In comparison, >50% of the estrogenic effect can typically be explained in sewage. Herbicidal activity could be fully explained by chemical analysis as the sampling period coincided with an illegal discharge and two herbicides dominated the mixture effect. The mass balance of the reverse osmosis process matched theoretical expectations for both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. Overall the investigated treatment train removed >97% estrogenicity, >99% herbicidal activity, and >96% baseline toxicity, confirming the suitability of the treatment train for polishing water for indirect potable reuse. The product water was indistinguishable from local tap water in all three bioassays. This study demonstrates the suitability and robustness of passive sampling linked with bioanalytical tools for semicontinuous monitoring of advanced water treatment with respect to micropollutant removal.

AB The occurrence and geochemical behavior of nine pharmaceutical compounds were investigated along the Yangtze River Estuary and its coastal area, by sampling and analysis of pharmaceuticals in sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloidal and soluble phases. In addition, the impact of sewage input was examined by sampling from sewage treatment plants (STP) effluent and its upstream and downstream in the Yangtze River. Although at relatively low concentrations in SPM and sediments, several pharmaceuticals were found at elevated concentration in filtered water samples from SIP-affected sites. SIP is therefore an important input of pharmaceuticals in the study area. Colloidal phase was further separated from bulk water samples using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF), confirming it being an effective sorbent for pharmaceuticals with high sorption capacity which are 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than SPM. Moreover, mass balance calculations showed that significant percentages of selected pharmaceutical compounds were associated with aquatic colloids, indicating colloids as a reservoir for these contaminants in the Yangtze estuarine system.

AB A quantitative approach for calculation of the percentage of water of domestic wastewater origin in contaminated water wells is presented. The article is an extension of a reported approach to quantify leakage from a wastewater recharge facility to nearby water wells pumping predominantly from a pristine aquifer. The relative contamination from a specific source, a wastewater recharge basin, and the contamination from unspecified domestic wastewater sources under near steady state conditions are calculated for several water wells in the vicinity of a wastewater recharge system. Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug whose refractory behaviour was reported before is evaluated as a tracer. It is demonstrated that CBZ fulfils the requirements of source-specific as well as non-specific wastewater tracer, under Israeli conditions. In addition to being biodegradation-resistant, a survey of the effluents of domestic wastewater treatment plants in Israel revealed that the CBZ level is roughly constant, 1407 +/- 204 ng/L in a wide range of water treatment facilities all over Israel. As such, at least for specific sites (e.g. Israel) CBZ can be used as a quantitative tracer for estimation of the fraction of effluent-originated water in water wells, and the uncertainty involved in such estimates can be calculated.

AB Fragrances such as OTNE (marketed as lso-E-Super (R)) and bactericides such as triclosan (marketed as lgrasan) are present in waste water and thus finally sorbed to sewage sludge. With that sludge they can reach agricultural fields where they potentially can undergo photodegradation processes. In this study the photodegradation of OTNE and triclosan on dried loamy sand was measured under artificial sunlight conditions in laboratory experiments. These compounds were artificially added with concentrations of 1 mu g g(-1) on pre-rinsed dried loamy sand. The decrease in concentration with light irradiation was measured for 32 d in comparison to soil samples without light irradiation. The estimated light source intensity was 27 W m(-2). Within the experiment, the apparent half-life was 7 and 17 d for OTNE and triclosan respectively. The decrease did not simply follow first-order kinetics. The apparent rate constant decreased in the latter stage of reaction, suggesting that part of the chemicals were inaccessible for degradation. Two models, i.e., a diffusion-limited model, and a light penetration-limited model, were used in comparison to the measured data to explain the observed degradation limitations in the latter stages of the experiments. Comparing the hereby obtained model parameters with estimated physico-chemical parameters for the soil and the two chemical compounds, the light penetration-limited model, in which the degradation in the soil surface layer is assumed to be limited due to the shading effect of light in the upper thin soil layer, showed to be the most realistic in describing the photodegradation.

AB The detection of drugs in drinking water sources has raised questions related to safety. In the absence of regulatory or other official guidance, water utilities are faced with a problem of which drugs should be monitored and the detection limits that should be required. The US FDA summarizes data required for drug approval and post marketing adverse reaction reporting. The use of these data as a means of arriving at concentrations in water where adverse health effects are minimal or non-existent was explored. The minimum therapeutic dose was assumed an appropriate point of departure. Appropriate uncertainty factors could be applied depending upon the qualitative and quantitative nature of the data that are available. Assumptions inherent in US FDA's approval of drugs for use in subsets of the population relative to the broader concerns that arise for exposures of the entire population had to be considered. Additional questions are; whether the drug under consideration is carcinogenic, carries pregnancy and lactation warnings, approval for limited vs. chronic use, exposures to multiple compounds that could act in additive or synergistic ways, and the seriousness of toxicities that are observed. Aside from these considerations, a combined uncertainty factor of 1000 appeared adequate. (C) 2011 WateReuse Research Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study discusses the occurrence and environmental risk associated with a micropollutant plume originating from the direct discharge of treated wastewater into the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. The temporal variations and spatial extent of the plume and its effect on the presence of 39 pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in the Vidy Bay were assessed over a 10 month period. A pronounced plume was observed from April to October, leading to locally elevated (up to 70-fold) pharmaceutical concentrations compared to the surrounding water column. For three of the measured substances, these plume-associated concentrations were sufficiently high to pose an ecotoxicological risk. The plume depth followed the thermal lake stratification, which moved to lower depths over the course of the warm seasons. Pharmaceutical hotspots associated with the plume were detected as far as 1.5 km downstream of the effluent wastewater outfall, but concentrations typically decreased with increasing distance from the wastewater outfall as a result of dilution and photodegradation. From November to January, when uniform temperature prevailed throughout the water column, no micropollutant plumes were detected. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, most pesticides showed homogeneous concentrations throughout the Vidy Bay during the whole study period, indicating that the effluent wastewater was not their dominant source. A strong linear correlation between electrical conductivity and concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants was identified. This relation will allow future estimates of wastewater-derived micropollutant concentrations via simple conductivity measurements.

AB A new photosynthetic bacterium isolate was morphologically identified as a non-motile rod-shape gram-negative bacterium. It produced a dark red culture under phototrophic condition, reproduced by budding and formed a lamellar intracytoplasmic membrane system parallel to cytoplasmic membrane, which contained bacteriochlorophyll a and caratenoids. It's physiological and nutrient requirement tests gave indication that the isolate thrived and multiplied in varied environmental conditions. It was consequently named Z08 and identified as Rhodobacter sphaeroides by 16SrDNA. Adaptation of Z08 to biodegradation of two environmentally concerned wastewaters, i.e. soybean and pharmaceutical wastewaters, attested its potential in wastewater bioremediation. Z08 adaptation in a suspended batch photobioreactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater at 3500lx radiation recorded best result after wastewater dilution of 1: 4 with concomitant chemical oxygen demand reduction, biomass yield and specific growth of 50 %, 780 mg/L and 0.015/h, respectively at the lowest hydraulic retention time of three days. Furthermore, gas chromatography mass spectra analyses of treated and raw pharmaceutical wastewater indicated that high molecular weight recalcitrant compounds found in the pharmaceutical wastewater were transformed to less toxic and acceptable lower molecular weight substances through biodegradation. Whilst Z08 treatment of soybean wastewater under natural light intensity radiation recorded 80 % reduction, 1540 mg/L and 0.025/h for chemical oxygen demand, biomass and specific growth rate respectively regardless of the food to microorganism ratio. This preliminary investigation showed that isolate Z08 has some toxic tolerance level which could detoxify refractory substances with great potential for cell protein recovery in high organic strength wastewater. Therefore, strain Z08 could be employed in biodegradation of contaminated wastewater streams.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfamethazine (SMT) has received little attention in the water treatment literature. Yet, SMT is among the non-biodegradable substances increasingly found in aqueous media and affecting both public health and wastewater treatments. For a long time, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were studied via pure empirical modeling, although the surface response models resulting from lumped information (TOC, COD, etc.) present limitations regarding extrapolation and optimization. Conversely, detailed first-principles modeling may not be affordable due to the computational burden and the chemical analysis needs. Thus, a balanced approach may be practical in many cases.
   RESULTS: Experiments on SMT solutions (500 mL, 50 mg L(-1)) were performed under conditions set by an experimental design. A set of replicated degradation time-profiles (TOC and SMT concentrations) was obtained and a semi-empirical kinetic model was fitted to these data to determine maximum conversion and kinetic rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: SMT can be completely degraded from water via photo-Fenton treatment. Conditions for this treatment were investigated and its outcomes were systematically characterized by a simple kinetic model and two lumped parameters, conversion and kinetic rate. Both, the model and the corresponding parametrical characterization are introduced as a means to discriminate the most efficient treatment conditions in a practical and efficient way.

AB The discovery of pharmaceuticals in effluent from wastewater treatment plants and drug manufacturing facilities and in receiving waters has raised environmental concern. Because these compounds are ending up in the environment, it is important to investigate the effects of these compounds on wildlife as well as humans. The present study used a fish model to investigate the endocrine-disrupting effects of spironolactone (SPL), an aldosterone antagonist used as a diuretic, but which also exhibits antiandrogenic effects in humans. A dose-response study measured the effects of SPL on anal fin ray elongation, an androgen-dependent secondary sex trait, and expression of the vitellogenin gene, an estrogen-dependent trait, in female western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. Fish were exposed to SPL in the water for 35 d at four nominal concentrations: 10, 100, 250, and 500 nM (4.2, 41.7, 104.1, and 208.3 mu g/L, respectively) via the static renewal method. Masculinization of females, as evidenced by development of an elongated and modified anal fin, was observed in the fish exposed to the three highest concentrations. Anal fin elongation was observed in the group exposed to the lowest SPL concentration, but without the development of a tip apparatus. These results confirm the results of a preliminary study that, in contrast to antiandrogenic effects seen in humans, SPL has androgenic and/or antiestrogenic activity in a fish. Environ.

AB An urgent need exists to assess the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals. The aim of the present study was to assess the uptake and metabolism of waterborne pharmaceuticals in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A further objective was to determine the possibility of monitoring exposure to low levels of pharmaceuticals by bile assays. Rainbow trout were exposed for 10 d under flow-through conditions to mixtures of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, bisoprolol, and carbamazepine) at high and low concentrations. The low concentration was used to mimic the conditions prevailing in the vicinity of the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants. The uptake and the bioconcentration were determined by blood plasma and bile analyses. The average bioconcentration factor in plasma ranged from below 0.1 for bisoprolol to 4.9 for diclofenac, the values being approximately similar at low and high ambient concentrations. The biotransformation of diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen was considered efficient, because several metabolites could be detected in concentrations clearly exceeding those of the unmetabolized compounds. The glucuronicles were the dominant metabolites for all three pharmaceuticals. The total bioconcentration in the bile was two to four orders of magnitude higher than in the plasma. The results of this work show that the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals in environmentally relevant concentrations may be monitored by blood plasma and bile analyses, the latter allowing detection at markedly lower ambient concentration.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) are useful in monitoring for a wide range of chemicals in aquatic systems; however, a lack of available uptake rate data for compounds of environmental interest is one limitation in the application of these samplers to environmental studies. In this study, laboratory calibration experiments were conducted with POCIS for 65 compounds at 25 degrees C under flowing conditions to determine chemical-specific uptake rates (R-s). Experimental uptake rates measured in this study ranged from 0.034 to 1.33 L/d, and uptake rates were determined for 36 compounds with no previously reported values. Experimentally determined uptake rates were applied to data obtained from POCIS samplers deployed downstream of three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharges and in four surface waters influenced by agricultural runoff. Time-weighted average concentrations for atrazine and metolachlor determined using uptake rates generated in this study compare well with results from composited grab sampling previously conducted in agricultural watersheds in Nebraska, USA.

AB The efficiency of UV- and VUV-based processes (UV, VUV, UV/H2O2, and VUV/H2O2) for removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in Milli-Q water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent was investigated at 20A degrees C. The investigated factors included initial pH, variety of inorganic anions (NO (3) (-) and HCO (3) (-) ), and humic acid (HA). The results showed that the degradation of SMX in Milli-Q water at both two pH (5.5 and 7.0) followed the order of VUV/H2O2 > VUV > UV/H2O2 > UV. All the experimental data well fitted the pseudo-first order kinetic model and the rate constant (k) and half-life time (t (1/2)) were determined accordingly. Indirect oxidation of SMX by generated (OH)-O-aEuro cent was the main degradation mechanism in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2, while direct photolysis predominated in UV processes. The quenching tests showed that some other reactive species along with (OH)-O-aEuro cent radicals were responsible to the SMX degradation under VUV process. The addition of 20 mg L-1 HA significantly inhibited SMX degradation, whereas, the inhibitive effects of NO (3) (-) and HCO (3) (-) (0.1 mol L-1) were observed as well in all processes except in UV irradiation for NO (3) (-) . The removal rate decreased 1.7-3.6 times when applying these processes to STP effluent due to the complex constituents, suggesting that from the application point of view the constituents of these complexes in real STP effluent should be considered carefully prior to the use of UV-based processes for SMX degradation.

AB Pharmacologically active substances used in the treatment of human and animal illnesses may usually enter the aquatic environment via effluents from sewage treatment plants, as they are not completely biodegraded or removed during waste water treatment. 17 beta-Estradiol genotoxicity was evaluated in Oreochromis niloticus (family Cichlidae) using micronucleus test, other nuclear abnormalities assessment, and the comet assay with erythrocytes. Fish were exposed to aqueous systems contaminated with 6 ng/L 17 beta-estradiol for three periods: 24 h, 48 h, and 10 days. The results showed that 17 beta-estradiol has genotoxic potential in different periods, since significant differences (P = 0.036) were observed in the micronucleus frequencies of the 10-day exposure groups in relation to the control group. Also, the same was observed when comparing the nuclear abnormality frequencies (P = 0.018) of the 24-h exposure group with the negative control group, and when using comet assay (P < 0.001) for 48-h evaluations. The tested concentration of the 17 beta-estradiol gave rise to mutagenic and genotoxic effects on the blood cells of O. niloticus, therefore the substance being considered a clastogenic chemical contaminant on both acute and chronic exposures. The assessment using a combination of micronucleus test, nuclear abnormalities, and comet assays proved to be suitable and useful in the genotoxicity testing of 17 beta-estradiol at nanograms per liter.

DE Predicted environmental concentration; Multiphase model; Pharmaceuticals
ID TREATMENT PLANTS; WATER
AB A multiphase model based on the Mackay-type level II fugacity model has been used to predict the behaviour and final environmental concentrations of some of the more consumed pharmaceuticals in Spain. The model takes into account the mean rate of consumption of pharmaceuticals, the percentage of pharmaceutical metabolised, the formation of the corresponding glucuronide, which is assumed to be hydrolysed back to the parent molecule, the partial degradation of each pharmaceutical in a conventional sewage treatment plant, and the fate of these substances in a regional model environmental system. Predicted environmental concentrations in air, water, soil, sediments and suspended matter, and the corresponding residence time for each pharmaceutical have been obtained by application of the model. The predicted concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the water phase are of the same order than the measured experimentally, showing that the simple model used to predict the environmental concentrations is suitable for modelling the environmental fate of high water soluble and low volatile organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals products.

Each site has a wastewater irrigated plot and a separate groundwater irrigated plot for comparison purpose. The results showed that the concentrations of the target compounds in the wastewater irrigated soils were in most cases higher than those in the groundwater irrigated soils. Among the 43 target compounds, nine compounds bisphenol-A, triclocarban, triclosan, 4-nonylphenol, salicylic acid, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, trimethoprim and primidone were detected at least once in the soils. Preliminary environmental risk assessment showed that triclocarban might pose high risks to terrestrial organisms while the other detected compounds posed minimal risks. Irrigation with wastewater could lead to presence or accumulation of some emerging contaminants to some extent in irrigated soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The anti-inflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) has been found as a micropollutant in river water downstream the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was exposed to NXP and the uptake and metabolism of the drug was studied.
   Methods Following exposure through intraperitoneal injection (i.p., 0.5 mg NPX/100 g fish biomass) and through water (1.6 mu g L(-1)), the bile was collected and analyzed with various LC-MS/MS methods. The identification of the formed metabolites in i.p. injected fish was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer (Q-TOF-MS) and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by an ion trap mass analyzer (IT-MS).
   Results No matter the exposure route, the main metabolites were found to be acyl glucuronides of NPX and of 6-O-desmethylnaproxen. Also, unmetabolized NPX was detected in the bile. The total bioconcentration factors (BCF(total-bile)) of NPX and the metabolites in the bile of fish exposed through water ranged from 500 to 2,300.
   Conclusion The findings suggest that fish living downstream WWTPs may take up NPX and metabolize the compound. Consequently, NPX and its metabolites in bile can be used to monitor the exposure of fish to NPX.

AB In recent years, concerns about the occurrence and fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients, solvents, intermediates and raw materials that could be present in water and wastewater including pharmaceutical industry wastewater has gained increasing attention. Traditional wastewater treatment methods, such as activated sludge, are not sufficient for the complete removal of active pharmaceutical ingredients and other wastewater constituents from these waters. As a result, complementary treatment methods such as membrane filtration, reverse osmosis and activated carbon are often used in conjunction with the traditional methods for treatment of industrial wastewater. Most of the literature published to date has been on the treatment of municipal wastewater. However, there is a growing body of research that looks at the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in industrial wastewater, the treatment of these wastewaters and the removal rates. This article, reviews these treatment methods and includes both traditional methods and advanced oxidation processes. The paper concludes by showing that the problem of pharmaceuticals in wastewaters cannot be solved merely by adopting end of pipe measures. At source measures, such as replacement of critical chemicals, reduction in raw material consumption should continue to be pursued as the top priority.

AB The removal of various organic micropollutants (OMPs), including six antibiotics (ERY, ROX, CLA, SMX, SMZ, and TMP), three pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, salicylic acid, and diclofenac), one industrial product (BPA), and one hormone (cholesterol), was investigated in two pilot plants treating the same raw sewage of the Tel-Aviv WWTP. The effluent production by CAS-UF was 45 m(3)/h while that of MBR was 40 L/h. Each system's effluent constituted the feed for its RO, which comprised three RO steps after the CAS/UF and a semi-batch RO system after the MBR. Despite significant molecular differences between the selected OMPs, high removal rates were achieved after the RO stage (>99% for macrolides, pharmaceuticals, cholesterol, and BPA, 95% for diclofenac, and >93% removal of sulfonamides). However, low antibiotics concentrations and 28-223 ng/L residuals of ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, cholesterol, and BPA in the MBR/RO and CAS-UF/RO permeates showed that although RO is an efficient removal solution, it cannot serve as an absolute barrier to OMPs. Therefore, additional treatment techniques should be considered to be incorporated aside the RO to ensure complete removal of such substances. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane bioreactor technology is widely recognised as offering a key option for enhanced wastewater treatment or reuse. This brief review of the technology incorporates four key aspects: (a) market growth, (b) research areas, (c) product supply diversity and specifications, and (d) practitioner needs. Market growth and research topics were assessed through an examination of the appropriate literature and databases, specifically Scopus for the latter. Available MBR membrane products were identified from the Internet and other searches and the specifications verified through contact with the suppliers. Appropriate practitioners were identified through networking and verified as either being active in the operation and maintenance of full-scale MBRs or with an extensive experience of them within the industrial community. Results indicate that the footprint of modules normalised against membrane area changes significantly across the currently commercially-available product range, notwithstanding generically similar construction, such that opportunities for interchanging may be limited. The survey of research papers revealed the most comprehensively researched topic to be at odds with its practical constraints as identified by the practitioners. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing new in vitro and in vivo methods to identify and classify endocrine disrupting chemicals that have been identified in environmental samples. In this study an in vitro test based on recombinant yeast strains transfected with genes for the human estrogen receptor alpha was adapted to examine the presence of estrogenic and antiestrogenic substances in six Swedish landfill leachates. Antiestrogenic effects were measured as inhibition of the estradiol induced response with the human estrogen receptor alpha, and quantified by comparison with the corresponding inhibitory effects of a known antiestrogen, hydroxytamoxifen. The estrogenicity was within the range of that determined in domestic sewage effluents, from below the limit of detection to 29 ng estradiol units L(-1). Antiestrogenicity was detected in some of the investigated landfill leachates, ranging between < 38 and 3800 mu g hydroxytamoxifen equivalents L(-1). There was no apparent relation between the type of waste deposited on the landfills and the antiestrogenic effect. Fractionation of a landfill leachate showed that estrogenic compounds were located in two dominant fractions. Three estrogenic compounds were found that accounted for the estrogenic activity in extracts of leachates: bisphenol A, estradiol, and ethinylestradiol. The bisphenol may have been released from decomposing plastic waste and the estrogenic steroids from earlier deposits of municipal sewage sludge and pharmaceutical waste. Fractionation of leachates from three parts of a landfill showed that the antiestrogenic activity was distributed in at least four fractions and somewhat different in different flows of leachate. This indicated a heterogeneous mixture of antiestrogenic substances. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 26:233-239, 2011.

AB The simultaneous removal of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria by ozone-based advanced oxidation technology (AOT) was investigated for the treatment of anaerobic digestion effluent of piggery wastewater. Chlorotetracycline (CTC) and CTC-resistant bacteria were selected as targets since CTC has been the most used antibiotics in livestock industries in Korea. The performance of four different combinations of oxidation agents was investigated, showing the order of removal rate as O-3 < O-3/H2O2 < O-3/UV < O-3/UV/H2O2 for wastewater. Applications of O-3/UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV degraded almost all CTC within 15 and 20 min, respectively. Only 30% of CTC was degraded even in 40 min by O-3 alone and O-3/H2O2 degraded 65% of CTC in 40 min. The combination of ozone/H2O2 did not contribute significantly to CTC degradation, but the influence of UV was substantial when coupled with ozone. CTC was partially degraded during oxidation although main HPLC peak was completely vanished. The resulting intermediates of partially oxidized CTC possessed no more antibiotic capability, suggesting that CTC transformed into nontoxic organic constituents. For disinfection, ozone alone was not effective for disinfection; less than 2-log reduction was achieved in 1 h. UV was more superior in reducing bacterial population, showing more than 4-log reduction in 20 min and 5-log reduction in 40 min. UV was also effective in reducing both total and CTC-resistant bacterial population, and the contribution ratio of UV to ozone was about 3:1 in logarithmic scale. The application of O-3/UV together further enhanced the disinfection performance compared to UV alone. (C) 2011 The Korean Society of industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The mineralization trend of atenolol in the presence of NaCl, Na2SO4 and NaNO3 was followed using total organic carbon analyzer. The disappearance of chloride ions and generation of active chlorine (Cl-2, HOCI, OCl-) were analysed by argentometric and iodometric methods, respectively. The BDD anode was found to be effective in the presence of Na2SO4 whereas Pt yields better removal in the presence of Naa The initial concentration of NaCl and applied current density on the mineralization of atenolol were found to be significant for both BDD and Pt anodes. These results are explained in terms of electrogenerated oxidants such as (OH)-O-center dot, SO4- S2O82-, Cl-2, HOCl and OCl-. The evolution of chlorine at BDD and Pt with respect to NaCl concentration was studied by means of cyclic voltammetric technique. Though the rate of mineralization was observed to be initially higher in the presence of Pt anode, the overall rate of mineralization is more or less similar beyond 15 h of electrooxidation. The slow degradation at the later stages of electrooxidation was attributed to the presence of residual chlorinated organic compounds which are very refractive. The complete mineralization was achieved in the presence of Na2SO4 using BDD as anode.Anodic oxidation of atenolol, known as beta-blocker, has been investigated using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and Pt electrodes.

AB Biodegradation of select endocrine-disrupting compounds (17 beta-estradiol, estrone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, 4-nonylphenol, 4-nonylphenol-monoexthoylate, and 4-nonylphenoldiethoxylate) was evaluated in stream biofilm, sediment, and water matrices collected from locations upstream and downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge. Both biologically mediated transformation to intermediate metabolites and biologically mediated mineralization were evaluated in separate time interval experiments. Initial time intervals (0-7 d) evaluated biodegradation by the microbial community dominant at the time of sampling. Later time intervals (70 and 185 d) evaluated the biodegradation potential as the microbial community adapted to the absence of outside energy sources. The sediment matrix was more effective than the biofflm and water matrices at biodegrading 4-nonyl-phenol and 17 beta-estradiol. Biodegradation by the sediment matrix of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol occurred at later time intervals (70 and 185 d) and was not observed in the biofilm or water matrices. Stream biofilms play an important role in the attenuation of endocrine-disrupting compounds in surface waters due to both biodegradation and sorption processes. Because sorption to stream biofilms and bed sediments occurs on a faster temporal scale (<1 h) than the potential to biodegrade the target compounds (50% mineralization at >185 d), these compounds can accumulate in stream biofilms and sediments.

TI Assessing Wastewater Micropollutant Loads with Approximate Bayesian

ID SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO; MODEL; SYSTEMS; PPCPS
AB Wastewater production, like many other engineered and environmental processes, is inherent stochastic in nature and requires the use of complex stochastic models, for example, to predict realistic patterns of down-the-drain chemicals or pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Up until now, a formal method of statistical inference has been lacking for many of those models, where explicit likelihood functions were intractable. In this Article, we investigate Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to infer important parameters of stochastic environmental models. ABC methods have been recently suggested to perform model-based inference in a Bayesian setting when model likelihoods are analytically or computationally intractable and have not been applied to environmental systems analysis or water quality modeling before. In a case study, we investigate the performance of three different algorithms to infer the number of wastewater pulses contained in three high-resolution data series of benzotriazole and total nitrogen loads in sewers. We find that all algorithms perform well and that the uncertainty in the inferred number of corresponding wastewater pulses varies between 6% and 28%. In our case, the results are more sensitive to substance characteristics than to catchment properties. Although the application of ABC methods requires careful tuning and attention to detail, they have a great general potential to update stochastic model parameters with monitoring data and improve their predictive capabilities.

AB The performance of clofibric acid (CA) degradation in Milli-Qwater and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent by solar/TiO2 and solar/ZnO was investigated in summer and winter seasons. The effects of NO3- and HCO3- anions, humic acid (HA), and H2O2 on CA photocatalysis were evaluated. Significant difference in CA degradation in two seasons was observed. Both NO3- and HCO3- anions adversely affected CA degradation, particularly at high HCO3- concentration. CA degradation slightly increased with 0.5 mg L-1 HA in solar/TiO2 in summer, but was significantly inhibited in winter at 20 mg L-1 HA. However, the inhibitive effect of 20 mg L-1 HA on CA removal in solar/ZnO had no remarkable difference in two seasons. The degradation in solar/TiO2/H2O2 was similar to that in solar/TiO2, but was inhibited obviously in solar/ZnO/H2O2. When applying photocatalytic process into WWTP effluent, degradation rates were apparently lower compared to Milli-Qwater and temperature caused a great adverse effect on CA elimination.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane processes were developed for municipal wastewater reclamation, and their performances, in terms of trace contaminant control and fouling mitigation, were evaluated and designed to meet water quality criteria and minimize flux decline. The dissolved contaminants in wastewater were poorly degraded by MBR but the microbial nitrification in MBR could greatly contribute to nitrogen removal in the MBR permeate through the addition of a NF membrane. Furthermore, most dissolved contaminants were efficiently removed by the NF membrane. However, the NF membrane was ineffective in the removal of boron. The org-N/C molar ratio was inversely correlated to SUVA and directly corresponded to the 3D FEEM, structural analysis, and IR spectra of organic matter in raw and treated water, and desorbed foulants. The observations obtained from rigorous characterization revealed that the hydrophilic fractions, which were comprised of polysaccharides and amino groups, played a major role in fouling formation of the MBR-NF system. In addition, strong amide IR peak in the NF-base supported the notion that amino groups were primarily responsible for the fouling formation of the NF membrane relative to the polysaccharides groups.

AB The study examined the feasibility of using combined TiO2 photocatalysis (UV/TiO2/H2O2) and sequencing batch biological reactor (SBR) process for treatment of an antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin. In the first part of the study, the effect of TiO2 and H2O2 dose on the UV/TiO2/H2O2 process was evaluated. The best TiO2 and H2O2 dose were observed to be 1000 and 250 mg/L, respectively. Under the best TiO2 and H2O2 dose and pH 5, HPLC analysis confirmed complete degradation of both antibiotics in 30 min. In the second part of the study, the effect of UV/TiO2/H2O2 treated wastewater characteristics under different UV/TiO2/H2O2 operating conditions and SBR cycle period on SBR and combined process performance were evaluated. Increasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 24 to 48 hr significantly improved SBR efficiency. Under the best operating conditions (H2O2 dose 250 mg/L, TiO2 dose 1000 mg/L, pH 5, irradiation time 5 hr and HRT 48 hr), the combined UV/H2O2/TiO2-SBR process achieved an overall efficiency of 57% in terms of sCOD removal and final sCOD of the effluent was 236 mg/L Based on the results, the feasibility of using combined UV/H2O2/TiO2-SBR process for treatment of antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin is limited.

AB The impact of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) introduced both individually and in mixtures was ascertained on the performance of laboratory-scale wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). When introduced individually at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M, no significant differences were observed with respect to chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia removal. Microbial community analyses reveal that although similarity index values generally decreased over time with an increase in PhAC concentrations as compared to the controls, no major microbial community shifts were observed for total bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities. However, when some PhACs were introduced in mixtures, they were found to both inhibit nitrification and alter AOB community structure. Ammonia removal decreased by up to 45% in the presence of 0.25 mu M gemfibrozil and 0.75 mu M naproxen. PhAC mixtures did not however affect COD removal performance suggesting that heterotrophic bacteria are more robust to PhACs than AOB. These results highlight that the joint action of PhACs in mixtures may have significantly different effects on nitrification than the individual PhACs. This phenomenon should be further investigated with a wider range of PhACs so that toxicity effects can more accurately be predicted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) is a biological wastewater treatment process used for stabilisation of domestic, animal, food and pharmaceutical sludges, and wastewater. It produces a high-quality effluent due to thermophilic processing conditions, however the stabilised sludge has poor settling characteristics, a high water content, low compaction capacity and is difficult to dewater by mechanical processes alone. These factors impact transport and disposal of processed ATAD sludge. We have carried out a detailed morphological characterisation of ATAD sludge at all stages of the ATAD process in an attempt to determine key characteristics of the sludge that might be responsible for its poor dewatering and settleability. A number of microscopic techniques including electron, optical, wide field and laser scanning confocal microscopy were applied to fresh, fixed or embedded sludge taken at various stages during a full scale ATAD process treating domestic sludge. The spatial distributions of structural sludge matrix components were determined and suggested a highly dynamic sludge morphology during the overall process. Large amounts of fibres were observed in the feed sludge, whereas thermophilic sludge liquor with low settleability was shown to have a lower protein to polysaccharide ratio (1:0.9) compared to the easily settled fraction where ratio values were in the range of (1:1.14-1:1.7) with a prevalence of protein constituents. ATAD sludge was also shown to contain colloids, slime, cellulose micro-particles and multiple hydrophobic droplets in the bulk liquor, factors that may markedly impact on sludge dewaterability characteristics. Laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated a superior ability to identify composition and spatial localisation of structural constituents in such a dispersed, high water content sludge.

AB Pulse electro-coagulation (PE) technology was applied to the treatment of refractory berberine hydrochloride (BH) wastewater. It showed that with Fe electrode the removal efficiencies of pollutants were significantly higher than that with Al electrode. By using Fe electrode and simulated wastewater, the effects of pulse duty cycle, current density, pulse frequency, electrode distance and electrolysis time on the removal efficiencies of BH and COD were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of reaction time of 3.5 h, pulse duty cycle of 0.3, pulse frequency of 1.0 kHz, current density of 19.44 mA/cm(2), and electrode distance of 2.0 cm, the removal efficiencies of BH and COD reached 72.8% and 69.6%, respectively. The raw BH wastewater was then treated with PE process, and 90.1% BH and 62.6% COD could be removed. Finally, the energy costs of PE and traditional electro-coagulation (EC) were compared and it showed that PE saved 90% energy than EC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hazardous chemical contamination of untreated wastewater and secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Zagreb, Croatia was comprehensively characterized using large-volume solid-phase extraction (SPE) and silica gel fractionation, followed by a detailed analysis of the resulting extracts by a combination of chemical and bioassay methods. Over 100 individual contaminants or closely related-contaminant groups were identified by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Ecotoxicity profiling of the investigated samples, including cytotoxicity, chronic toxicity and EROD activity; inhibition of the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR), genotoxicicity and estrogenic potential, revealed the most significant contribution of toxic compounds to be present in polar fractions. Wastewater treatment using conventional activated sludge process reduced the initial toxicity of raw wastewater to various extents, ranging from 28% for algal toxicity to 73.2% for an estrogenic activity. The most efficient toxicity removal was observed for the polar compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Point-source measures have been suggested to decrease pharmaceuticals in water bodies. We analyzed 68 and 50 alternatives, respectively, for a typical Swiss general and psychiatric hospital to decrease pharmaceutical discharge. Technical alternatives included reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated carbon; organizational alternatives included urine separation. To handle this complex decision, we used Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and combined expert predictions (e.g., costs, pharmaceutical mass flows, ecotoxicological risk, pathogen removal) with subjective preference-valuations from 26 stakeholders (authorities, hospital-internal actors, experts). The general hospital contributed ca. 38% to the total pharmaceutical load at the wastewater treatment plant, the psychiatry contributed 5%. For the general hospital, alternatives removing all pharmaceuticals (especially reverse osmosis, or vacuum-toilets and incineration), performed systematically better than the status quo or urine separation, despite higher casts. They now require closer scrutiny. To remove X-ray contrast agents, introducing roadbags is promising. For the psychiatry with a lower pharmaceutical load, costs were more critical. Stakeholder feedback concerning MCDA was very positive, especially because the results were robust across different stakeholder-types. Our MCDA results provide insight into an important water protection issue: implementing measures to decrease pharmaceuticals will likely meet acceptance. Hospital point-sources merit consideration if the trade-off between costs and pharmaceutical removal is reasonable.

AB In developed, non-agricultural, unsewered areas, septic systems and fertilizer application to lawns and gardens represent two major sources of nitrogen to coastal groundwater, in addition to atmospheric input. This study was designed to distinguish between these two possible nitrogen sources by analyzing groundwater samples for pharmaceutical residuals, because fertilizers do not contain any of these pharmaceuticals, but domestic wastewater commonly does. In addition, several herbicides and insecticides used in lawn treatment were analyzed as indicators of nitrogen delivery to groundwater from fertilizers. Groundwater samples were taken through piezometres at shoreline sites in unsewered areas surrounding Northport Harbor and in sewered areas adjacent to Manhasset Bay (hereafter referred to as "Northport" and "Manhasset", respectively), both in northwestern Long Island, USA. Excessive nitrogen loading has led to reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations in Long Island Sound, and the groundwater contribution to the nitrogen budget is poorly constrained. The frequent detection of the anticonvulsant compound carbamazepine in groundwater samples of the Northport Harbor area (unsewered), together with the fact that few pesticides associated with lawn applications were detected, suggests that wastewater input and atmospheric input are the likely sources of nitrogen in the Northport groundwater. High concentrations of nitrogen were also detected in the Manhasset (sewered) groundwater. The low detection frequency and concentration of carbamazepine, however, suggest that the sewer system effectively intercepts nitrogen from wastewater there. The likely sources of nitrogen in the Manhasset groundwater are atmospheric deposition and lawn fertilizers, as this area is densely populated.

AB Sucralose, a chlorinated carbohydrate, is used as an artificial sweetener in more than 80 countries and in excess of 4,000 products. Thus far, minimal research has been done on the degradation and fate of sucralose in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We collected samples from WWTPs and surface waters in Arizona, United States. The average sucralose concentration of seven WWTP effluents was 2,800 +/- 1,000 ng/L. Similarly, surface waters in Arizona contained sucralose at concentrations up to 300 +/- 30 ng/L, which corroborates sucralose discharge from WWTPs into the environment. Biological degradation and chemical oxidation processes were evaluated to remove or transform sucralose under potential WWTP operation scenarios. Sucralose did not degrade in aerobic or anaerobic biological reactors, either metabolically or co-metabolically (in the presence of sucrose), after 42-62 days of experiments. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation did not oxidize sucralose significantly, and chlorine and ozone addition led only to slow sucralose oxidation. Sucralose is not expected to degrade by free chlorine or ozone under typical WWTP operational conditions. Our results suggest that no significant sucralose degradation occurs in WWTPs, that it is present in their effluent waters, and that it reaches environmental water sources. We report for the first time the presence of sucralose in U. S. inland surface waters. Our measurements of sucralose concentrations in WWTP effluents and surface waters also confirm the low degradability of sucralose.

   COMPOUNDS; SORPTION-DESORPTION; ADSORPTION; CARBON; ATRAZINE; FRACTIONS;

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are co-introduced into soils by irrigation with reclaimed wastewater. We targeted carbamazepine (CBZ) as a model compound to study the tertiary interactions between relatively polar PCs, DOM, and soil. Sorption-desorption behavior of CBZ was studied with bulk clay soil and the corresponding clay size fraction in the following systems: (i) without DOM, (ii) co-introduced with DOM, and (iii) pre-adsorption of DOM before CBZ introduction. Sorption of the DOM to both sorbents was irreversible and exhibited pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis. Carbamazepine exhibited higher sorption affinity and nonlinearity, and a higher degree of desorption hysteresis with the bulk soil than the corresponding clay size fraction. This was probably due to specific interactions with polar soil organic matter fractions that are more common in the bulk soil. Co-introduction of CBZ and DOM to the soil did not significantly affect the sorption behavior of CBZ; however, following pre-adsorption of DOM by the bulk soil, an increase in sorption affinity and decrease in sorption linearity were observed. In this latter treatment, desorption hysteresis of CBZ was significantly increased for both sorbents. We hypothesize that this was due to either strong chemical interactions of CBZ with the adsorbed DOM or physical encapsulation of CBZ in DOM-clay complexes. Based on this study, we suggest that DOM facilitates stronger interactions of polar PCs with the solid surface. This mechanism can reduce PC desorption ability in soils.

AB Although sewage effluent application to land is a common approach to recycle water and provide nutrients to plants, bioactive pharmaceuticals contained in sewage may change soil quality by affecting soil microbial communities. Establishing causal effects, however, is difficult, because trace levels of pharmaceuticals are confounded with other effluent constituents. Therefore, two originally similar soil microbial communities, one irrigated in situ with sewage effluent for 12 years and another nonirrigated, were exposed to high levels of acetaminophen, aspirin, carbamazepine, chlorpromazine, and tetracycline. The objectives of the current study were to determine the influence of high levels of pharmaceuticals on several soil microbial properties, the effect that prolonged effluent irrigation with ambient levels of pharmaceuticals had on soil microbial function, and how this effect would change in response to pharmaceutical exposure. Several pharmaceuticals, at high exposure levels, imposed stress on the soil microbial community as judged by increased CO(2) respiration, decreased biomass carbon, and altered substrate utilization affinities. Prolonged effluent irrigation, which altered the genetic fingerprint of the microbial community, also mitigated the response that exposure to pharmaceuticals had on the microbial community and enabled degradation of the antimicrobial salicylic acid after aspirin exposure. In conclusion, prolonged irrigation with sewage effluent containing pharmaceuticals at ambient levels influenced the microbial community so that they were able to better cope with sudden exposure to high levels of pharmaceuticals.

AB For safe biosolid-land-applying, sludge should be contaminant-free. However, it may contain important amounts of micropollutants, not removed in the wastewater-treatment-processes. An alternative treatment with the fungus Trametes versicolor was applied in sterile solid-phase systems consisting of sludge and a lignocellulosic substrate. Fungal colonization and activity were demonstrated during the process, according to monitoring of ergosterol, laccase activity and the naproxen-degradation test (ND24). Fourteen out of 43 analyzed pharmaceuticals were found in the raw sludge. After treatment, phenazone, bezafibrate, fenofibrate, cimetidine, clarithromycin, sulfamethazine and atenolol were completely removed, while removals between 42% and 80% were obtained for the remaining pharmaceuticals. Toxicological analyses (Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and seed germination) showed an important reduction in sludge toxicity after treatment. Results suggest that a solid-phase treatment with T. versicolor may reduce the ecotoxicological impact of micropollutants present in sewage sludge. This is the first report of a fungal-approach for elimination of emerging pollutants from biosolids. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mass flows and removal of 20 antibiotics of seven classes in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Hong Kong were investigated in different seasons of a whole year, using bihourly 24 h flow proportional composite samples. Antibiotics were detected at concentrations of 3.2-1718, 1.3-1176 and 1.1-233 ng L(-1) in influents, secondary and disinfection effluents. Total daily discharges of all the detected antibiotics from effluents of Shatin and Stanley WWTPs were 470-710 and 3.0-5.2 g d(-1), respectively. Ampicillin, cefalexin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, chlortetracycline and vancomycin were effectively (52-100%) eliminated by activated sludge process while ampicillin and cefalexin were effectively (91-99%) eliminated by disinfection. Bihourly variation analysis showed that concentrations of the major antibiotics in influents varied more significantly in Stanley WWTP which served small communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Tula Valley receives untreated wastewater from Mexico City for agricultural irrigation, half of which infiltrates to aquifers from where drinking water is extracted. Samples of wastewater and infiltrated water from three areas of the valley were analyzed for microorganisms, organic micropollutants, and some basic parameters. Concentrations of microorganisms in the infiltrated water were generally very low but the incidence of fecal coliforms (present in 68% of samples), somatic bacteriophages (36%). Giardia spp. (14%), and helminth eggs (8%) suggested a health risk. Organic micropollutants, often present at high concentrations in the wastewater, were generally absent from the infiltrated water except carbamazepine which was in 55% of samples (up to 193 ng/L). There was no correlation between carbamazepine concentrations and the presence of microorganisms but highest concentrations of carbamazepine and boron coincided. A treatment such as nanofiltration would be necessary for the infiltrated water to be a safe potable supply. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Disinfection with chloramines is often used to reduce the production of regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). However, chloramination can lead to the formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Previous research used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor of NDMA, but certain widely used tertiary dimethylamines (e.g. the pharmaceutical ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than DMA. This study investigates the NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines including pharmaceuticals and herbicides. The reactivity of these molecules with monochloramine (NH2Cl) is studied through the formation of NDMA, and other halogenated DBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and AOX (Adsorbable Organic Halides). Several compounds investigated formed NDMA in greater amounts than DMA, revealing the importance of structural characteristics of tertiary amines for NDMA formation. Among these compounds, the pharmaceutical ranitidine showed the highest molar conversion to NDMA. The pH and dissolved oxygen content of the solution were found to play a major role for the formation of NDMA from ranitidine. NDMA was formed in higher amounts at pH around pH 8 and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreased NDMA yields. These findings seem to indicate that dichloramine (NHCl2) is not the major oxidant involved in the formation of NDMA from ranitidine, results in contradiction with the reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature. Dissolved oxygen was also found to influence the formation of other oxygen-containing DBPs (i.e. trichloronitromethane and haloketones). The results of this study identify several anthropogenic precursors of NDMA, indicating that chloramination of waters impacted by these tertiary amines could lead to the formation of significant amounts of NDMA and other non-regulated DBPs of potential health concern (e.g. dichloroacetonitrile or trichloronitromethane). This could be of particular importance for the chloramination of wastewater effluents, especially during water reuse processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the adsorption, desorption, and biodegradation characteristics of sulfonamide antibiotics in the presence of activated sludge with and without being subjected to NaN3 biocide. Batch experiments were conducted and the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to the observed removal of sulfonamide antibiotics were determined. Three sulfonamide antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadime-thoxine (SDM), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), which had been detected in the influent and the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Taiwan, were selected for this study. Experimental results showed that the antibiotic compounds were removed via sorption and biodegradation by the activated sludge, though biodegradation was inhibited in the first 12 h possibly due to competitive inhibition of xenobiotic oxidation by readily biodegradable substances. The affinity of sulfonamides to sterilized sludge was in the order of SDM > SMM > SMX. The sulfonamides existed predominantly as anions at the study pH of 6.8, which resulted in a low level of adsorption to the activated sludge. The adsorption/desorption isotherms were of a linear form, as well described by the Freundlich isotherm with the n value approximating unity. The linear distribution coefficients (K-d) were determined from batch equilibrium experiments with values of 28.6 +/- 1.9, 55.7 +/- 2.2, and 110.0 +/- 4.6 mL/g for SMX, SMM, and SDM, respectively. SMX, SMM, and SDM desorb reversibly from the activated sludge leaving behind on the solids 0.9%, 1.6%, and 5.2% of the original sorption dose of 100 mu g/L. The sorbed antibiotics can be introduced into the environment if no further treatments were employed to remove them from the biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work examined the sorption potential to wastewater primary- and activated-sludge solids for 34 emerging trace organic chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations. These compounds represent a diverse range of physical and chemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and charge state, and a diverse range of classes, including steroidal hormones, pharmaceutically-active compounds, personal care products, and household chemicals. Solid-water partitioning coefficients (K-d) were measured where 19 chemicals did not have previously reported values. Sludge solids were inactivated by a nonchemical lyophilization and dry-heat technique, which provided similar sorption behavior for recalcitrant compounds as compared to fresh activated-sludge. Sorption behavior was similar between primary- and activated-sludge solids from the same plant and between activated-sludge solids from two nitrified processes from different wastewater treatment systems. Positively-charged pharmaceutically-active compounds, amitriptyline, clozapine, verapamil, risperidone, and hydroxyzine, had the highest sorption potential, log K-d = 2.8-3.8 as compared to the neutral and negatively-charged chemicals. Sorption potentials correlated with a compound's hydrophobicity, however the higher sorption potentials observed for positively-charged compounds for a given log D-ow indicate additional sorption mechanisms, such as electrostatic interactions, are important for these compounds. Previously published soil-based one-parameter models for predicting sorption from hydrophobicity (log K-ow > 2) can be used to predict sorption for emerging nonionic compounds to wastewater sludge solids.

AB The presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater effluent is a major concern to the scientific community. This research effort was aimed at investigating Fenton-like degradation of two EDCs 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The results of the study showed that E2 and EE2 were effectively removed by the Fenton-like oxidation process. Removal efficiencies of 95% and 98% at ferric concentration of 1 x 10(-3) M (58.6 mg l(-1)) were achieved for E2 and EE2, respectively. The kinetics of Fenton-like degradation of E2 and EE2 were adequately described by the pseudo second order kinetic model. Values of 27.8 and 22.5 kJ mol(-1) were obtained for the activation energy for E2 and EE2, respectively, from the Arrhenius-type plot, showing that the process does not just involve radical reactions but also intermediate reaction steps involving radical-molecule or ion-molecule reactions. The presence of high dissolved organics in wastewater significantly reduced the removal efficiencies. The reaction by-products for E2 and EE2 were more stable to the oxidation process and more readily biodegradable. Fenton-like oxidations therefore offers a promising alternative for the removal of these EDCs in wastewater treatment applications at the tertiary treatment stage.

AB This paper describes the presence of 33 pharmaceuticals and hormones in waters from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) situated in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain. The target compounds were one psychoactive stimulant, one antiepileptic, four analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, one lipid regulators, two anti-ulcer agents, nine antibiotics (sulfonamides and macrolides), two beta-blockers, two metabolites, and 11 hormones (free and conjugates). The determination was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry after enrichment by solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB sorbent. Most of the pharmaceuticals were found in both influent and effluent samples from the two STPs. The most frequently detected were caffeine, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, ranitidine, omeprazole, estrone 3-sulfate, and estradiol 17-glucuronide. Specifically, the highest concentrations found in influents were 19,850 ng/L (acetaminophen), 9,945 ng/L (caffeine), 4,215 ng/L (ibuprofen), 5,695 ng/L (sulfamethoxazole), and 5,140 ng/L (sulfathiazole). Most of the pharmaceuticals present in influent waters were found in effluents at lower concentrations. The highest concentrations in effluents were 970 ng/L (caffeine), 670 ng/L (sulfamethoxazole), 510 ng/L (bezafibrate), and 1,032 ng/L (diclofenac).

AB The biocide triclosan (TCS, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is commonly used in several personal care products, textiles, and children's toys. Because the removal of TCS by wastewater treatment plants is incomplete, its environmental fate is to be discharged into freshwater ecosystems, where its ecological impact is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of TCS on the antioxidant enzymatic chain of the freshwater mollusk zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). We measured the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in zebra mussel specimens exposed to 1 nM, 2 nM, and 3 nM TCS in vivo. The mussels were exposed for 96 h, and the enzyme activities were measured every 24 h. We measured clear activation of GST alone at all three dose levels, which shows a poor induction of the antioxidant enzymatic chain by TCS. CAT and SOD were activated only at 3 nM, while GPx values overlapped the baseline levels.

AB The present manuscript describes for the first time the transformation and mineralization of cocaine (COC) in water (distilled water (DW) and synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SWeff)) by natural solar irradiation and two solar photocatalytic processes: heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton. The solar photocatalytic processes were run at equivalent pilot-plant scale by means of compound parabolic collectors, which allowed for comparison of solar transformation kinetics and compound mineralization. Direct photolysis resulted in almost complete and partial disappearance of COC in SWeff and DW, respectively, after 33 h of normalized irradiation time, and negligible mineralization. Solar transformation of COC by heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO(2) was completed after 28 and 50 min of illumination in DW and SWeff, respectively, whereas about half of the irradiation time was needed with photo-Fenton, which was also proved to be more effective in compound mineralization. Kinetics parameters were calculated for process comparison. Additionally, the phototransformation intermediates generated during each treatment were investigated and characterized by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqTOF-MS/MS). Identity confirmation was possible for some of them with the analysis of commercially available analytical standards. The main COC phototransformation pathways were observed to be ester bond cleavage, hydroxylation, and demethylation. Finally, the application of an acute toxicity test (Vibrio fischeri) to selected water samples resulted in inhibition percentages of bacterial bioluminescence in most cases below 20% after 30 min of sample contact, which indicates low acute toxicity of the photointermediates generated during the different treatments.

AB Wastewater impoundments at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) represent a potential source of veterinary pharmaceuticals and steroid hormone contamination to shallow groundwater. This study investigates the occurrence of seventeen veterinary pharmaceuticals and thirteen steroid hormones and hormone metabolites in lagoons and adjacent groundwater at operating swine and beef cattle facilities. These sites were chosen because subsurface geology and previous monitoring of nitrate, ammonia and chloride levels in shallow ground water strongly indicated direct infiltration, and as such represent worst cases for ground water contamination by waste water. Pharmaceutical compounds detected in samples obtained from cattle facilities include sulfamerazine; sulfamethazine; erythromycin; monensin; tiamulin; and sulfathiazole. Lincomycin; ractopamine; sulfamethazine; sulfathiazole; erythromycin; tiamulin and sulfadimethoxine were detected in wastewater samples obtained from swine facilities. Steroid hormones were detected less frequently than veterinary pharmaceuticals in this study. Estrone, testosterone, 4-androstenedione, and androsterone were detected in wastewater impoundments at concentrations ranging from 30 to 3600 ng/L, while only estrone and testosterone were detected in groundwater samples at concentrations up to 390 ng/L The co-occurrence of veterinary pharmaceutical and steroid hormone contamination in groundwater at these locations and the correlation between pharmaceutical occurrence in lagoon wastewater and hydraulically downgradient groundwater indicates that groundwater underlying some livestock wastewater impoundments is susceptible to contamination by veterinary pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones originating in wastewater lagoons.

AB Catalytic ozonation of three selected pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac, DCF, sulfamethoxazole, SMX, and 17 alpha-ethynylstradiol. ETOL) in the presence of a commercial gamma-Al2O3 and a synthesized Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst has been studied. Experiments were carried out with the pharmaceuticals spiked in both, ultrapure water (Milli Q Millipore) and an actual secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). Regardless of the water matrix and the presence or absence of any catalyst, the removal of the three pharmaceutical compounds developed through fast direct reactions with ozone (i.e., the compounds were totally removed in less than 10 min). In terms of COD and TOC removals, catalytic ozonation, especially in the presence of the Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst, clearly enhanced the results obtained when the single ozonation process was applied. The stability and reusability of the Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst was demonstrated by carrying repetitive experiments reusing a catalyst sample. Finally, a kinetic model that accounts for two reaction stages has been proposed and apparent rate constants have been computed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An unique up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater at various organic loading rate (OLR) was investigated and showed efficient substrate removal at low OLRs (0.43-1.86 kg COD m(-3)d(-1)) by promoting efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (70-75%). However, increasing the OLRs to 3.73 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) (4-2 d) reduced :he COD removal efficiency (45%). Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis showed that the microbial community of the reactor stages was dominated by methanogenic archaea (56-79% of 4',6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells in all stages) when the reactor was fed at OLR 0.86-2.98 kg COD m(-3)d(-1) but decreased in Stage 1 (30% of DAPI-stained cells) when the OLR was at 3.73 kg COD m(-3)d(-1). The two methanogenic genera detected were Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. Generally, Methanosaeta dominated the reactor stages when the OLR was 0.86-1.86 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), while Methanosarcina dominated during the period of high OLR (2.98-3.73 kg COD m(-3)d(-1)). Based on the number of Desulfovibrio cells detected (8-36% of the total eubacteria) in all stages during the entire operation of the reactor, it appears that sulfidogenic bacteria contributed to the overall degradation of organic substances in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The occurrence of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two wastewater treatment plants in Beijing was studied monthly over the course of one year. The removal of PPCPs by three biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS), biological nutrient removal (BNR), and membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared during different seasons. Seasonal variations of PPCPs in the wastewater influent were discrepant, while in the wastewater effluent, most PPCPs had lower concentrations in the summer than in the winter. For the easily biodegradable PPCPs, the performance of MBR was demonstrated to be more stable than CAS or BNR especially during winter months. Diclofenac, trimethoprim, metoprolol, and gemfibrozil could be moderately removed by MBR, while their removal by CAS and BNR was much lower or even negligible. Nevertheless, no removal was achieved regardless of the season or the treatment processes for the recalcitrant PPCPs. Studies on the contribution of each tank of the MBR process to the total removal of four biodegradable PPCPs indicated the oxic tank was the most important unit, whereas membrane filtration made a negligible contribution to their elimination.

AB Tertiary treatment methods, like ozonation, are currently under discussion to improve removal efficiencies of micropollutants by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In order to assess the effects of a full-scale wastewater ozonation at WWTP Wueri, Switzerland, on the receiving stream, a total of seven in situ bioassays with Gammarus fossarum that lasted 7-days were conducted during an overall period of 33 months. Caged gammarids were exposed between 150 m up- and 400 m downstream of a WWTP effluent before, during and following the operation of the full-scale wastewater ozonation. During the release of nonozone treated wastewater, gammarid feeding was significantly reduced by up to 90 parts per thousand 50 and 150 m downstream of the WWTP effluent. In contrast, during the operation period of the ozonation, no significant alterations in feeding were observed downstream. The results of these bioassays were incorporated into a mathematical simulation of the release of nonozone treated wastewater in a Central European region, suggesting a 40 parts per thousand reduction in leaf litter breakdown and hence in energy provision for the remaining aquatic food web downstream of WWTP effluents, while the release of ozone treated wastewater did not affect this important ecosystem function.

AB Many rivers and streams worldwide are impacted by pharmaceuticals originating from sewage. The hyporheic zone underlying streams is often regarded as reactive bioreactor with the potential for eliminating such sewage-born micropollutants. The present study aims at checking the elimination potential and analyzing the coupling of hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and micropollutant processing. To this end, two sites at the lowland stream Erpe, which receives a high sewage burden, were equipped and sampled with nested piezometers. From temperature depth profiles we determined that at one of the sites infiltration of surface water into the aquifer occurs while exfiltration dominates at the other site. Biogeochemical data reveal intense mineralization processes and strictly anoxic conditions in the streambed sediments at both sites. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were high in the surface water and also in the subsurface at the infiltrating site. The evaluation of the depth profiles indicates some attenuation but due to varying surface water composition the evaluation of subsurface processes is quite complex. Borate and non-geogenic gadolinium were measured as conservative wastewater indicators. To eliminate the influence of fluctuating sewage proportions in the surface water, micropollutant concentrations are related to these indicators. The indicators can cope with different dilutions of the sewage but not with temporally varying sewage composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article reports on degradation using TiO2 immobilized on glass spheres of 15 emerging contaminants (ECs) at low concentrations in simulated and real Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluents. A sal containing titanium isopropoxide, commercial P25 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was prepared, and a layer of the photoactive precursor was immobilized on glass spheres by dip-coating. The raw materials and the xerogels were characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption, XRD and TGA-DTA. The xerogel showed the TiO2 anatase, rutile and brookite crystal phases characteristic of the reference materials. The diffraction pattern showed no modification of the crystal size from incorporation of the PEG. Two different TiO2 anatase crystal sizes were identified, which was attributed to the different TiO2 precursors used in the synthesis route. Degradation of the emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan), at an initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 each was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-UV) and mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar of Almeria (Spain). 85% of the compounds were degraded within 120 min of illumination time depending on the water. The results show the potential application of this technology as a good alternative to suspension systems for the treatment of polluted water. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines the oxidative disposal of Prozac (R) (also known as Fluoxetine, FXT) through several oxidative processes with and without UV irradiation: for example, TiO2 alone, O-3 alone, and the hybrid methods comprised of O-3 + H2O2 (PEROXONE process), TiO2+ O-3 and TiO2+ O-3 + H2O2 at the laboratory scale. Results show a strong pH dependence of the adsorption of FXT on TiO2 and the crucial role of adsorption in the whole degradation process. Photolysis of FXT is remarkable only under alkaline pH. The heterogeneous photoassisted process removes 0.11 mM FXT (initial concentration) within ca. 60 min with a concomitant 50% mineralization at pH 11 (TiO2 loading, 0.050 g L-1). The presence of H2O2 enhances the mineralization further to >70%. UV/ozonation leads to the elimination of FXT to a greater extent than does UV/TiO2: i.e., 100% elimination of FXT is achieved by UV/O-3 in the first 10 min of reaction and almost 97% mineralization is attained under UV irradiation in the presence of H2O2. The hybrid configuration UV + TiO2 + O-3 + H2O2 enhances removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in ca. 30 mm leaving, however, an important inorganic carbon (IC) content. In all cases, the presence of H2O2 improves the elimination of DOC, but not without a detrimental effect on the biodegradability of FXT owing to the low organic carbon content in the final treated effluent, together with significant levels of inorganic byproducts remaining. The photoassisted TiO2/O-3 hybrid method may prove to be an efficient combination to enhance wastewater treatment of recalcitrant drug pollutants in aquatic environments.

AB Seven mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs), differing in their design characteristics, were set up in the open air to assess their efficiency to remove antibiotics from urban raw wastewater. A conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was simultaneously monitored. The experiment took place in autumn. An analytical methodology including HPLC-MS/MS was developed to measure antibiotic concentrations in the soluble water fraction, in the suspended solids fraction and in the WWTP sludge. Considering the soluble water fraction, the only easily eliminated antibiotics in the WWTP were doxycycline (61 +/- 38%) and sulfamethoxazole (60 +/- 26%). All the studied types of CWs were efficient for the removal of sulfamethoxazole (59 +/- 30-87 +/- 41%), as found in the WWTP, and, in addition, they removed trimethoprim (65 +/- 21-96 +/- 29%). The elimination of other antibiotics in CWs was limited by the specific system-configuration: amoxicillin (45 +/- 15%) was only eliminated by a free-water (FW) subsurface flow (SSF) CW planted with Typha angustifolia; doxycycline was removed in FW systems planted with T. angustifolia (65 +/- 34-75 +/- 40%), in a Phragmites australis-floating macrophytes system (62 +/- 31%) and in conventional horizontal SSF-systems (71 +/- 39%); clarithromycin was partially eliminated by an unplanted FW-SSF system (50 +/- 18%); erythromycin could only be removed by a P. australis-horizontal SSF system (64 +/- 30%); and ampicillin was eliminated by a T. angustifolia-floating macrophytes system (29 +/- 4%). Lincomycin was not removed by any of the systems (WWTP or CWs). The presence or absence of plants, the vegetal species (T. angustifolia or P. australis), the flow type and the CW design characteristics regulated the specific removal mechanisms. Therefore, CWs are not an overall solution to remove antibiotics from urban wastewater during cold seasons. However, more studies are needed to assess their ability in warmer periods and to determine the behaviour of full-scale systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A predicted environment concentration (PEC) for surface water was estimated at 0.023 mu g L(-1), (action limit of 0.01 mu g L(-1)) triggering a comprehensive battery of laboratory evaluations. Pioglitazone and its major metabolites were determined not to significantly adsorb to sewage solids, were not persistent in the aquatic environment, did not bioaccumulate and were non-toxic to aquatic organisms. Pioglitazone does not pose an unacceptable risk to groundwater supplies, with concentrations not anticipated to be a risk to aquatic organisms or human drinking water supplies.

AB This study examined the tissues distribution of selected serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in brook trout exposed for 3 months to continuous flow-through primary-treated effluent before and after ozone treatment. A reliable analytical method was developed for the quantification of trace amounts of antidepressants in small tissue homogenate extracts. Levels of six antidepressants and four of their N-desmethyl metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant amounts of the SSRIs were found in fish tissue-in decreasing order: liver > brain > muscle. Sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline were the predominant substances observed in most tissues (0.04-10.3 ng g(-1)). However, less SSRIs (0.08-1.17 ng g(-1)) were bioaccumulated in the ozonated effluent. The early molecular effects of these SSRIs on the Na/K-dependent ATPase pump activity in brain synaptosomes where also investigated in vitro and in fish exposed to the municipal effluents. With respect to their potential biological effects, in vitro exposure to selected SSRIs induced a reduction of the brain Na/K-ATPase activity in synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner. Results showed that Na/K-ATPase activity was readily inhibited by exposure to municipal effluent before and, to a lesser extent, after ozone treatment. Moreover, the Na/K-ATPase activity was significantly and negatively correlated with brain tissue concentrations of fluoxetine (r = -0.57; p < 0.03), desmethylsertraline (r = -0.84; p < 0.001), and sertraline (r = -0.82; p < 0.001). The present study reveals that SSRIs are readily available in fish, biologically active and corroborates previous findings on the serotonergic properties of municipal effluents to aquatic organisms.

AB Multiple regression models, clustering tree diagrams, regression trees (CHAID) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied to the study of the removal of organic matter and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater by means of constructed wetlands (CWs). These four statistical analyses pointed out the importance of physico-chemical parameters, plant presence and chemical structure in the elimination of most pollutants. Temperature, pH values, dissolved oxygen concentration, redox potential and conductivity were related to the removal of the studied substances. Plant presence (Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis) enhanced the removal of organic matter and some PPCPs. Multiple regression equations and CHAID trees provided numerical estimations of pollutant removal efficiencies in CWs.

AB A liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of antibiotics in water was developed and applied to Brazilian surface waters. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefalexin (CEF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline (TET), and trimethoprim were selected as target compounds due to their high consumption pattern in Brazil. LC and MS conditions were optimized to produce the maximum analytic response for each compound. Anion exchange and polymeric solid-phase extraction cartridges, in series, were employed during the extraction procedures. Recovery, linear range, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification were calculated. LOD varied from 0.13 ng L-1 for CIP and NOR to 0.76 ng L-1 for TET. Surface water samples from the Atibaia watershed (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) were analyzed. Results showed that seasonal and anthropogenic aspects dictated the levels of antibiotics in the samples. An overall frequency of detection of 55% was observed during the rainy period, whereas a higher percentage (88%) was noticed for samples collected during the dry season. In the Atibaia River, sample concentrations ranged from 29 ng L-1 for CEF to 0.5 ng L-1 for NOR. In a sewage-affected stream, however, concentrations up to 2422 ng L-1 CEF were found.

AB Nowadays the removal of organic micropollutants is one of the major challenges of water and wastewater treatment plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of persulfate addition on micropollutants degradation by ionizing radiation. In this system, the radicals SO4 center dot-/OH center dot can be present simultaneously due to persulfate reaction with solvated electrons. Ibuprofen (IB), progesterone (Pg) and benzotriazole (BT) have been selected for this study. The degradation of micropollutants was followed at various radiation doses and under the influence of persulfate (S2O82-) addition at a fixed dose (30 Gy), in deionized and tap water. In deionized water the addition of 500 mu M persulfate improved the degradation of BT, IB and Pg by 17%, 36% and 24% respectively and the removal of micropollutants was increased when the concentration of persulfate ions increased. No influence of the presence of persulfate ions was observed in tap water. Contrary to tap water experiments, the persulfate (500 mu M) increases the elimination of BT slightly in the presence of bicarbonate ions. In the case of IB and Pg the influence of persulfate addition is significant even in the presence of bicarbonate ions which indicate that the bicarbonate ions do not completely inhibit the influence of persulfate addition in tap water. Even if the bicarbonate ions have an inhibitory effect on the irradiation system, it was suggested that the inhibition could be explained by the presence of nitrate ions, which would prevent the formation of sulfate radicals.

AB Presence of pharmaceuticals at trace levels in recycled water is an emerging issue impacting the beneficial reuse of treated wastewater, including practices such as irrigation and groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid regions. To assess the environmental risks of irrigation with recycled water containing such micropollutants, in this study we evaluated sorption and degradation of five pharmaceuticals that are antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in two soils collected from arid regions. Naproxen and trimethoprim showed moderate to strong sorption, while the sorption of diclofenac, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole was negligible in both soils. Under aerobic conditions, the studied compounds were susceptible to microbial degradation with half-lives varying from 4.8 to 69.3 d. Apart from sulfamethoxazole, the other compounds were relatively persistent under anaerobic conditions as indicated by a negligible loss over 84 d of incubation or half-lives > 50 d. The degradation of the selected pharmaceuticals was influenced by microbial activities, oxygen status in the soil, soil type and compound characteristics. The poor sorption and relative persistence of diclofenac and ibuprofen under anaerobic conditions suggest that the two chemicals may pose a high leaching risk when using recycled for irrigation or groundwater replenishment.

AB The aim of this work was to study the mineralization of acetaminophen (ACTP) present in synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SE.) in a UV-A/C pilot plant using a homogeneous photo-Fenton oxidation process with continuous addition of H(2)O(2) to the system.
   The mineralization process was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Experimental kinetic constants were fitted using neural networks (NNs). The mathematical model reproduced the experimental data to within a 90% confidence level. At the optimum conditions (H(2)O(2) flow rate = 50 mL/h, [Fe(II)]= 2 ppm, pH = 2.5 and temperature = 40 degrees C), 71.5%, 82.1% and 94% of COT, COD and BDO-5 were removed in 120 min respectively.
   Determination of the hydrogen peroxide consumed and remaining in the water revealed that 5.8 mol of H(2)O(2) were consumed per each mol of total organic carbon removed from solution. It was also confirmed that an excess of dissolved H(2)O(2) is needed to achieve high mineralization rates, so continuous addition of peroxide is recommended for industrial application of this process.
   Comparison experiments of scavenger-loaded conditions proved that the reaction takes place mainly through a radical and single oxygen mechanism (96.7%). The molecular pathway (0.7%) and direct photolysis (2.6%) are secondary. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intensive land development as a result of the rapidly growing tourism industry in the "Riviera Maya" region of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico may result in contamination of groundwater resources that eventually discharge into Caribbean coastal ecosystems. We deployed two types of passive sampling devices into groundwater flowing through cave systems below two communities to evaluate concentrations of contaminants and to indicate the possible sources. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products accumulated in the samplers could only have originated from domestic sewage. PAHs indicated contamination by runoff from highways and other impermeable surfaces and chlorophenoxy herbicides accumulated in samplers deployed near a golf course indicated that pesticide applications to turf are a source of contamination. Prevention and mitigation measures are needed to ensure that expanding development does not impact the marine environment and human health, thus damaging the tourism-based economy of the region.

AB In this work, we investigated the transport and burial of triclosan and its methylated derivative, in surface sediments near the mouth of Barker Inlet in South Australia. The most likely source of this commonly used bactericide to the area is a wastewater outfall discharging at the confluence of the inlet with marine waters. Triclosan was detected in all samples, at concentrations (5-27 mu g kg(-1)) comparable to values found in other surface sediments under the influence of marine wastewater outfalls. Its dispersal was closely associated with fine and organic-rich fractions of the sediments. Methyl-triclosan was detected in approximately half of the samples at concentrations < 11 mu g kg(-1). The occurrence of this compound was linked to both wastewater discharges and biological methylation of the parent compound. Wastewater-borne methyl-triclosan had a smaller spatial footprint than triclosan and was mostly deposited in close proximity to the outfall. In situ methylation of triclosan likely occurs at deeper depositional sites, whereas the absence of methyl-triclosan from shallower sediments was potentially explained by photodegradation of the parent compound. Based on partition equilibrium, a concentration of triclosan in the order of 1 mu g L(-1) was estimated in sediment porewaters, a value lower than the threshold reported for harmful effects to occur in the couple of species of marine phytoplankton investigated to date. Methyl-triclosan presents a greater potential for bioaccumulation than triclosan, but the implications of its occurrence to aquatic ecosystem health are difficult to predict given the lack of ecotoxicological data in the current literature.

AB Occurrence of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and diclofenac) and three lipid regulators (bezafibrate, clofibric acid and gemfibrozil) was investigated in wastewater, sewage sludge, and river water of the urban section of the Pearl River at Guangzhou in South China. Behavior and fate of the pharmaceuticals during treatment in two sewage treatment plants (STPs) were also studied in depth by determining concentrations in the influents and effluents at major treatment units and the sewage sludge. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the raw wastewater were mostly at ng L(-1) levels except salicylic acid whose concentrations ranged from 9.6 to 23.3 mu g L(-1). No significant amount of the pharmaceuticals was detected in the suspended particulate matter of wastewater and sewage sludge. Salicylic acid, indomethacin, and naproxen were almost completely removed (>99%); gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and bezafibrate were significantly removed (>75%), whereas diclofenac and clofibric acid were removed by 60-70% during treatment in the STPs. Generally, biodegradation was the governing process for elimination of the investigated pharmaceuticals. Anaerobic biodegradation was responsible for most of the removal of diclofenac whereas aerobic biodegradation also played an important role in elimination of the other pharmaceuticals except SA, which was nearly completely removed after the anoxic process. In the Pearl River, the pharmaceuticals were widely detected. Both the concentrations and detection frequency were higher in March 2008 than those in the other seasons, which may be ascribed mainly to less dilution caused by lower precipitation. Besides the STPs, urban canals directly connected with the Pearl River may also be important contributors to the pharmaceutical contamination in the river.

AB The occurrence and behavior of beta-blockers, antiepileptic drug carbamazepine and its metabolites, X-ray contrast agent iopromide, natural and synthetic hormones, and several groups of hormone-like personal care products (PCPs), including antiseptics (triclocarban, triclosan, and 2-phenylphenol), parabens and bisphenol A, were investigated in municipal wastewater, sewage sludge, and urban river water of the Pearl River Delta, South China. The pharmaceuticals, natural hormones and PCPs were ubiquitously detected in the raw wastewater from a sewage treatment plant (STP). Only triclocarban and triclosan were detected at significant amounts in the dewatered sludge. Iopromide and the PCPs were greatly removed/transformed from the aqueous phase of the wastewater. The beta-blockers were only moderately removed/transformed. Carbamazepine passed through the STP almost unchanged. Biodegradation was the dominant process for elimination/transformation of the pharmaceuticals, hormones, and most PCPs in the STP. However, sorption also played an important role in the fate of triclocarban with nearly 50% of the mass load entering the STP ended up and persisted in the dewatered sludge. The pharmaceuticals, estrone, and PCPs were also widely detected in the Pearl River at Guangzhou. Bisphenol A had the highest concentration. The pharmaceutical concentrations in the Pearl River were higher in March than in May, most likely due to less dilution by lower precipitation. The omnipresence and high levels of the pharmaceuticals and PCPs in the Pearl River may be associated with direct discharge of untreated wastewater and pose potential risks to the ecological system.

AB Six trace contaminants (acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), carbamazepine (CBZ), diatrizoic acid (DTA), 1H-benzotriazole (BTZ) and its 4-methyl analogue (4-TTri)) were traced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to receiving waters and further to riverbank filtration (RBF) wells to evaluate their prediction power as potential wastewater markers. Furthermore, the persistence of some compounds was investigated in advanced wastewater treatment by soil aquifer treatment (SAT). During wastewater treatment in four conventional activated sludge WWTPs ACE, SUC, and CBZ showed a pronounced stability expressed by stable concentration ratios in influent (in) and effluent (out) (ACE/CBZ: in45, out40; SUC/CBZ: in1.8, out1.7; and ACE/SUC: in24, out24). In a fifth WWTP, additional treatment with powdered activated carbon led to a strong elimination of CBZ, BTZ, and 4-TTri of about 80% and consequently to a distinctive shift of their ratios with unaffected compounds. Data from a seven month monitoring program at seven sampling locations at the rivers Rhine and Main in Germany revealed the best concentration correlation for ACE and CBZ (r(2) = 0.94) and also a good correlation of ACE and CBZ concentrations to BTZ and 4-TTri levels (r(2) = 0.66 to 0.82). The comparison of ratios at different sampling sites allowed for the identification of a CBZ point source. Furthermore, in Switzerland a higher consumption of SUC compared to Germany can be assumed, as a steadily increasing ACE/SUC ratio along the river Rhine was observed. In RBF wells a good correlation (r(2) = 0.85) was again observed for ACE and CBZ. Both also showed the highest stability at a prolonged residence time in the subsurface of a SAT field. In the most peripheral wells ACE and CBZ were still detected with mean values higher than 36 mu g L-1 and 1.3 mu g L-1, respectively. Although SUC concentrations in wastewater used for SAT decreased by more than 80% from about 18 mu g L-1 to 2.1 mu gL(-1) and 3.5 mu g L-1 in these outlying wells, the compound was still adequate to indicate a wastewater impact in a qualitative way.

AB This study investigates biofiltration for the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and for the reduction of non-specific toxicity expressed as baseline toxicity equivalent concentration (baseline-TEQ). Two filtering media, sand and granular activated carbon, were tested. The influence of pre-ozonation and empty-bed contact time (EBCT, from 30 to 120 min) was determined. The experiments were performed at a pilot-scale with real WWTP effluent. A previous study showed that biological activity had developed on the filtering media and dissolved organic removal had reached a steady state before sampling commenced. The results show that biological activated carbon (BAC) has a good potential for the removal of DOG (35-60%), PPCPs (>90%) and baseline-TEQ (28-68%) even without pre-ozonation. On the contrary, the sand shows limited improvement of effluent quality. Varying the EBCT does not influence the performance of the BAG filters; however, dissolved oxygen concentration could be a limiting factor. The performances of the BAG filters were stable for over two years suggesting that the main mechanism of organic matter and PPCPs removal is biodegradation. It is concluded that BAG filtration without pre-ozonation could be implemented as a low cost advanced treatment option to improve WWTP effluent chemical quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The partitioning of steroid estrogens in wastewater treatment and receiving waters is likely to influence their discharge to, and persistence in, the environment. This study investigated the partitioning behaviour of steroid estrogens in both laboratory and field studies. Partitioning onto activated sludge from laboratory-scale Husmann units was rapid with equilibrium achieved after 1 h. Sorption isotherms and Kd values decreased in the order 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol > 17 alpha-estradiol > estrone > estriol without a sorption limit being achieved (1/n > 1). Samples from a wastewater treatment works indicated no accumulation of steroid estrogens in solids from primary or secondary biological treatment, however, a range of steroid estrogens were identified in sediment samples from the River Thames. This would indicate that partitioning in the environment may play a role in the long-term fate of estrogens, with an indication that they will be recalcitrant in anaerobic conditions.

AB Citalopram is one of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) commonly found in treated sewage effluents. Accordingly, there are concerns about possible adverse effects of SSRIs on aquatic organisms, particularly behavioural effects similar to those associated with SSRI use in humans. Rainbow trout fry and adult male guppies were therefore exposed to waterborne citalopram, ranging from environmentally relevant to high concentrations (1, 10,100 mu g/L) for 3-7 days. Under these experimental conditions citalopram does not appear to cause significant effects on aggression in rainbow trout fry or on sexual behaviour in male guppies. This may be explained by a relatively low uptake of citalopram from water to fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs) represent one of the largest point sources of contamination, but few studies have addressed the impact on fish populations. We tested the hypothesis that MWWEs disrupt multiple stress-related pathways by examining expression of genes and proteins in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A caging study was undertaken by placing juvenile trout for 14 d either at an upstream control or 100%, 50%, and 10% MWWE sites. A custom-made low-density rainbow trout cDNA microarray was utilized for transcriptomics, and select gene expression was confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR. MWWE exposure significantly elevated plasma cortisol, glucose, and vitellogenin levels, and altered the expression of a number of hepatic genes. Notably, expression of stress-related genes, hormone receptors, glucose transporter 2, and genes related to immune function were altered. The gene and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor, heat shock proteins 70 and 90, and cytochrome P4501A1 were also impacted by MWWE exposure. Our results demonstrate that tertiary-treated MWWEs elicit an organismal and cellular stress response in trout and may lead to an enhanced energy demand in the exposed fish. The disruption in multiple stress-related pathways suggests that tertiary-treated MWWEs exposure may reduce fish performance to subsequent stressors.

AB Pharmaceutical products are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers and lakes. A wide variety of drugs have been found in waterways of many countries, including analgesics, antibiotics and antiepileptics. The adsorption of four common pharmaceuticals present in surface-waters, trimethoprim (antibiotic), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), ketoprofen and naproxen (analgesics) onto Amberlite XAD-7 (an acrylic ester resin) has been investigated. Adsorption experiments were carried out at different pH conditions and the experimental equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. For the same experimental conditions (pH 7) the estimated adsorption capacities are from 97 mg g(-1) for carbamazepine >54 mg g(-1) for trimethoprim >45 mg g(-1) for ketoprofen and approximate to 43 mg g(-1) for naproxen. The influence of adsorption pH was established for each compound. The investigation indicates that the mean sorption energy (E=8.3-10.1 kJ mol(-1)) characterizes a physical adsorption and the surface of the resin is energetically heterogeneous. On the other hand, the work studies the effect of the presence of other drugs in solution on the individual adsorption process. The comparison of Freundlich-parameters shows that the adsorption capacity decreases as expected for neutral and acidic drugs and increases for the case of trimethoprim (a basic drug).

AB The Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) conducted a survey in 2006 on emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) which included pharmaceuticals, hormones and bisphenol A (BPA). The survey collected 258 samples over a 16 month period from selected source waters and 17 drinking water systems (DWSs), and analyzed them for 48 EOCs using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) for the highest precision and accuracy of analytical data possible. 27 of the 48 target EOCs were detected in source water, finished drinking water, or both. DWSs using river and lake source water accounted for > 90% detections. Of the 27 EOCs found, we also reported the first detection of two antibiotics roxithromycin and enrofloxacin in environmental samples. The most frequently detected compounds (>= 10%) in finished drinking water were carbamazepine (CBZ), gemfibrozil (GFB), ibuprofen (IBU), and BPA; with their concentrations accurately determined by using IDMS and calculated to be 4 to 10 times lower than those measured in the source water. Comparison of plant specific data allowed us to determine removal efficiency (RE) of these four most frequently detected compounds in Ontario DWSs. The RE of CBZ was determined to be from 71 to 93% for DWSs using granulated activated carbon (GAC); and was 75% for DWSs using GAC followed by ultraviolet irradiation (UV). The observed RE of GFB was between 44 and 55% in DWSs using GAC and increased to 82% when GAC was followed by UV. The use of GAC or GAC followed by UV provided an RE improvement of SPA from 80 to 99%. These detected concentration levels are well below the predicted no effect concentration or total allowable concentration reported in the literature. Additional targeted, site specific comparative research is required to fully assess the effectiveness of Ontario DWSs to remove particular compounds of concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Separation of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater by nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been investigated in this study. For this purpose a membrane system including a polyamide spiral wound NF membrane was evaluated for the treatment of amoxicillin wastewater. The effects of operating conditions such as flow rate, pressure and concentration of amoxicillin and COD in the feed, on the efficiency of the membrane were evaluated. The permeation flux and rejection of amoxicillin and COD were the criteria for this evaluation. The rejection of the amoxicillin by the selected NF membrane was adequate and in most cases exceeded 97% whereas COD reached a maximum of 40% rejection and permeation flux was over 1.5 L/min.m(2). The rise in pressure enhanced the transport rate of the solvents. Permeation flux of the NE membrane increased with increasing flow rates. Experimental data also indicated that concentration polarization existed in this membrane separation process. The stable permeation flux and high rejection of amoxicillin indicated the potential of NF for the recovery of amoxicillin from the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been recognized as a group of chemicals of emerging environmental concern. Results from previous studies have shown that PPCPs are among the most frequently detected anthropogenic contaminants in the environment. Following the reuse of animal waste, reclaimed wastewater and treated sewage sludge (biosolids), PPCPs can enter the terrestrial environment. However, little is known about their fate in receiving soils and particularly their uptake potential by agriculturally important plants. In this work, we review the available literature on this subject, propose future research needs, and discuss possible management practices that can help reduce PPCP plant uptake.

AB A simple method using direct sample injection combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of six alkaloid compounds in environmental samples. The target list includes two psychostimulants (nicotine and caffeine), three metabolites (cotinine, nicotinic acid and paraxanthine) and a coffee chemical (trigonelline). The analytical method was evaluated in three different matrices (surface water, influent and effluent wastewater). The method developed showed an adequate sensitivity, below 0.6 mu g L-1 for wastewater and 0.1 mu g L-1 for river matrices, without any prior treatment of the samples. Finally, the methodology was applied to real samples for evaluation of their removal from a sewage treatment plant and their persistence/fate in the aquatic environment. All compounds studied in this work were detected at all sampling points collected along the Henares River. However, nicotinic acid was only detected three times in treated sewage samples at levels above its detection limit. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was investigated with the aim of evaluating its potential for cytostatic drug and cytotoxicity bioremoval. The toxicity removal was assessed from biomarker test. CP removal of up to 80% was achieved under the operating conditions studied (HRT of 48 h and a SRT of 50 days). The increase of TMP was associated with an increase of supernatant toxicity as if fouling led to retention of the toxicity. Peaks of supernatant cytotoxicity were correlated with peaks in supernatant humic acid contents. It may suggest that molecules with a toxic effect may be adsorbed or entrapped in humic acids substances. Our study then points out that advances in wastewater treatment using an MBR can provide a suitable process for lowering CP concentrations before discharge into the aqueous environment. However, a tertiary treatment is necessary if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as dipyrone is so widespread that this drug and its metabolites have been detected in effluents and surface water. This study aimed to evaluate the potential toxic effects of dipyrone on the aquatic environment, using a native fish species, Rhamdia quelen. Fish were exposed to three concentrations of dipyrone, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/L, in the water for 15 days, and hematological, biochemical, genetic and morphological biomarkers were evaluated. The glutathione S-transferase activity decreased in the highest concentration in relation to the control group. In addition, hematocrit, red blood cells and thrombocyte counts were decreased in all three exposed groups in relation to the control group. The comet assay showed DNA damage at the lowest concentration of dipyrone and significant kidney damage. Those results suggest that a constant exposure of aquatic organisms to dipyrone presents potential toxic effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Biological degradation rates of estrogen compounds and common pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were examined in soils with a long history of exposure to these compounds through wastewater effluent and in soil not previously exposed. Biological degradation rates over 14 days were compared under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Estrogen compounds including estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol exhibited rapid degradation by soil microorganisms in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Rapid degradation rates for estrone, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol occurred in pre-exposed soil under aerobic conditions; half-lives calculated under these conditions were 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 day, respectively. Unexposed soil showed similar or slightly longer half-lives than pre-exposed soil under aerobic conditions. The exception was 17 beta-estradiol; in all treatments, degradation in unexposed soil resulted in a shorter half-life (2.1 versus 2.3 days). Anaerobic soils exhibited high biological degradation of estrogens as well. Half-lives of all estrogens ranged from 0.7 to 6.3 days in anaerobic soils. Triclosan degraded faster under aerobic conditions with half-lives of 5.9 and 8.9 days in exposed and unexposed soil. Under anaerobic conditions, triclosan half-lives were 15.3 days in unexposed and 28.8 days in exposed soil. Ibuprofen showed the least propensity toward biological degradation than other chemicals tested. Biological degradation of ibuprofen was only observed in unexposed soil; a half-life of 41.2 days was determined under anaerobic conditions and 121.9 days under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, unexposed soil exhibited a greater ability under anaerobic conditions to biologically degrade tested compounds than previously exposed soil.

AB Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antimycotic drug used for the treatment of dermatological and gynecological infections; it is incompletely broken down during sewage treatment and could potentially reach agricultural land through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater. In the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated the persistence and dissipation pathways of H-3-clotrimazole during laboratory incubations of agricultural soils. Clotrimazole was removed from a loam (time to dissipate 50% = 68 d), a sandy loam (time to dissipate 50% = 36 d), and a clay loam (time to dissipate 50% = 55 d), with formation of nonextractable residues being the major sink for H-3. Their parent compound had no significant mineralization, as evidenced by the lack of formation of (H2O)-H-3. Up to 15% of the applied radioactivity was recovered in the form of [H-3]-(2-chlorophenyl)diphenyl methanol. The rate of clotrimazole dissipation in the loam soil did not vary with moisture content, but it was slower at a lower temperature (number of days to dissipate 50% = 275.6 d at 4 degrees C). Addition of municipal biosolids to the loam soil did not vary the clotrimazole dissipation rate. In summary, the present study has established that clotrimazole is dissipated in soil, at rates that varied with soil texture and temperature. Clotrimazole dissipation was accompanied by the formation of nonextractable residues and detectable extractable residues of the transformation product (2-chlorophenyl)diphenyl methanol. Environ.

AB Because of the growing need to eliminate undesirable microorganisms in different industrial treatments, mainly in the food and agricultural sector and the pharmaceutical industry, a number of increasingly effective systems for disinfection to eliminate microorganisms have been devised. This article analyzes different methods to eliminate and/or significantly reduce the number of microorganisms in industrial contexts and in environmental engineering. Although, in the past, thermal treatments had been used most frequently for microbial elimination, the method is costly and has the disadvantage of modifying the organoleptic and/or physicochemical properties of the food products. For this reason, new technologies rapidly are being developed, such as high-intensity pulsed electric fields, high-pressure systems, ultrasounds, and irradiation, which effectively eliminate microorganisms without deteriorating the properties of the product. These emerging technologies are potentially applicable in the field of environmental engineering. Water Environ. Res., 83, 233 (2011).

AB Research on the effects of chemical pollution in the environment that is related to urban wastewaters' discharge and reuse until recently was focused almost exclusively on conventional pollutants. During the last several years though there has been a growing level of concern related to the hypothesis that various chemicals may exhibit endocrine disrupting effects. In addition, thousands of tons of pharmacologically active substances are used annually ending up in the wastewaters. In many countries facing prolonged droughts and implementing wastewater reuse schemes for irrigation and groundwater discharge, the existence of xenobiotic compounds in the tertiary treated wastewaters constitutes a new concern. This study describes the application of a recently developed multi-residue method for the determination of 29 multi-class pharmaceuticals using off line solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The method was applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues at three sewage treatment plants in Cyprus serving major coastal Mediterranean cities. The presence of 19 pharmaceuticals was confirmed. For some of the compounds high concentrations were obtained for the final effluents (e.g. ofloxacin: 4.82 mu g/L, diclofenac: 5.51 mu g/L, carbamazepine: 27.27 mu g/L, metoprolol: 9.59 mu g/L). Concerning the elimination potential, what was derived from the study is that the biological treatment step contributes the most to the removal of the compounds while sand filtration and chlorination steps reduce slightly the residual concentrations.

AB Nervous system active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including anti-depressants and opioids, are important clinically administered pharmaceuticals within healthcare facilities. This study provides source characterization data describing the composition and magnitude of nervous system APIs present in healthcare facility wastewaters. Concentrations and mass loadings of ten nervous system APIs and three nervous system API metabolites are reported for wastewaters from a hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility within a single municipality. Concentrations of nervous system APIs ranged from non-detectable levels for alprazolam in all four facility wastewaters to a high of 290 ng/L amitriptyline in nursing facility wastewater. The summed mean concentration of all thirteen analytes ranged from 402 ng/L in independent living facility wastewater to 624 ng/L in assisted living facility wastewater. Wastewater flow rates from each facility were combined with concentration data to estimate the daily mass loading of nervous system APIs leaving each facility through wastewater discharge to the municipal sewer system. The total mass loading of all thirteen analytes for the hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility was 228, 44, 29.5, and 28.1 mg/day, respectively. The total mass loading of nervous system APIs contributed to the municipality's wastewater from all four facilities was 330 mg/day. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We measured five estrogens in the wastewater samples from the municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs), livestock wastewater treatment plants (L-WWTPs), hospital WWTPs (H-WWTPs) and pharmaceutical manufacture WWTPs (P-WWTPs) in Korea. The L-WWTPs showed the highest total concentration (0.195-10.4 mu g L-1) of estrogens in the influents, followed by the M-WWTPs (0.028-1.15 mu g L-1), H-WWTPs (0.068-0.130 mu g L-1) and P-WWTPs (0.015-0.070 mu g L-1). Like the influents, the L-WWTPs (0.003-0.729 mu g L-1) and the M-WWTPs (0.001-0.299 mu g L-1) also showed higher total concentration of estrogens in the effluents than the H-WWTPs (0.002-0.021 mu g L-1) and P-WWTPs (0.011 mu g L-1 in one sample). The L-WWTPs (37.5-543 mu g kg(-1), dry weight) showed higher total concentrations in sludge than the M-WWTPs (3.16-444 mu g kg(-1), dry weight) like the wastewater. The distribution of estrogens in the WWTPs may be affected by their metabolism in the human body, their transition through biological treatment processes, and their usage for livestock growth. Unlike the concentration results, the daily loads of estrogens from the M-WWTPs were the highest, which is related to the high capacities of WWTPs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of antibiotic metronidazole (MNZ) in aqueous solution by nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) particles was investigated. The experimental results showed that MNZ was completely removed by NZVI. MNZ solution at 80 mg L-1 was rapidly removed by NZVI within 5 min, at initial solution pH 5.60. NZVI dose of 0.1 g L-1. Influencing factors such as NZVI dosage, initial MNZ concentration and initial solution pH were systematically studied, and the removal process of MNZ followed a pseudo-first order kinetics model. The removal efficiency was enhanced with increasing NZVI dosage while it was decreased with the increase of initial MNZ concentration and initial solution pH. The removal of MNZ in a nitrogen bubbling system (NZVI/N-2 process) and in an air bubbling system (NZVI/air process) was compared, and the results showed that the removal rate in the NZVI/air process was slightly higher than that in the NZVI/N-2 process. The removal efficiencies of MNZ by using NZVI and commercial iron powder were investigated as well, indicating that MNZ removal efficiency by NZVI was about 49 times higher than that by commercial iron powder under the same dosages. This study demonstrates that the NZVI technology could be a promising approach for antibiotic wastewater treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of tropical horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) planted with Typha angustifolia to remove four widely used pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, declofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) at the relatively short hydraulic residence time of 2-4 days was documented. For both ibuprofen and naproxen, pharmaceutical compounds with low D-ow values, the planted beds showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of removal efficiencies (80% and 91%, respectively, at the 4 day HRT), compared to unplanted beds (60% and 52%, respectively). The presence of plants resulted in the removal of these pharmaceutical compounds from artificial wastewater. The more oxidizing environment in the rhizosphere might have played an important role, but other rhizosphere effects, beside rhizosphere aeration, appeared to be important also. Carbamazepine, considered one of the most recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, and declofenac showed low removal efficiencies in our CW, and this is attributable to their higher hydrophobicity. The fact that the removal of these compounds could be explained by the sorption onto the available organic surfaces, explains why there was no significant difference (p > 0.05)in their removal efficiencies between planted as compared to unplanted beds. No statistical significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for the removal efficiencies of any of the pharmaceuticals tested for the 2-day HRT as compared to that corresponding to 4-day HRT. The rather efficient removal shown by the wetlands in this study (with HRTs of 2-4 days), indicates that such a CW system may be more practically used (with less land requirements) in tropical regions for removing conventional pollutants and certain pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater effluents.

AB We assessed possible ecotoxicological implications of ozone application to secondary treated wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant on Gammarus fossarum, an aquatic leaf shredding amphipod. Our 10-week study exposed G. fossarum populations to ozone-treated, non-ozone treated wastewater, or tap water in replicated outdoor flow-through stream microcosms. Feeding activity, an indicator for organic matter decomposition, of amphipod populations exposed to ozone treated wastewater was significantly higher compared to those exposed to non-ozone treated wastewater (repeated measure ANOVA, p = 0.0002, df = 44). Also the population size was at the end of the experiment with approximately 150% significantly (t-test, p = 0.0059, n = 4) increased in ozone treated wastewater compared to non-ozone treated wastewater. Additionally, chlorophyll-a concentration, an indicator for algal biomass, was significantly higher in ozone treated wastewater (repeated measure ANOVA, p = 0.0404, df = 65). Thus, from an ecotoxicological viewpoint, we conclude that ozonation may improve wastewater quality, which should translate into positive ecological outcomes in the receiving waters. However, because ozonation also can cause toxic transformation products, the process may best be considered on a case-by-case basis.

AB The occurrence and transport of 12 antibiotics (from the tetracycline, sulfonamide, quinolone, and macrolide families) was studied in a 72-km stretch of the Haihe River, China, and in six of its tributaries. Aqueous and sediment samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. Sulfonamides were detected at the highest concentrations (24-385 ng/L) and highest frequencies (76-100%). Eight of the 12 antibiotics likely originated from veterinary applications in swine farms and fishponds, and concentrations at these sources (0.12-47 mu g/L) were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in the effluent of local wastewater treatment plants. Sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) was detected in all swine farm and fishpond samples (maximum concentration 47 mu g/L), which suggests its potential usefulness to indicate livestock source pollution in the Haihe River basin. Hydrological and chemical factors that may influence antibiotic distribution in the Haihe River were considered by multiple regression analysis. River flow rate exerted the most significant effect on the first-order attenuation coefficient (K) for sulfonamides, quinolones, and macrolides, with higher flow rates resulting in higher K, probably due to dilution. For tetracyclines, sediment total organic matter and cation exchange capacity exerted a greater impact on K than flow rate, indicating that adsorption to sediments plays an important role in attenuating tetracycline migration. Overall, the predominance of sulfonamides in the Haihe River underscores the need to consider regulating their veterinary use and improving the management and treatment of associated releases.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) can reach soil and aquatic environments through land application of wastewater effluent and agricultural runoff. The objective of this research was to assess the fate of PPCPs at field scale. PPCPs were measured systematically in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and in soil and groundwater receiving treated effluent from the WWTP. A land application site in West Texas was used as the study site; it has received treated wastewater effluent from the WWTP for more than 70 years in order to remove additional nutrients and irrigate non-edible crops. Target compounds (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, triclosan, caffeine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin) in wastewater, sewage sludge, soil, and groundwater were determined using HPLC/UV with qualitative confirmatory analyses using GC/MS. Samples were collected quarterly over 12 months for wastewater and sludge samples and over 9 months for soil and groundwater samples. Results indicated that concentrations of PPCPs in wastewater influent, effluent, sludge solid phase, and sludge liquid phase were in the range of non-detected (ND)-183 mu g/L, ND-83 mu g/L, ND-19 mu g/g, and ND-50 mu g/L, respectively. Concentrations in soil and groundwater samples were in the range of ND-319 ng/g and ND-1,745 mu g/L, respectively. GC/MS confirmation data were consistent with the results of HPLC/UV analyses. Overall, data indicate that PPCPs in the wastewater effluent from the WWTP transport both vertically and horizontally in the soil, and eventually reach groundwater following land application of the effluent.

AB The number of chemical compounds in sewage and consequently their release into the environment is increasing. Some of them are toxic and many of them are considered endocrine disrupters. Here, the capacity of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove caffeine, hormones and bisphenol-A was investigated. Bisphenol-A and caffeine are highly water-soluble compounds, as opposed to hormones (estradiol, estriol, and ethynilestradiol) which are hydrophobic compounds. In the Sewage Treatment Plant (SWT)1 the sewage is treated by activated sludge process, in the second plant, SWT2, sewage is treated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors followed by dissolved air flotation, and in the third, SWT3 sewage is treated by stabilization lagoons. The first lagoon is 3.5 m deep, thus facultative and polishment processes occur. It was speculated that there was a difference in efficiency between the three plants in removing micropollutants. Small differences were found in the amounts removed, probably accounted for by retention time. The caffeine and bisphenol-A were almost completely removed, higher than 90% for both compounds (bisphenol-A and caffeine) in all WWTPs. The hormones, however, had a smaller rate of removal, between 70% and 87%. It is suspected that retention time is essential for removal efficiency, together with type of treatment. In fact, the hormones, caffeine, and bisphenol-A found in the environment definitely come from untreated sewage.

AB In particular in arid regions the reuse of waste water and aquifer recharge is an important issue. Elimination of persistent emerging pollutants represents a key factor in integrated water resources management, and identifying suitable treatment processes to eliminate such compounds becomes inevitably necessary. It is the objective of this study (1) to assess the occurrence of emerging pollutants in the Jordan Valley and (2) to review and examine the biodegradability of selected key compounds. Among the most frequently detected compounds during a sampling campaign in 2007 were pharmaceutical residues such as carbamazepine, diclofenac, or naproxen, and X-ray contrast agents such as diatrizoic acid and iopromide, all typically found in Europe and the USA as well. To gain further insight into elimination processes, biodegradation studies were conducted with batch tests and flow-through soil columns under unsaturated, aerobic conditions. Results demonstrated biodegradation for pharmaceutical residues such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and bezafibrate. The degradation rate was faster in treated waste water as compared to raw waste water, most probably due to competing substrate consumption in raw waste water. The antiepileptic carbamazepine showed no degradation in the batch tests and only moderate removal during soil passage, probably due to sorption. The results of this study and previously published data emphasize the need for further studies under more defined conditions to elucidate the specific conditions under which biodegradation of emerging pollutants proceeds.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products are used extensively worldwide and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. In this study, antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservative compounds were analyzed in surface water and sediment from the Kaveri, Vellar and Tamiraparani rivers, and in the Pichavaram mangrove in India by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The mean concentration of carbamazepine recorded in the Kaveri River water (28.3 ng/L) was higher than in the other rivers and the mangrove. Because carbamazepine is used only in human drugs, this may reflect the relative contributions of human excretions/sewage in these rivers. The mean triclosan level in the Tamiraparani River (944 ng/L) was an order of magnitude greater than in the other water systems, and the concentrations at two of the sites reported here (3800-5160 ng/L) are, to our best knowledge, among the highest detected in surface waters. Sediment levels were, however, comparable with other sites. We conclude that industrial releases are likely major contributors of triclosan into this river system. Among parabens, ethyl paraben was predominantly observed. Hazard Quotients suggest greater environmental risks for triclosan than for carbamazepine and parabens. This is the first study on antiepileptic, antimicrobial and preservatives in rivers and mangroves from India. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hourly samples of tertiary wastewater effluent were analyzed for 30 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, estrogenic steroids, and alkylphenols in order to better understand the rate at which these compounds enter the environment. Several distinct patterns of daily cycling were observed, and were characterized as three separate categories. The concentrations of compounds such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, naproxen, estrone, and triclosan varied greatly during a daily cycle, with relative standard deviations exceeding 100% of their daily mean. Less extreme daily cycles were seen for other compounds such as azithromycin, atenolol, tert-octylphenol, iopromide and gemfibrozil. Peak concentrations for most compounds occurred in the early evening (5-8 pm). However, some compounds including carbamazepine, primidone, fluoxetine, and triclocarban exhibited little or no variability.

AB Treated sewage effluents contain complex mixtures of micropollutants, raising concerns about effects on aquatic organisms. The addition of advanced treatment steps has therefore been suggested. However, some of these could potentially produce effluents affecting exposed organisms by unknown modes of action. Here, H-1 NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) metabolomics of fish blood plasma was used to explore potential responses not identified by more targeted (chemical or biological) assays. Rainbow trout was exposed in parallel to six differently treated effluents (e.g., conventional activated sludge, addition of sand filter, further addition of ozonation and/or a moving bed biofilm reactor or a separate membrane bioreactor line). Multivariate data analysis showed changes in the metabolome (HDL, LDL, VLDL and glycerol-containing lipids, cholesterol, glucose, phosphatidylcholine, glutamine, and alanine) between treatment groups. This formed the basis for postulating a hypothesis on how exposure to effluent treated by certain processes, including zonation, would affect the metabolic profiles of exposed fish. The hypothesis withstood testing in an independent study the following year. To conclude, H-1 NMR metabolomics proved suitable for identifying physiological responses not identified by more targeted assays used in parallel studies. Whether these changes are linked to adverse effects remains to be tested.

AB In this study, photolytic and photocatalytic removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under UVC radiation (lambda = 254 nm) was investigated. The light intensity distribution inside the batch photoreactor was characterized by azoxybenzene actinometry. The intensity of incident radiation was found to be a strong function of position inside the reactor. 12 mg L-1 of SMX was completely removed within 10 min of irradiation under UVC photolysis, compared to 30 min under TiO2 photocatalysis. COD measurement was used as an indication of the mineralization efficiency of both processes and higher COD removal with photocatalysis was shown. After 6 h of reaction with photolysis and photocatalysis, 24% and 87% removal of COD was observed, respectively. Two of the intermediate photo-products were identified as sulfanilic acid and 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole by direct comparison of the HPLC chromatograms of standards to those of treated solutions. Ecotoxicity of treated and untreated solutions of SMX towards Daphnia magna was also investigated. It was found that a 3:1 ratio of sample to standard freshwater and a high initial concentration of 60 mg L-1 of SMX were used to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The photo-products formed during photocatalytic and photolytic processes were shown to be generally more toxic than the parent compound. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Co-adsorption of norfloxacin (Nor) and Cu(II) on montmorillonite at pH 4.5, 7.0 and 9.0 was studied by integrated batch adsorption experiments and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Under such pH conditions the dominant species of Nor are cation (Nor(+)), zwitterion (Nor(+/-)), and anion (Nor(-)), respectively. Results indicated that Nor sorption decreased with an increase of solution pH. The presence of Cu(II) slightly suppressed the Nor(+) sorption at pH 4.5, while increased Nor(+/-) and Nor(-)sorption on montmorillonite at pH 7.0 and 9.0, respectively. In contrast, Nor increased Cu(II) adsorption at pH 4.5, but had little effect on the adsorption of Cu(II) on montmorillonite at pH 7.0 and 9.0. Spectroscopic results showed that, at pH 4.5, Nor(+) was sorbed on montmorillonite by the formation of outer-sphere montmorillonite-Nor-Cu(II) ternary surface complex. At pH 7.0, montmorillonite-Nor-Cu(II) and montmorillonite-Cu(II)-Nor ternary surface complexes co-exist. At pH 9.0, montmorillonite-Cu(II)-Nor ternary surface complex was likely formed, which was different to Cu(II)(Nor)(2) precipitate of the solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Personal care products (PCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are groups of organic contaminants that have been detected in biosolids around the world. There is a shortage of data on these types on compounds in Australian biosolids, making it difficult to gain an understanding of their potential risks in the environment following land application. In this study, 14 biosolids samples were collected from 13 Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to determine concentrations of eight compounds that are PCPs and/or EDCs: 4-t-octylphenol (4tOP), 4-nonylphenol (4NP), triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Concentration data were evaluated to determine if there were any differences between samples that had undergone anaerobic or aerobic treatment. The concentration data were also compared to other Australian and international data. Only 4tOP, 4NP, TCS, and BPA were detected in all samples and El was detected in four of the 14 samples. Their concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 3.08 mg/kg, 0.35 to 513 mg/kg, <0.01 to 11.2 mg/kg, <0.01 to 1.47 mg/kg and <45 to 370 mu g/kg, respectively. The samples that were obtained from WWTPs that used predominantly anaerobic treatment showed significantly higher concentrations of the compounds than those obtained from WWTPs that used aerobic treatment. Overall, 4NP, TCS and BPA concentrations in Australian biosolids were lower than global averages (by 42%, 12% and 62%, respectively) and 4tOP concentrations were higher (by 25%), however, of these differences only that for BPA was statistically significant. The European Union limit value for NP in biosolids is 50 mg/kg, which 4 of the 14 samples in this study exceeded. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive analytical procedure for a reliable identification of nontarget polar contaminants in aquatic sediments was developed, based on the application of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOFMS). The procedure was applied for the analysis of freshwater sediment that was highly impacted by wastewater discharges from the pharmaceutical industry. A number of different contaminants were successfully identified owing to the high mass accuracy of the QTOFMS system, used in combination with high chromatographic resolution of UHPLC. The major compounds, identified in investigated sediment, included a series of polypropylene glycols (n = 3-16), alkylbenzene sulfonate and benzalkonium surfactants as well as a number of various pharmaceuticals (chlorthalidone, warfarin, terbinafine, torsemide, zolpidem and macrolide antibiotics). The particular advantage of the applied technique is its capability to detect less known pharmaceutical intermediates and/or transformation products, which have not been previously reported in freshwater sediments.

AB A detailed investigation was carried out to evaluate the occurrence, persistence and fate of a range of micropollutants at different processing points at a full-scale water recycling plant (WRP) in Queensland, Australia. The WRP, which combines an advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) with a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), produces high quality recycled water for industrial users. The concentrations of 11 pharmaceuticals from various therapeutic categories and two endocrine disrupting chemicals were examined in full -scale microfiltration and reverse osmosis membrane facilities. Salicylic acid was the most abundant analyte in the WWTP influent, with a concentration range of 11-38 mu g/L, followed by bisphenol A with concentrations ranging from 6 to 23 mu g/L The concentration of all analytes decreased on average by one order of magnitude following primary and secondary treatment. Gemfibrozil, primidone and carbamazepine were found to have lower removal efficiencies (74-78%) than other compounds during these stages, which could indicate lower biodegradability. The microfiltration and reverse osmosis systems were found to further lower the pollutant concentrations by an order of magnitude. The overall removal efficiencies in the final recycled water were above 97%, resulting in product water concentrations of lower than 0.1 mu g/L for most compounds. An exception to this finding was observed for bisphenol A, which was detected in concentrations up to 0.5 mu g/L in the final recycled water. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since conventional wastewater treatment processes are not particularly effective for PPCP removal, treated wastewater discharges are the main entry points for PPCPs into the environment, and eventually into our drinking water. This study investigates the use of laccase-catalyzed oxidation for removing low concentrations of PPCPs from municipal wastewater primary effluent. Oxybenzone was selected as a representative PPCP. Like many other PPCPs, it is not recognized directly by the laccase enzyme. Therefore, mediators were used to expand the oxidative range of laccase, and the efficacy of this laccase mediator system in primary effluent was evaluated. Eight potential mediators were investigated, and 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), a synthetic mediator, and acetosyringone (ACE), a natural mediator, provided the greatest oxybenzone removal efficiencies. An environmentally relevant concentration of oxybenzone (43.8 nM, 10 mu g/L) in primary effluent was completely removed (below the detection limit) after two hours of treatment with ABTS, and 95% was removed after two hours of treatment with ACE. Several mediator/oxybenzone molar ratios were investigated at two different initial oxybenzone concentrations. Higher mediator/oxybenzone molar ratios were required at the lower (environmentally relevant) oxybenzone concentration, and ACE required higher molar ratios than ABTS to achieve comparable oxybenzone removal. Oxybenzone oxidation byproducts generated by the laccase-mediator system were characterized and compared to those generated during ozonation. Enzymatic treatment generated byproducts with higher mass to charge (m/z) ratios, likely due to oxidative coupling reactions. The results of this study suggest that, with further development, the laccase mediator system has the potential to extend the treatment range of laccase to PPCPs not directly recognized by the enzyme, even in a primary effluent matrix.

AB The occurrence and behavior of carbamazepine (CBZ) was investigated in aquatic environment of Yangtze River Delta, East China. The water samples were enriched by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector. The validation of the analytical method included linearity (0.1-1 mg/L), recovery studies, and determination of limits of quantification. Limits of quantification of CBZ in various aquatic samples were in the range of 0.1-0.2 mu g/L. CBZ was detected in the Tongji University Intramural River, the Huangpu River, and the Suzhou River with the highest concentration of 1,090 ng/L, but not detected in the Nanhengyin River and the Caojia River. In sewage water samples, CBZ was not detected in one of the sewage treatment plants (STPs) but was detected in the raw influents and effluents at the other three selected STPs in Shanghai, with the concentrations ranging from 230 to 1,110 ng/L. CBZ was not completely eliminated after secondary treatment (with the active sludge process).

AB The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of ozone in oxidation processes, coliform inactivation and Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs) formation, associated with the potential of ozone to increase the Biodegradable Dissolved Organic Carbon (BDOC) in secondary effluent with applied ozone doses of 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 mg/L for contact times of 2, 5 and 10 min. The wastewater used in this work was collected from the Bhagwanpur Sewage Treatment Plant, Varanasi, India. Results of this experiment showed that 10 mg O-3/L O-3 for 5 min exposure was found most suitable dose for highest degradation of COD, TOC, UV254, color, turbidity and total nitrogen parameters. The inactivation range of microbial biomass range was found in between 95% and 98%. Experiment revealed the fact that aldehydes and carboxylic acid formation were significantly related with the ozone dose and exposure time and ozone might enhance the treatment efficiency of secondary effluent treatment.

AB This study presents the influence of the addition of additives such as activated carbon, carbon tetra chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium dichromate on ultrasonic reduction of pharmaceutical wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) under laboratory conditions. The addition of activated carbon increased the % COD reduction whereas the combined addition of activated carbon and H2O2/CCl4/K2Cr2O7 was found to show higher reduction. Among the various combinations investigated, the combined addition of activated carbon and CCl4 was found to be the best combination. However, the environmental and health problems associated with these chemicals limit the applicability of the process in an industrial level. Further investigation with this system showed that the initial pH and initial COD have significant influence on the removal rate. The data obtained were fitted with first order and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models. The values of the rate constants obtained indicated that the pharmaceutical wastewater can be treated efficiently by the proposed methods.

AB Tetracyclines (TCs) are a group of widely used antibiotics that have been frequently found in the aquatic environment. The potential reactions of TCs with common water disinfection oxidants such as chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and free available chlorine (FAC) have not been studied in depth and are the focus of this study. The oxidation kinetics of tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline and iso-chlorotetracycline by CLO2 and FAC are very rapid (with large apparent second-order rate constants k(app) = 2.24 x 10(5)-1.26 x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) with ClO2 and k(app) = 1.12 x 10(4)-1.78 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) with FAC at pH 7.0) and highly dependent on pH. Species-specific rate constants are obtained by kinetic modeling that incorporates pH-speciation of TCs and the oxidants (for FAC), and reveal that TCs primarily react with ClO2 and FAC by their unprotonated dimethylamino group and deprotonated phenolic-diketone group. The modest difference in reactivity among the four TCs toward the oxidants is consistent with expectation and can be explained by structural influences on the two reactive moieties. Product evaluation shows that oxidation of TCs by ClO2 leads to (hydr)oxylation and breakage of TC molecules, while oxidation of TCs by FAC leads to chlorinated and (hydr)oxylated products without any substantial ring breakage. Results of this study indicate that rapid transformation of TCs by oxidants such as ClO2 and FAC under water and wastewater treatment conditions can be expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Industrial wastewater flow caused operational difficulties in the wastewater treatment plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Bioaugmentation was successfully applied to maintain effluent quality in the periods when wastewater of high starch content was accepted, but, at the end of 2008, the nitrification capacity of the plant decreased considerably due to improperly pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater.
   Dynamic simulations were carried out in a prototype programme developed by the Environmental Expert System Research Group at the University of Pannonia, Hungary. Several parameters for heterotrophic biomass were adjusted in function of time, and the specific growth rate of autotrophic biomass was altered in function of time and temperature in order to describe the effects of inoculation and toxic influence. Simulations were carried out with both constant and adjusted parameters.
   Though results on effluent COD of the different modelling versions were similar, the ammonia concentration fitted the measured data only when modified parameters were used. The study revealed that the autotrophic biomass had slowly adapted to the toxic compound. Different control strategies of aeration and decreased excess sludge removal rate were tested to enhance the nitrification in the critical time intervals. The amount of ammonia and inorganic nitrogen decreased in all cases while the oxygen demand increased to a maximum of 10.1%.
   Reducing excess sludge removal rate gave satisfactory results even without changing aeration. Further improvement could be achieved by introducing aeration into the post-denitrification reactor. The combination of the two modifications can compensate for the effect caused by toxicity.

The influences of the volume ratio of pharmaceutical wastewater to domestic wastewater (PW/DW), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and air-liquid ratio (A/L) on chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) and ammonium (NH4+-N) of the effluent were investigated. When PW/DW of 4:1, HRT of 6 h, and A/L of 5:1 were applied, the mean effluent concentration of NH4+-N was 6.2 mg L-1, and the maximum CODCr concentration in the effluent was 96 mg L-1. Both NH4+-N and CODCr did not exceed the limits of the national discharge standards (NH4+-N <= 15 mg L-1, CODCr <= 100 mg L-1). In addition, the BAF system showed a strong capacity of further removal from NH4+-N of the effluent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spirulina platensis was cultivated in a bench-scale airlift photobioreactor using synthetic wastewater (total nitrogen 412 mg L-1, total phosphorous 90 mg L-1, pH 9-10) with varying ammonia/total nitrogen ratios (50-100% ammonia with balance nitrate) and hydraulic residence times (15-25 d). High average biomass density (3500-3800 mg L-1) and productivity (5.1 g m(-2) d(-1)) were achieved when ammonia was maintained at 50% of the total nitrogen. Both high ammonia concentrations and mutual self-shading, which resulted from the high biomass density in the airlift reactor, were found to partially inhibit the growth of S. platensis. The performance of the airlift bioreactor used in this study compared favorably with other published studies. The system has good potential for treatment of high strength wastewater combined with production of algae for biofuels or other products, such as human and animal food, food supplements or pharmaceuticals.

AB Four simple advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), i.e. heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). sonolysis (US), ozonation (O-3) and H2O2 oxidation, as well as their combinations were investigated in bench-scale for removing the organics present in the reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate from a municipal wastewater reclamation plant. It was observed that the degradation efficiencies reached a plateau after 1 h of reaction, with varying removals of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) up to 52%. The O-3-based AOPs exhibited relative high efficiencies in treating the organics present in the raw RO concentrate. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) coagulation was preferred over activated carbon adsorption as pretreatment process to improve the subsequent AOP treatments of the RO concentrate. Coupling pretreatment with coagulation, the various AOPs could efficiently remove the organics, resulting in an overall DOC removal of 34-68%, a significant improvement in biodegradability (7-20 times), and a decrease of ecotoxicity. Analyses of molecular weight (MW) distribution of the treated RO concentrate revealed that coagulation could remove large MW organics that were AOP-resistant, while AOP treatments could effectively decompose the complex organics into small molecular organics. The results also demonstrated that a simple integrated method. FeCl3 coagulation + photocatalysis (UVC/TiO2), could finally achieve 95% of the organics removal from the RO concentrate within 6 h.

AB Reclaimed wastewater is an important source of irrigation in semiarid and arid zones. Here we report data on carbamazepine (CBZ) uptake by cucumber plants in hydroponic culture and greenhouse experiments using different soil types irrigated with fresh water or reclaimed wastewater. Data obtained from the hydroponic culture experiments suggest that CBZ is mainly translocated by water mass flow, and thus it is concentrated and accumulated to the largest extent in the mature/older leaves. Carbamazepine concentration in cucumber fruits and leaves was negatively correlated with soil organic matter content. The concentrations of CBZ in the roots and stems were relatively low, and most CBZ in the plant (76-84% of total uptake) was detected in the leaves. A greenhouse experiment using fresh water and reclaimed wastewater spiked, or not, with CBZ at 1 mu g L-1 (typical concentration in effluents) revealed that CBZ can be taken up and bioaccumulated from its background concentration in reclaimed wastewater. Bioaccumulation factor (calculated as the ratio of CBZ concentration in the plant to that in the soil solution) for the fruits (0.8-1) was significantly lower than the value calculated for the leaves (17-20).
   This study emphasizes the potential uptake of active pharmaceutical compounds by crops in organic-matter-poor soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and highlights the potential risks associated with this agricultural practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Interest in the presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. in the water of our rivers and, to a lesser extent, in our drinking water, has been growing in recent decades. Many of these substances, currently classified as "emerging pollutants", are biologically active compounds and continuously released in effluents. As sewage treatment plants (STPs) are not adequately equipped to eliminate all of these substances completely, some are discharged directly into rivers. In Spain, as in most of its neighbouring countries, there is an elevated use of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (which are extremely prevalent among the older adult population) and anti-inflammatory medications, which are obtainable over the counter without a medical prescription.
   This study therefore sought to determine to what degree pharmaceuticals with the highest regional prescription and/or use rates, such as cardiovascular and analgesic/anti-inflammatory/antipyretic medications, were present in the principal rivers (pram, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tagus) and tap-water samples of the Madrid Region (MR). Samples were taken downstream the discharge of 10 of the most important region's STPs and the most frequently used drugs in the region were analysed for.
   Of the 24 drugs analysed, 21 were detected at concentrations ranging from 2 ng L-1 to 18 mu g L-1. The highest drug concentrations corresponded to ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, atenolol, frusemide (furosemide), gemfibrozil and hydrochlorthiazide, and in most cases exceeded the amounts reported in the scientific literature. No traces of these groups of pharmaceuticals were detected in the drinking water analysed.
   On the basis of the high concentrations detected, we believe that an environmental surveillance system should be implemented to assess the continuous discharge of these pharmaceuticals and their possible ecotoxicological effects. At the same time, efforts to raise the awareness of the public about responsible use and the proper disposal of such substances at purpose-designated collection points should be increased. Furthermore sewage treatment processes should be suitably adapted to increase the rates of removal of these drugs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of cashmerane (DPMI), celestolide, phantolide, traesolide (ATII), galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) in sewage and surface waters and their fate during wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion is investigated. AHTN and HHCB are the most important representatives and influent concentrations of 0.41-1.8 and 0.9-13 mu g L(-1) are observed. DPMI is detected in influent and effluent samples but in notably lower concentrations than AHTN and HHCB. Major sources of polycyclic musks are households, whereas industrial emitters seem to be of minor importance. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of selected industrial wastewaters (metal, textile and paper industry). Specific emissions of 0.36 +/- 0.19 and 1.6 +/- 1.0 mg cap(-1) d(-1) for AHTN and HHCB are calculated. Overall removal efficiencies between approx 50% and more than 95% are observed during biological wastewater treatment and removal with the excess sludge is the major removal pathway. Log K(D) values of 3.73-4.3 for AHTN, 3.87-4.34 for HHCB and 2.42-3.22 for DPMI are observed in secondary sludge. During sludge digestion no or only slight removal occurred. Mean polycyclic musk concentrations in digested sludge amounted to 1.9 +/- 0.9 (AHTN), 14.2 +/- 5.8 (HHCB), 0.8 +/- 0.4 (ATII) and 0.2 +/- 0.09 (DPMI) mg kg(-1) dry matter. In the receiving water systems a comparable distribution as during wastewater treatment is observed. AHTN, HHCB and DPMI are detected in surface waters (ND (not detected) - <0.04, ND - 0.32 and ND - 0.02 mu g L(-1)) as well as AHTN and HHCB in sediments (ND - 20, ND - 120 mu g kg(-1)). For HHCB an apparent K(OC) value of 4.1-4.4 is calculated for sediments. Major source for polycyclic musks in surface waters are discharges from wastewater treatment plants. For HHCB and DPMI 100% of the load observed in the sampled surface waters derive from discharges of treated wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Water saving; Pollution reduction
AB The pharmaceutical industry in China makes an important contribution to the national economy. However, the associated pollution problems cause gradual deterioration of the environment and impact adversely on the local community. Cleaner production (CP) technology, an effective way to reduce waste emission and save resources, has been widely employed in the pharmaceutical industry in the developed countries. Such technologies have been applied in a number of factories in China, although there is no integrated assessment and implementation procedure for implementing CP technologies in pharmaceutical plants. To solve such problems, a series of CP options are proposed and assessed here. CP is a powerful tool for decreasing waste production, limiting environmental pollution and natural resource depletion. Moreover, the return on investment in CP is quick, so it would seem that CP activities should be very much in demand by enterprises. Reality is less optimistic: frequently only limited interest is expressed, even after an explanation; business people hesitate to become actively involved. The processes in the pharmaceutical production industry produce a vast amount of waste, including wastewater with high concentrations of organic substances (the principal component), solid waste, and organic off-gas. To solve such problems, a series of CP options are proposed and assessed in this study. Having consideration to environmental impacts and economic efficiency, four groups of medium/high cost CP options were screened in an integrated assessment. To verify the proposed options, a case study was conducted in Degussa Luyuan, Northeast China. The characteristics of resource consumption and waste emission during the production process were identified. The proposed options were evaluated according to different aspects. An integrated CP system based on the proposed options was designed and then implemented in the factory. In three years of practical use, the productivity and quality of alcohol product were improved, with a reduction in waste and pollution and a marked increase in water/energy savings. This study provides theoretical and practical support for the extensive application of CP technologies and sustainable development in China's pharmaceutical industry. These methods include ways to clean up production that are incorporated in the process design, reforming present production technologies, updating the equipment, exploiting new producing flowcharts, using cleaner energy, building recycling into the manufacturing process, recycling waste, enhancing management, developing environmental protection technology, and ensuring satisfactory end-of-pipe disposal.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) have become one of the antibiotic families most frequently found in all kind of environmental waters. In the present work, the presence of 16 SAs and one of their acetylated metabolites in different water matrices of the Ebro River basin has been evaluated during two different sampling campaigns carried out in 2007 and 2008. Influent and effluent samples from seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), together with a total of 28 river water samples were analyzed by on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromathography-tandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS). Sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine were the SAs most frequently detected in WWTPs (96-100%), showing also the highest concentrations, ranging from 27.2 ng L-1 to 596 ng L-1 for sulfamethoxazole and from 3.7 ng L-1 to 227 ng L-1 for sulfapyridine. Sulfamethoxazole was also the SA most frequently detected in surface waters (85% of the samples) at concentrations between 11 ng L-1 and 112 ng L-1 In order to assess the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment in degrading SAs, removal efficiencies in the seven WWTPs were calculated for each individual SA (ranging from 4% to 100%) and correlated to the corresponding hydraulic retention times or residence times of the SAs in the plants. SAs half-lives were also estimated, ranging from to 2.5 hours (sulfadimethoxine) to 128 h (sulfamethazine). The contribution of the WWTPs to the presence of SAs depends on both the load of SAs discharging on the surface water from the WWTP effluent but also on the flow of the receiving waters in the discharge sites and the dilution exerted; WWTP4 exerts the highest pressure on the receiving water course. Finally, the potential environmental risk posed by SAs was evaluated calculating the hazard quotients (HQ) to different non-target organisms in effluent and river water. The degree of susceptibility resulted in algae>daphnia>fish. Sulfamethoxazole was the only SA posing a risk to algae in effluent water, with an HQ>7. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The antimicrobial substance triclosan has widespread use in personal care products and can enter the terrestrial environment if sewage sludge is applied to soil. The inhibitory effects of triclosan on basal and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) of three different soils were investigated. Soils were dosed and later redosed with four nominal triclosan concentrations, and respiration rates were measured over time. In each soil, a significant depression in basal respiration was noted after initial dosing, followed by a recovery. The initial extent of respiration inhibition was positively related to the triclosan dose, i.e., respiration was most inhibited at highest triclosan concentration. Differences in respiration inhibition between soils at equivalent dose were inversely correlated with organic matter and clay content, suggesting that the bioavailability of triclosan might have been reduced by sorption to organic carbon or by physical protection in micropores. Substrate-induced respiration was also reduced by the addition of triclosan and subsequently recovered. After redosing with triclosan, basal respiration was enhanced in all soils, suggesting that it was acting as a substrate. However, redosing resulted in SIR inhibition in all treatments above 10 mg triclosan kg(-1) in all three soils, although all soils appeared to be more resistant to perturbation than following initial dosing. The present study suggests that triclosan inhibits soil respiration but that a subsequent acclimation of the microbial community occurs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:360-366. (C) 2010 SETAC

AB Recent worldwide surveys have not only established incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by sewage treatment plants, but also their presence in surface waters receiving treated sewage effluent. Those aquatic systems where sewage effluent dominates flow are thought to be at the highest risk for ecosystem level changes. The city of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (population 190,400) treats its sewage at a modern tertiary sewage treatment facility located on Wascana Creek. The Wascana Creek hydrograph is dominated by one major event: spring snow melt. Thereafter, creek flow declines considerably and in winter treated sewage effluent makes up almost 100% of stream flow. Four water surveys conducted on the creek from winter 2005 to spring 2007 indicated that PPCPs were always present, in nanogram and sometimes microgram per liter concentrations downstream of the sewage treatment plant. This mixture included antibiotics, analgesics, antiinflammatories, a lipid regulator, metabolites of caffeine, cocaine and nicotine, and an insect repellent. Not surprisingly, concentrations of some PPCPs were highest in winter. According to hazard quotient calculations and homologue presence, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, triclosan, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole were present in Wascana Creek at concentrations that may present a risk to aquatic organisms. The continual exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals as well as concentrations of un-ionized ammonia that far exceed Canadian and American water quality guidelines suggests that Wascana Creek should be considered an ecosystem at risk. Although the Wascana Creek study is regional in nature, the results highlight the considerable risks posed to aquatic organisms in such effluent-dominated ecosystems. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The 2009-2010 influenza pandemic saw many people treated with antivirals and antibiotics. High proportions of both classes of drugs are excreted and enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in biologically active forms. To date, there has been no study into the potential for influenza pandemic-scale pharmaceutical use to disrupt WWTP function. Furthermore, there is currently little indication as to whether WWTP microbial consortia can degrade antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors when exposed to pandemic-scale doses. In this study, we exposed an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor, operated for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), to a simulated influenza-pandemic dosing of antibiotics and antivirals for 8 weeks. We monitored the removal of the active form of Tamiflu (R), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), bacterial community structure, granule structure and changes in EBPR and nitrification performance. There was little removal of OC by sludge and no evidence that the activated sludge community adapted to degrade OC. There was evidence of changes to the bacterial community structure and disruption to EBPR and nitrification during and after high-OC dosing. This work highlights the potential for the antiviral contamination of receiving waters and indicates the risk of destabilizing WWTP microbial consortia as a result of high concentrations of bioactive pharmaceuticals during an influenza pandemic.

AB Occurrence and distribution of chlorinated and non-chlorinated organophosphates in 72 groundwater samples from Germany under different recharge/infiltration conditions were investigated. Tris(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were the most frequently detected organophosphates in groundwater samples. Highest individual organophosphate concentrations (>0.1 mu g L(-1)) were determined in groundwater polluted by infiltrating leachate and groundwater recharged via riverbank filtration of organophosphate-loaded recipients. In samples from springs and deep groundwater monitoring wells that are not affected by surface waters, organophosphate concentrations were mostly below the limit of detection. The occurrence (3-9 ng L(-1)) of TCPP and TCEP in samples from aquifers with groundwater ages between 20 and 45 years indicates the persistence of both compounds within the aquifer. At urban sites organophosphate-loaded precipitation, surface runoff, and leakage of wastewater influenced groundwater quality. For rural sites, where groundwater recharge is only influenced by precipitation, organophosphates were very rarely detectable in groundwater.

AB The occurrence of the metabolites of five human pharmaceuticals was investigated in treated wastewater, surface waters and sediments. Metabolites of carbamazepine (carbamazepine epoxide), diclofenac (4'- and 5-hydroxy diclofenac) and atorvastatin (o- and p-hydroxy atorvastatin) were typically detected in flow proportional 24 h composite samples of wastewater effluent collected from the Norwegian cities of Oslo and Tromso at higher concentrations than the parent pharmaceutical. The concentrations determined in discharged effluent were as high as 3700 ng L-1 for 5-hydroxy diclofenac. The overall mean concentration of metabolites being typically higher in the primary treated effluent from the city of Tromso compared to the tertiary treatment performed on the Oslo effluent. Metabolites of carbamazepine (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide), metoprolol (alpha-hydroxy metoprolol) and simvastatin (hydroxy simvastatin) were detected in surface water samples collected from Oslofjord at concentrations of up to 108 ng L-1, whilst alpha-hydroxy metoprolol and simvastatin hydroxy carboxylic acid were also detected in sediments at low ng L-1 concentrations. These screening data show that the metabolites of selected pharmaceuticals are being discharged into the Norwegian coastal environment and that certain metabolites occur in marine surface waters and sediments.

AB During membrane treatment of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants, a reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) containing trace organic contaminants is generated. As the latter are of concern, effective and economic treatment methods are required. Here, we investigated electrochemical oxidation of ROC using Ti/Ru0.7Ir0.3O2 electrodes, focussing on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and 28 pharmaceuticals and pesticides frequently encountered in secondary treated effluents. The experiments were conducted in a continuously fed reactor at current densities (J) ranging from 1 to 250 A m(-2) anode, and a batch reactor at J = 250 A m(-2). Higher mineralization efficiency was observed during batch oxidation (e.g. 25.1 +/- 2.7% DOC removal vs 0% removal in the continuous reactor after applying specific electrical charge, Q = 437.0 A h m(-3) ROC), indicating that DOC removal is depending on indirect oxidation by electrogenerated oxidants that accumulate in the bulk liquid. An initial increase and subsequent slow decrease in SUVA(254) during batch mode suggests the introduction of auxochrome substituents (e.g. -Cl, NH2Cl, -Br, and -OH) into the aromatic compounds. Contrarily, in the continuous reactor ring-cleaving oxidation products were generated, and SUVA(254) removal correlated with applied charge. Furthermore, 20 of the target pharmaceuticals and pesticides completely disappeared in both the continuous and batch experiments when applying J >= 150 A m(-2) (i.e. Q >= 461.5 A h m(-3)) and 437.0 A h m(-3) (J = 250 A m(-2)), respectively. Compounds that were more persistent during continuous oxidation were characterized by the presence of electrophilic groups on the aromatic ring (e.g. triclopyr) or by the absence of stronger nucleophilic substituents (e.g. ibuprofen). These pollutants were oxidized when applying higher specific electrical charge in batch mode (i.e. 1.45 kA h m(-3) ROC). However, baseline toxicity as determined by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition tests (Microtox) was increasing with higher applied charge during batch and continuous oxidation, indicating the formation of toxic oxidation products, possibly chlorinated and brominated organic compounds.

AB This work assessed the solar photo-Fenton degradation of nalidixic acid (NXA), a quinolone antibacterial agent, in several different aqueous solutions. It has been proven that the composition of the water clearly affects the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process. The presence of chlorine ions induces the concurrence of different mechanisms involving Cl-center dot and Cl-2(center dot-) radicals, which slow down the process. Up to 35 transformation products (TPs) were identified and their structures characterized by accurate LC-TOF-MS mass measurements during treatment of the different model waters. Photocatalytic degradation was thus observed to proceed mainly through the attack of the hydroxyl radicals on the double bond C-(2)=C-(3) which induce further ring opening. All the TPs identified persisted after total degradation of NXA. NXA in real pharmaceutical effluent was treated by photo-Fenton as a first stage before biological treatment. As NXA has been demonstrated to be recalcitrant to biological treatment, photo-Fenton treatment of the effluent was continued until its total degradation. Although NXA was efficiently degraded, LC-MS analyses demonstrated that some of the TPs identified after the photo-Fenton treatment were also recalcitrant to biological treatment, persisting after the combined treatment. These results show that analytical assessment of photocatalytic water treatments is essential to assure they are functioning as intended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products, biocides and iodinated contrast media (ICM) are persistent compounds, which appear in ng to mu g L-1 in secondary effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this work, biogenic metals manganese oxides (BioMnOx) and bio-palladium (Bio-Pd) were applied in lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBR) as oxidative and reductive technologies, respectively, to remove micropollutants from STP-effluent. From the 29 substances detected in the STP-effluent, 14 were eliminated in the BioMnOx-MBR: ibuprofen (>95%), naproxen (>95%), diuron (>94%), codeine (>93%), N-acetyl-sulfa-methoxazole (92%), chlorophene (>89%), diclofenac (86%), mecoprop (81%), triclosan (>78%), clarithromycin, (75%), iohexol (72%), iopromide (68%), iomeprol (63%) and sulfa-methoxazole (52%). The putative removal mechanisms were the chemical oxidation by BioMnOx and/or the biological removal by Pseudomonas putida and associated bacteria in the enriched biofilm. Yet, the removal rates (highest value: 2.6 mu g diclofenac L-1 d(-1)) need to improve by a factor 10 in order to be competitive with ozonation. ICM, persistent towards oxidative techniques, were successfully dehalogenated with a novel reductive technique using Bio-Pd as a nanosized catalyst in an MBR. Iomeprol, iopromide and iohexol were removed for >97% and the more recalcitrant diatrizoate for 90%. The conditions favorable for microbial H-2-production enabling the charging of the Pd catalyst, were shown to be important for the removal of ICM. Overall, the results indicate that Mn oxide and Pd coupled to microbial catalysis offer novel potential for advanced water treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The incidence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle impose a growing concern for the future reuse of treated water. Because of the recurrent global use of drugs such as Acetaminophen (APAP), an analgesic and antipyretic drug, they are often detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, receiving surface waters and drinking water resources. In this study, the removal of APAP has been demonstrated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with APAP as the sole carbon source. After 16 days of operation, at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 days, more than 99.9% removal was obtained when supplying a synthetic WWTP effluent with 100 mu g APAP L-1. Batch experiments indicated no sorption of APAP to the biomass, no influence of the WWTP effluent matrix, and the capability of the microbial consortium to remove APAP at environmentally relevant concentrations (8.3 mu g APAP L-1). Incubation with allylthiourea, an ammonia monooxygenase inhibitor, demonstrated that the APAP removal was mainly associated with heterotrophic bacteria and not with the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Two APAP degrading strains were isolated from the MBR biomass and identified as Delftia tsuruhatensis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During incubation of the isolates, hydroquinone - a potentially toxic transformation product - was temporarily formed but further degraded and/or metabolized. These results suggest that the specific enrichment of a microbial consortium in an MBR operated at a high sludge age might be a promising strategy for post-treatment of WWTP effluents containing pharmaceuticals.

AB The removal of hydrophobic organic pollutants in water to surfactant-coated aluminum hydroxide [surfactant-Al(OH)(3)] was investigated. Anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT), and sodium oleate were sorbed on positively charged aluminum hydroxide at pH 7 and formed hydrophobic aggregates that can incorporate hydrophobic organic pollutants in water. Because of the hydrophobic interaction and decrease in the positive charge, surfactant-Al(OH)(3) was coagulated into precipitates that can readily be separated from water. Hydrophobic organic pollutants such as alkylphenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, estrogens, chlorinated antifungals, and pesticides were well collected to the precipitates and thus efficiently removed from water. The collection of hydrophobic organic pollutants was correlated to their aqueous-octanol distribution coefficient. The decomposition of hydrophobic organic pollutants was examined using a bacterial agent (Bacillus subtilis). Hydrophobic organic compounds collected to AOT-Al(OH)(3) or sodium oleate-Al(OH)(3) were insufficiently decomposed. On the other hand, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and pendimethalin collected to SDS-Al(OH)(3) were decomposed within 1 week. The decomposition was accelerated by the collection to SDS-Al(OH)(3).

AB In an effort to validate the use of ozone for contaminant oxidation and disinfection in water reclamation, extensive pilot testing was performed with ozone/H2O2 and biological activated carbon (BAG) at the Reno-Stead Water Reclamation Facility in Reno, Nevada. Three sets of samples were collected over a five-month period of continuous operation, and these samples were analyzed for a suite of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), total estrogenicity, and several microbial surrogates, including the bacteriophage MS2, total and fecal coliforms, and Bacillus spores. Based on the high degree of microbial inactivation and contaminant destruction, this treatment train appears to be a viable alternative to the standard indirect potable reuse (IPR) configuration (i.e., membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, UV/H2O2, and aquifer injection), particularly for inland applications where brine disposal is an issue. Several issues, including regrowth of coliform bacteria in the BAG process, must be addressed prior to full-scale implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A full-scale test was conducted with an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) pre-treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and amoxicillin. The aim of the study is to investigate the performance of UASB in the condition of a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate from 12.57 to 21.02 kg m(-3) d(-1) and a wide pH from 5.57 to 8.26, in order to provide a reference for treating the similar chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and amoxicillin. The results demonstrated that the UASB average percentage reduction in COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin were 52.2%, 26.3% and 21.6%, respectively. In addition, three models, built on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory and linear regression techniques were developed for the simulation of the UASB system performance in the biodegradation of pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and amoxicillin. The average error of COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin were -0.63%, 2.19% and 5.40%, respectively. The results indicated that these models built on the BPNN theory were well-fitted to the detected data, and were able to simulate and predict the removal of COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin by UASB.

AB Sewage effluents are widely recognised as the main source of emerging contaminants, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals in surface waters. A full-scale granular activated carbon (GAC) plant has been installed as an advanced technology for the removal of these contaminants, in a major sewage treatment works (STW) in South-West England as part of the UK National Demonstration Programme for EDCs. This study presented for the first time, an assessment of the impact of a recently commissioned, post-tertiary GAC plant in the removal of emerging contaminants in a working STW. Through regular sampling followed by solid-phase extraction and analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). a significant reduction in the concentrations of steroidal estrogens was observed (>43-64%). In addition, significant reductions were observed for many of the pharmaceutical compounds such as mebeverine (84-99%), although the reduction was less dramatic for some of the more widely used pharmaceuticals analysed, including carbamazepine and propranolol (17-23%).

AB The photodegradation of three antibiotics, oxytetracycline (OTC), doxycycline (DTC), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in UV and UV/H2O2 process was investigated with a low-pressure UV lamp system. Experiments were performed in buffered ultrapure water (UW), local surface water (SW), and treated water from local municipal drinking water treatment plant (DW) and wastewater treatment plant (WW). The efficiency of UV/H2O2 process was affected by water quality. For all of the three selected antibiotics, the fastest degradation was observed in DW, and the slowest degradation occurred in WW. This phenomenon can be explained by R-OH,R-UV, defined as the experimentally determined (OH)-O-center dot radical exposure per UV fluence. The R-OH,R-UV values represent the background (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging in water matrix, obtained by the degradation of para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), a probe compound. In natural water, the indirect degradation of CIP did not significantly increase with the addition of H2O2 due to its effective degradation by UV direct photolysis. Moreover, the formation of several photoproducts and oxidation products of antibiotics in UV/H2O2 process was identified using GC-MS. Toxicity assessed by vibrio fischer (V. fischer), was increased in UV photolysis, for the photoproducts still preserving the characteristic structure of the parent compounds. While in UV/H2O2 process, toxicity increased first, and then decreased; nontoxic products were formed by the oxidation of (OH)-O-center dot radical. In this process, detoxification was much easier than mineralization for the tested antibiotics, and the optimal time for the degradation of pollutants in UV/H2O2 process would be determined by parent compound degradation and toxicity changes.

AB Rivers containing effluents from water treatment plants are complex soups of compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals to natural hormones. Male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 3 weeks to effluent waters from the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant in St. Paul, MN. Fish were tested for their competitive nest holding behavior. Changes in vitellogenin were measured and these were correlated to changes in gene expression using a 22,000 gene microarray developed specifically for fathead minnows. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in both liver and testis, which correlate to phenotypic changes of vitellogenin induction and reduced competitive behavior. We also compared by real-time PCR the expression changes in key genes related to steroid biosynthesis and metabolism in fish exposed to the effluent as well as in fish exposed to a model estrogen and a model androgen. While the gene expression signature from effluent-exposed fish shared some elements with estrogen and androgen signatures, overall it was different, underscoring the complexity of compounds present in sewage and their different modes of action.

AB Prospects for wastewater irrigation in Brazil look promising, in light of the fact that agriculture plays an essential role in the country's economy and, furthermore, freshwater for irrigation is scarce in some parts of the country. However, irrigation with effluents still represents a new practice, and most available data related to the benefits and risks of effluent irrigation are based on short-term experiments. The present paper provides an overview of the potential of water reuse in Brazil; it describes the main results concerning effects of effluent irrigation on soil/plant interactions in Brazil, and discusses some important issues that require further investigation. So far, research in Brazil has been mainly focused on soil chemical changes that follow effluent application, while investigations concerning the occurrence and fate of trace contaminants, and the potential risks they present, remain to be carried out. Such contaminants include heavy metals and pharmaceutically active products. Effluent irrigation of agricultural crops intended for biofuel production represents a strategic issue, of increasing importance for the national and international market. For a consistent evaluation of long-term benefits and risks of effluent irrigation in this country, major needs are: improvement of the sewage collection and treatment infrastructure; establishment of legal regulations to control water reuse in agriculture; and permanent monitoring of areas already under wastewater irrigation.

AB OBJECTIVES: Ketoprofen is a common human medicine from a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which is provably detected in surface waters in concentrations ordinarily in mu g.L-1. The aim of this study was to compare the acute toxicity of ketoprofen to embryonic and juvenile stages of aquarium fish - zebrafish (Danio rerio).
   METHODS: Tests were performed according to the methods of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) No. 203 (Fish, acute toxicity test) and OECD No. 212 (Fish, short-term toxicity test on embryo and sac-fry stages).
   RESULTS: The results showed (mean +/- SD) LC50 value of ketoprofen to be 632.30 +/- 10.10 mg.L-1 in juvenile zebrafish and 6.44 +/- 2.22 mg.L-1 in embryonic stages of zebrafish. The results revealed statistically significantly higher sensitivity (p<0.01) of the embryonic stages of zebrafish to ketoprofen compared to its juveniles. The susceptibility of embryos depends on many factors, especially yet improperly developed enzymatic system in embryos, different ways of the absorption of the substance into the organism or differences in metabolism pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS: The acute toxicity of ketoprofen for juvenile stages of zebra:ish is low, but the substance seems to be toxic for embryonic stages.

AB We investigated the occurrence of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in Tokyo Bay during dry and wet weather and evaluated the contributions of wastewater effluent, untreated wastewater, and surface runoff by using two sewage markers, caffeine and crotamiton. Sigma 8PFCAs ranged from 11 to 185 ng L(-1). Perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was the major species, followed by perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA). Principal component analysis followed by multiple linear regression revealed that the PFCAs were derived mainly from wastewater effluent during dry weather, and jointly from wastewater effluent (59%) and combined sewer overflow (41%) during wet weather. We used caffeine-to-crotamiton ratios to evaluate the contributions of untreated wastewater and wastewater effluent. Estimated concentrations of wastewater-derived PFCAs were much lower than observed concentrations during wet weather, indicating the contribution of surface runoff to contamination. During a combined sewer overflow, surface runoff had a significant effect on contamination in the bay.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of coupling a catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO), with CuO/Al2O3 as catalyst, and an anaerobic/aerobic biological process to treat wastewater from Vitamin B-6 production. Results showed that the CWAO enhanced the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) from 0.10 to 0.80. The oxidized effluents with COD of 10,000 mg l(-1) was subjected to subsequent continuous anaerobic/aerobic oxidation, and 99.3% of total COD removal was achieved. The quality of the effluent obtained met the discharge standards of water pollutants for pharmaceutical industry Chemical Synthesis Products Category (GB21904-2008), and thereby it implies that the integrated CWAO and anaerobic/aerobic biological treatment may offer a promising process to treat wastewater from Vitamin B6 production.

AB Planned potable water recycling has become an important strategy for managing drinking water supplies in a growing number of countries including Australia, the USA, Namibia, Singapore and some parts of Europe. This involves the advanced treatment of municipal wastewaters (treated sewage) prior to reuse by supplementation of drinking water supplies. In order to ensure the protection of public health, careful assessment and management of trace chemical contaminants is essential. Important chemical contaminants include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroidal hormones, pesticides, industrial chemicals, perfluorochemicals, antiseptics and disinfection by-products. Monitoring of key toxic chemicals of concern is important and can be supplemented by techniques for direct toxicological assessment of whole water samples. Furthermore, monitoring of a limited range of identified indicator chemicals and surrogate parameters can be an effective means for confirming ongoing treatment performance of individual unit treatment processes. This chapter provides a description of some of the most significant planned potable water recycling schemes currently in operation or under development around the world. It highlights the various approaches used in the assessment of chemical safety for these schemes, and hence the alternatives that are available for the assessment of future potable water recycling schemes.

AB The influence of pH on the degradation of the pharmaceutical diclofenac (DCF) by the solar/photo-Fenton process was investigated using ammonium iron(III) citrate complex (FecitNH(4)). Although the degradation efficiency decreased as the pH increased (in the pH range 5 to 8), the DCF concentration was lower than its limit of detection after 45 min irradiation while 77% of the total organic carbon was removed after 150 min irradiation at initial pH 7 (without further adjustment). A pseudo-first-order kinetics of DCF degradation was observed, which kinetic constant increased with the increase of the concentrations of FecitNH(4) and H2O2. Lower DCF degradation was observed when present in a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent sample, mainly due to the high concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate at pH 7. However, after adjusting the pH to 5, the DCF concentration was lower than its detection limit after 75 min irradiation.

AB The ability of several mesocosm-scale horizontal subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands (CW) to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater was assessed in the winter and summer of 2008. As CWs are generally used as secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment systems, their efficacy was compared when fed from two different primary treatment systems, a sedimentation tank and an anaerobic hydrolysis upflow sludge bed reactor (HUSB). The influence of plants (Phragmites australis) in the CWs and their feeding regime (continuous flow or batch flow) on PPCP removal were also monitored. One of the CWs was replicated and operated simultaneously in Barcelona and Leon, Spain, in order to study the effect of environmental conditions on PPCP removal. All systems operated in the open air. The sedimentation tank offered slightly better removal values throughout the experimental period than the HUSB. The presence of P. australis enhanced the removal of salicylic acid, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate, but only in summer (when plants were more active). The use of a batch flow or a continuous flow made very little difference to PPCP removal efficiency. When the two mesocosm replicates were compared, temperature proved to be one of the most determining parameters affecting PPCP elimination, with naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate being removed in SSF-CWs more efficiently at higher temperatures. In general, the most easily removed PPCPs in planted CWs were caffeine (14 +/- 74%-84 +/- 7% in winter, 98 +/- 1%-99 +/- 1% in summer), methyl dihydrojasmonate (28 +/- 21%-63 +/- 17% in winter, 93 +/- 2%-98 +/- 1% in summer) and salicylic acid (0%-97 +/- 4% in winter, 41 +/- 40%-89 +/- 9% in summer), followed by naproxen (0%-41 +/- 16% in winter, 60 +/- 18%-95 +/- 4% in summer) and ibuprofen (0%-47 +/- 26% in winter, 35 +/- 12%-99 +/- 1% in summer). Other substances experimented lower removal efficiencies, like ketoprofen (4 +/- 27%-27 +/- 14% in winter, 0%-37 +/- 32% in summer), diclofenac (0%-22 +/- 22% in winter, 0%-71 +/- 8% in summer), carbamazepine (0%-9 +/- 100% in winter, 0%-58 +/- 21% in summer), galaxolide (0% in winter, 25 +/- 14%-87 +/- 5% in summer) and tonalide (0% in winter, 32 +/- 12%-76 +/- 12% in summer).

AB The removal efficiency of selected emerging pollutants, total (TotCol) and faecal (FecCol) coliforms in surface (SF) and subsurface (SSF) flow constructed wetlands (CWs) was compared. The pilot plant (located in southeastern Mexico) consisted of eight CWs: four with SF and four with SSF. Two cells of each type were planted with Typha sp. and two were left without plant as controls. CWs were fed with water from Sordo river, which receives untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewaters. Water samples from river and outflow from each CW were collected in four sampling campaigns, they were filtered, extracted and analysed by GC/MS. Redox potential (Eh) was measured in all cells. The following pollutants were identified and quantified: Caffeine, CAF; Galaxolide, GAL; Methyl dihydrojasmonate, MDHJ; Linear alkylbenzenes, LAB; Butylated hydroxytoluene, BHT; Surfynol 104, SSURF; Alkylphenols, AP; 4-alkylphenol monoetoxylates, APE; Parsol, PAR. Typical removals of studied compounds were attained with slightly better results in SSFCW. A multiple linear regression analysis considering Eh, time, influent pollutant concentration (C-0) and the presence of plants and filtering media (Fmedia) as independent variables showed that Eh has a significant influence in the removal for almost all the studied compounds with the exception of BHT and AP. C-0 influences removal processes with the exception of coliforms. A significant influence of Fmedia in the BHT and PAR removal is observed, also positive for AP, APE, CAF, LAB and GAL in decreasing order. The effect of plants is positive for PAR (significant), GAL, CAF, BHT and MDHJ. SURF has a distinct behaviour with a negative coefficient for its C-0. For TotCol and FecCol the most significant effects are Eh and time. This may be related to the fact that predation by aerobic microbial communities may be the predominant factor in their removal and the development of these microbial communities with time.

AB The occurrence and seasonal distribution of 14 pharmaceutical substances of different classes were investigated in two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) supplied by the two main Italian rivers, the Po and the Adige (Northern Italy). The therapeutic categories of the selected pharmaceuticals included anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, lipid regulators, diuretics, anti-epileptics, antibiotics and a steroidal hormone. The named compounds were assessed in samples collected from the river water inlet and after each purification stage (sand filtration, ozone treatment, granular active carbon (GAC)). Six of the 14 selected pharmaceuticals were found in all analysed samples, with concentration levels ranging from 1 ng l(-1) for atorvastatin to 69 ng l(-1) for atenolol in the drinking water produced. The granular active carbon stage resulted the most efficient in eliminating the examined chemicals from the water (removal range: 12-95%, average: 68%), while the sand filtration stage resulted the least effective treatment (removal range: 4-37%, average: 13%). The observed differences between winter and summer conditions, in terms of residual concentrations and number of detected analytes, seemed to depend mainly on the quality of the river water supplies. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported data on the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water obtained from the water treatment of these two rivers.

AB Advanced oxidation processes, based on hydroxyl radical chemistry, can be used to successfully destroy chemical contaminants in waters intended for reuse. In determining the effectiveness of these radical oxidative degradations and transformations in water, both reaction rate constants and compound removal efficiencies must be considered. Removal efficiencies are defined as the number of contaminant molecules transformed per 100 hydroxyl radicals reacting. Hydroxyl radical reaction efficiencies have been determined for bisphenol A, caffeine, DEET, and sulfamethazine in different qualities of treated and model laboratory wastewaters. While these four contaminants show similar hydroxyl radical reaction rate constants, their removal efficiencies in deionized water varied significantly at 76 +/- 7, 92 +/- 8, 95 +/- 9, and 56 +/- 7%, respectively. Model wastewater studies showed that dissolved oxygen did not appreciably influence these values, and low levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) reduced the removal efficiencies by an average of approximately 20%. However, the combination of solution alkalinity and DOM had a significant impact in reducing hydroxyl radical reaction efficiencies, although not always in a linear, additive, fashion. These results imply that the effective implementation of advanced oxidation technologies in wastewater treatments might be enhanced by prior removal of organics or alkalinity.

AB The present investigation was aimed at determining the impact of the macrolide antibiotic Tylosin in reduced HRT at constant organic loading rate (OLR) by varying feed substrate concentration in an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR). The antibiotic concentration was maintained at 200 mg.L-1, at constant OLR of. 1.88 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1), by varying feed substrate concentration to the UASR and the HRT was decreased gradually from 4 to 1 d. Throughout the operation period, brewery wastewater was used as simple feed substrate to elevate the concentration of easily biodegradable carbon in comparison with the concentrations of more recalcitrant Tylosin substrate. The reactor alkalinity was controlled in all the stages of UASR by adding 1000 2000 mg.L-1 CaCO3. Results showed the total COD removal efficiency at 4 d HRT was around 92%, after which point there was a slight decrease at 3 and 2 d HRT (average 82%), and this was reduced further (average 77%) at a HRT of 1 d. The UASR showed stable operation with effluent volatile fatty acid (VFA) less than 300 mg.L-1 throughout the experimental period (HRT 4 - 1 d). Moreover, the average methane yield (CH4.kg COW) showed a relatively constant profile and was largely unaffected by HRT in all the stages of UASR. These results show that bacteria were readily adapted to wastewater containing Tylosin at lower HRTs and did not affect the reactor performance substantially.

AB Using HPLC method with DAD detection for the simultaneous determination of 15 pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups in surface water and wastewater was proposed. The determined drugs included the analgesic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) paracetamol (PAR), metamizole (MTZ), aspirin (ASP), salicylic acid (SAL), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET), diclofenac (DIC), and naproxen (NAP); the corticosteroids dexamethasone (DEX) and prednisolone (PRE); the beta-blockers carvedilol (CAR), metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), and sotalol (SOT); and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBM). Three solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns were examined for the pre-concentration of water samples: the Oasis HLB, NEXUS and Bond Elut ENV The concentration level for which each method was validated in spiked water samples was 0.2 mu g/L. The Oasis HLB column yielded the best recovery efficiency. Different HPLC columns were examined to achieve the best separations with the shortest possible time. The best column, C(30) and was used for the determination of drugs from water samples.. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of water samples, mostly from rivers, and can be used for screening as a rapid and low-cost analytical tool. However, to confirm the positive findings MS techniques should be applied.

AB Treated sewage effluent (TSE) is becoming a critical resource in arid parts of the world. The high costs of desalinated potable water and the depletion of fresh groundwater resources necessitate increased use of TSE as an important component of water resource management throughout the Middle East. TSE can replace potable-quality water in irrigation, with the latter becoming too valuable a resource to use for irrigation purposes. In urban regions of the Middle East and North Africa, excess TSE is often available because of seasonal variations in demand and supply or that the development of reuse infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, concomitant water use and TSE generation. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology provides an opportunity to store large volumes of TSE for later beneficial use. Natural attenuation processes that occur during underground storage in an ASR system can also act to improve the quality of stored water and thus provide an opportunity to 'polish' already high-quality TSE. Aquifers containing brackish water or those depleted from over-pumping are present throughout much of the Middle East. These aquifers could potentially be used as storage zones for ASR systems. However, currently available hydrogeologic data are insufficient for assessment of potential system performance. Other key design issues are the selection of ASR system locations and storage zones so that TSE will not enter potable water supplies, and ensuring that the ASR systems will be readily integrated into existing or planned sewage treatment, TSE transmission and reuse infrastructure.

AB Gammarus spp. and Fucus vesiculosus from the Baltic Sea littoral community were exposed to 3 concentrations of the pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and propranolol. Both physiological and behavioural parameters were measured to examine potential effects in the organisms. For Gammarus spp., respiration, feeding rate and activity with and without predator cues were measured, and gross production to respiration ratio (GP/R) and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured for F. vesiculosus. The results showed that propranolol decreased the activity related to movement, and Gammarus spp. could not compensate for the reduced movement when subjected to predator cues. The feeding rates of Gammarus spp. exposed to propranolol were more than 2 times higher at all concentrations compared to the control. Ibuprofen did not significantly affect any of the measured parameters of Gammarus spp. The GP/R was lower in algae exposed to propranolol. The effects of propranolol on both behaviour and physiology of Gammarus spp., in combination with the stress responses in the algae, might cause unexpected indirect and cascade effects which eventually could have implications at both community and ecosystem scales.

AB The environmental fate and persistence of steroidal estrogens is influenced by their photodegradation. This can potentially occur both in the presence of the ultraviolet (UV) portion of solar radiation and in tertiary wastewater treatment plants that use UV radiation for disinfection purposes. To determine patterns of UV photodegradation for estrone (E1) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), water samples containing these compounds were exposed to levels of UVB radiation that would simulate exposure to ambient sunlight. E1 degraded with a pseudo-first-order rate law constant that was directly proportional to UVB radiation intensity (R-2 = 0.999, P < 0.001) and inversely proportional to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (R-2 = 0.812, P = 0.037). DOC acted as a competitive inhibitor to direct photolysis of E1 by UV. In contrast to E1, EE2 was more persistent under similar UVB treatment. A reporter gene assay showed that the estrogenicity of UVB-exposed estrogens did not decrease relative to non-UVB-exposed estrogens, suggesting that some of the photoproducts may also have estrogenic potency. These results show that environmental degradation rates of steroidal estrogens are predictable from the UV intensity reaching surface waters, and the DOC concentrations in these surface waters.

AB The purpose of this study was to treat complex wastewater consisting of domestic wastewater, tobacco processing and building materials washings. The proposed multi-level bioreactor consists of a biopond-biofilter, anoxic/aerobic (A/O) fluidized beds and a photoautotrophic system. The results show that when the hydraulic load of the bioreactor was 200m(3)/d, it successfully and simultaneously removed the organic matter and metals. When the bioreactor was in a relatively steady-state condition, the overall average organic matter and metals removal efficiencies are as follows, COD (89%), UV245 nm-matter (91%), Cu (78%), Zn (79%) and Fe (84%). The growth conditions of the native bacterial habitat were improved, which resulted from the increase of the in bacterial diversity under the rejuvenated conditions induced by the bioreactor. The results demonstrate that the multi-level bioreactor, without a sludge treatment system, can remove heterogeneous organic matter and metals from wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical substances are synthetic compounds with very widespread usage due to their therapeutic biological effects. These compounds and their bioactive metabolites are continually introduced into the aquatic environment as complex mixtures via sewage treatment plants (incomplete destruction), animal farms or leaching from landfills. In this study, an analytical procedure involving solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed to determine pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine, diclofenac, ketoprofen and ibuprofen) in aqueous samples (wastewater and surface water). The results demonstrated the suitability of the method at trace levels (ng . L-1) for multi-residue analysis of different types of water matrices.

AB Twenty-four pharmaceuticals were measured in wastewater from 12 municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs), four livestock WWTPs (L-WWTPs), four hospital WWTPs (H-WWTPs) and four pharmaceutical manufacture WWTPs (P-WWTPs). The total concentration of pharmaceuticals in the influent samples was highest in the L-WWTPs followed by the P-WWTPs, H-WWTPs and M-WWTPs. The effluents had different patterns of pharmaceuticals than their corresponding influents because of the different fate of each compound in the WWTPs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most dominant in the influents from the M-WWTPs and P-WWTPs, while antibiotics were dominantly detected in the L-WWTP. In the H-WWTP influents, NSAIDs, caffeine and carbamazepine were dominant. In the P-WWTPs, the distribution of pharmaceuticals in the effluents varied with sampling sites and periods. The M-WWTP influents had the highest daily loads, while the effluents showed somewhat similar levels in all source types. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The transport and fate of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated in the Dan Region Reclamation Project (SHAFDAN), Tel-Aviv, Israel. Soil samples were taken from seven subsections of soil profiles (150 cm) in infiltration basins of a soil aquifer treatment (SAT) system. The transport characteristics were studied from the release dynamics of soil-resident CBZ and, subsequently, from applying a pulse input of wastewater containing CBZ. In addition, a monitoring study was performed to evaluate the fate of CBZ after the SAT. Results of this study indicate adsorption, and consequently retardation, in CBZ transport through the top soil layer (0-5 cm) and to a lesser extent in the second layer (525 cm), but not in deeper soil layers (25-150 cm). The soluble and adsorbed fractions of CBZ obtained from the two upper soil layers comprised 45% of the total CBZ content in the entire soil profile. This behavior correlated to the higher organic matter content observed in the upper soil layers (0-25 cm). It is therefore deduced that when accounting for the full flow path of CBZ through the vadose zone to the groundwater region, the overall transport of CBZ in the SAT system is essentially conservative. The monitoring study revealed that the average concentration of CBZ decreased from 1094 +/- 166 ng L-1 in the recharged wastewater to 560 +/- 175 ng L-1 after the SAT. This reduction is explained by dilution of the recharged wastewater with resident groundwater, which may occur as it flows to active reclamation wells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced oxidation technologies such as ozonation have been proposed to improve removal efficiency of micropollutants during wastewater treatment. In a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature, we found no ecotoxicological effects of wastewater ozonation on invertebrates (n = 82), but significant adverse effects on bacteria (n = 24) and fish (n = 5). As information on functional endpoints or trophic interactions is lacking, we applied a bioassay relating to leaf litter decomposition to fill this gap. Leaf discs exposed to ozone-treated wastewater with a high (1.04 mg O(3) (mg DOC)(-1), n = 49) ozone concentration were significantly preferred by an aquatic detritivore, Gammarus fossarum, over discs conditioned in wastewater not treated with ozone. This effect might have been mediated by reduced bacterial and elevated fungal biomass, and appears to be the first demonstration of wastewater ozonation impacts on invertebrates and an associated ecosystem process. In accordance with the food-choice trials, chemical analyses revealed significantly decreased concentrations of organic micropollutants in wastewater treated with ozone at high concentrations. Thus, food-choice trials as applied here hold promise to assess environmental effects of advanced oxidation technologies in wastewater treatment and appear to be a valuable complement to the ecotoxicological toolbox in general.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are commonly found in wastewater influent. However, little research has focused on determining their impact on fundamental processes in wastewater treatment such as nitrogen removal. In this study, focus was placed on 4 commonly occurring PhACs (ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil). Their effect was ascertained in the ammonia oxidizing bacterium (AOB), Nitrosomonas europaea in terms of membrane integrity and nitrite production. These PhACs were shown to inhibit nitrite production at concentrations of 1 and 10 mu M while no effect was observed at 0.1 mu M. The maximum observed nitrification inhibition was 25%, 29%, 22% and 26% for ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, respectively. A decrease in the live/dead ratio ranging from 10% to 16% suggests that these PhACs affect membrane integrity in N. europaea. The difference in nitrite production between PhACs treated cells and non PhAC treated controls was still significant following washing suggesting that inhibition is irreversible. Finally, nitrite production when adjusted to the live fraction of cells was also found to decrease suggesting that PhACs inhibited the activity of surviving cells. These results suggest that the presence of PhACs may affect AOB activity and may impact nitrogen removal, a key function in wastewater treatment. Follow up studies with additional AOB and in mixed culture are needed to further confirm these results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of sewage-borne micro contaminants in environmental waters is directly related to the discharge of treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the flow rate of the receiving river waters. Mediterranean rivers, in particular, are characterized by important fluctuations in the flow rates and heavy pollution pressures resulting from extensive urban, industrial and agricultural activities. This translates into contamination levels in these rivers often higher than those in other larger European basins. The present work provides an overview of the occurrence of five groups of organic contaminants (131 compounds) namely pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, polar pesticides, estrogens, alkylphenols and related ethoxylates in WWTP tertiary treatment effluents. Data gathered during a period of water reuse carried out in the lower stretch of the Llobregat river (NE Spain), in the surroundings of the town of Barcelona as a consequence of the severe drought that took place along the years 2007-2008 are presented as illustrative example. In general, measured concentrations of the target compounds were in the low to mid ng L-1 range. The total concentration of each compound class downstream to the discharge point was similar or slightly higher than that found upstream. Regarding the loads calculated for each compound, the relative contribution from the river upstream and the tertiary effluent were highly compound depending with no apparent trend. However, estimation of the overall bulk loads for each compound class determined in the Llobregat river showed the following rank order: pharmaceuticals > alkylphenols > pesticides > illicit drugs >> estrogens.

AB Phenolic compounds exist widely in the influents and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and most are un-regulated. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 50 phenolic compounds in wastewater was developed. Deconvolution technology was used to identify contaminants that are covered by co-extracted materials. A mass spectral library containing all 50 silylated phenolic compounds was first established and used for deconvolution. Twelve typical phenolic compounds were selected to optimize the sample preparation procedures. Solid-phase extraction using a C18 cartridge coupled with an HLB cartridge was used for pre-concentration and dichloromethane was used for elution. The solutes were derivatized and analyzed by GC-MS. The blank and matrix spike recoveries ranged from 57.46% to 136.4% and 47.87% to 114.8%, respectively. Method detection limits ranged from 3.64 to 97.64 ng L-1. The relative standard deviations of all the recovery experiments were lower than 13.6%. The instrument limits of quantification ranged from 0.7 to 87.7 pg. The method has been applied to analyze the influents and effluents of 5 Chinese STPs. Except for regulated phenolic compounds (phenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol), three un-regulated phenolic compounds, including 2-chlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol were identified in the effluent wastewater. The detected concentrations of un-regulated phenolic compounds could possibly cause environmental effects, indicating that immediate attention is required to prevent complications.

AB Agitated thin-film dryers (ATFDs) are used to produce dry free-flowing powder from slurry/solution-type feed and widely implemented in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. The feed passes through the ATFD in several forms such as solution/slurry and successively becomes paste, wet powder, and dry powder. The flow of feed in the ATFD undergoes a helical path (combination of rotational velocity imparted by the agitator/blade and axial velocity of feed) while flowing through the annular part of the dryer. The ATFD is described stage-wise and the parameters such as physical properties, scraped surface heat transfer coefficient, and evaporation rate (drying rate) are derived using stepwise model equations. The penetration theory is modeled to obtain the scraped-side heat transfer coefficient. The model equations were solved using MATLAB 7 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and the simulated drying rate was consequently validated with the experimental values.

The estrogenic compounds 4-t-OP, 4-NP, BPA, El, E2 and TCS were detected in most of the samples, with their concentrations up to 52.1 2065.7, 755.6, 55.8, 7.4 and 81.3 ng/L in water, and up to 8.6, 558.4, 33.8, 7.9, <LOQ and 33.9 ng/g in sediment, respectively. However, DES and EE2 were not detected in the Liao River. The estrogen equivalents (EEQ) of the water and sediment samples were also measured by the bioassay. High estrogenic risks to aquatic organisms were found in the river sections of metropolitan areas and the lower reach of the river system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change scenarios predict lower flow rates during summer that may lead to higher proportions of wastewater in small and medium sized streams. Moreover, micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals and other contaminants) continuously enter aquatic environments via treated wastewater. However, there is a paucity of knowledge, whether extended exposure to secondary treated wastewater disrupts important ecosystem functions, e.g. leaf breakdown. Therefore, the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum was exposed to natural stream water (n = 34) and secondary treated wastewater (n = 32) for four weeks in a semi-static test system under laboratory conditions. G. fossarum exposed to wastewater showed significant reductions in feeding rate (25%), absolute consumption (35%), food assimilation (50%), dry weight (18%) and lipid content (22%). Thus, high proportions of wastewater in the stream flow may affect both the breakdown rates of leaf material and thus the availability of energy for the aquatic food web as well as the energy budget of G. fossarum.

AB In the present work we fractioned the effluent water from an urban sewage treatment plant (USTP) of Ribarroja (Valencia, Spain) using the conventional protocol based on DAX8 and XAD4 resins. The fractions were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H-NMR, COSY-NMR, HSQC-NMR, FAB+-MS and also by derivatization with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 10% of trimethylchlorosilane. The four fractions obtained have common spectroscopic features and individual compounds indicating that the fractioning procedure is inefficient at separating different families of compounds. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the derivatized fractions allowed identification of many individual compounds. The main classes of organic compounds present in the effluent are saccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, hydroxyacids, aromatic compounds and steroids. Also we were able to identify in the effluent the emerging pollutants paracetamol and ketoprofen - two best-selling anti-inflammatory drugs used in humans.

AB Clofibric acid (CA), a metabolite of lipid regulators, was investigated in ultra-pure water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent at 10 degrees C under UV, vacuum UV (VUV), UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2 processes. The influences of NO3-, HCO3- and humic acid (HA) on CA photolysis in all processes were examined. The results showed that all the experimental data well fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the apparent rate constant (k(ap)) and half-life time (t(1/2)) were calculated accordingly. Direct photolysis of CA through UV irradiation was the main process, compared with the indirect oxidation of CA due to the slight generation of hydroxyl radicals dissociated from water molecules under UV irradiation below 200 nm monochromatic wavelength emission. In contrast, indirect oxidation was the main CA degradation mechanism in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2, and VUV/H2O2 was the most effective process for CA degradation. The addition of 20 mg L-1 HA could significantly inhibit CA degradation, whereas, except for UV irradiation, the inhibitive effects of NO3- and HCO3- (1.0 x 10(-3) and 0.1 mol L-1, respectively) on CA degradation were observed in all processes, and their adverse effects were more significant in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2 processes, particularly at the high NO3- and HCO3- concentrations. The degradation rate decreased 1.8-4.9-fold when these processes were applied to a real STP effluent owing to the presence of complex constituents. Of the four processes, VUV/H2O2 was the most effective, and the CA removal efficiency reached over 99% after 40 min in contrast to 80 min in both the UV/H2O2 and VUV processes and 240 min in the UV process.

AB This study presents the ultrasound mediated reduction of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) into non-toxic trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) using sludge obtained during the electrocoagulation of pharmaceutical wastewater (EC sludge). Experiments were carried out with and without ultrasound to explore its influence. The effect of initial concentration of Cr(VI) (100-200 mg/l), pH (6-8) and EC sludge dosage (5-10 g/l) on Cr(VI) reduction was studied. The morphological and functional group changes of EC sludge due to Cr(VI) reduction were analysed with scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared, respectively. The reduction rates observed in the presence of ultrasound were found to be higher than the rates observed for without ultrasound. The results concluded that the EC sludge can be successfully used for reduction of Cr(VI) at lower cost.

AB We present an environmental risk assessment of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs citalopram sertraline and fluoxetine) in the aquatic environment based on two case scenarios Abionc and biotic degradation experiments and sorption estimates were used to predict environmental concentrations of three SSRIs from the wastewater of two psychiatric hospitals the primary sector and wastewater entering and leaving wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) Assuming a sewage treatment retention time of 8 h abiotic degradation was low for all three SSRIs inhibitors ranging between 0 and 2% for hydrolysis and 0 and 6% for photolysis The biodegradation was also slow ranging from 0 to 3% within an 8 h period In untreated sewage citalopram (CIT) and sertraline (SER) concentrations may be high enough to exert effects on the aquatic biota (CIT 0 19-10 3 mu g/L SER 0 14-17 1 mu g/L) Removal of the pharmaceuticals is due primarily to sorption in the WWTP Sertraline was estimated to have the highest concentrations in the sewage effluents 4 4 and 19 9 ng/L for the two cases respectively In treated wastewater individual SSRI concentrations are probably too low to exert effects on biota By using concentration addition a cocktail exposure scenario was estimated The predicted concentration in the biota calculated from the cocktail effect was 0 05 and 0 16 nmol/g for the two cases respectively and SER was found to give the highest contribution to this cocktail effect The results indicate that the concentrations in the wastewater effluents are one to two orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations likely to cause an effect in the aquatic biota Environ Toxicol Chem 2011 30 254-261 (C) 2010 SETAC

AB Paper mills generate varieties of pollutants depending upon the type of the production process. Raw and biologically treated effluents from two paper mills with different production processes and different biological treatment plants were analysed by COD, BOD5, AOX as well as by phthalates, bisphenol A, and nonylphenol which are potential endocrine disrupting compounds. Removal efficiency of aerobic and combined aerobic/anaerobic wastewater treatment plants were studied for investigated compounds. The results indicated that dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bisphenol A, and nonylphenol were present in raw and biologically treated paper mill effluents. The removal efficiencies of aerobic and combined aerobicanaerobic biological wastewater treatment plants were 87% and 87% for dimethyl phthalate, 79% and 91% for diethyl phthalate, 73% and 88% for dibutyl phthalate, 84% and 78% for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 86% and 76% for benzyl butyl phthalate, 74% and 79% for bisphenol A, and 71% and 81% for nonylphenol, respectively. Despite relative high removal efficiency of biological wastewater treatment plants for investigated compounds, the concentrations of nonylphenol in treated paper mill effluents exceeded limits of 0.3 mu g/L according to Directive (2008/105/EC).

AB A lab-scale anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor (A/O-MBR) was operated for selected antibiotics tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadiazine (SDZ) and ampicillin (AMP) removal in the wastewater. The effects of solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on antibiotics removal were studied, experiment results showed that almost upper 80% of-antibiotics were removed at any SRT and HRT investigated during the whole A/O-MBR process. The reduction of SRT in phase 3 and 4 decreased selected antibiotics removal efficiency. Further studies showed that at short SRT, the change of HRT usually led to fluctuation of the antibiotics removal efficiencies due to the loading alternation. Meanwhile, batch experiments were performed to investigate antibiotics sorption and biodegradation by activated sludge. No evidence of biodegradation for TC, CTC and OTC was observed during the biodegradability tests, and adsorption was found to be the principal removal mechanism of tetracyclines by activated sludge, and adsorption and biodegradation for AMP. The outcomes of the present study demonstrated that the antibiotics SMX, SDZ, and AMP have the possibilities to be degraded biologically during wastewater treatment after an acclimatization of sludge.

AB The elimination of 11 selected emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, metoprolol, caffeine, antipyrine, sulfamethoxazole, flumequine, ketorolac, atrazine, isoproturon, 2-hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac) has been investigated by means of ultrafiltration membranes in a cross-flow equipment that operated in continuous regime. Two different aqueous systems were used for dissolving the selected pollutants: ultrapure water and a secondary effluent generated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The influence of the MWCO of the membranes, and the nature of the water matrix on the permeate flux was established, and the rejection coefficients of the selected compounds were determined. Additionally, in the UF of the secondary effluent, rejection coefficients of several quality parameters (turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and absorbance at 254 nm) were also evaluated. In order to enhance the efficiency of the single UF process, three different combined processes were also tested: two pre-treatments consisting in coagulation (by using aluminum sulfate) and adsorption (by using powdered active carbon) stages followed by the UF stage; and adsorption post-treatment (by using granular active carbon) that was conducted to the permeate of the UF stage. The improvements in the elimination of the selected compounds and the quality pollutant parameters were established and discussed.

AB A method for the analysis of the artificial sweetener sucralose in sewage water and recipient water was developed. Extraction and clean up was performed with solid-phase extraction utilising Oasis HLB columns. Detection was made by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. However, 'pseudo MRM' was used, a technique where the two quadrupoles monitor the same m/z. The sodium adduct of sucralose was used for quantification, since lower detection limits were obtained as compared to the sucralose quasi-molecular ion in negative ion mode. The two ions with highest intensity in the chlorine isotope pattern were monitored. The reduction of matrix effects with this approach is discussed. The method limit of quantification (MLOQ) for sewage water was 0.2 mu g L-1, whereas for recipient water MLOQ was 0.02 mu g L-1. The method was used to analyse effluent samples from an experimental sewage treatment plant (STP) to assess the efficiency of tertiary treatment techniques for removal of sucralose. Filtration through activated carbon was shown to be efficient, while ozonation, advanced oxidation techniques and membrane bioreactors were less efficient. Analyses of receiving waters showed low dilution of sucralose emitted from the STPs.

AB A multi-residue method for the extraction and clean-up of sediment samples was developed for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues. Sediment samples were collected in the proximity of sewage water plant in Stockholm, Sweden. Target analytes were the basic beta-blocker propranolol, the neutral neuroleptic carbamazepine and the acidic anticoagulant warfarin, the painkiller diclofenac and the lipid regulator gemfibrozil. The extraction solvent was optimised with regard to pH and organic modifer. Extraction and clean up were performed with liquid-liquid extraction and ultra-sonication followed by solid-phase extraction. One extraction solvent, containing acetone/McIlvaine buffer pH4, provided satisfactory extraction for all substances. LC/MSMS in the MRM mode was used for determination. The recoveries of the extraction and clean-up steps were 60-75% (+/- 2-8%) and LOQs were in the range 0.4-8 ng/g sediment (dry weight). The pharmaceuticals found in the sediment samples were propranolol and carbamazepine, representing substances with basic and neutral properties. Additionally, the samples were analysed with LC/QTOF for verification with the use of accurate mass measurement in the full-scan mode. Pharmaceuticals not represented in the original method were looked for. Non-target pharmaceuticals found using the LC/QTOF system were the basic beta-blocker metoprolol and the acidic painkiller naproxen.

AB Biosorbents have been recently gaining importance, with an increasing number of publications on their environmental applications, especially for removal of organic pollutants from aqueous media. The aim of this work was to evaluate the sorption capacity of a biosorbent, namely granulated cork, to remove mixtures of ibuprofen (IB), carbamazepine (CB) and clofibric acid (CA) from water and wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained for IB and CB while a less satisfactory performance was observed for CA. Simultaneous removal of the three compounds mixed in the same aqueous solution showed no significant differences in comparison to the removal of the isolated compounds in separate solutions, which indicates that no competitive sorption effects occurred at the highest concentrations tested. On the other hand, in wastewater medium the mixture of pharmaceuticals underwent a decrease in the sorbed amounts of all the three substances, probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter which increases their solubilities. These compounds were removed in the following order of efficiencies in all the tested conditions: IB > CB > CA. The sorption kinetics were characterised by an initial fast step within the first 6 h, during which most of the removed pharmaceuticals amounts were sorbed. After the first 6 h, CA attained equilibrium concentrations whereas the sorption kinetics for IB and CB were characterised by two pseudo-second order stages, the first one up to 48 h and a slower one beyond 48 h. Shorter equilibration times and larger removed amounts of pharmaceuticals per unit weight of sorbent were observed in this study for granulated cork in comparison with a previously studied clay material (LECA). The results of this study showed the sorptive qualities of granulated cork but are only a first step in the evaluation of this material for use as support matrix in constructed wetlands designed for removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters.

AB A reliable and robust analytical method based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detector was developed for the simultaneous determination of five cephalosporin antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Cefradine, Cefaclor, Cefotaxime and Cefoperazone) in various water samples. Under optimised conditions, it was applicable to preconcentrate up to 500 ml of water samples in the OASIS HLB cartridges with reasonable recoveries for all the cephalosporin antibiotics tested. Recoveries were as follows: deionised water, tap water and groundwater, between 84.2 and 98.9%; surface water, between 71.2 and 81.0%; influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), between 56.9 and 72.1%. The method detection limits (MDLs) for different water samples were in the range of 26 to 59 ng l(-1). Real water samples were analysed using the proposed approach to demonstrate the applicability and validation. Negative results were obtained for the tap water and groundwater. However, all the selected cephalosporin antibiotics were identified in the influent and effluent of a local WWTP at ng l(-1)-mu g l(-1) level. In addition, Ceftazidime was found in surface water with a concentration of 0.75-2.60 mu g l(-1). The results indicate that the 'pseudo-persistent' contamination of cephalosporin antibiotics in the water environment could not be neglected.

AB Urban water supplies are traditionally based on limited freshwater resources located outside the cities However a range of concepts and techniques to exploit alternative water resources has gained ground as water demands begin to exceed the freshwater available to cities Based on 113 cases and 15 in-depth case studies solutions used to increase water self-sufficiency in urban areas are analyzed The main drivers for increased self-sufficiency were identified to be direct and indirect lack of water constrained infrastructure high quality water demands and commercial and institutional pressures Case studies demonstrate increases in self-sufficiency ratios to as much as 80% with contributions from recycled water seawater desalination and rainwater collection The introduction of alternative water resources raises several challenges energy requirements vary by more than a factor of ten amongst the alternative techniques wastewater reclamation can lead to the appearance of trace contaminants in drinking water and changes to the drinking water system can meet tough resistance from the public Public water-supply managers aim to achieve a high level of reliability and stability We conclude that despite the challenges self-sufficiency concepts in combination with conventional water resources are already helping to reach this goal (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Broad scale monitoring of estrogenic compounds was performed at 19 sampling points throughout the Yeongsan and Seomjin river basins and 5 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) adjacent to the Gwangju area, Korea, from December 2005 to August 2007. The concentrations of estrogenic compounds, including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol-A, nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (OP), in the samples was measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the estrogenic activities throughout the river were investigated using the E-screen assay. Of the six estrogenic chemicals, NP (114.6-336.1 ng L-1) and EE2 (0.23-1.90 ng L-1) were detected at the highest and lowest levels, respectively in both the river waters and the WWTP effluents. Bisphenol-A showed the largest concentration range, from 7.5 to 335 ng L-1. The concentrations of E1, E2 and octylphenol ranges were 3.6-69.1, 1.2-10.7, and 2.2-16.9 ng L-1, respectively. According to the calculated estradiol equivalent concentration (EEQ); however, no estrogenic contribution was observed due to the phenolic compounds in the river waters and effluents. E1 and E2 dominated in both the river water and effluent samples, with contributions to the calculated EEQ of over 79 and 77%, respectively. Conversely, EE2 was rarely detected in the river waters (21%) and effluents (0%). The largest contribution of EE2 to the calculated EEQ was 21% in the river water at S-7. The levels of E1, E2, and EE2 were remarkably decreased in the effluents, indicating that the 5 WWTPs did not contribute to the estrogenic effect of the receiving streams. Overall, the WWTPs did not contributed to the estrogenic activity of the receiving waters, but the livestock industry or wildlife may play an important role in the estrogenic contribution to river water.

AB The occurrence and fate of eight pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) during sewage treatment has been studied in a pilot-scale treatment plant, comprising a primary settler (2.85 m(3)), an aeration tank (1.845 m(3)) and a secondary clarifier (0.5 m(3)), placed on site at a wastewater treatment works in the north west of the UK. It was fed both with raw sewage and the return liquor produced after sludge centrifugation, thus representing the most common configuration for a municipal sewage treatment plant based on the activated sludge process. Samples were taken at six different locations, including the return liquor stream, and analysed for musk fragrances and pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to various therapeutic groups such as anti-inflammatory drugs, tranquillisers and antiepileptics. Mass balances were conducted for those PPCPs that were quantifiable. The fate of the PPCPs was found to differ according to their physical-chemical characteristics. Anti-inflammatories underwent a degradation process and were almost completely removed from sewage during the biological treatment step. Musk fragrances were only partially removed, through adsorption onto the primary suspended solids and the biomass in the aerobic process, due to their strong lipophilic characteristics. The results of this study provide increasing evidence that the partial removal of these substances through the sewage treatment process contribute to the environmental occurrence of PPCPs. Consequently, existing STPs should be upgraded in order to attenuate the release of these substances into the aquatic environment.

AB The distribution and occurrence of 15 antibiotics in surface water of the Pearl River System (Liuxi River, Shijing River and Zhujiang River) and effluents of four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated in two sampling events representing wet season and dry season by using rapid resolution liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) in positive ionization mode. Only eight antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, roxithromycin, erythromycin-H2O and norfloxacin) were detected in the water samples of the three rivers and the effluents. The detection frequencies and levels of antibiotics in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season. This could be attributed to the dilution effects in the wet season and relatively lower temperature in the dry season under which antibiotics could persist for a longer period. The levels of the detected antibiotics in different sites are generally in a decreasing order as follows: Shijing River >= WWTP effluent >= Zhujiang River >= Liuxi River. Risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotients showed that only erythromycin-H2O and roxithromycin detected in the Pearl Rivers might have adverse effects on aquatic organisms.

ID WASTE-WATER; RETENTION; ANTIBIOTICS; REJECTION
AB This study explored the removal of five veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) (sulfamethoxazole (SMETOX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), dexamethasone (DEXA) and febantel (FEBA)) from different water matrices (Milli-Q water, model water, tap water and real pharmaceutical wastewater using four types of nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NF90, NF270, NF and HL) and two reverse osmosis (RO) membranes (LFC-1 and XLE). All VPs were added to different water matrices at a concentration of 10 mg/L. Rejections of VPs and water flux were measured. The rejection increased with increase of molecular weight. The highest rejections were obtained with RO membranes (LFC-1, XLE) and tight NF (NF90) membrane. In general, the rejection of VPs was higher in model water and tap water than in Milli-Q water, but the water flux was lower. This was mainly explained by ion adsorption inside the membranes pores. Narrower pore size counteracted the effect of presence of low concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) in tap water. The NOM was assumed to enhance the adsorption of VPs onto membrane surface, increased the size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion also appeared during the transport. Investigated water matrices had influence on water flux decline due to their complexity.

AB This work describes a systematic approach to the development of a method for simultaneous determination of three classes of veterinary antibiotics in the suspended solids (SS) of swine wastewater, including five sulfonamides, three tetracyclines and one macrolide (tiamulin). The entire procedures for sample pretreatment, ultrasonic extraction (USE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantification were examined and optimized. The recovery efficiencies were found to be 76%-104% for sulfonamides, 81%-112% for tetracyclines, and 51%-64% for tiamulin at three spiking levels. The intra-day and inter-day precisions, as expressed by the relative standard deviation (RSD), were below 17%. The method detection limits (MDLs) were between 0.14 and 7.14 mu g/kg, depending on a specific antibiotic studied. The developed method was applied to field samples collected from three concentrated swine feeding plants located in Beijing, Shanghai and Shandong province of China. All the investigated antibiotics were detected in both SS and liquid phase of swine wastewater, with partition coefficients (logK(d)) ranging from 0.49 to 2.30. This study demonstrates that the SS can not be ignored when determining the concentrations of antibiotics in swine wastewater.

AB A single run optimization chromatographic method for the determination of 15 emerging contaminants in surface water was optimized using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection through ultraviolet-diode array (UV-DAD) or fluorescence (FLD). Selected compounds included acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, progesterone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, levonorgestrel, diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, 4-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol and bisphenol A. Quality parameters of the proposed method showed a linearity r(2) > 0.996, coefficient of variation lower than 5%, recoveries between 80 to 120% for a spike of 10 mu g L-1 for each of the 15 compounds. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) was 38 ng L-1 for caffeine, whereas the highest value was 170 ng L-1 for ibuprofen. The method was applied to the spatial and seasonal monitoring of these compounds in the Atibaia River, which is the main drinking water source for Campinas City (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Among the 15 selected emerging contaminants, 10 were detected at least once. The lowest concentration determined was 0.096 mu g L-1 for diclofenac, whereas caffeine showed concentrations as high as 127 mu g L-1.

AB The occurrence of thirty-one selected Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) and Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) was analyzed in eleven major municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) in Seoul, Korea over two consecutive days. The area was selected since there was a lack of information in the Seoul area on the suspected contamination of wastewater effluents by micropollutants. Discharge from those major WWTPs accounted for approximately 25% of the Han River flow where over 99% of drinking water is produced from surface waters in this area that has a population approximately 15 million inhabitants. Samples collected in WWTP effluents were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI). Many target compounds were detected in the effluent samples (66%). Atenolol, iopromide, TCPP, TCEP, musk ketone, naproxen, DEET, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and benzophenone were frequently detected in effluent samples with mean concentrations ranging from 98 to 663 ng/L (maximum = 230-1,700 ng/L). However, the steroid hormones (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone), atrazine (herbicide), and octylphenol (surfactant) were not detected in all the samples. Results of this study can provide evidence that WWTP effluent is one of the major sources contaminating the Han River.

AB A useful source tracking approach that has emerged over the past few years involves detection of human-specific chemicals found in wastewaters and septage. Chemicals specific to human wastewaters offer some potential advantages over biologically based methods: they are generally faster to prepare and analyze; they are more source-specific because they are not confounded by regrowth in the environment; and chemicals may be more geographically and temporally stable. However, chemicals have received less scrutiny to date, often require specialized equipment, and sample processing is usually more expensive. Additionally, many chemicals specific to human waste streams may occur at concentrations low enough to be diluted below detection limits once the waste stream enters the ambient environment. This chapter describes the different classes of wastewater chemicals and explores the advantages, disadvantages of each as potential source tracking candidates. While no single chemical has emerged as the best, there are several viable candidates for source tracking applications. For initial water sample screenings, optical brighteners (OBs) in detergents have shown considerable promise. Although not as sensitive as most microbial assessments, OBs can be measured with a handheld fluorometer, providing near real-time and relatively inexpensive tracking of signals in the field if the sample contains an OB concentration large enough to produce a measurable signal. Fecal sterols and stanols have been found to work best for source attribution, correlating with fecal indicator bacteria and providing discrimination between humans and several other fecal sources.

AB The pharmaceutical industry produces carbon-rich liquid wastes which have been generally qualified as hazardous. A significant proportion of these carbon-rich wastes are currently sent for incineration, although they could be utilised. It was found that the majority of the liquid wastes investigated in this study could be used in biological N-removal as carbon sources for denitrification in domestic wastewater treatment, or for anaerobic biogas production. The volatile content could be separated and the solvents re-utilised, the residual toxic organic compounds could be decomposed by wet oxidation and subsequently sent for biological treatment.

AB CWO and WO were carried out for oxidizing different industrial wastewaters of pharmaceutical production, at 230 degrees C and 250 degrees C and total pressure of 50 bar, with oxygen, in stainless steel autoclaves. The catalysts were titania supported precious metal (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) oxides and copper sulfate. Samples were analyzed with respect to their TOC, COD (BOD) content. The tested wastewaters, some of them mother liquors, could be oxidized, but with rather different conversions. Even at the hard-to-oxidize wastewater the COD decrease hit the 50 % during 4 hours, this procedure decreased the COD/BOD ratio. The Ru oxide-titania catalyst proved to be the most active in this process, yet in the non-catalytic reactions significant conversion was detected also, due to the Fe or Cu ion content of the wastewaters.

AB This work provides physicochemical solutions for the treatment of process wastewaters of fine chemical industries, that is, pharmaceutical industry. Economical methods are recommended for practical use, which can reduce the disposal ratio of the process wastewaters with higher values of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Adsorbable Organically Bound Halogens (AOX) than the corresponding emission limits. Such treatment alternatives are also the part of environmental sustainability.
   The work reviews the theoretical background of the problem and gives options for using the waste management hierarchy chart. Then the general features of pharmaceutical process wastewaters and the treatment methods are summarized. In the algorithm developed for process wastewater treatment, the distillation is the core of the physicochemical treatment alternatives. In the case of the real industrial case studies, the distillation and membrane filtration laboratory experiments and cost calculations prove the efficiency of the selected physicochemical treatment options.

AB Spreading of urban wastewater on agricultural land may lead to concomitant input of organic and inorganic pollutants. Such multiple pollution sites offer unique opportunities to study the fate of both heavy metals and pharmaceuticals. We examined the occurrence and fate of selected antibiotics in sandy-textured soils, sampled four years after cessation of 100 years irrigation with urban wastewater from the Paris agglomeration. Previous studies on heavy metal contamination of these soils guided our sampling strategy. Six antibiotics were studied, including quinolones, with a strong affinity for organic and mineral soil components, and sulfonamides, a group of more mobile molecules. Bulk samples were collected from surface horizons in different irrigation fields, but also in subsurface horizons in two selected profiles. In surface horizons, three quinolones (oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, and flumequine) were present in eight samples out of nine. Their contents varied spatially, but were well-correlated one to another. Their distributions showed great similarities regarding spatial distribution of total organic carbon and heavy metal contents, consistent with a common origin by wastewater irrigation. Highest concentrations were observed for sampling sites close to irrigation water outlets, reaching 22 mu g kg(-1) for nalidixic acid. Within soil profiles, the two antibiotic groups demonstrated an opposite behavior: quinolones, found only in surface horizons; sulfamethoxazole, detected in clay-rich subsurface horizons, concomitant with Zn accumulation. Such distribution patterns are consistent with chemical adsorption properties of the two antibiotic groups: immobilization of quinolones in the surface horizons ascribed to strong affinity for organic matter (OM), migration of sulfamethoxazole due to a lower affinity for OM and its interception and retention in electronegative charged clay-rich horizons. Our work suggests that antibiotics may represent a durable contamination of soils, and risks for groundwater contamination, depending on the physicochemical characteristics both of the organic molecules and of soil constituents.

AB In our modern society, there are thousands of organic chemicals in common use. These chemicals reach estuarine and coastal systems through a number of pathways, depending on their life cycle: extraction, manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. The most significant classes include crude oil and its many derivatives, halogenated hydrocarbons, pesticides, and personal care and pharmaceutical products. Although some of these compounds are easily degradable, others require specific conditions for significant degradability; this is usually enhanced by microbes and other biota that can biodegrade them. Many of the compounds enter the aqueous environment via nonpoint sources (e.g., agricultural or urban storm water runoff), but a number of them are discharged from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants, which were not designed to deal with the ever-increasing diversity of organic compounds that pass through their treatment units. These discharges may be either directly to the estuaries or to coastal areas; but, in many cases, the discharge is into freshwater bodies (e.g., rivers and lakes) that then discharge into the ocean margins. The toxicity of some of these compounds has been known for decades; however, in other cases, it has taken considerable effort, both on the analytical side and on the toxicological assays, to determine that even at extremely low concentrations these compounds will cause harm. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the major classes of biodegradable organic compounds that may be discharged into estuaries and coastal water from a variety of sources. We then consider the key processes and compound properties that determine their mobility, bioavailability, persistence, and fate in the estuarine environment. We conclude with an assessment of the biotic and habitat impacts that can result from these biodegradable organic compounds.

AB Ultrasonic irradiation is a promising technique for the degradation of persistent organic molecules such as pharmaceuticals in wastewater. This paper focuses on the sonolytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. During a first experiment at 25 C and 544 kHz, the degradation of a 15 mg L-1 CIP-solution showed a pseudo-first order degradation constant k(1) equal to 0.0067 +/- 0.0001 min(-1) (n = 3). Experiments with the addition of t-butanol as a radical scavenger showed that reaction with OH radicals is the main degradation route for ciprofloxacin. Since the production of OH radicals was the highest at 544 kHz, this was also the most favorable frequency for CIP degradation in comparison with 801 (k(1) = 0.0055 min(-1)) and 1081 kHz (k(1) = 0.0018 min(-1)). The degradation constant is also strongly dependent on the temperature of the bulk solution. The degradation constant increased significantly with increasing temperature from 0.0055 min-1 at 15 C to 0.0105 min-1 at 45 C. According to the Arrhenius law, the apparent activation energy was determined to be 17.5 kJ mol(-1). This suggests that the degradation of CIP is diffusion controlled, as is the case for most radical reactions. A Langmuir-type heterogeneous reaction kinetics model could be used to explain the increasing degradation constant with decreasing initial CIP concentration from 0.0204 min-1 (C-0 = 0.15 mg L-1) to 0.0009 min-1 (C0 = 150 mg L-1). According to the model a local reaction zone exists at the interface region of the cavitation bubbles. During bubble oscillation, molecules accumulate in the reaction zone and when the bubble finally collapses, the molecules in the reaction zone can be oxidized by the formed OH radicals. This means that degradation is limited by the available surface at the interface. The model agreed very well with the experimental data (R-2 = 0.975). The pseudo rate constant for decomposition (k(d)) was estimated to be 0.40 mu M min-1 and the modeled equilibrium constant (K) was equal to 0.047 mu M-1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we evaluated the ecotoxicological potential of the 100 pharmaceuticals expected to occur in highest quantities in the wastewater of a general hospital and a psychiatric center in Switzerland. We related the toxicity data to predicted concentrations in different wastewater streams to assess the overall risk potential for different scenarios, including conventional biological pretreatment in the hospital and urine source separation. The concentrations in wastewater were estimated with pharmaceutical usage information provided by the hospitals and literature data on human excretion into feces and urine. Environmental concentrations in the effluents of the exposure scenarios were predicted by estimating dilution in sewers and with literature data on elimination during wastewater treatment. Effect assessment was performed using quantitative structure-activity relationships because experimental ecotoxicity data were only available for less than 20% of the 100 pharmaceuticals with expected highest loads. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, a correction for the speciation was implemented in the toxicity prediction model.
   The lists of Top-100 pharmaceuticals were distinctly different between the two hospital types with only 37 pharmaceuticals overlapping in both datasets. 31 Pharmaceuticals in the general hospital and 42 pharmaceuticals in the psychiatric center had a risk quotient above 0.01 and thus contributed to the mixture risk quotient. However, together they constituted only 14% (hospital) and 30% (psychiatry) of the load of pharmaceuticals. Hence, medical consumption data alone are insufficient predictors of environmental risk. The risk quotients were dominated by amiodarone, ritonavir, clotrimazole, and diclofenac. Only diclofenac is well researched in ecotoxicology, while amiodarone, ritonavir, and clotrimazole have no or very limited experimental fate or toxicity data available. The presented computational analysis thus helps setting priorities for further testing. Separate treatment of hospital wastewater would reduce the pharmaceutical load of wastewater treatment plants, and the risk from the newly identified priority pharmaceuticals. However, because high-risk pharmaceuticals are excreted mainly with feces, urine source separation is not a viable option for reducing the risk potential from hospital wastewater, while a sorption step could be beneficial.

AB Efficient biological nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical wastewater has been focused recently. The present study dealt with the treatment of colistin sulfate and kitasamycin manufacturing wastewater through anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX). The biotoxicity assay on luminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum (T3 mutation) showed that the pharmaceutical wastewater imparted severe toxicity with a relative luminosity of 3.46% +/- 0.45%. During long-term operation, the cumulative toxicity from toxic pollutants in wastewater resulted in the performance collapse of conventional ANAMMOX process. A novel ANAMMOX process with sequential biocatalyst (ANAMMOX granules) addition (SBA-ANAMMOX process) was developed by combining high-rate ANAMMOX reactor with sequential biocatalyst addition (SBA). At biocatalyst addition rate of 0.025 g VSS (L wastewater)(-1) day(-1), the nitrogen removal rate of the process reached up to 9.4 kg N m(-3) day(-1) in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The effluent ammonium concentration was lower than 50 mg N L-1, which met the Discharge Standard of Water Pollutants for Pharmaceutical Industry in China (GB 21903-2008). The application of SBA-ANAMMOX process in refractory ammonium-rich wastewater is promising. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vacuum collected black (toilet) water contains hormones and pharmaceuticals in relatively high concentrations (mu g/L to mg/L range) and separate specific treatment has the potential of minimizing their discharge to surface waters. In this study, the fate of estrogens (natural and synthetical hormones) and pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, metoprolol, propranolol, cetirizine, doxycycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) in the anaerobic treatment of vacuum collected black water followed by nitrogen removal by partial nitritation-anammox was investigated. A new analytical method was developed to detect the presence of several compounds in the complex matrix of concentrated black water. Detected concentrations in black water ranged from 1.1 mu g/L for carbamazepine to >1000 mu g/L for paracetamol. Anaerobic treatment was only suitable to remove the majority of paracetamol (>90%). Metoprolol was partly removed (67%) during aerobic treatment. Deconjugation could have affected the removal efficiency of ibuprofen as concentrations even increased during anaerobic treatment and only after the anammox treatment 77% of ibuprofen was removed. The presence of persistent micro-pollutants (diclofenac, carbamazepine and cetirizine), which are not susceptible for biodegradation, makes the application of advanced physical and chemical treatment unavoidable.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the direct photodegradation of nitroimidazoles. For this purpose, i) a kinetic study was performed, determining the quantum yield of the process; and ii) the influence of the different operational variables was analyzed (initial concentration of antibiotic, pH, presence of natural organic matter compounds, and chemical composition of water), and the time course of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and toxicity during nitroimidazole photodegradation was studied. The very low quantum yields obtained for the four nitroimidazoles are responsible for the low efficacy of the quantum process during direct photon absorption in nitroimidazole phototransformation. The R-254 values obtained show that the dose habitually used for water disinfection is not sufficient to remove this type of pharmaceutical; therefore, higher doses of UV irradiation or longer exposure times are required for their removal. The time course of TOC and toxicity during direct photodegradation (in both ultrapure and real water) shows that oxidation by-products are not oxidized to CO2 to the desired extent, generating oxidation by-products that are more toxic than the initial product. The concentration of nitroimidazoles has a major effect on their photodegradation rate. The study of the influence of pH on the values of parameters epsilon (molar absorption coefficient) and k(E)' (photodegradation rate constant) showed no general trend in the behavior of nitroimidazoles as a function of the solution pH. The components of natural organic matter, gallic acid (GAL), tannic acid (TAN) and humic acid (HUM), may act as promoters and/or inhibitors of OH center dot radicals via photoproduction of H2O2. The effect of GAL on the metronidazole (MNZ) degradation rate markedly differed from that of TAN or HUM, with a higher rate at low GAL concentrations. Differences in MNZ degradation rate among waters with different chemical composition are not very marked, although the rate is slightly lower in wastewaters, mainly due to the UV radiation filter effect of this type of water.

AB The kinetics of oxidation and disinfection processes during ozonation in a full-scale reactor treating secondary wastewater effluent were investigated for seven ozone doses ranging from 0.21 to 1.24 g O-3 g(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOG). Substances reacting fast with ozone, such as diclofenac or carbamazepine (k(P,O3) > 10(4) M-1 s(-1)), were eliminated within the gas bubble column, except for the lowest ozone dose of 0.21 g O-3 g(-1) DOG. For this low dose, this could be attributed to short-circuiting within the reactor. Substances with lower ozone reactivity (k(p,O3) < 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) were only fully eliminated for higher ozone doses.
   The predictions of micropollutant oxidation based on coupling reactor hydraulics with ozone chemistry and reaction kinetics were up to a factor of 2.5 higher than full-scale measurements. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the observed differences were higher than model uncertainties. The overestimation of micropollutant oxidation was attributed to a protection of micropollutants from ozone attack by the interaction with aquatic colloids. Laboratory-scale batch experiments using wastewater from the same full-scale treatment plant could predict the oxidation of slowly-reacting micropollutants on the full-scale level within a factor of 1.5. The Rct value, the experimentally determined ratio of the concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, was identified as a major contribution to this difference.
   An increase in the formation of bromate, a potential human carcinogen, was observed with increasing ozone doses. The final concentration for the highest ozone dose of 1.24 g O-3 g(-1) DOG was 7.5 mu g L-1, which is below the drinking water standard of 10 mu g L-1. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation of up to 15 ng L-1 was observed in the first compartment of the reactor, followed by a slight elimination during sand filtration. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) increased up to 740 mu g AOC L-1, with no clear trend when correlated to the ozone dose, and decreased by up to 50% during post-sand filtration. The disinfection capacity of the ozone reactor was assessed to be 1-4.5 log units in terms of total cell counts (TCC) and 0.5 to 2.5 log units for Escherichia coli (E. coli). Regrowth of up to 2.5 log units during sand filtration was observed for TCC while no regrowth occurred for E. coli. E. coli inactivation could not be accurately predicted by the model approach, most likely due to shielding of E. coli by flocs. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research has shown that exposure to androgens and progestogens can cause undesirable biological responses in the environment. To date, however, no detailed or direct study of their presence in wastewater treatment plants has been conducted. In this study, nine androgens, nine progestogens, and five estrogens were analyzed in influent and final effluent wastewaters in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Beijing, China. Over a period of three weeks, the average total hormone concentrations in influent wastewaters were 3562 (Wujiacun WWTP)-5400 ng/L (Fangzhuang WWTP). Androgens contributed 96% of the total hormone concentrations in all WWTP influents, with natural androgen (androsterone: 2977 739 ng/L; epiandrosterone: 640 +/- 263 ng/L; and androstenedione: 270 +/- 132 ng/L) being the predominant compounds. The concentrations of synthetic progestogens (megestrol acetate: 41 25 ng/L; norethindrone: 6.5 +/- 3.3 ng/L; and medroxyprogesterone acetate: 6.0 +/- 3.2 ng/L) were comparable to natural ones (progesterone: 66 36 ng/L; 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-progegnen-3-one: 4.9 +/- 1.2 ng/L; 21 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone: 8.5 +/- 3.0 ng/L; and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone: 1.5 +/- 0.95 ng/L), probably due to the wide and relatively large usage of synthetic progestogens in medical therapy. In WWTP effluents, androgens were still the dominant class accounting for 60% of total hormone concentrations, followed by progestogens (24%), and estrogens (16%). Androstenedione and testosterone were the main androgens detected in all effluents. High removal efficiency (91-100%) was found for androgens and progestogens compared with estrogens (67-80%), with biodegradation the major removal route in WWTPs. Different profiles of progestogens in the receiving rivers and WWTP effluents were observed, which could be explained by the discharge of a mixture of treated and untreated wastewater into the receiving rivers.

AB Augmentation of potable water sources by planned indirect potable reuse of wastewater is being widely considered to address growing water shortages. Environmental buffers such as lakes and dams may act as one of a series of barriers to potable water contamination stemming from micropollutants in wastewater. In South-East Queensland, Australia, current government policy is to begin indirect potable reuse of water from reverse osmosis equipped advanced water treatment plants (AWTPs) when the combined capacity of its major storages is at 40% capacity. A total of 15 organic contaminants including NDMA and bisphenol A have been publically reported as detected in recycled water from one of South-East Queensland's AWTPs, while another 98 chemicals were analysed for, but found to be below their detection limit. To assess the natural attenuation in Lake Wivenhoe, a Level III fugacity based evaluative fate model was constructed using the maximum concentrations of these contaminants detected as input data. A parallel aquivalence based model was constructed for those contaminants, such as dichloroacetic acid, dalapon and triclopyr, which are ionised in the environment of Lake Wivenhoe. A total of 247 organic chemicals of interest, including disinfection by-products, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, xenoestrogens and industrial chemicals, were evaluated with the model to assess their potential for natural attenuation. Out of the 15 detected chemicals, trihalomethanes are expected to volatilise with concentrations in the outflow from the dam approximately 400 times lower than influent from the AWTPs. Transformation processes in water are likely to be more significant for NDMA and pharmaceuticals such as salicylic acid and paracetamol as well as for caffeine and the herbicides dalapon and triclopyr. For hydrophobic contaminants such as cholesterol and phenolic xenoestrogens such as 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol and bisphenol A, equilibrium between water and sediments will not be attained and hence fate processes such as removal in outflow are predicted to become relatively important.

AB Sewage-contaminated rivers are ecosystems deeply disturbed by human activity due to the release of heavy metals, organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals as well as faecal and pathogenic micro-organisms, which coexist with the autochthonous microbial population. In this study, we compared the percentage of resistance in faecal and heterotrophic bacteria in rivers with different degrees of sewage pollution. As a matter of fact, no correlation was found neither between the degree of sewage pollution and the percentage of antimicrobial resistant heterotrophic bacteria nor between the number of resistant faecal bacteria and that of resistant heterotrophic bacteria. Most of the resistant isolates from the Zenne river downstream Brussels were multi-resistant and the resistance patterns were similar among the strains of each phylogenetic group. The total microbial community in this polluted river (as evaluated through a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis) appeared to be dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while the phylum TM7 was the third most represented.

AB The worldwide detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment and drinking water has been a cause for concern in recent years. The possibility for concurrent formation of nitrosamine DBPs (disinfection by-products) during chloramine disinfection has become another significant concern for delivered drinking water quality because of their potent carcinogenicity. This study demonstrates that a group of PPCPs containing amine groups can serve as nitrosamine precursors during chloramine disinfection. Molar yields higher than 1% are observed for eight pharmaceuticals, with ranitidine showing the strongest potential to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The molar conversion increases with the Cl-2:N mass ratio, suggesting that dichloramine is relevant to the formation of NDMA from these precursors. Although the trace level of PPCPs in the environment suggests that they may not account for the majority of nitrosamine precursors during the disinfection process, this study demonstrates a connection between the transformation of PPCPs and the formation of nitrosamines during chloramine disinfection. This both expands the pool of potential nitrosamine precursors, and provides a possible link between the presence of trace levels of certain PPCPs in drinking water sources and potential adverse health effects.

AB Carbamazepine, a widely consumed psychotropic pharmaceutical, is one of the most commonly detected drugs in the environment. To better assess the environmental persistence of carbamazepine in aqueous matrices, the effect of pH and dissolved oxygen on the direct photodegradation rate of this pharmaceutical was evaluated in this study, using simulated solar irradiation. In order to follow the degradation and the emergence of photoproducts, a micellar electrokinetic chromatography based method was developed, consisting on the use of a dynamically coated capillary column. The developed methodology showed good repeatability and efficiency in the separation of carbamazepine and photoirradiation products. Also, seven photodegradation products were identified by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), including the known carcinogenic acridine that was produced under all the pH and oxygenation levels studied and one newly identified photoproduct.
   This paper gives new insights into the role of dissolved oxygen on the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine. The results indicate that acidic pH, combined with the absence of dissolved oxygen in the aqueous matrix, results in very high direct photodegradation rates. At basic pH, dissolved oxygen does not interfere with the process and very low rates were observed. At environmentally relevant conditions, carbamazepine was shown to persist in the environment from 4.5 to 25 days. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During 8 sampling campaigns carried out over a period of two years, 72 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, and sludge samples from three conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), were analyzed to assess the occurrence and fate of 43 pharmaceutical compounds. The selected pharmaceuticals belong to different therapeutic classes, i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid modifying agents (fibrates and statins), psychiatric drugs (benzodiazepine derivative drugs and antiepileptics), histamine H2-receptor antagonists, antibacterials for systemic use, beta blocking agents, beta-agonists, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and anti-diabetics. The obtained results showed the presence of 32 target compounds in wastewater influent and 29 in effluent, in concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few mu g/L (e.g. NSAIDs). The analysis of sludge samples showed that 21 pharmaceuticals accumulated in sewage sludge from all three WWTPs in concentrations up to 100 ng/g. This indicates that even good removal rates obtained in aqueous phase (i.e. comparison of influent and effluent wastewater concentrations) do not imply degradation to the same extent. For this reason, the overall removal was estimated as a sum of all the losses of a parent compound produces by different mechanisms of chemical and physical transformation, biodegradation and sorption to solid matter. The target compounds showed very different removal rates and no logical pattern in behaviour even if they belong to the same therapeutic groups. What is clear is that the elimination of most of the substances is incomplete and improvements of the wastewater treatment and subsequent treatments of the produced sludge are required to prevent the introduction of these micro-pollutants in the environment.

AB Numerous studies have reported the presence of trace (i.e., ng/L) organic chemicals in municipal wastewater effluents, but it is unclear which compounds will be useful to evaluate the contribution of effluent to overall river flow or the attenuation processes that occur in receiving streams. This paper presents a new approach that uses a suite of common trace organic chemicals as indicators to assess the degree of impact and attenuation of trace organic chemicals in receiving streams. The utility of the approach was validated by effluent monitoring at ten wastewater treatment plants and two effluent-impacted rivers with short retention times (<17 h). A total of 56 compounds were particularly well suited as potential indicators, occurring frequently in effluent samples at concentrations that were at least five times higher than their limit of quantification. Monitoring data from two effluent-impacted rivers indicated that biotransformation was not important for these two river stretches, whereas photolysis attenuation was possibly important for the shallow river. The application of this approach to receiving waters and water reclamation and reuse systems will allow for more effective allocation of resources in future monitoring programs.

AB The photolysis of two antibacterial compounds, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, was studied in wastewater effluent. The rate of loss of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced in wastewater effluent due to indirect photolysis reactions, specifically reactions with hydroxyl radicals and triplet excited state effluent organic matter. Photolysis in the presence of natural organic matter, however, did not lead to enhanced degradation of sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim was also found to be susceptible to indirect photolysis in wastewater effluents, with hydroxyl radical and triplet excited effluent organic matter being the responsible species. Deoxygenation of solutions led to more rapid direct photolysis of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, indicating that direct photolysis proceeds through a triplet excited state, which was verified by demonstrating that trimethoprim is a singlet oxygen sensitizer. In the wastewater effluents tested, photolysis could be apportioned into direct photolysis (48% for sulfamethoxazole, 18% for trimethoprim), reaction with hydroxyl radicals (36% and 62%, respectively) and reaction with triplet excited effluent organic matter (16% and 20%, respectively). These results indicate that allowing photolysis in wastewater stabilization ponds or wastewater treatment wetlands may lead to enhanced pharmaceutical removal prior to discharge and that effluent organic matter has different photoreactivity than natural organic matter.

AB This research investigated removal, mineralization, and bioincorporation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in membrane bioreactors and conventional bioreactors. When the influent EE2 concentration was >50 mu g/L, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) biomass removed more EE2 than conventional bioreactor (CBR) biomass in continuous tests, likely because the sorption partitioning coefficients are higher for MBR biomass. Microautoradiography was carried out to investigate the distribution of EE2 within the aggregates retrieved from the bioreactors, and the results revealed concentration gradients present within the floc. Experiments using radiolabeled C-14-EE2 experiments (done with 24.5 mu g/L EE2) showed that EE2 removal rates and the amount of EE2 mineralized were similar in MBRs and CBRs. Direct measurements and bioenergetic estimates suggest that EE2-related carbon is probably incorporated into active biomass, despite the fact that EE2 was added at a concentration that was much lower than that of the primary growth substrates.

AB The influence of iron species on amoxicillin (AMX) degradation, intermediate products generated and toxicity during the photo-Fenton process using a solar simulator were evaluated in this work. The AMX degradation was favored in the presence of the potassium ferrioxalate complex (FeOx) when compared to FeSO4. Total oxidation of AMX in the presence of FeOx was obtained after 5 min, while 15 min were necessary using FeSO4. The results obtained with Daphnia magna biossays showed that the toxicity decreased from 65 to 5% after 90 min of irradiation in the presence of FeSO4. However, it increased again to a maximum of 100% after 150 min, what indicates the generation of more toxic intermediates than AMX, reaching 45% after 240 min. However, using FeOx, the inhibition of mobility varied between 100 and 70% during treatment, probably due to the presence of oxalate, which is toxic to the neonates. After 240 min, between 73 and 81% TOC removal was observed. Different pathways of AMX degradation were suggested including the opening of the four-membered beta-lactamic ring and further oxidations of the methyl group to aldehyde and/or hydroxylation of the benzoic ring, generating other intermediates after bound cleavage between different atoms and further oxidation to carboxylates such acetate, oxalate and propionate, besides the generation of nitrate and ammonium.

AB High global consumption rates have led to the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. The use of chlorine to disinfect wastewater prior to release into the environment may convert PhACs into uncharacterized chlorinated by-products. In this investigation, chlorination of a common pharmaceutical, the antihyperlipidemic agent gemfibrozil, was documented. Gemfibrozil (2,2-dimethyl-5-(2,5-dimethylphenoxy)pentanoic acid) was reacted with sodium hypochlorite and product formation was monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The incorporation of one, two or three chlorine atoms into the aromatic region of gemfibrozil was demonstrated using negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Further analysis using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy identified the reaction products as 4'-ClGem (5-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid) 4',6'-diClGem (5-(4,6-dichloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid), and 3',4',6'-triClGem (5-(3,4,6-trichloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid), products consistent with electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The rapid reaction of gemfibrozil with free chlorine at pH conditions relevant to water treatment indicates that a mixture of chlorinated gemfibrozils is likely to be found in wastewater disinfected with chlorine.

AB Ruthenium-based catalysts were prepared by a saturation-dip method. Their catalytic activity was evaluated by a catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) process. The ruthenium-based catalysts were used to purify organic pharmaceutical wastewater with high concentration pyridine and pyridine derivatives that have high chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the CWO process, organic pharmaceutical wastewater was continuously pumped into fixed-bed reactors filled with Ru-based catalysts, while the organic components in wastewater were catalytically degraded by oxygen at high temperatures and pressures (temperature, 170-300 degrees C; pressure, 1.0-10 MPa). The experimental results showed that the prepared catalysts could effectively purify pharmaceutical wastewater with high concentration organic components, which are difficult to degrade biochemically, and that the removal rates of both COD and total nitrogen were over 99%.

AB The removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) by a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with synthetic sewage was evaluated and moreover, compared with that by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated under same conditions in parallel. Eight kinds of typical EDCs, including 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynilestradiol (EE2), 4-octylphenol (4-OP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPnEO), were spiked into the feed. Their concentrations in influent, effluent and supernatant were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The overall estrogenecity was evaluated as 17 beta-estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ), determined via yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. E2, E3, BPA and 4-OP were well removed by both MBR and SBR, with removal rates more than 95% and no significant differences between the two reactors. However, with regard to the other four EDCs, of which the removal rates were lower, MBR performed better. Comparison between supernatant and effluent of the two reactors indicated that membrane separation of sludge and effluent, compared with sedimentation, can relatively improve elimination of target EDCs and total estrogenecity. By applying different solids retention times (SRTs) (5, 10, 20 and 40 d) to the MBR, 10 and 5 d were found to be the lower critical SRTs for efficient target EDCs and EEQ removal, respectively.

AB The purpose of this paper is to report the study of the fate and distribution of three endocrine disrupting compounds (estrogens); Estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in a laboratory scale submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR). For this matter, both aqueous and solids phases were analyzed for the presence of E1, E2 and EE2. The outcome of this study was that three SMBRs showed enhanced elimination of estrogens in different operational conditions; the estrogen removal was close to 100% in SMBR. Additionally, E1, E2 and EE2 were detected in SMBR sludge at concentrations of up to 41.2, 37.3 and 36.9 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The estrogen removal in the SMBRs was directly influenced by a combination of simultaneous biodegradation-adsorption processes, indicating that the main removal mechanism of the estrogens in the SMBRs is the biodegradation process. The E1, E2 and EE2 were biologically degraded in the SMBR (87-100%). The sorption of estrogens onto activated sludge was from 2%. Therefore, a high potential for estrogen removal by biodegradation in the SMBR was observed, allowing less estrogen concentration in the dissolved phase available for the adsorption of these compounds onto biological flocs. Two different methods were carried out for mass balance calculations of estrogens in SMBR. For the first method, the measured data was used in both liquid and solid phases, whereas for the second one, it was in aqueous phase and solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d) value of E1, E2 and EE2. The purpose of these methodologies is to make easier the identification of the main mechanisms involved in the removal of E1, E2 and EE2 in a SMBR. Both methods can be applied in order to determine the mechanism, fate and distribution of estrogens in a SMBR.

AB Water and wastewater effluents contain a vast range of pharmaceutical chemicals. The present study aims to determine the potential of the advanced oxidation technology UV/H2O2/O-3 and its sub-processes (i.e. UV, UV/H2O2, UV/O-3, O-3 and H2O2/O-3) for the degradation of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP) and trimethoprim (TMP), and the antineoplastic drug cyclophosphamide (CPD) from water. Creating AOP conditions improved in most cases the degradation rate of the target compounds (compared with O-3 and UV alone). H2O2 concentration was found to be an important parameter in the UV/H2O2 and H2O2/O-3 sub-processes, acting as (OH)-O-center dot initiator as well as (OH)-O-center dot scavenger. Out of the examined processes, O-3 had the highest degradation rate for TMP and H2O2/O-3 showed highest degradation rate for CIP and CPD. The electrical energy consumption for both CIP and CPD, as calculated using the E-EO parameter, was in the following order: UV > UV/O-3 > UV/H2O2/O-3 > O-3 > H2O2/O-3. Whereas for TMP O-3 was shown to be the most electrical energy efficient. Twelve degradation byproducts were identified following direct UV photolysis of CIP.

AB Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the removal and fate of estrogens 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) activated sludge system. Estrogen concentrations in the aqueous and solid phases in each reactor of AAO system were analyzed separately. E2 was not detected in the final effluent. The anaerobic, anoxic and oxic reactors accounted for 71%, 7% and 22% of the overall E2 removal, respectively. The overall EE2 removal efficiency was about 80%, and the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic reactors were responsible for 44%, 8% and 48% of the overall EE2 removal, respectively. In anaerobic unit, sorption was the dominant mechanism for the removal of E2 and EE2. While E2 was degraded in all the three units of the AAO system, EE2 was only degraded in the anoxic and aerobic units. Biodegradation is important for the fate of E2 compared to sorption. Of the total influent E2 in the AAO system, 99.99% was biodegraded and 0.01% remained in the waste sludge. Nevertheless, both sorption and biodegradation play important roles in the removal of EE2. Of the total influent EE2, 79.1% was degraded by activated sludge, 19.9% was discharged in the effluent and 1% remained in the waste sludge.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micro-pollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to meet the environmental quality standards set by new regulations like the Water Framework Directive. The present work assessed the efficiency of different types of primary, secondary and tertiary processes for the removal of more than 100 priority substances and other relevant emerging pollutants through on-site mass balances over 19 municipal wastewater treatment lines. Secondary biological processes proved to be in average 30% more efficient than primary settling processes. The activated sludge (AS) process led to a significant reduction of pollution loads (more than 50% removal for 70% of the substances detected). Biofilm processes led to equivalent removal efficiencies compared to AS, except for some pharmaceuticals. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) process allowed to upgrade removal efficiencies of some substances only partially degraded during conventional AS processes. Preliminary tertiary processes like tertiary settling and sand filtration could achieve significant removal for adsorbable substances. Advanced tertiary processes, like ozonation, activated carbon and reverse osmosis were all very efficient (close to 100%) to complete the removal of polar pesticides and pharmaceuticals; less polar substances being better retained by reverse osmosis.

AB Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are a very attractive option for the treatment of hospital wastewater and elimination of pharmaceuticals in high density urban areas. The present investigation showed that, depending on the substance, between 19% and 94% of the level of antibiotics found in the environment originate from hospitals. Because of their ecotoxic potential, hospital wastewaters can have a significant impact on the environment. The segregation of these wastewaters and their separate treatment at the source can reduce the entry of drugs in waterways and enable water reuse after adequate polishing treatment processes.

AB One of the two main objectives of this work is to oxidize MBR effluents with ozone/peroxide in high pH conditions in order to improve oxidation of pharmaceuticals, which could efficiently be rejected by the nanofiltration (NF) stage. The other main objective is to effectively oxidize of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in MBR effluents in order to decrease fouling in the filtration stage. In this work, ozone/peroxide oxidation was applied to the MBR effluents in high pH conditions in order to improve the formation of OH radicals, and oxidized effluents were filtered by the NF membrane (NE90) in order to investigate fouling potentials and the removal of pharmaceuticals. Natural and synthetic wastewater samples were used as feed solutions for the MBR system, which was equipped with a U-shaped hollow fiber membrane module. The flux decline was decreased from 29% to 15% when 9 mg/L of ozone was used, the same decline was also observed when 6 mg/L ozone and hydrogen peroxide (1/1 ozone/peroxide mol ratio) were used. A further decrease in flux decline was observed when pH was adjusted to 9.00 (29% to 9%) prior to the ozone/peroxide oxidation. In most cases, the increase in the ozone dose, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and the adjustment of the pH level led to an increase in the removal of pharmaceuticals. Iopromide, TCEP and Naproxen were found to be more resistant to the oxidation when pH was increased.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) can influence pharmaceutical adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC) by direct adsorption competition and pore blocking. However, in the literature there is limited information on which of these mechanisms is more important and how this is related to NOM and pharmaceutical properties. Adsorption batch experiments were carried out in ultrapure, waste- and surface water and fresh and NOM preloaded GAC was used. Twenty-one pharmaceuticals were selected with varying hydrophobicity and with neutral, negative or positive charge. The influence of NOM competition and pore blocking could not be separated. However, while reduction in surface area was similar for both preloaded GAcs, up to 50% lower pharmaceutical removal was observed on wastewater preloaded GAG. This was attributed to higher hydrophobicity of wastewater NOM, indicating that NOM competition may influence pharmaceutical removal more than pore blocking. Preloaded GAG was negatively charged, which influenced removal of charged pharmaceuticals significantly. At a GAG dose of 6.7 mg/L, negatively charged pharmaceuticals were removed for 0-58%, while removal of positively charged pharmaceuticals was between 32-98%. Charge effects were more pronounced in ultrapure water, as it contained no ions to shield the surface charge. Solutes with higher log D could compete better with NOM, resulting in higher removal.

The primary aim of this study was to develop a chemical monitoring program that can demonstrate proper plant operation resulting in the removal of priority chemical constituents in the product water. The feed water quality to the pilot plant was tertiary-treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. The unit processes of the AWTP were comprised of an integrated membrane system (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis) followed by final chlorination generating a water quality that does not present a source of human or environmental health concern. The chemical monitoring program was undertaken over 6 weeks during pilot plant operation and involved the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, steroidal hormones, industrial chemicals, pesticides, N-nitrosamines and halomethanes. The first phase consisted of baseline monitoring of target compounds to quantify influent concentrations in feed waters to the plant. This was followed by a period of validation monitoring utilising indicator chemicals and surrogate measures suitable to assess proper process performance at various stages of the AWTP. This effort was supported by challenge testing experiments to further validate removal of a series of indicator chemicals by reverse osmosis. This pilot-scale study demonstrated a simplified analytical approach that can be employed to assure proper operation of advanced water treatment processes and the absence of trace organic chemicals.

AB The effect of antimicrobial chemical, triclosan (TCS) on protozoa present in aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors for wastewater treatment is reported in this study. Bioreactor sludge ciliated protozoa such as Spirostomum, Cyclidium and Colpoda and flagellated protozoa Mastigella were exposed to TCS at 1 mg/L level in batch cultures. The response of TCS on protozoa was followed by microscopic observation of the sludge at specific time intervals. Among the protozoa in aerobic sludge, Colpoda exhibited strong sensitivity to triclosan and the cells distorted and burst in 20 minutes period. Mastigella and Spirostomum were resistant to triclosan for first two days, but afterwards the mobility was found declined and subsequently mortality increased to 100% in four and five days respectively. Anaerobic sludge ciliate, Cyclidium exhibited morphological distortion and motility decline after 1 hour exposure to triclosan. The sludge flocs were affected and pelagic cell count declined by the presence of triclosan at the tested level.

AB In India a large number of pharmaceutical industries are manufacturing drugs of complex type subsequently producing huge quantities of wastewaters. The herbal pharmaceutical industries are one of them which manufacture various herbal medicines from natural products and certain chemicals and metal combinations. During their manufacturing process a large number of toxicants enter the watercourse harming the biota of the receiving water bodies. Zooplankton organisms being at the base of the food chain if affected, will subsequently affect the fisheries potential at large, harming the interest of man. Keeping this point in view a herbal pharmaceutical manufacturing industry based at Nagpur was selected for investigation with respect to assessing its toxic effect on the freshwater crustacean Cypris spp. during short duration toxicity tests. This research paper discusses in detail the bioassay evaluation of raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated herbal pharmaceutical effluent for arriving at a concentration safe for the Cypris spp.

AB Tylosin has been considered inhibiting COD removal in anaerobic digestion. In this study it is proven that this is not always the case. Accordingly, elevated concentrations of Tylosin (100-800mgL(-1)) could be tolerated by the anaerobic system. The influence of Tylosin concentrations on an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) was assessed using additions of Tylosin phosphate concentrate. Results showed high efficiency for COD removal (average 93%) when Tylosin was present at concentrations ranging from 0 to 400mgL(-1). However, at Tylosin concentrations of 600 and 800mgL(-1) treatment efficiency declined to 85% and 75% removal respectively. The impact of Tylosin concentrations on archaeal activity were investigated and the analysis revealed that archaeal cells dominated the reactor, confirming that there was no detectable inhibition of the methanogens at Tylosin levels between 100 and 400mgL(-1). Nevertheless, the investigation showed a slight reduction in the number of methanogens at Tylosin levels of 600 and 800mgL(-1). These results demonstrated that the methanogens were well adapted to Tylosin. It would not be expected that the process performance of the UASR would be affected, not even at a level well in excess of those appearing in real wastewater from a Tylosin production site.

AB In semi-arid regions, treated wastewater reuse for irrigation is a common practice since wastewater is considered as a non negligible water resource in these areas. However, treated wastewater contains traces of organic compounds which may contaminate the receiving environment i.e. soil and groundwater. Some of these organic compounds have the ability to bind to estrogen receptor (ER) or dioxin receptor (AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor). The fate of these compounds in effluent reused for irrigation, irrigated soils and groundwater is not well addressed yet. In the present study, estrogenic and dioxin-like activities were studied in three media: i) effluents reused for irrigation, ii) soils samples collected from the reclaimed water irrigated plot during six month irrigation, and iii) groundwater sampled before and after irrigation periods. Effluents reused for irrigation exhibited ER and AhR activities at 38.5 +/- 9.9 ng estradiol-equivalent/L (ng E2-EQ/L) and 113.3 +/- 27.7 ng dioxin-equivalent/L (ng TCDD-EQ/L), respectively. Soils showed ER activity (0.05 ng E2-EQ/g) only after 4 months of irrigation. AhR activities detected in all soil samples have not changed during irrigation. In groundwater, ER activities were detected in two piezometers indicating transfer of some estrogenic compounds.

ID ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; GROWTH
AB We describe the operation of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) system operating on a synthetic wastewater (acetic acid), under conditions of increasing nitrogen limitation. Two MFCs were operated under feed conditions which spanned a range of TKN/COD values of 1.6-28 mg/g. Stable operation was observed in all cases, even when no ammoniacal nitrogen was added to the cell. Improved electrochemical performance (measured as power density, W/m(2)) was observed as nitrogen limitation was imposed on the cells. Even with no ammonium addition, continuous function of the cell was maintained, at levels consistent with operation at balanced nutrient supplementation. The work has implicated biological nitrogen fixation as a potential source of nitrogen within the MFC. Whilst this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed, the work highlights the opportunity for continuous operation of microbial fuel cells utilising wastewaters with extremely low nitrogen levels, present in pulp and paper, pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries. Further, the described increases in some of the electrochemical indices (e. g. power density) under application of nitrogen limitation may provide a new approach to increasing fuel cell performance. Finally, the lack of any need to add supplemental nitrogen to a MFC-based wastewater treatment technology holds potential for significant financial and environmental savings.

AB Mass flows of 13 pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) found in drinking water were studied in the water cycle of Stockholm. Data were collected by analyzing samples of surface water, raw water and drinking water as well as influents, effluents and sludges from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in Stockholm area. A mass balance was performed, based on sold amounts of pharmaceuticals and the measured concentrations in water and sludge. The selected APIs were all present in WWTP effluents and the removal rates for many of them were poor. Mass balance calculations showed that the three studied WWTPs in Stockholm release considerable amounts of the selected APIs into the Baltic Sea while the portions ending up in WWTP sludge were significantly lower. The levels of APIs found in drinking water are low at present, but may increase in the future unless the releases from WWTPs in the catchment of Lake Malaren are mitigated.

AB Simple Treat 3.1 predicts the distribution and elimination of chemicals by sewage treatment. The model is used as the default calculation in EUSES 2.0 to estimate exposure concentration in the receiving water, soil and air. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank input parameters according to their influence on model predictions. Triclosan was selected for the base case. The sewage flow, degradation rates and parameters describing the raw sewage were shown to be the most sensitive inputs. The pH and dissociation constant are very sensitive parameters when working with ionisable compounds. Variation in certain input parameters was propagated through the model to yield greater variation in output parameters with a maximum ratio of 4.0. Simple Treat 3.1 is a steady state model describing a highly non-steady system. A large variability in the most sensitive parameters is expected within a single sewage plant and parameters should therefore be selected to cover this variability.

AB The system ozone and hydrogen peroxide was used to reclaim wastewater from the secondary clarifier from a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of Alcala de Henares (Madrid-Spain). The assays were performed by bubbling a gas mixture of oxygen and ozone, with similar to 24 g Nm(-3) of ozone concentration, through a volume of wastewater samples for 20 minutes at 25 degrees C. The removal of dissolved micropollutants such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Organic Carbon (TOC) was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. Removal efficiency ratios in the range of 7-26 mg O-3/mg TOC and 0.24 mg O-3 /ng micropollutants at 5 minutes of ozonation were assessed as reference data to reclaim wastewater from STP. The relation between the extent of TOC removed and ozone doses used was related by a second-order kinetic model in which the time-integrated ozone-hydrogen peroxide concentration was included.

AB Trace amounts of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters in the nano- to microgram per liter range, and in drinking water in the nanogram/L range. The environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in surface waters have been evaluated and generally found to be low if the wastewater is treated before release to the environment. The human health risks of trace amounts of pharmaceuticals in drinking water have however not been evaluated in any great depth. Preliminary screening level assessments suggest risk to be low - but the public and decision-makers are concerned and would like the matter investigated more thoroughly, especially with regards to mixture effects, chronic long-term effects and sensitive sub-populations. The World Health Organization is currently evaluating the need for credible health based guidance associated with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. The aim of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-science and the ongoing international debate on the topic.

AB The presence in the aquatic environment of xenobiotics such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) has emerged as an issue of concern. Upgrading sewage treatment quality with modern technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs) and/or implementing a further post-treatment might mitigate the release of xenobiotics into surface waters. The performance of two processes treating municipal sewage, a MBR and an Activated Sludge (AS) unit, have been compared in terms of PPCPs removal. Moreover, their effluents were treated using vertical flow reed beds. Both systems were operated under similar conditions, more specifically Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), maintained at 8 hours, and Sludge Retention Time (SRT) set at 6 and 20 days. Pharmaceuticals belong to therapeutic groups such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine) and analgesics (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), whereas the personal care products are musk fragrances (galaxolide and tonalide). Xenobiotics removals achieved in the MBR showed better results, particularly for the acidic drugs ibuprofen (87% vs. 50%) and naproxen (56% vs. 6%) operating at low SRT. After filtration through vertical flow reed-beds, PPCPs content in effluents was decreased, below 1 ppb in most cases, improving the effluent quality and confirming reed-beds as an interesting low cost alternative in order to attenuate xenobiotics contamination.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micro-pollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to meet reuse applications and contribute to reach the good status of the water bodies. A hundred priority and relevant emerging substances were measured to evaluate at full-scale the removal efficiencies of seven advanced treatment lines (one membrane bioreactor process and six tertiary treatment lines) that were designed for reuse applications. To reliably compare the processes, specific procedures for micro-pollutants were applied for sampling, analysis and calculation of removal efficiencies. The membrane bioreactor process allowed to upgrade the removal efficiencies of about 20% of the substances measured, especially those that were partially degraded during conventional processes. Conventional tertiary processes like high rate clarification, sand filtration and polishing pond achieved significant removal for some micro-pollutants, especially for adsorbable substances. Advanced tertiary processes, like ozonation, activated carbon and reverse osmosis were all very efficient to complete the removal of polar pesticides and pharmaceuticals; metals and less polar substances were better retained by reverse osmosis.

AB The ability of several mesocosm-scale and full-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater was assessed. The results of three previous works were considered as a whole to find common patterns in PPCP removal. The experiment took place outdoors under winter and summer conditions. The mesocosm-scale CWs differed in some design parameters, namely the presence of plants, the vegetal species chosen (Typha angustifolia versus Phragmites australis), the flow configuration (surface flow versus subsurface flow), the primary treatment (sedimentation tank versus HUSB), the feeding regime (batch flow versus continuous saturation) and the presence of gravel bed. The full-scale CWs consisted of a combination of various subsystems (ponds, surface flow CWs and subsurface flow CWs). The studied PPCPs were ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide. The performance of the evaluated treatment systems was compound dependent and varied as a function of the CW-configuration. In addition, PPCP removal efficiencies were lower during winter. The presence of plants favoured naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide removal. Significant positive correlations were observed between the removal of most PPCPs and temperature or redox potential. Accordingly, microbiological pathways appear to be the most likely degradation route for the target PPCPs in the CWs studied.

AB 4-Aminobenzenesulfonate (4-ABS), an aromatic amine and recalcitrant toxic pollutant, is widely used in the dye and pharmaceutical industry. Pannonibacter sp. W1 is a specialized microbial strain which can efficiently degrade 4-ABS. This study shows the feasibility of using the specialized strain in an MBR system to treat synthetic wastewater containing large amount of 4-ABS. Due to membrane retention, the biomass concentration is able to reach 5 g/L within two months of continuous operation. Pannonibacter sp. W1 is able to adapt to the high loading rate of 1000 mg 4-ABS/L and achieve a remarkable 4-ABS removal efficiency of 99% within 6 h. Strain W1 grows well under the MBR continuous operation and remains as the dominant bacterium at the end of 60 days continuous operation. Minor membrane fouling has been detected within 40 days of operating at 15 LMH. At a flux of 25 LMH, the system experiences the 'TMP jump'. The high organic removal rate and low membrane fouling results illustrate the excellent performance of the bioaugmented MBR system in 4-ABS wastewater treatment.

AB This study aimed at enhancing knowledge on the fate of diclofenac (DF), together with its main human metabolite 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (4'OHDF), during wastewater treatment by using a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The reactor was fed continuously with non-radiolabelled diclofenac for a one month period prior to a single pulse of a C-14-radiolabelled solution of DF and 4'OHDF. The solution spike contained approximately 25% 4'OHDF and 65% DF, which corresponds to the ratio observed in municipal sewage, as well as traces of two other metabolites. The radioactivity was monitored for a total of twelve days in the various output streams. The calculation of the complete mass balance in the system demonstrated that the major part of the radioactivity left the reactor with the permeate (88.7%), while 2.1% was recovered in the excess sludge. Negligible amounts were recovered in the off-gas traps and on the membranes. Chromatographic analyses of effluent samples, by means of HPLC-MS coupled in parallel to a radiodetector, displayed a different pattern than the one of the spiked solution. It showed the occurrence of three additional metabolites.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ) in aqueous solution was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using CBZ as a template molecule and methacrylic acid (MM) as a functional monomer. The performance of the CBZ-MIP was evaluated in terms of selectivity, adsorption capacity, binding characteristics, loading volume, and elution volume. The CBZ-MIP exhibited a high affinity for CBZ over the competitive compound (Diclofenac) and was more suitable to remove low concentrations of CBZ in large-volume water samples. A binding performance experiment indicated that the adsorption of CBZ-MIP was characterized by both specific and non-specific binding interactions. Moreover, the regenerability of the MIP was affirmed in ten sequential cycles of adsorption/desorption without a significant loss in recovery. Finally, the CBZ-MIP was applied to enrich CBZ in environmental water samples, and the CBZ concentrations were subsequently determined using HPLC-UV. The results were in good agreement with corresponding LC-MS/MS data. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of phenolic wastewaters by means of H2O2-promoted TiO2 photocatalysis was investigated in single baffle reactor concerning the effect of major operating factors, namely H2O2 dosage and method of addition on process efficiency. Addition of hydrogen peroxide enhances considerably treatment efficiency and its beneficial role is associated with increased production of radicals due to its reaction with conduction band electrons and other reactive species. When compared to rate of degradation, the solar/TiO2/H2O2 process is two to three times faster than the solar/TiO2 process. For untreated samples of 400 mg/L phenol concentration, from pharmaceutical industry the BOD/COD ratio is 0, while solar photocatalytic treatment of 4 h enhanced the biodegradability values to 0.44. Results of this study open new research window for a more complex approach to photocatalytic experiments where photocatalysis can be combined with hydrogen peroxide.

AB The photocatalytic abatement of hazardous pharmaceuticals has been investigated at very low concentration in the ppb range as found in wastewater and in environmental pollutants. Photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline as a model compound with titania catalysts has been studied using solarium UV-A and black light with differentially applied electric power, tetracycline and catalyst concentration. Abatement of up to 90% has been achieved after 1 hour. Adsorption of tetracycline and photochemical degradation contribute significantly to the abatement of tetracycline resulting in an immediate reduction during the initial period of treatment. Contribution of adsorption is high at very low concentration (500 ppb). Photocatalytic treatment with titania is even highly efficient in the abatement of very small concentrations of tetracycline in drinking water.

AB To investigate the occurrence and fate of ritalinic acid - the main human metabolite of the psychostimulant drug methylphenidate - in the aquatic environment, a HPLC-electrospray-MS/MS method for the quantification of ritalinic acid in wastewater. surface water and bank filtrate was developed Carbamazepine known as very stable in the aquatic environment was analyzed as anthropogenic marker in parallel Furthermore, the removal of ritalinic acid was studied in a sewage treatment plant using an activated sludge system during a field study and in lab-scale plants In good agreement between lab-scale and field studies a low removal rate of 13% and 23%, respectively, was determined As a consequence, the concentration of ritalinic acid in the wastewater effluents were in the range of <50-170 ng L-1 which corresponds to a mean specific load per capita of 177 mu g d(-1).
   Ritalinic acid has further been detected in German rivers at concentrations of 4-23 ng L-1 and in bank filtrate samples in 100-850 m distance from the river up to 5 ng L-1 demonstrating the widespread occurrence of this stable metabolite in the aquatic environment A comparison to available sales data shows that a significant amount of methylphenidate applied can be found in waters as ritalinic acid (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB The reuse of wastewater for irrigation of agricultural land is a well established practice but introduces many contaminants into the terrestrial environment including pharmaceuticals and personal care products. This study reports the persistence and leaching potential of a group of acidic pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine, and three endocrine disruptors in soils from the Tula Valley in Mexico, one of the largest irrigation districts in the world that uses untreated wastewater. After irrigation of soil columns with fortified wastewater over the equivalent of one crop cycle, between 0% and 7% of the total added amounts of ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac and between 0% and 25% of 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, and bisphenol-A were recovered nom the soil profiles Carbamazepine was more persistent, between 55% and 107% being recovered. Amounts in leachates suggested that movement through the soil was possible for all of the analytes, particularly in profiles of low organic matter and clay content. Analysis of soil samples from the Tula Valley confirmed the general lack of accumulation of the acidic pharmaceuticals (concentrations from below the limit of detection to 0 61 mu g kg(-1)) and endocrine disruptors (concentrations from below the limit of detection to 109 mu g kg(-1)) despite continual addition through regular irrigation with untreated wastewater: there was little evidence of movement through the soil profiles. In contrast, carbamazepine was present in horizon A of the soil at concentrations equivalent to several years of additions by irrigation (2.6-7 5 mu g kg(-1)) and was also present in the deeper horizons. The persistence and mobility of carbamazepine suggested a potential to contaminate groundwater (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Antibiotics are released into the environment in a variety of ways: via wastewater effluent as a result of incomplete metabolism in the body after use in human therapy, as runoff after use in agriculture, through improper disposal by private households or hospitals or through insufficient removal by water treatment plants. Unlike in most European countries, in Arctic regions effluents are not suitably treated prior to their release into the aquatic environment Also, many of the scattered human settlements in remote regions of the Arctic do not possess sewage treatment facilities and pharmaceutical residues therefore enter the aqueous environment untreated.
   Only limited data are available on the biodegradation of antibiotics under Arctic conditions. However, such information is needed to estimate the potential harm of antibiotics for the environment. Pen-G is used in this study since it is a widely prescribed antibiotic compound whose environmental properties have not yet been investigated in detail Thus, for a very first assessment, the OECD approved biodegradation Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT. OECD 302 B) was used to study biodegradation and non-biotic elimination of the antibiotic Benzyl-penicillin (Pen-G) at different temperatures (5 degrees C, 12.5 degrees C and 20 degrees C) The testing period was extended from the OECD standard of 28-42 d. In addition to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Pen-G levels and major transformation products were recorded continuously by LC-ion-trap-MS/MS. DOC monitoring revealed considerable temperature dependence for the degradation process of Pen-G. DOC loss was slowest at 5 degrees C and considerably faster at 12.5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. In the initial step of degradation it was found that Pen-G was hydrolyzed. This hydrolyzed Pen-G was subsequently further degraded by decarboxylation, the result of which was 2-(5.5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidin-2-yl)-2-(2-phenylacetamido)acetic acid. Furthermore, direct elimination of 2-phenyl-acetaldehyde from the hydrolyzed and decarboxylated Pen-G also led to the formation of 2-[amino(carboxy)methyl]-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidone-4-carboxylic acid. Since biodegradation slows down considerably at a low temperature, the resulting transformation products had considerably longer residence times at 5 degrees C compared to higher temperature conditions within the 42-d experiment. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that a risk assessment for pharmaceuticals present in low ambient temperature environments (i.e. the Arctic) cannot be based on test results obtained under standard laboratory conditions (i e. 20 degrees C ambient temperatures).

AB This study uses 4,4'-dinitrostilberie-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNS) wastewater to produce paramycin (4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), an antitubercular agent and important pharmaceutical intermediate. The high concentrations of aromatic sulfonic acids contained in the wastewater, derived from a DNS production facility, have been transformed to paramycin in yields of more than 85%. This waste-disposal strategy, which combines oxidation using NaClO, reduction using iron powder, and subsequent alkaline fusion with NaOH, has been proven to be successful in dealing with ton-scale DNS wastewater. Compared with common treatment methods, which usually involve degrading the compounds, this new method recycles most of the aromatic sulfonic acids in the wastewater to produce paramycin. This effectively solve:; the associated environment problems associated with DNS wastewater and is also potentially profitable. The present approach could also lead to alternative solutions for dealing with other industrial wastewaters generated from oxidative coupling reactions of nitro-substituted toluenes to the corresponding substituted stilbenes.

AB A suspended growth photobioreactor was utilized to treat pharmaceutical wastewater by a wild strain purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium isolated from the soil. The strain was named Z08 and identified as Rhodobacter-sphaeroides by 16SrDN. The photobioreactor was illuminated externally with two (40 W) fluorescent compact light sources on both sides. Its operation pH and temperature were between 6.8 - 7.0 and 20 - 30 degrees C, respectively. Optimum growth of the isolate was obtained after enrichment of the pharmaceutical wastewater with 0.5 % ammonium sulfate and 0.1 % yeast extract under microaerobic optimum light (6000 lx) condition at 5d retention. Using these optimum conditions, the maximum dry cell weight and chemical oxygen demand percentage removal were 880 mg/L and 80 %. Chemical analysis of the culture after treatment of the enriched and non-enriched wastewater showed the crude protein content of the biomass to be 54.6 % and 38.0 %, respectively. This study proved that photosynthetic bacteria could transform complex wastewater that contains recalcitrant organic compounds with a resultant recovery of useful products.

AB Urine source separation (NoMix technology) followed by processing the concentrated nutrient solution has the potential to become a cost-efficient alternative to conventional end-of-pipe nutrient elimination. A choice of processing technologies can only be made for specific scenarios, and there is currently no methodology for analyzing generic situations. In setting up a formalized decision-support methodology (based on STEEPLED analysis), we discuss how to create such generic scenarios, how to couple them with process engineering objectives, how to define the technology requirements, and finally how to produce a realistic subset of technology alternatives. The methodology is tested in five real scenarios. We also touch on the criteria for a final choice of technology taking into account large uncertainties about the performance of real technologies. We conclude that technology development is one of the most important requirements for implementing urine source separation in practice. There is an urgent need to develop cost-efficient processing technologies that satisfy the requirements of stakeholders. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to demonstrate the complementarities of combining membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment with nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration for the removal of trace organic contaminants for potential indirect potable water recycling applications. Four commercially available NF/RO membranes, namely NF270, NF90, BW30 and ESPA2, were selected for this investigation. Challenge tests were conducted with 40 trace organic compounds at concentrations of approximately 2 mu g/L in initial wastewater solutions using a laboratory scale MBR system and a cross-flow NF/RO rig. The results suggest that the MBR system effectively removes hydrophobic and biodegradable trace organic compounds. The adsorption of these hydrophobic compounds onto the MBR mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) leads to an extended retention time in the biological reactor, thereby enhancing their removal. The remaining, mostly hydrophilic, trace organic compounds were shown to be effectively removed by NF/RO membranes. The combination of MBR and a low pressure RO membrane resulted in more than 95% removal or removal to below the analytical detection limit of all 40 trace organic compounds investigated in this study. The results also suggest that NF/RO membrane fouling could be mitigated by appropriate membrane selection. Despite a relatively high initial permeate flux, negligible flow rate decline was observed with an NF membrane and a low pressure RO membrane over more than 25 h of filtration, possibly due to the smooth surfaces of these two particular membranes.

AB The reactions of hetero-tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (H-TCAHs) with hypochlorite in an aqueous solution were investigated under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. H-TCAH-hypochlorite reaction products were determined by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses. For 20 mu M, 10H-phenothiazine, 10H-phenoxazine, and phenoxathiin reacted rapidly with active chlorine in neutral pH (7.0), but no phenazine-hypochlorite reaction was observed over pH values of 5-9 for 1 hr. The 10H-phenothiazine-hypochlorite reaction began by oxidation with active chlorine to form its dioxides, followed by chloro-substitution in water. The extent of the reactions depended on the chlorine dose, solution pH and compound structures. Ames assays for the chlorination byproducts of 10H-phenothiazine and 10H-phenoxazine also showed to be weak mutagenicity in TA98 and TA 100 strains without S9 mix, but no chlorination byproducts of phenoxathiin exhibited any mutagenicity in both tester strains with and without S9 mix.

AB A growing number of pharmaceuticals are found in surface waters worldwide, raising concerns about their effects on aquatic organisms and it is a major challenge to develop a rational strategy for prioritizing drugs on which to focus the most extensive environmental research efforts. However, in contrast to most other chemicals, very good understanding of the human potency of pharmaceuticals has been obtained through efficacy and safety testing. Assuming that a drug acts primarily through the same target(s) also in a non-target species, it would be possible to predict the likelihood for pharmacological interactions in wildlife. Among aquatic organisms, fish most often share drug targets with humans. In this study, we have calculated the predicted critical environmental concentration (CECs), i.e. the surface water concentration expected to cause a pharmacological effect in fish, for 500 pharmaceuticals, assuming equivalent pharmacological activity. The CECs are based on literature data on human potencies together with a predicted bioconcentration factor in fish for each drug based on lipophilicity. We propose that CECs could be used as preliminary indicators of specific drugs' potential to cause adverse pharmacological effects at specific water concentrations, used when selecting pharmaceuticals to include in screening campaigns and for assessing relevant detection limits.

AB Transport of salicylic acid (SA) through flat-sheet supported liquid membrane (SLM) was investigated using as liquid membrane the ionic liquids 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C(6)mim][PF6]) or ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). Using [C(6)mim][PF6], it has been observed that the transport efficiency decreases with increasing pH, indicating that the un-dissociated form of SA is mainly extracted. On the other hand, the ionic dissociated form of salicylic acid is mostly extracted via the anion exchange mechanism between nitrate and salicylate anions when EAN is used as liquid membrane. Parameters such as nature and concentration of the strippant in the receiving phase and concentration of the SA in the feed phase were studied. By comparing the SLM transport efficiency of SA (initial flux) of the two used ionic liquids. EAN appears to be slight efficient than [C(6)mim][PF6].
   Despite the use of different stripping solutions (NaCl, NaOH and Na2CO3) and even with pH maintenance around initial values, uphill transport driven by pH difference was not observed using both ionic liquids. The absence of uphill transport has been attributed to the formation, along the course of the experiment, of water microenvironments (aggregates) inside the ionic liquid. SA transport through these water microenvironments inside the liquid membrane becomes the main mechanism. The main feature of SLMs based on ionic liquids is their higher stability compared to classical SLMs. In fact, our SLM system retained its stability and initial performance during the 9 days long experiment.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a group of widely prescribed antibiotics and have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven FQs (ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), lomefloxacin (LOM), pipemidic acid (PIP) and flumequine (FLU)) and three structurally related amines (1-phenylpiperazine (PP), N-phenylmorpholine (PM) and 4-phenylpiperidine (PD)) toward chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were investigated to elucidate the behavior of FQs during ClO2 disinfection processes. The reaction kinetics are highly pH-dependent, can be well described by a second-order kinetic model incorporating speciation of FQs, and follow the trend of OFL > ENR > CIP similar to NOR similar to LOM > > PIP in reactivity. Comparison among FQs and related amines and product characterization indicate that FQs' piperazine ring is the primary reactive center toward ClO2. ClO2 likely attacks FQ's piperazinyl N4 atom followed by concerted fragmentation involving piperazinyl N1 atom, leading to dealkylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular ring closure at the piperazine moiety. While FQs with tertiary N4 react faster with ClO2 than FQs with secondary N4, the overall reactivity of the piperazine moiety also depends strongly on the quinolone ring through electronic effects. The reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to model the decay of CIP by ClO2 in surface water samples, but overestimate the decay in wastewater samples. Overall, transformation of FQs, particularly for those with tertiary N4 amines, could be expected under typical ClO2 disinfection conditions. However, the transformation may not eliminate antibacterial activity because of little destruction at the quinolone ring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and elimination of 19 micro-organic pollutants including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a full-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic-membrane bioreactor process was investigated. The investigated process achieved over 70% removal of the target EDCs and 50%-100% removal of most of the PPCPs, with influent concentration ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. Three PPCPs, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulpiride were not well removed, with the removal efficiency below 20%. A rough mass balance suggests that the targets were eliminated through sludge-adsorption and/or biodegradation, the former of which was particularly significant for the removal of hydrophobic compounds. The two-phase fate model was employed to describe the kinetics of sludge-adsorption and biodegradation. It was found that the fast sludge adsorption (indicated by mass-transfer rates greater than 10 for most compounds) is responsible for the rapid decline of the aqueous concentration of the targets in the first compartment of the treatment process (i.e. in the anaerobic tank). In contrast, the slow biodegradation proved to be the rate-determining step for the entire degradation process, and the rates are generally positively related to the dissolved oxygen level. On the other hand, this study showed that the removal rates of most targets can reach a quasi-plateau in 5 h under aerobic conditions, indicating that hydraulic retention time of ca. 5 h in aerobic tanks should be sufficient for the elimination of most targets.

AB Municipal biosolids are in widespread use as additives to agricultural soils in the United States. Although it is well known that digested sewage sludge is laden with organic wastewater contaminants, the fate and behavior of micropollutants in biosolids-amended agricultural soils remain unclear. An outdoor mesocosm study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, to explore the fate of 72 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) over the course of three years in that were placed in plastic containers made from polyvinylchloride and kept exposed to ambient outdoor conditions. Of the 72 PPCPs tested for using EPA Method 1694, 15 were initially detected in the soil/biosolids mixtures at concentrations ranging from low parts-per-billion to parts-per-million levels. The anti-microbials triclocarban and triclosan showed the highest initial concentrations at 2715 and 1265 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Compounds showing no discernable loss over three years of monitoring included diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, thiabendazole and triclocarban. The following half-life estimates were obtained for compounds showing first-order loss rates: azithromycin (408-990 d) carbamazepine (462-533 d), ciprofloxacin (1155-3466 d), doxycycline (533-578 d), 4-epitetracycline (630 d), gemfibrozil (224-231 d), norfloxacin (990-1386 d), tetracycline (578 d), and triclosan (182-193 d). Consistent with other outdoor degradation studies, chemical half-lives determined empirically exceeded those reported from laboratory studies or predicted from fate models. Study results suggest that PPCPs shown in the laboratory to be readily biotransformable can persist in soils for extended periods of time when applied in biosolids. This study provides the first experimental data on the persistence in biosolids-amended soils for ciprofloxacin, diphenhydramine, doxycycline, 4-epitetracycline, gemfibrozil, miconazole, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and thiabendazole.

TI Hazard and risk assessment for indirect potable reuse schemes: An
   approach for use in developing Water Safety Plans
SO WATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Water scarcity; Augmentation; Risk assessment; Chemicals; Heat map
ID PHARMACEUTICALS
AB This paper describes research undertaken to develop an approach for facilitating an initial hazard assessment and risk characterisation for a proposed indirect potable reuse scheme, as part of the water safety plan recommended by the World Health Organization. The process involved a description and evaluation of the catchment, which was the sewerage system supplying the sewage treatment works that would provide the effluent to supply the pilot scale indirect potable reuse water treatment plant. Hazards, sources and barriers throughout the proposed system were identified and evaluated. An initial assessment of the possible hazards, highlighted chemical hazards as predominating, and assessment of risks, using a heat map as output, categorised most hazards as medium or high risk. However, this outcome has been influenced by a precautionary approach which assigned a high likelihood to the occurrence of hazards where no data was available on their occurrence in the system. As more data becomes available, and the waster safety plan develops, it is anticipated that the risk heat map will become more specific. Additionally, high quality targets, to drinking water standards, have been set, although water from the potable reuse plant will be discharged to receiving waters where it will undergo natural attenuation prior to further treatment to potable standards before distribution. The assessment has demonstrated the usefulness of the approach where data is initially limited, in generating a heat map allowing for prioritisation of hazards to a practical level.

AB Studies have shown the detection of emerging contaminants (ECs), of which pharmaceuticals are a subset, in surface waters across the United States. The objective of this study was to develop methods, and apply them, to evaluate the potential for food chain transfer when EC-containing waters are used for crop irrigation. Greenhouse experiments were performed in which select food crops were irrigated with water spiked with three antibiotics. Field experiments, at two different sites, were conducted. Select crops were irrigated with wastewater effluent known to contain ECs, EC-free well water, and Colorado River water containing trace-level ECs. The results of the greenhouse studies show the potential for uptake of one or more of the antibiotics evaluated, albeit at very low levels. In those food crops watered with wastewater effluent, only an industrial flavoring agent, N,N'-dimethylphenethylamine (DMPEA), was consistently found. None of the evaluated contaminants were found in crops irrigated with Colorado River water.

AB The stability of a variety of microporous coordination polymers (MCPs) to water-containing solutions was studied using powder X-ray diffraction. It was determined that the stability of the MCP is related to the metal cluster present in the structure with trinuclear chromium clusters more stable than copper paddlewheel clusters which are more stable than basic zinc acetate clusters. Zn(2-methylimidizolate)(2) was found to be more water stable than zinc MCPs with carboxylate linkers; however, extended exposure to water led to decomposition of all zinc-based MCPs. Materiaux de I'Instiut Lavoisier (MIL)-100 was also found to be completely water stable and was used to adsorb the pharmaceuticals furosemide and sulfasalazine from water with large uptakes achievable at low concentrations. indicating that the adsorption of wastewater contaminants may be a feasible application for these materials.

AB Triclosan is a commonly used bactericide that survives several degradation steps in WWTP (wastewater treatment plants) and potentially reaches fluvial ecosystems. In Mediterranean areas, where water scarcity results in low dilution capacity, the potential environmental risk of triclosan is high. A set of experimental channels was used to examine the short-term effects of triclosan (from 0.05 to 500 mu g L-1) on biofilm algae and bacteria. Environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan caused an increase of bacterial mortality with a no effect concentration (NEC) of 0.21 mu g L-1. Dead bacteria accounted for up to 85% of the total bacterial population at the highest concentration tested. The toxicity of triclosan was higher for bacteria than algae. Photosynthetic efficiency was inhibited with increasing triclosan concentrations (NEC = 0.42 mu g L-1), and non-photochemical quenching mechanisms decreased. Diatom cell viability was also affected with increasing concentrations of triclosan. Algal toxicity may be a result of indirect effects on the biofilm toxicity, but the clear and progressive reduction observed in all the algal-related endpoints suggest the existence of direct effects of the bactericide. The toxicity detected on the co-occurring non-target components of the biofilm community, the capacity of triclosan to survive through WWTP processes and the low dilution capacity that characterizes Mediterranean systems extend the relevance of triclosan toxicity beyond bacteria in aquatic habitats.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a pharmaceutical acting as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is used to treat depression in humans. Fluoxetine and the major active metabolite norfluoxetine (NFLX) are released to aquatic systems via sewage-treatment effluents. They have been found to bioconcentrate in wild fish, raising concerns over potential endocrine disrupting effects. The objective of this study was to determine effects of waterborne FLX, including environmental concentrations, on the reproductive axis in sexually mature male goldfish. We initially cloned the goldfish serotonin transporter to investigate tissue and temporal expression of the serotonin transporter, the FLX target, in order to determine target tissues and sensitive exposure windows. Sexually mature male goldfish, which showed the highest levels of serotonin transporter expression in the neuroendocrine brain, were exposed to FLX at 0.54 mu g/L and 54 mu g/L in a 14-d exposure before receiving vehicle or sex pheromone stimulus consisting of either 4.3 nM 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one (17,20P) or 3 nM prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)). Reproductive endpoints assessed included gonadosomatic index, milt volume, and blood levels of the sex steroids testosterone and estradiol. Neuroendocrine function was investigated by measuring blood levels of luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, pituitary gene expression of luteinizing hormone, growth hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and neuroendocrine brain expression of isotocin and vasotocin. To investigate changes at the gonadal level of the reproductive axis, testicular gene expression of the gonadotropin receptors, both the luteinizing hormone receptor and the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, were measured as well as expression of the growth hormone receptor. To investigate potential impacts on spermatogenesis, testicular gene expression of the spermatogenesis marker vasa was measured and histological samples of testis were analyzed qualitatively. Estrogen indices were measured by expression and activity analysis of gonadal aromatase, as well as liver expression analysis of the estrogenic marker, esr1. After 14d, basal milt volume significantly decreased at 54 mu g/L FLX while pheromone-stimulated milt volume decreased at 0.54 mu g/L and 54 mu g/L FLX. Fluoxetine (54 mu g/L) inhibited both basal and pheromone-stimulated testosterone levels. Significant concentration-dependent reductions in follicle-stimulating hormone and isotocin expression were observed with FLX in the 17,20P- and PGF(2)alpha-stimulated groups, respectively. Estradiol levels and expression of esr1 concentration-dependently increased with FLX. This study demonstrates that FLX disrupts reproductive physiology of male fish at environmentally relevant concentrations, and potential mechanisms are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The catalytic ozonation of fenofibric acid was studied using activated alumina and alumina-supported manganese oxide in a semicontinuous reactor. The rate constants at 20 degrees C for the non-catalytic reaction of fenofibric acid with ozone and hydroxyl radicals were 3.43 +/- 0.20 M-1 s(-1) and (6.55 +/- 0.33) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The kinetic constant for the catalytic reaction between fenofibric acid and hydroxyl radicals did not differ significantly from that of homogeneous zonation, either using Al2O3 or MnOx/Al2O3. The results showed a considerable increase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals clue to the use of catalysts even in the case of catalytic runs performed using a real wastewater matrix. Both catalysts promoted the decomposition of ozone in homogeneous phase, but the higher production of hydroxyl radicals corresponded to the catalyst with more activity in terms of ozone decomposition. We did not find evidence of the catalysts having any effect on rate constants, which suggests that the reaction may not involve the adsorption of organics on catalyst surface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A 1-year monitoring study was carried out to investigate the presence of 16 pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups in wastewater discharges, rivers and streams affecting Donana Park. Fourteen pharmaceuticals were detected in effluent wastewater at concentration levels up to 26.8 mu g L-1 and thirteen were detected in surface water at concentration levels up to 4.55 mu g L-1. Ibuprofen was the compound at the highest concentration levels. An increase of the concentration levels in surface water was observed in summer months due to the reduction of the flow rates of the rivers. Nevertheless, risk quotient values estimated in surface water were lower than one so no toxicological effect is suspected to occur. The highest average risk quotients were obtained for ibuprofen (risk quotient 0.67 +/- 0.28), gemfibrozil (risk quotient 0.52 +/- 0.33). propranolol (0.13 +/- 0.06) and naproxen (0.10 +/- 0.09). Nevertheless, in summer months, risk quotient values up to 9.3 and 10.7 were estimated for the estrogenic compounds 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of reclaimed wastewater irrigation on the alteration of soil properties and accumulation of trace metals in soil profiles was investigated by monitoring different plots from Palmdale. California that had been irrigated with effluents for various lengths of time (3, 8, and 20 years, respectively). The non-effluent-irrigated plot served as the control and provided reference "background" values. Total metals at different soil depths were analyzed by acid digestion, and EDTA-extractable metals were analyzed as available fraction. Results show that soil pH values were significantly (p < 0.05) lowered in plots with 20-year irrigation to a depth of 140 cm, while EC was elevated for all three plots compared with control. OM, TC and TN contents increased in the top 10-cm soil layers in plots with 8- and 20-year effluent irrigation. Irrigation with effluents also increased both the total and EDTA-extractable metals in the fields. It showed that long-term effluent irrigation could be of agricultural interest due mainly to its organic matter concentrations and nutrients input, however, trace contaminants such as heavy metals in the upper horizons may be accumulated, which may eventually lead to deterioration of soil and groundwater quality and affect the sustainability of land-based disposal of effluent.

AB Incomplete elimination of bacteria and pharmaceutical drugs during wastewater treatment results in the entry of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria into receiving streams with effluent inputs In Mud Creek in Fayetteville AR, ofloxacin trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have been detected in water and sediment and tetracycline has been detected in sediment downstream of treated effluent input. These antibiotics have been measured repeatedly but at low concentrations (<1 mu g/L) in the stream To determine if effluent input results in detectable and stable changes in antibiotic resistances downstream of effluent input antibiotic resistance in Escherichia colt and total coliform bacteria in Mud Creek stream water and sediment were determined using a culture-based method Isolated E. cob colonies were characterized for multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) patterns on solid media and to evaluate E cob isolate richness by amplification of a partial uidA gene followed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) Despite temporal variability, proportions of antibiotic-resistant E. coli were generally high in effluent and 640 m downstream The MAR pattern ampicillin-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a DGGE profile that was detected in effluent and downstream E colt isolates but not upstream Percent resistance among coliform bacteria to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was higher 640 m downstream compared to upstream sediment and water (with one exception) Resistance to ofloxacin was too low to analyze statistically and tetracycline resistance was fairly constant across sites Resistances changed from 640 m to 2000 m downstream although dissolved nutrient concentrations within that stream stretch resembled effluent Antibiotic resistant bacteria are entering the stream but resistances change within a short distance of effluent inputs more quickly than indicated based on chemical water properties Results illustrate the difficulty in tracking the input and fate of antibiotic resistance and in relating the presence of low antibiotic concentrations to selection or persistence of antibiotic resistances (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB The aim of this work consists in evaluating the influence of carmabazepine (CBZ) (i) on the endogenous and exogenous respirations, in batch reactors, of bacterial populations taken from a conventional activated sludge process (CAS) and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) and (ii) on COD removal, sludge production and oxygen requirement of a lab-sale MBR system. In batch experiments, the increase in endogenous oxygen needs suggests an increase in maintenance requirements, essentially to manage the chemical stress induced by the CBZ presence. The decrease of exogenous oxygen needs seems to suggest a change in the metabolic pathways of the substrate or a change in the active bacterial species. However, in spite of these momentary changes, no inhibition is observed in the presence of CBZ in the test tank. This result is confirmed by the MBR experiment where no significant difference COD removal, sludge production and oxygen requirement is observed, with and without CBZ. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The antiviral drug Tamiflu has received particular attention because of its recommended use against the influenza A H5N1 and H1N1 viruses. Given its resistance to degradation and its hydrophilicity the active metabolite, Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), is expected to enter the aquatic ecosystem from sewage treatment plants. In the present paper the bacterial community of surface water samples, treated with OC (1.5 mg L-1), was characterized by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in microcosm experiments. The alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased in OC-treated versus non-treated water samples during the incubation period, suggesting these bacterial groups had an active role in OC degradation.

AB A continuous injection experiment was implemented in a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system to evaluate the behavior of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (i.e. ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and tonalide) and a phenolic estrogenic compound (i.e. bisphenol A). The treatment system consisted of an anaerobic reactor as a primary treatment, followed by two 0.65 m(2) wetlands (81 and B2) working in parallel and connected to a 1.65 m(2) wetland (B3) operating in series. Overall removal efficiencies for the selected compounds ranged from 97% to 99%. The response curves of the injected pollutants show that the behavior of these compounds strongly depends on their sorption and biodegradation characteristics. While about 50% of ibuprofen was removed in B1 and 82, 99% was achieved at B3, where the dissolved oxygen concentration was significantly higher (B1-B2 = 0.5 mg L-1 and B3 = 5.4 mg L-1). Naproxen and diclofenac were efficiently removed (93%) in B1 and B2, revealing anaerobic degradation as a probable removal mechanism. Moreover, tonalide and bisphenol A were readily removed in the small wetlands (94% and 83%, respectively), where the removal of total suspended solids was 93%. Therefore, given their high hydrophobicity, sorption onto the particulate matter stands for the major removal mechanism. However, the tentative identification of carboxy-bisphenol A as an intermediate degradation product in B3 suggested biodegradation as a relevant bisphenol A removal pathway under aerobic prevailing conditions.

AB Besides classical organic pollutants and pesticides, pharmaceuticals and their residues have nowadays become recognized as relevant environmental contaminants. The risks of these chemicals for aquatic ecosystems are well known, but information about the pharmaca-plant interactions and metabolic pathways is scarce. Therefore, we investigate the process of uptake of acetaminophen (N-Acetyl-4-aminophenol) by Brassica juncea, drug-induced defense responses and detoxification mechanisms in different plant parts.
   Hydroponically grown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L. Czern.) plants were treated with acetaminophen and root and leaf samples were collected after 24, 72, and 168 h of treatment. The uptake of acetaminophen and the formation of its metabolites were analyzed using LC-MS/MS technique and enzyme activities including glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) as well as several plant defense enzymes like catalase, ascorbat peroxidase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were assayed spectrophotometrically.
   We determined the uptake and the translocation of acetaminophen, and we tried to identify the steps of the detoxification process by assaying typical enzymes, supposing the involvement of the same- or similar enzymes and reactions as in the mammalian detoxification process. After 24-h exposure, effective uptake and translocation were observed to the upper part of plants followed by two independent conjugative detoxification pathways. Changes in antioxidant defense enzyme activities connected to the defense pathway towards reactive oxygen species indicate an additional oxidative stress response in the plants.
   The major metabolic pathways in mammals are conjugation with activated sulfate and glucuronic acid, while a small amount of acetaminophen forms a chemically reactive and highly toxic, hydroxylated metabolite. We identified a glutathionyl and a glycoside conjugate, which refer to the similarities to mammalian detoxification. Increased GST activities in leaf tissues were observed correlated with the appearance of the acetaminophen-glutathione conjugate which shows the involvement of this enzyme group in the metabolism of acetaminophen in plants to organic pollutants and xenobiotics. High acetaminophen concentrations lead to oxidative stress and irreversible damages in the plants, which necessitates further investigations using lower drug concentrations for the deeper understanding of the induced detoxification-and defense processes.

AB The uptake of polar organic contaminants into polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) varies with environmental factors, such as water flow rate To evaluate the influence of water flow rate on the uptake of contaminants into POCIS, flow-controlled field experiments were conducted with POCIS deployed in channel systems through which treated sewage effluent flowed at rates between 2.6 and 37 cm/s Both pharmaceutical POCIS and pesticide POCIS were exposed to effluent for 21 d and evaluated for uptake of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting substances (EDS). The pesticide POCIS,had higher uptake rates for PPCPs and EDS than the pharmaceutical POCIS, but thew are some practical advantages to using pharmaceutical POCIS. The uptake of contaminants into POCIS increased with flow rate, but these effects were relatively small (i e., less than twofold) for most of the test compounds There. was no relationship observed between the hydrophobicity (log octanol/water partition coefficient. log K-OW) of model compounds and the effects of flow rate on the uptake kinetics by POCIS These data indicate that water flow rate has a relatively minor influence on the accumulation of PPCPs and EDS into POCIS.
