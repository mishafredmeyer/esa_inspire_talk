AB Pharmaceuticals derived from manufacturing and human consumption contaminate surface waters worldwide. To what extent such pharmaceutical contamination accumulates and disperses over time in different compartments of aquatic food webs is not well known. In this study we assess to what extent five pharmaceuticals (diphenhydramine, oxazepam, trimethopiim, diclofenac, and hydroxyzine) are taken up by fish (European perch) and four aquatic invertebrate taxa (damselfly larvae, mayfly larvae, waterlouse, and ramshorn snail), by tracing their bioconcentrations over several months in a semi-natural large-scale (pond) system. The results suggest both significant differences among drugs in their capacity to bioaccumulate and differences among species in uptake. While no support for in situ uptake of diclofenac and trimethoprim was found, oxazepam, cliphenhyclramine, and hydroxyzine were detected in all analyzed species. Here, the highest bioaccumulation factor (tissue:water ratio) was found for hydroxyzine. In the food web, the highest concentrations were found in the benthic species ramshorn snail and waterlouse, indicating that bottom-living organism at lower trophic positions are the prime receivers of the pharmaceuticals. In general, concentrations in the biota decreased over time in response to decreasing water concentrations. However, two interesting exceptions to this trend were noted. First, mayfly larvae (primarily grazers) showed peak concentrations (a fourfold increase) of oxazepam, cliphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine about 30 days after initial addition of pharmaceuticals. Second, perch (top-predator) showed an increase in concentrations of oxazepam throughout the study period. Our results show that drugs can remain bioavailable for aquatic organism for long time periods (weeks to months) and even re-enter the food web at a later time. As such, for an understanding of accumulation and dispersion of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs, detailed ecological knowledge is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study includes an environmental analysis of a membrane bioreactor (MBR), the objective being to quantitatively define the inventory of the resources consumed and estimate the emissions produced during its construction, operation and end-of-life deconstruction. The environmental analysis was done by the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, in order to establish with a broad perspective and in a rigorous and objective way the environmental footprint and the main environmental hotspots of the examined technology. Raw materials, equipment, transportation, energy use, as well as air- and waterborne emissions were quantified using as a functional unit, 1 m(3) of urban wastewater. SimaPro 8.0.3.14 was used as the LCA analysis tool, and two impact assessment methods, i.e. IPCC 2013 version 1.00 and ReCiPe version 1.10, were employed. The main environmental hotspots of the MBR pilot unit were identified to be the following: (i) the energy demand, which is by far the most crucial parameter that affects the sustainability of the whole process, and (ii) the material of the membrane units. Overall, the MBR technology was found to be a sustainable solution for urban wastewater treatment, with the construction phase having a minimal environmental impact, compared to the operational phase. Moreover, several alternative scenarios and areas of potential improvement, such as the diversification of the electricity mix and the material of the membrane units, were examined, in order to minimize as much as possible the overall environmental footprint of this MBR system. It was shown that the energy mix can significantly affect the overall sustainability of the MBR pilot unit (i.e. up to 95% reduction of the total greenhouse gas emissions was achieved with the use of an environmentally friendly energy mix), and the contribution of the construction and operational phase to the overall environmental footprint of the system.

AB Wastewater analysis, or wastewater-based epidemiology, has become a common tool to monitor trends of illicit drug consumption around the world. In this study, we examined trends in cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine consumption by measuring their residues in wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants in Australia (specifically, an urban and a rural catchment, both in South East Queensland) between 2009 and 2015. With direct injection of the samples, target analytes were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cocaine and MDMA residues and metabolites were mainly quantifiable in the urban catchment while methamphetamine residues were consistently detected in both urban and rural catchments. There was no consistent trend in the population normalised mass loads observed for cocaine and MDMA at the urban site between 2009 and 2015. In contrast, there was a five-fold increase in methamphetamine consumption over this period in this catchment. For methamphetamine consumption, the rural area showed a very similar trend as the urban catchment starting at a lower baseline. The observed increase in per capita loads of methamphetamine via wastewater analysis over the past six years in South East Queensland provides objective evidence for increased methamphetamine consumption in the Australian population while the use of other illicit stimulants remained relatively stable.

AB Obtaining representative information on illicit drug use and patterns across a country remains difficult using surveys because of low response rates and response biases. A range of studies have used wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a complementary approach to monitor community-wide illicit drug use. In Australia, no large-scale WBE studies have been conducted to date to reveal illicit drug use profiles in a national context. In this study, we performed the first Australia-wide WBE monitoring to examine spatial patterns in the use of three illicit stimulants (cocaine, as its human metabolite benzoylecgonine; methamphetamine; and 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)). A total of 112 daily composite wastewater samples were collected from 14 wastewater treatment plants across four states and two territories. These covered approximately 40% of the Australian population. We identified and quantified illicit drug residues using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. There were distinctive spatial patterns of illicit stimulant use in Australia. Multivariate analyses showed that consumption of cocaine and MDMA was higher in the large cities than in rural areas. Also, cocaine consumption differed significantly between different jurisdictions. Methamphetamine consumption was more similar between urban and rural locations. Only a few cities had elevated levels of use. Extrapolation of the WBE estimates suggested that the annual consumption was 3 tonnes for cocaine and 9 tonnes combined for methamphetamine and MDMA, which outweighed the annual seizure amount by 25 times and 45 times, respectively. These ratios imply the difficulty of detecting the trafficking of these stimulants in Australia, possibly more so for methamphetamine than cocaine. The obtained spatial pattern of use was compared with that in the most recent national household survey. Together both WBE and survey methods provide a more comprehensive evaluation of drug use that can assist governments in developing policies to reduce drug use and harm in the communities.

AB In this study, we systematically investigated the potential applicability of potassium permanganate for removal of triclosan (TCS) in water treatment. A series of kinetic experiments were carried out to study the influence of various factors, including the pH, oxidant doses, temperature, and presence of typical anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-), humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (FA) on triclosan removal. The optimal reaction conditions were: pH = 8.0, [TCS](0):[KMnO4](0) = 1:2.5, and T = 25 degrees C, where 20 mg/L of TCS could be completely degraded in 120 s. However, the rate of TCS (20 mu g/L) oxidation by KMnO4 ([TCS](0):1KMnO(4)](0) = 1:2.5) was 1.64 x 10(-3) mg L-1 .h(-1), lower than that at an initial concentration of 20 mg/L (2.24 x 10(3) mg L-1.h(-1)). A total of eleven products were detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole -time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) analysis, including phenol and its derivatives, benzoquinone, an organic acid, and aldehyde. Two main reaction pathways involving C-O bond cleavage (-C(8)-0(7)) and benzene ring opening (in the less chlorinated benzene ring) were proposed, and were further confirmed based on frontier electron density calculations and point charges. Furthermore, the changes in the toxicity of the reaction solution during TCS oxidation by KMnO4 were evaluated by using both the luminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and the water flea Daphnia magna. The toxicity of 20 mg/L triclosan to D. magna and P. phosphoreum after 60 min was reduced by 95.2% and 43.0%, respectively. Phenol and 1,4-benzoquinone, the two representative degradation products formed during permanganate oxidation, would yield low concentrations of DBP5 (STHMFP, 20.99-278.97 mu g/mg; SHAAFP, 7.86 x 10(-4)-45.77 jig/mg) after chlorination and chloramination. Overall, KMnO4 can be used as an effective oxidizing agent for TCS removal in water and wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotks have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse bio-effect and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance. This study investigated the degradation kinetics of sulfonamide antibiotics in synthetic wastewater and hydrolyzed human urine by low pressure (LP) UV, UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS). Direct photolysis rates of sulfonamide antibiotics varied and depended on the structures. Sulfonamides with a five-membered heterocyclic group underwent faster direct photolysis. For indirect photolysis processes, second-order rate constants of sulfonamide antibiotics with hydroxyl radical, sulfate radical and carbonate radical were determined, which were (6.21-9.26) x 10(9), (0.77-16.1) x 10(10) and (1.25-8.71) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. A dynamic model was applied and successfully predicted the degradation kinetics of sulfonamides in different water matrices. In synthetic wastewater, carbonate radical contributed to approximately 10% of the overall removal, whereas in synthetic hydrolyzed urine, carbonate radical was the dominant reactive species to degrade sulfonamides. Sulfonamide antibiotics were eliminated more efficiently in synthetic hydrolyzed urine than in synthetic wastewater and UV/PDS was more efficient than UV/H2O2 to degrade most sulfonamides. Energy evaluation showed that UV/PDS costs less energy than LPUV and UV/H2O2 under the experimental conditions applied in this study, particularly for sulfonamides whose indirect photolysis overweighed direct photolysis. By varying UV dose and oxidant dose, the UV/H2O2 process can be optimized to achieve higher efficiency than the UV/PDS process in synthetic wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large amount of iodinated contrast media (ICM) are found in natural waters (up to mu g.L-1 levels) due to their worldwide use in medical imaging and their poor removal by conventional wastewater treatment. Synthetic water samples containing different ICM and natural organic matter (NOM) extracts were subjected to UV254 irradiation followed by the addition of chlorine (HOCl) or chloramine (NH2Cl) to simulate final disinfection. In this study, two new quantum yields were determined for diatrizoic acid (0.071 mol.Einstein(-1)) and iotalamic acid (0.038 mol.Einstein(-1)) while values for iopromide (IOP) (0.039 mol.Einstein(-1)), iopamidol (0.034 mol.Einstein(-1)) and iohexol (0.041 mol.Einstein(-1)) were consistent with published data. The photodegradation of IOP led to an increasing release of iodide with increasing UV doses. Iodide is oxidized to hypoiodous acid (HOI) either by HOCl or NH2Cl. In presence of NOM, the addition of oxidant increased the formation of iodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs). On one hand, when the concentration of HOCl was increased, the formation of I-DBPs decreased since HOI was converted to iodate. On the other hand, when NH2Cl was used the formation of I-DBPs was constant for all concentration since HOI reacted only with NOM to form I-DBPs. Increasing the NOM concentration has two effects, it decreased the photodegradation of IOP by screening effect but it increased the number of reactive sites available for reaction with HOI. For experiments carried out with HOCl, increasing the NOM concentration led to a lower formation of I-DBPs since less IOP are photodegraded and iodate are formed. For NH2Cl the lower photodegradation of IOP is compensated by the higher amount of NOM reactive sites, therefore, I-DBPs concentrations were constant for all NOM concentrations. 7 different NOM extracts were tested and almost no differences in 101, degradation and I-DBPs formation was observed. Similar behaviour was observed for the 5 ICM tested. Both oxidant poorly degraded the ICM and a higher formation of I-DBPs was observed for the chloramination experiments compared to the chlorination experiment. Results from toxicity testing showed that the photodegradation products of IOP are toxic and confirmed that the formation of I-DBPs leads to higher toxicity. Therefore, for the experiment with HOCl where iodate are formed the toxicity was lower than for the experiments with NH2Cl where a high formation of I-DBPs was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim: Analysis of wastewater samples can be used to assess population drug use, but reporting and statistical issues have limited the utility of the approach for epidemiology due to analytical results that are below the limit of quantification or detection. Unobserved or non-quantifiable-censored-data are common and likely to persist as the methodology is applied to more municipalities and a broader array of substances. We demonstrate the use of censored data techniques and account for measurement errors to explore distributions and annual estimates of the daily mean level of drugs excreted per capita. Measurements: Daily 24-hour composite wastewater samples for 56 days in 2009 were obtained using a random sample stratified by day of week and season for 19 municipalities in the Northwest region of the U.S.
   Methods: Methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone were identified and quantified in wastewater samples. Four statistical approaches (reporting censoring, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Kaplan-Meier estimates, or complete data calculations) were used to estimate an annual average, including confidence bounds where appropriate, dependent upon the amount of censoring in the data.
   Findings: The proportion of days within a year with censored data varied greatly by drug across the 19 municipalities, with MDMA varying the most (4% to 94% of observations censored). The different statistical approaches each needed to be used given the levels of censoring of measured drug concentrations. Figures incorporating confidence bounds allow visualization of the data that facilitates appropriate comparisons across municipalities. Conclusions: Results from wastewater sampling that are below detection or quantification limits contain important information and can be incorporated to create a more complete and valid estimate of drug excretion.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of contiguous groundwater is a substantial concern in wastewater-impacted streams, due to ubiquity in effluent, high aqueous mobility, designed bioactivity, and to effluent-driven hydraulic gradients. Wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) closures are rare environmental remediation events; offering unique insights into contaminant persistence, long-term wastewater impacts, and ecosystem recovery processes. The USGS conducted a combined pre/post-closure groundwater assessment adjacent to an effluent-impacted reach of Fourmile Creek, Ankeny, Iowa, USA. Higher surface-water concentrations, consistent surface-water to groundwater concentration gradients, and sustained groundwater detections tens of meters from the stream bank demonstrated the importance of WWTF effluent as the source of groundwater pharmaceuticals as well as the persistence of these contaminants under effluent-driven, pre-closure conditions. The number of analytes (110 total) detected in surface water decreased from 69 prior to closure down to 8 in the first post-closure sampling event approximately 30 d later, with a corresponding 2 order of magnitude decrease in the cumulative concentration of detected analytes. Post-closure cumulative concentrations of detected analytes were approximately 5 times higher in proximal groundwater than in surface water. About 40% of the 21 contaminants detected in a downstream groundwater transect immediately before WWTF closure exhibited rapid attenuation with estimated half-lives on the order of a few days; however, a comparable number exhibited no consistent attenuation during the year-long post-closure assessment. The results demonstrate the potential for effluent-impacted shallow groundwater systems to accumulate pharmaceutical contaminants and serve as long-term residual sources, further increasing the risk of adverse ecological effects in groundwater and the near-stream ecosystem.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter soils through reclaimed water irrigation and biosolid land applications. Colloids, such as clays, that are present in soil may interact with PPCPs and thus affect their fate and transport in the subsurface environment. This study addresses the influence of soil colloids on the sorption and transport behaviors of PPCPs through laboratory column experiments. Results show that the affinities of PPCPs for colloids vary with their molecular chemistry and solution ionic strength. The presence of colloids promotes the breakthrough of ciprofloxacin (over 90% sorbed on colloids) from similar to 4% to 30-40%, and the colloid-facilitated effect was larger at lower ionic strength (e.g., 2 mM). In comparison, the net effect of colloids on the transport of tetracycline (similar to 50% sorbed on colloids) could be facilitation or inhibition, depending on solution chemistry. This dual effect of colloids is primarily due to the opposite response of migration of dissolved and colloid-bound tetracycline to the change in solution ionic strength. Colloids could also facilitate the transport of ibuprofen (similar to 10% sorbed on colloids) by similar to 50% due likely to exclusion of dispersion pathways by colloid straining. This study suggests that colloids are significant carriers or transport promoters of some PPCPs in the subsurface environment and could affect their off-site environmental risks.

AB Twelve selected pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics and lipid regulators were analysed and detected in water samples collected from 18 sampling sections along the three main urban rivers in Yangpu District of Shanghai, China during four sampling campaigns. Besides, algal growth inhibition test was conducted to preliminarily assess the eco-toxicology induced by the target pharmaceuticals in the rivers. Mean levels for most of target compounds were generally below 100 ng/L at sampling sections, with the exception of caffeine and paracetamol presenting considerably high concentration. The detected pharmaceuticals in the urban rivers ranged from <LOQ for propranolol to 8571 ng/L for caffeine. Qiujiang River could be regarded as the most polluted according to total detected pharmaceutical concentrations. The target pharmaceuticals varied and fluctuated irregularly from the upstreams to the downstreams of the three rivers, indicating the wastewater inputs from non-point sources and their individual different characteristics of transference and transportation. Preliminary eco-toxicological risk assessment showed that the presence of azithromycin, clarithromycin and caffeine may present an ecotoxicological risk in the urban rivers. For other tested pharmaceuticals the inhibition effects of single substances in the urban aquatic environment, based on the algae inhibition tests, were very imperceptible.

AB The discharge of persistent and mobile organic chemicals (PMOCs) into the aquatic environment is a threat to the quality of our water resources. PMOCs are highly polar (mobile in water) and can pass through wastewater treatment plants, subsurface environments and potentially also drinking water treatment processes. While a few such compounds are known, we infer that their number is actually much larger. This Feature highlights the issue of PMOCs from an environmental perspective and assesses the gaps that appear to exist in terms of analysis, monitoring, water treatment and regulation. On this basis we elaborate strategies on how to narrow these gaps with the intention to better protect our water resources.

AB The presence of estrogens in the environment and their effects especially on reproductive health on aquatic animals and on humans has become a subject of growing concern worldwide. This paper describes the preliminary data and tests performed in order to obtain and optimize a new gas chromatographic method for the identification of the most common found estrogen in the environment, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. For this purpose, a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector and a chromatographic column DB-5MS has been used and the specific parameters have been optimized. The developed analytical method was then tested on two types of water (waste water and surface water). The processing of samples followed several steps, involving liquid-liquid extraction, concentration, purification and derivatization. The linearity range of the method has been established between 0.025 - 0.100 mu g/L. The recovery for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol fortified water samples reached 85.30 %.

AB Agricultural crops have a long history of being irrigated with recycled wastewater (RW). However, its use on vegetable crops has been of concern due to the potential prevalence of microcontaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the latter, which represents a possible health hazard to consumers. We investigated the uptake of three PPCPs (atenolol, diclofenac, and ofloxacin), at three different concentrations in irrigation water (0.5, 5, and 25 mu g L-1) in relation to three varying volumetric soil moisture depletion levels of 14 % (-4.26 kPa), 10 % (-8.66 kPa), and 7 % (-18.37 kPa) by various vegetable crop species. Experiments were conducted in a split-split block completely randomized design. PPCPs were extracted using a developed method of accelerated solvent extraction and solid phase extraction and analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Results indicate that all treated crops were capable of PPCP uptake at nanogram per gram concentrations independent of the applied soil moisture depletion levels and PPCP concentrations. Ofloxacin was the chemical with the highest uptake amounts, followed by atenolol and then diclofenac. Although the results were not statistically significant, higher concentrations of PPCPs were detected in plants maintained under higher soil moisture levels of 14 % (-4.26 kPa).

AB We analyzed illicit drugs and their metabolites and pharmaceuticals in wastewater from 15 selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Slovakia. Our results indicate that methamphetamine is one of the most commonly used illegal drugs in all the regions of Slovakia monitored in this study. Compared with the international results, the Slovak cities of Dunajska Streda (479 mg/day/1000inh) and Trnava (354 mg/day/1000inh) are among the cities with the largest numbers of methamphetamine users in Europe. These results indicate an increase in the incidence of drugs in big cities and in the satellite cities (Trnava and Dunajska Streda) near Bratislava. These results also confirm the police statistics about production and use of illicit drugs in Slovakia. The highest specific loads of cocaine were found in Bratislava (112 mg/day/1000inh), followed by PetrA3/4alka (74 mg/day/1000inh). Compared with other European cities, Bratislava and the other Slovak cities in this study have a relatively low number of COC consumers. The ecstasy load in wastewater from larger cities also significantly increased over the weekend and during music festivals. The highest 2-year mean concentrations of THC-COOH, a cannabis biomarker, were observed in the sewage from BA-PetrA3/4alka and BA-Central (191 and 171 ng/L, respectively). A first complex monitoring of pharmaceuticals in all therapeutic groups was also realized in selected Slovak WWTPs. Occurrence of wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals with very high concentrations as well as consumptions were observed mainly in small Slovak cities. Considering all 120 monitored pharmaceuticals, Valsartan had the highest concentrations: 6000 ng/L, on average.

AB Zinc oxide nano-particles were synthesized, characterized and used for photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline using UV-C and visible light. Effects of several operational factors including initial pH of antibiotic solution, initial antibiotic concentration and ZnO nano-particles loading amount were investigated. Comparing photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of doxycycline under UV-C and visible light showed successful application of the method under both light sources. However, reaction rate was higher under UV-C irradiation, which degraded doxycycline almost completely in 5 hours, and 68% mineralization was achieved. Synthesized ZnO nano-particles were successfully applied for photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline in a pharmaceutical wastewater sample. The process was fitted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with rate constants in the range of 6-22 (x10(-3)) mg L-1 min(-1) with respect to initial concentration of doxycycline under UV-C irradiation. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was also employed for describing the photocatalytic reaction with surface reaction kinetic constant k(c) and equilibrium adsorption constant K-LH values calculated as 0.12 mg L-1 min(-1) and 2.2 L mg(-1), respectively. Degradation of doxycycline was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy and a validated stability indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method that was developed using stressed samples of doxycycline and could selectively determine doxycycline in the presence of its degradation products. Mass spectrometry was used for determining final degradation products.

AB The adsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal care product, Bisphenol-A (BPA), according to four coal-based and four wood-based granular activated carbons modified using outgassing treatment, acidic treatment or alkaline treatment was studied. The adsorption isotherm results indicated that carbon surface acidity played a very important role in the adsorption of BPA. It was found that increasing surface acidity would increase the hydrogen bonding effects and increase adsorption of BPA on activated carbon. The acidic modified sample (F600-A and OLC-A) represented the best adsorption capacity, and the equilibrium adsorption amounts reached 346.42 and 338.55 mg/g, respectively. Further, effects of surface charge and surface basicity were examined. It was found that the adsorbed amount of BPA decreased with the increase of surface charge. Finally, there appeared to be a significant oligomerization phenomenon with BPA molecules onto the surface of activated carbon. OLC and OLC-OG, which have higher micropore percentages, are very effective in hampering the oligomerization of BPA under oxic conditions.

AB In present study, we have investigated the treatment of Ayurveda pharmaceutical wastewater (APW) by electrocoagulation (EC) treatment method to minimize the energy consumed per unit mass of COD removed and maximize the color and COD removals by using the stainless steel (SS) and aluminum (Al) electrodes. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the multiple responses during the batch mode study of APW treatment. A full factorial central composite experimental design has been used to determine the experiments for each factors and optimize the responses: color removal (R-1), COD removal (R-2), and energy consumed per unit mass of COD removed (R-3). At optimized conditions, R-1 = 97.83%, R-2 = 58.35% and R-3 = 27.12 kWh/kg COD removed for Al electrodes and R-1 = 95.35%, R-2 = 78.88% and R-3 = 28.32 kWh/kg COD removed for SS electrodes, respectively were obtained. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) have been used to determine the EC treatment mechanism and disposal aspects of EC solid residue (scum and sludge). EC treatment mechanism of APW seems to be a combination of electro-floatation, electro-oxidation, and electro-coagulation. (C) 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of certain pharmaceutical compounds in ground- and surface waters may constitute a serious environmental problem, even at low concentrations. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment indicates incomplete removal of these pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study four representative pharmaceutical compounds were identified and quantified in influent and effluent of WWTPs around the Region of Murcia. In addition, the removal efficiencies of the five different treatment systems employed by these WWTPs were evaluated for the four pharmaceutical compounds. Influent and effluent wastewaters were sampled on a weekly basis during four consecutive weeks and compound concentrations were quantitatively determined by HPLC-DAD.
   Pharmaceuticals were detected at mu g/L levels (0.34-26.52 mu g/L) in influent and effluent samples from all five different systems of the twelve WWTPs sampled in this work. The two most abundant pharmaceutical compounds were carbamazepine and naproxen. WWTPs that worked with extended aeration activated sludge processes, coagulation-flocculation, sand filtration and as tertiary treatment processes are used ultraviolet and chlorination systems (EAAS + C-F + SF + UV + Cl) removed better carbamazepine and ketoprofen than conventional activated sludge system with a double aeration tank, sand filtration, lamination, coagulation-flocculation and as tertiary treatment processes are used ultraviolet systems (CAS-DS + L + C-F + SF + UV) that removed better naproxen and diclofenac.

AB Emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals are a class of compounds that are causing great concern due to several environmental problems. Conventional water and wastewater treatments do not achieve high removal efficiencies for many of these drugs. Therefore, the present work investigated the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) by heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2 irradiated with artificial UV light or solar radiation. The treated solutions were tested against Daphnia similis and Raphidocelis subcapitata, which are species commonly used as bioindicators of environmental conditions. The results indicated that IBP removal reached 92 % after 1 h of treatment using artificial UV and 1000 mg L-1 of TiO2, which was the optimum catalyst concentration in the range studied (20-1000 mg L-1). TOC removal reached up to 78 % after 60 min of treatment using TiO2/artificial UV. Ecotoxicological bioassays indicated that the treated solutions had acute effects, with 30 % immobilization of D. similis and 40 % growth inhibition of R. subcapitata.

AB The aim of this work was to study the effect of tetracycline, which is on the growth, physiological characteristics, and contaminants removal by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results showed that the biomass and photosynthetic pigment concentration of C. reinhardtii exposed to tetracycline were lower than those of the control, while the superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activities, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, were higher than those of the control. Additionally, when the tetracycline concentration reached 0.25 mg/L, the removal of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased from 80.8 to 55.0%, 100 to 92.5%, and 36.5 to 11.5%, respectively. Thus, tetracycline concentrations of 0-0.25 mg/L are expected to have a significant effect on the growth and nutrient removal of C. reinhardtii in recycled water from wastewater treatment plants.

AB The eicosapentaenoic acid rich marine eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis oceanica was grown in wastewaters sampled from four different industries (i.e. pesticides industry, pharmaceutical industry, activated sludge treatment plant of municipality sewage and petroleum (oil) industry). Under the wastewater based growth conditions used in this study, the biomass productivity ranged from 21.78 +/- 0.87 to 27.78 +/- 0.22 mg L (1) d (1) in relation to freeze dried biomass, while the lipid productivity varied between 5.59 +/- 0.02 and 6.81 +/- 0.04 mg L (1) d (1). Although comparatively higher biomass, lipid and EPA productivity was observed in Conway medium, the % EPA content was similarly observed in pesticides industry and municipal effluents. The results highlight the possibility of selectively using wastewater as a growth medium, demonstrating the elevated eicosapentaenoic acid content and biodiesel properties, that complies with the European standards for biodiesel.

AB Increased interest over the levels of pharmaceuticals detected in the environment has led to the need for new approaches to manage their emissions. Inappropriate disposal of unused and waste medicines and release from manufacturing plants are believed to be important pathways for pharmaceuticals entering the environment. In situ treatment technologies, which can be used on-site in pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and at manufacturing plants, might provide a solution. In this study we explored the use of Pyropure, a microscale combined pyrolysis and gasification in situ treatment system for destroying pharmaceutical wastes. This involved selecting 17 pharmaceuticals, including 14 of the most thermally stable compounds currently in use and three of high environmental concern to determine the technology's success in waste destruction. Treatment simulation studies were done on three different waste types and liquid, solid, and gaseous emissions from the process were analyzed for parent pharmaceutical and known active transformation products. Gaseous emissions were also analyzed for NOx, particulates, dioxins, furans, and metals. Results suggest that Pyropure is an effective treatment process for pharmaceutical wastes: over 99 % of each study pharmaceutical was destroyed by the system without known active transformation products being formed during the treatment process. Emissions of the other gaseous air pollutants were within acceptable levels. Future uptake of the system, or similar in situ treatment approaches, by clinics, pharmacists, and manufacturers could help to reduce the levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment and reduce the economic and environmental costs of current waste management practices.

AB Recycling sludge as a soil amendment has both positive and negative effects because of its enrichment in both nutrients and contaminants. So far; the negative effect has to be extensively investigated that the severities of different types of contaminants also remain unclear. The environmental behavior and risk of organic contaminant and pharmaceuticals, heavy metal and salt as well as pathogenic microorganisms brought by sludge amendment are summarized and discussed here. Organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals are typically found at low concentrations in sludge, the risks from sludge-amended soil decrease over time owing to its biodegradability. On the other hand, application of sludge generally increases soil salinity, which may cause physiological damage to plants grown in sludge-amended soil. In some extent, this negative effect can be alleviated by means of dilution; however, greater attention should be paid to long term increasing possible risk of eutrophication. Heavy metal (particularly of mobile heavy metals, such as Cd) with high concentrations in sludge and soil receiving considerable sludge can cause its incremental abundance in soil and crop contamination, further posing risks to humans, but most cases showed that there remained not excessive in heavy metal caused by sludge amendment. It is worth noting that increasing soil organic matter content may reduce transfer of heavy metal from soil to crops, but not restrict its uptake by crops at all. Combined literature together, it is summarized that heavy metal becomes a relatively severe bottleneck in recycling of sludge as soil amendment due to its non biodegradability and potential damage to health by adventuring contamination from agricultural products. Particular attention should therefore be paid to long term monitoring the change of heavy metals concentration in sludge amended soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study is the first to investigate the pharmaceutical burden from point sources affecting the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Kristianstads Vattenrike, Sweden. The investigated Biosphere Reserve is a > 1000 km(2) wetland system with inflows from lakes, rivers, leachate from landfill, and wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs). We analysed influent and treated wastewater, leachate water, lake, river, and wetland water alongside sediment for six model pharmaceuticals. The two WWTPs investigated released pharmaceutical residues at levels close to those previously observed in Swedish monitoring exercises. Compound-dependent WWTP removal efficiencies ranging from 12 to 100 % for bendroflumethiazide, oxazepam, atenolol, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were observed. Surface-water concentrations in the most affected lake were aeyen100 ng/L for the various pharmaceuticals with atenolol showing the highest levels (> 300 ng/L). A small risk assessment showed that adverse single-substance toxicity on aquatic organisms within the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is unlikely. However, the effects of combinations of a large number of known and unknown pharmaceuticals, metals, and nutrients are still unknown.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of numerous pharmaceuticals found in treated municipal wastewater discharged to the environment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term (96 h) waterborne FIX exposure (1 mu g/L or 100 mu g/L) on the expression of selected genes in brain, liver, and gonads of female Murray-Darling rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis), a small-bodied teleost of ecotoxicological relevance in the Australasia region. Plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels were also determined. In the brain, no significant changes in mRNA levels were observed for the selected genes. In ovaries, 100 mu g/L FLX caused a 10-fold downregulation of aromatase A (cyp19a1a) mRNA and a 4-fold upregulation of estrogen receptor alpha(esr1) mRNA levels. In liver, mRNA levels for vitellogenin A (vtga) and choriogenin L (chgl) were downregulated by 50-fold and 18-fold compared with controls, respectively, in response to 100 mu g/L FLX. Concentrations of E2 in plasma were significantly lower than controls in response to 100 mu g/L FLX. This could be attributable to a decrease in estrogen biosynthesis as a result of the observed downregulation of cyp19a1a mRNA. To establish whether the observed changes in gene expression could be explained by the modulation of selected nuclear receptors by FLX, we employed panel of reporter gene assays in agonistic and antagonistic modes. Apart from minor activation of ER alpha after exposure to high concentrations (5 mu M), FLX did not activate or inhibit the nuclear receptors tested. Further study is required to determine whether the observed downregulation of ovarian aromatase expression and liver estrogen regulated genes also occurs at environmentally relevant FLX concentrations over longer exposure periods.

AB Several environmental stressors have been identified as key and/or emerging drivers of habitat change that could significantly influence marine near-shore ecosystems. These include increasing discharges of pharmaceutical contaminants into the aquatic coastal systems. Pharmaceutical drugs are often detected in aquatic environments but still information on their toxicity impacts on inhabiting species is scarce, especially when acting in combination. Furthermore, almost no information is available on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in polychaetes, often the most abundant taxon in benthic communities and commonly used as indicator species of environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biochemical alterations induced in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, from a low contaminated area at the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal), by the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (0.0 -control, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 mu g/L) and the stimulant caffeine (0.0 -control, 0.5, 3.0, and 18.0 mu g/L), acting alone and in combination (0.3 CBZ + 0.5 CAF and 6.0 CBZ + 3.0 CAF). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities was determined in Hediste diversicolor from each condition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reduced and oxidized (GSH and GSSG), glycogen and electron transport system (ETS) were also measured. The results obtained clearly revealed that both drugs induced oxidative stress in H. diversicolor, shown by the increase on LPO levels and decrease on total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio with the increase of exposure concentrations. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that polychaetes biotransformation capacity as well as antioxidant defense mechanisms were not sufficiently efficient to fight against the excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to LPO when organisms were exposed to both drugs. Our results also demonstrated that polychaetes tended to decrease the activity of ETS when exposed to drugs, avoiding energy expenditure which may prevent them from greater damages. The present study further revealed that the impacts induced by the combination of both drugs were similar to those obtained at the highest drugs concentrations acting alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study attempted to clarify the long-term pharmaceutical removal mechanism from sewage treatment plant effluent during the cyclical adsorption-regeneration operation of 5 commercial resin-based fixed-bed reactors with the simultaneous occurrence of electrostatic interactions and complex non electrostatic interactions. It examined 12 pharmaceuticals belonging to 10 therapeutic classes with different predominant existing forms and hydrophobicities. Furthermore, the effect of the resin charged functional group (strong-base vs. strong-acid vs. non-ionic), porosity (macroporous vs. gel), and chemical matrix (polystyrenic vs. polyacrylic) on the mechanism was investigated to optimize resin properties and achieve higher pharmaceutical removal. The results reported herein indicate the importance of non electrostatic interactions between pharmaceuticals and the resin backbone during short-term cyclical operation (i.e., the 1st adsorption-regeneration cycle). With the development of cyclical operation, however, non-electrostatic interaction-induced pharmaceutical removal generally decreased and even disappeared when equilibrium was achieved between the influent and the resin. Despite pharmaceutical therapeutic class or hydrophilicity, anion (or cation) exchange resin preferentially removed those pharmaceuticals that were predominantly present as organic anions (or cations) by ion exchange process during long-term cyclical operation (i.e., >= 6 adsorption-regeneration cycles). Besides pharmaceuticals predominantly present as undissociated molecules, some amphoteric pharmaceuticals containing large amounts of zwitterions were also difficult to remove by ion exchange resin. Additionally, neither resin porosity nor chemical matrix had any significant effect on the long-term pharmaceutical removal mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a fully automated analytical method, based on online solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-LC-MS/MS), has been developed and optimized for the quantification of 10 illicit drugs and metabolites in environmentally aqueous samples collected from China. The particular attention was devoted to minimize the matrix effects through a washing step, which washed out the interferences effectively and helped to reduce the matrix effect significantly. The key advantages of the method are high sensitivity, selectivity and reliability of results, smaller sample manipulation, full automation, and fairly high throughput. The whole procedure was then successfully applied in the analysis of various surface water and wastewater effluents samples. Pseudoephedrine have been detected at trace levels (several tens ng L-1 or less), while MDA, MDMA, benzoylecgonine and methadone were below the LOQ in all samples. Caffeine, cotinine and paraxanthine, which may be derived from medicines and foods, were detected with the highest frequencies and concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of 12 commonly used antibiotics, two fluoroquinolones (FQs), three sulfonamides (SAs), three macrolides (MLs), two beta-lactams and two tetracyclines (TCs), were studied in four sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their receiving water, the Huangpu River, Shanghai. The levels of selected antibiotics in the STPs ranged from ng L-1 to mu g L-1, while ofloxacin (OFL) was predominant (reach up to 2936.94 ng L-1). The highest and lowest proportions were of FQs (STP 1, STP 2 and STP 3) and TCs (in four STPs) respectively in both influents and effluents. And the second-highest proportion was of FQs in STP 4 (only 2% lower than the highest). What could be inferred was that the usage of TCs were extremely low while the usage of FQs were larger than other antibiotics in our study area. The elimination of antibiotics through these STPs was incomplete and a wide range of removal efficiencies (-442.8% to 100%) during the treatment was observed. Based on the mass loadings as well as the per capita mass loadings of target antibiotics in four STPs, OFL was considered the primary contaminant herein. In the Huangpu River, 3 antibiotics were not detected in any water samples, while the detection frequencies of 4 antibiotics were 100%. The highest concentration detected in the river was 53.91 ng L-1 of sulfapyridine (SD). The Spearman correlation analysis of antibiotics in STPs and the nearby water samples suggests that the antibiotics discharged from some STPs might influence the receiving water to some extent. Moreover, most of the hazard quotient (HQ) values in STP effluents were one order magnitude higher than those in their receiving water. However, there is no imminent significant ecotoxicological risk caused by any single compound in the effluents and receiving waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence of antibiotics and heavy metals, together with concentrations of conventional pollution indicators were assessed in digested piggery wastewater (DPW) generated in ten large-scale pig farms in Jiaxing City, China. Results showed that water quality of DPW varied in different farms as well as in different seasons. Digested piggery wastewater pollution tended to be less serious in Summer than in Spring, Autumn and Winter. Conventional pollution indicators of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (TP) in Spring ranged 1008 - 18479 mg/L, 205 - 2228 mg/L, 119 - 1936 mg/L and 32.6 - 306 mg/L, respectively, being four times higher than those in Summer. Pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in DPW was very severe for all farms. Six heavy metals (copper, Cu; zinc, Zn; lead, Pb; cadmium, Cd; nickel, Ni; and chromium, Cr) and ten antibiotics (three tetracyclines, two sulfonamides, three macrolides and two quinolones) were detectable in all the ten farms. Copper and Zn accounted for 97 +/- 3% of the total heavy metals concentrations, and their concentrations reached the discharge limits of 0.5 mg/L (Cu) and 1.5 mg/L (Zn) in most cases. The total concentrations of the ten antibiotics were in the range of 0.155 - 1,090 mu g/L. Heavy metals and antibiotics should be given intensive attention during resource utilization and treatment of DPW.

AB The degradation of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in a municipal wastewater treated by ozonation was characterized using the methods of high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and excitation/emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The removal of 40 diverse trace-level contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) present in the wastewater was determined as well. Ozonation caused a rapid decrease of the absorbance and fluorescence of the wastewater, which was associated primarily with the oxidation of high and low apparent molecular weight (AMW) EfOM fractions. PARAFAC analysis also showed that components C1 and C2 decreased prominently in these conditions. The EfOM fraction of intermediate molecular weight ascribable to a terrestrial humic-like component (C3) tended to be less reactive toward ozone. Relative changes of EEM fluorescence were quantified using F (max) values of PARAFAC-identified components (a dagger F/F (0) (max)). Unambiguous relationships between a dagger F/F (0) (max) values and the extent of the degradation of the examined CECs (a dagger C/C-0) were established. This allowed correlating main parameters of the a dagger C/C-0 vs. a dagger F/F (0) (max) relationships with the rates of oxidation of these CECs. The results demonstrate the potential of online measurements of EEM fluorescence for quantitating effects of ozonation on EfOM and micropollutants in wastewater effluents.

AB Effective management of water quality in large rivers requires information on the influence of activities within the catchment (urban and rural) throughout the whole river basin. However, traditional water quality monitoring programmes undertaken by individual agencies normally relate to specific objectives, such as meeting quality criteria for wastewater discharges, and fail to provide information on basin-scale impacts, especially in transboundary river basins. Ideally, monitoring in large international river basins should be harmonised to provide a basin-scale assessment of sources and impacts of human activities, and the effectiveness of management actions. This paper examines current water quality issues in the Danube River Basin and evaluates the approach to water quality monitoring in the context of providing information for a basin-wide management plan. Lessons learned from the monitoring programme in the Danube are used to suggest alternative approaches that could result in more efficient generation of water quality data and provide new insights into causes and impacts of variations in water quality in other large international river basins.

AB Water from six points from the Riachuelo-Matanza basin was analyzed in order to assess ibuprofen biodegradability. In four of them biodegradation of ibuprofen was proved and degrading bacterial communities were isolated. Biodegradation in each point could not be correlated with sewage pollution. The indigenous bacterial community isolated from the point localized in the La Noria Bridge showed the highest degradative capacity and was selected to perform batch and continuous degradation assays. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the community consisted of Comamonas aquatica and Bacillus sp. In batch assays the community was capable of degrading 100mgL(-1) of ibuprofen in 33h, with a specific growth rate () of 0.21h(-1). The removal of the compound, as determined by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), exceeded 99% of the initial concentration, with a 92.3% removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). In a down-flow fixed-bed continuous reactor, the community shows a removal efficiency of 95.9% of ibuprofen and 92.3% of COD for an average inlet concentration of 110.4mg. The reactor was kept in operation for 70 days. The maximal removal rate for the compound was 17.4gm(-3)d(-1). Scanning electron microscopy was employed to observe biofilm development in the reactor. The ability of the isolated indigenous community can be exploited to improve the treatment of wastewaters containing ibuprofen.

AB The release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into the environment has been held up as a potential threat to ecosystem and human health. Using a custom-designed survey of residents living in Xiamen, China, this paper examines individuals' disposal practices, awareness of the environmental impact of PPCPs, and willingness to pay for measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of PPCPs being released into the environment. The vast majority of respondents report that they dispose of PPCPs through the thrash. The results of a contingent valuation experiment suggest a substantial willingness to pay (WTP) for policy measures aimed at reducing PPCP pollution. Income as well as subjective perceptions relating to overall financial health, expenditure on PPCPs, and overall concern with environmental issues emerged as significant predictors of respondents' WTP. Our results should be of interest to policymakers looking for ways to mitigate the introduction of PPCPs in the environment. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB In the event of a foot and mouth disease outbreak, further spread of the virus is generally prevented by culling of infected animals in burial pits. This practice may eventually lead to groundwater contamination through leaching of wastewater from the animal carcasses. Wastewater from carcass leachate often contains antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes as well as traces of pharmaceuticals, and a high nutrient content. The role of operational parameters used in activated sludge treatment of this wastewater in the spread of antibiotic resistance has not been fully understood. This study investigated the fate of tetracycline-resistant bacteria and genes in sequencing batch reactors with synthetic carcass leachate at different solid retention times. Escherichia coli DH5 alpha was used as the representative tetracycline-resistant bacteria with multiple antibiotic-resistant genes encoded in plasmid pB10. Solids retention time contributed to an increase in antibiotic resistance in SBRC (SRT = 25 days) with TRB values up to 1.25 x 107 CFU/mL which is one log higher than the influent. Microbial community analysis of the DNA samples from effluent of SBRC showed four major phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria under which are ecologically-important microbial species. It was shown that antibiotic resistance genes cannot be eliminated during treatment of synthetic carcass leachate in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rural communities in central and eastern Europe usually use constructed wetlands (CWs) to treat domestic wastewater. Effluents from these systems are regularly discharged to receiving water, resulting in a potential transfer of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from sewage to the aquatic environment. In this study, the seasonal occurrence, removal and risk assessment of 32 multi-class PPCPs were investigated in three CWs from the village of south Bohemia, Czech Republic. Among the PPCPs considered, 25 compounds were detected in sewage influent, and ibuprofen, caffeine and paracetamol were the most commonly detected PPCPs. The removal efficiencies of PPCPs in the rural CWs exhibited large variability with 11-100% for anti-inflammatories, 37-99% for beta-blockers and 18-95% for diuretics. The statistical results revealed significant correlations between removal efficiencies of six PPCPs and conventional water quality parameters. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that most of the PPCPs (except ibuprofen) in the effluent yielded low aquatic risk. This study suggested that constructed wetlands could be effective for removing PPCPs and reducing environmental risk of PPCPs discharged from rural communities into surface water systems.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the potential of constructed wetlands (CWs) for removal of antibiotics (enrofloxacin and oxytetracycline) and antibiotic resistant bacteria from saline aquaculture wastewaters. Removal of other contaminants (nutrients, organic matter and metals) and toxicity reduction and the influence of antibiotics with these processes were evaluated. Thus, nine CWs microcosms, divided into three treatments, were assembled and used to treat wastewater (doped or not with the selected antibiotics) between October and December of 2015. Each week treated wastewater was removed and new wastewater (doped or not) was introduced in CWs. Results showed >99% of each antibiotic was removed in CWs. After three weeks of adaptation, removal percentages >95% were also obtained for total bacteria and for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Nutrients, organic matter and metal removal percentages in CWs treated wastewater were identical in the absence and in the presence of each antibiotic. Toxicity in treated wastewaters was significantly lower than in initial wastewaters, independently of antibiotics presence. Results showed CWs have a high efficiency for removing enrofloxacin or oxytetracycline as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria from saline aquaculture wastewaters. CWs can also remove other contaminants independently of drug presence, making the aquaculture wastewater possible to be reutilized and/or recirculated.

AB This annual review covers the literature published in 2015 on topics related to the occurrence and fate of emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater. Due to the vast amount of literature published on this topic, I have discussed only a fraction of the quality research publications, up to maximum 20 relevant articles per section, due to limitation of space. The abstract search was carried out using Web of Science, and the abstracts were selected based on their relevance. In few cases, full-text articles were referred to better understand new findings. This review is divided into the following sections: biological agents, disinfection by-products (DBPs), halogenated compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other emerging contaminants.

AB This review covers selected 2015 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due largely to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB Biosolids from wastewater treatment are primarily disposed of via land applications, where numerous pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) may contaminate food crops and pose a human exposure risk. Biosolids are rich in organic carbon and addition of biosolids can increase the sorption of certain PPCPs in soil, decreasing their bioavailability. This study tested the hypothesis that the relative plant uptake of PPCPs decreases with increasing biosolids amendment. Accumulation of triclosan and triclocarban was measured in roots of radish and carrot grown in soils with or without biosolids. Addition of biosolids significantly-prolonged the persistence of triclosan in soil. When expressed in bioaccumulation factor (BCF), accumulation of triclosan drastically decreased in biosolids-amended soils, while the effect was limited for triclocarban. Compared to the unamended soil, amending biosolids at 2% (w/w) decreased BCF of triclosan in the edible tissues of radish and carrot by 85.4 and 89.3%, respectively. Measurement using a thin-film passive sampler provided direct evidence showing that the availability of triclosan greatly decreased in biosolids-amended soils. Partial correlation analysis using data from this and published studies validated that biosolids decreased plant uptake primarily by increasing soil organic carbon content and subsequently sorption. Therefore, contamination of food crops by biosolids-borne contaminants does not linearly depend on biosolids use rates. This finding bears significant implications in the overall risk evaluation of biosolids-borne contaminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of emerging organic micropollutants (OMPs) in sewage sludge has been widely reported; nevertheless, their fate during sludge treatment remains unclear. The objective of this work was to study the fate of OMPs during mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD), the most common processes used for sludge stabilization, by using raw sewage sludge without spiking OMPs. Moreover, the results of analytical chemistry were complemented with biological assays in order to verify the possible adverse effects (estrogenic and genotoxic) on the environment and human health in view of an agricultural (re)use of digested sludge. Musk fragrances (AHTN, HHCB), ibuprofen (IBP) and triclosan (TCS) were the most abundant compounds detected in sewage sludge. In general, the efficiency of the AD process was not dependent on operational parameters but compound-specific: some OMPs were highly biotransformed (e.g. sulfamethoxazole and naproxen), while others were only slightly affected (e.g. IBP and TCS) or even unaltered (e.g. AHTN and HHCB). The MCF-7 assay evidenced that estrogenicity removal was driven by temperature. The Ames test did not show point mutation in Salmonella typhimurium while the Comet test exhibited a genotoxic effect on human leukocytes attenuated by AD. This study highlights the importance of combining chemical analysis and biological activities in order to establish appropriate operational strategies for a safer disposal of sewage sludge. Actually, it was demonstrated that temperature has an insignificant effect on the disappearance of the parent compounds while it is crucial to decrease estrogenicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Widespread occurrence of trace pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments is of great concerns due to the potential chronic toxicity of certain pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen on aquatic organisms even at environmental levels. In this study, the phytoextraction, phytotransformation and rhizodegradation of ibuprofen associated with Typha angustifolia were investigated in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system. The experimental wetland system consisted of a planted bed with Typha angustifolia and an unplanted bed (control) to treat ibuprofen-loaded wastewater (similar to 107.2 mu g L-1). Over a period of 342 days, ibuprofen was accumulated in leaf sheath and lamina tissues at a mean concentration of 160.7 ng g(-1), indicating the occurrence of the phytoextraction of ibuprofen. Root-uptake ibuprofen was partially transformed to ibuprofen carboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen and 1-hydroxy ibuprofen which were found to be 1374.9, 235.6 and 301.5 ng g(-1) in the sheath, respectively, while they were 1051.1, 693.6 and 178.7 ng g(-1) in the lamina. The findings from pyrosequencing analysis of the rhizosphere bacteria suggest that the Dechloromonas sp., the Clostridium sp. (e.g. Clostridium saccharobutylicum), the order Sphingobacteriales, and the Cytophaga sp. in the order Cytophagales were most probably responsible for the rhizodegradation of ibuprofen.

AB This study investigated the behaviour and characteristics of soluble microbial products (SMP) in two anoxic-aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs): MB-k-ontrol and MBRpharma, for treating municipal wastewater. Both protein and polysaccharides measured exhibited higher concentrations in the MBRpharma than the MBRcontrol. Molecular weight (MW) distribution analysis revealed that the presence of pharmaceuticals enhanced the accumulation of SMPs with macro- (13,091 kDa and 1587 kDa) and intermediate-MW (189 kDa) compounds in the anoxic MBRpharma, while a substantial decrease was observed in both MBR effluents. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence contours indicated that the exposure to pharmaceuticals seemed to stimulate the production of aromatic proteins containing tyrosine (10.1-32.6%) and tryptophan (14.7-43.1%), compared to MBRcontrol (9.9-29.1% for tyrosine; 11.8 42.5% for tryptophan). Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed aromatics, long-chain alkanes and esters were the predominant SMPs in the MBRs. More peaks were present in the aerobic MBRpharma (196) than anoxic MBRpharma (133). The SMPs identified exhibited both biodegradability and recalcitrance in the MBR treatment processes. Only 8 compounds in the MBRpharma were the same as in the MBRcontrol Alkanes were the most dominant SMPs (51%) in the MBRcontrol, while aromatics were dominant (40%) in the MBRpharma" A significant decrease in aromatics (from 16 to 7) in the MBRpharma permeate was observed, compared to the aerobic MBRpharma. Approximately 21% of compounds in the aerobic MBRcontrol were rejected by membrane filtration, while this increased to 28% in the MBRpharma (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Irrigation with reclaimed wastewater may result in the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and their metabolites in the agroecosystem. In this study, we focused on two highly persistent anticonvulsant drugs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine and two of its metabolites (EP-CBZ and DiOH-CBZ), aiming to elucidate their behavior in agricultural ecosystem using batch and lysimeter experiments. Sorption of the studied compounds by soils was found to be governed mainly by the soil organic matter level. Sorption affinity of compounds to soils followed the order lamotrigine > carbamazepine > EP-CBZ > DiOH-CBZ. Sorption was reversible, and no competition between sorbates in bi-solute systems was observed. The results of the lysimeter studies were in accordance with batch experiment findings, demonstrating accumulation of lamotrigine and carbamazepine in top soil layers enriched with organic matter. Detection of carbamazepine and one of its metabolites in rain-fed wheat previously irrigated with reclaimed wastewater, indicates reversibility of their sorption, resulting in their potential leaching and their availability for plant uptake. This study demonstrates the long-term implication of introduction of PCs to the agroecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seawater acidification could alter the susceptibility of marine organisms to emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals. In this study, the combined effects of seawater acidification and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac on survival, growth and oxidative stress-related parameters (catalase activity and lipid peroxidation) in the larvae of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum were investigated for the first time. An experimental flow-through system was set up to carry out a 96-h exposure of clam larvae. Two pH levels (pH 8.0, the control, and pH 7.8, the predicted pH by the end of this century) were tested with and without diclofenac (0.5 mu g/L). After 4 days, mortality was dramatically higher under reduced pH, particularly in the presence of diclofenac (62% of the larvae dead). Shell morphology was negatively affected by both acidification and diclofenac from the first day of exposure. The percentage of abnormal larvae was always higher at pH 7.8 than in controls, peaking at 98% in the presence of diclofenac after 96 h. Instead, shell length, shell height or the ratio of these values were only negatively influenced by reduced pH throughout the whole experiment.
   After 96 h, catalase activity was significantly increased in all larvae kept at pH 7.8, whereas no significant difference in lipid peroxidation was found among the treatments. This study demonstrates a high susceptibility of R. philippinarum larvae to a slight reduction in seawater pH. Furthermore, the results obtained highlight that acidification enhances the sensitivity of clam larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of diclofenac. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential through a membrane bioreactor (MBR) coupled to a nanofiltration (NF) pilot plant that treats urban wastewater is investigated. The results are compared to the fate of the individual NDMA precursors detected: azithromycin, citalopram, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ranitidine, venlafaxine and its metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine. Specifically, the effect of dissolved oxygen in the aerobic chamber of the MBR pilot plant on the removal of NDMA formation potential (FP) and individual precursors is studied.
   During normal aerobic operation, implying a fully nitrifying system, the MBR was able to reduce NDMA precursors above 94%, however this removal percentage was reduced to values as low as 72% when changing the conditions to minimize nitrification. Removal decreased also for azithromycin (68 -59%), citalopram (31-17%), venlafaxine (35-15%) and erythromycin (61-16%) on average during nitrifying versus non-nitrifying conditions. The removal of clarithromycin, o-desmethylvenlafaxine and ranitidine could not be correlated with the nitrification inhibition, as it varied greatly during the experiment time. The MBR pilot plant is coupled to a nanofiltration (NF) system and the results on the rejection of both, NDMA FP and individual precursors, through this system was above 90%.
   Finally, results obtained for the MBR pilot plant are compared to the percentage of removal by a conventional full scale biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) fed with the same influent. During aerobic operation, the removal of NDMA FP by the MBR pilot plant was similar to the full scale WWTP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, differing metrics were utilized to measure effects of erythromycin (ER), trimethoprim (TR) and clindamycin (CL) on the structure and function of attached Wascana Creek, SK microbial communities. All three test antibiotics, especially ER, affected community structure and function of biofilms grown in rotating annular reactors. Biofilm thickness, bacterial biomass, and lectin binding biovolume (exopolymeric substances) were consistently less in ER treated biofilms when compared to the control. As well negative effects on protozoan numbers, and carbon utilization were detected. Finally, PCA analyses of DGGE results indicated that bacterial community diversity in ER exposed biofilms was always different from the control. ER exhibited toxic effects even at lower concentrations. Observations on TR and CL exposed biofilms indicated that bacterial biomass, lectin binding biovolume and carbon utilization were negatively affected as well. In terms of bacterial community diversity, however, CL exposed biofilms tended to group with the control while TR grouped with nutrient additions suggesting both nutritive and toxic effects. This study results represent an important step in understanding antibiotic effects, especially ER, on aquatic microbial communities. And because ER is so ubiquitous in receiving water bodies worldwide, the Wascana study results suggest the possibility of ecosystem disturbance elsewhere.

AB Kinetic studies on the stability of the pain killer paracetamol in Al-Quds activated sludge demonstrated that paracetamol underwent biodegradation within less than one month to furnish p-aminophenol in high yields. Characterizations of bacteria contained in Al-Quds sludge were accomplished. It was found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the bacterium most responsible for the biodegradation of paracetamol to p-aminophenol and hydroquinone. Batch adsorptions of paracetamol and its biodegradation product (p-aminophenol) by activated charcoal and a composite micelle (octadecyltrimethylammonium)-clay (montmorillonite) were determined at 25 degrees C. Adsorption was adequately described by a Langmuir isotherm, and indicated better efficiency of removal by the micelle-clay complex. The ability of bench top reverse osmosis (RO) plant as well as advanced membrane pilot plant to remove paracetamol was also studied at different water matrixes to test the effect of organic matter composition. The results showed that at least 90% rejection was obtained by both plants. In addition, removal of paracetamol from RO brine was investigated by using photocatalytic processes; optimal conditions were found to be acidic or basic pH, in which paracetamol degraded in less than 5min. Toxicity studies indicated that the effluent and brine were not toxic except for using extra low energy membrane which displayed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) value of 80%.

AB A comprehensive study of spatial and temporal consumption patterns of the selected illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, methamphetamine, cannabis) and therapeutic opioids (codeine, methadone) has been performed in six Croatian cities by applying wastewater-based epidemiology. The investigated cities (Bjelovar, Vinkovci, Varazdin, Karlovac, Zadar and Zagreb) varied widely in the population size (27,000688,000 inhabitants) as well as in the number of registered drug consumers included in compulsory and voluntary medical treatment and rehabilitation programs (30-513 persons/100,000 inhabitants of age 15-64). The most consumed illicit drugs were cannabis (10-70 doses/day/1000 inhabitants), heroin (<0.2-10 doses/day/1000 inhabitants) and cocaine (0.2-8.7 doses/day/1000 inhabitants), while the consumption of amphetamine-type drugs was much lower (<0.01-4.4 doses/day/1000 inhabitants). Enhanced consumption of illegal drugs was generally associated with larger urban centers (Zagreb and Zadar) however comparatively high consumption rate of cocaine, MDMA and methadone was determined in some smaller cities as well. The overall average dose number of 3 major illegal stimulants (cocaine, MDMA, amphetamine) was rather similar to the number of corresponding heroin doses, which is in disagreement with a comparatively much higher proportion of heroin users in the total number of registered drug users in Croatia. Furthermore, the illicit drug consumption pattern in the large continental city (Zagreb) was characterized by a significant enhancement of the consumption of all stimulants during the weekend, which could not be confirmed neither for the coastal city of Zadar nor for the remaining small continental cities. On the other hand, the city of Zadar exhibited a significant increase of stimulant drug usage during summer vacation period, as a result of pronounced seasonal changes of the population composition and lifestyle in coastal tourist centers. The obtained results represent a valuable complementary data source for the optimisation and implementation of strategies to combat drug abuse in Croatia. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Septic systems, a common type of onsite wastewater treatment systems, can be an important source of micropollutants in the environment. We investigated the fate and mass balance of 17 micropollutants, including wastewater markers, hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the drainfield of a septic system. Drainfields were replicated in lysimeters (1.5 m length, 0.9 m width, 0.9 m height) and managed similar to the field practice. In each lysimeter, a drip line dispersed 9 L of septic tank effluent (STE) per day (equivalent to 32.29 L/m(2) per day). Fourteen micropollutants in the STE and 12 in the leachate from drainfields were detected over eight months. Concentrations of most micropollutants in the leachate were low (<200 ng/L) when compared to STE because >85% of the added micropollutants except for sucralose were attenuated in the drainfield. We discovered that sorption was the key mechanism for retention of carbamazepine and partially for sulfamethoxazole, whereas microbial degradation likely attenuated acetaminophen in the drainfield. This data suggests that sorption and microbial degradation limited transport of micropollutants from the drainfields. However, the leaching of small amounts of micropollutants indicate that septic systems are hot-spots of micropollutants in the environment and a better understanding of micropollutants in septic systems is needed to protect groundwater quality.

AB Jakarta is an Indonesian coastal megacity with over 10 million inhabitants. The rivers flowing through the city receive enormous amounts of untreated wastewaters and discharge their pollutant loads into Jakarta Bay. We utilized a screening approach to identify those site-specific compounds that represent the major contamination of the cities' water resources, and detected a total number of 71 organic contaminants in Jakarta river water samples. Especially contaminants originating from municipal wastewater discharges were detected in high concentrations, including flame retardants, personal care products and pharmaceutical drugs. A flame retardant, a synthetic fragrance and caffeine were used as marker compounds to trace the riverine transport of municipal wastewaters into Jakarta Bay. These markers are also appropriate to trace municipal wastewater discharges to other tropical coastal ecosystems. This application is in particular useful to evaluate wastewater inputs from land-based sources to habitats which are sensitive to changing water quality, like coral reefs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The economic crisis plaguing Greece was expected to impact consumption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs a priori to an unknown extent. We quantified the change of use for various classes of licit and illicit drugs by monitoring Athens' wastewater from 2010 to 2014. A high increase in the use of psychoactive drugs was detected between 2010 and 2014, especially for antipsychotics (35-fold), benzodiazepines (19-fold), and antidepressants (11-fold). This directly reflects the perceived increase of incidences associated with mental illnesses in the population, as a consequence of severe socioeconomic changes. Other therapeutic classes, like antiepileptics, hypertensives, and gastric and ulcer drugs also showed an increase in use (from 2-fold increase for antiepileptics to 13-fold for hypertensives). In contrast, the overall use of antibiotics and NSAIDs decreased. For mefenamic acid, an almost 28-fold decrease was observed. This finding is likely related to the reduction in drug expenditure applied in public health. A 2-fold increase of methamphetamine use was detected, associated with a cheap street drug called "sisa" (related to marginal conducts), which is a health concern. MDMA (5-fold) and methadone (7-fold) use showed also an increase, while cocaine and cannabis estimates did not show a clear trend.

AB Solar-powered electrochemical systems have shown promise for onsite wastewater treatment in regions where basic infrastructure for conventional wastewater treatment is not available. To assess the applicability of these systems for trace organic contaminant treatment, test compound electrolysis rate constants were measured in authentic latrine wastewater using mixed-metal oxide anodes coupled with stainless steel cathodes. Complete removal of ranitidine and cimetidine was achieved within 30 min of electrolysis at an applied potential of 3.5 V (0.7 A L-1). Removal of acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, propranolol, and carbamazepine (>80%) was achieved within 3 h of electrolysis. Oxidation of ranitidine, cimetidine, and ciprofloxacin was primarily attributed to reaction with NH2Cl. Transformation of trimethoprim, propranolol, and carbamazepine was attributed to direct electron transfer and to reactions with surface-bound reactive chlorine species. Relative contributions of aqueous phase center dot OH, center dot Cl, center dot Cl-2(-), HOCl/OCl-, and Cl-2 were determined to be negligible based on measured second-order reaction rate constants, probe compound reaction rates, and experiments in buffered Cl- solutions. Electrical energy per order of removal (E-EO) increased with increasing applied potentials and current densities. Test compound removal was most efficient at elevated Cl- concentrations present when treated wastewater is recycled for use as flushing water (i.e., similar to 75 mM Cl-; E-EO = 0.2-6.9 kWh log(-1) m(-3)). Identified halogenated and oxygenated electrolysis products typically underwent further transformations to unidentifiable products within the 3 h treatment cycle. Identifiable halogenated byproduct formation and accumulation was minimized during electrolysis of wastewater containing 75 mM Cl-.

AB The efficiency of two white-rot fungi (WRF), Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma lucidum, to eliminate thirteen pharmaceutical pollutants with concomitant biodiesel production from the accumulating lipid content after treatment, was examined. The removal efficiency was studied using both individual and combined strains. The results of individual and combined strains showed a total removal (100%) of diclofenac (DCF), gemfibrozil (GFZ), ibuprofen (IBP), progesterone (PGT) and ranitidine (RNT). Lower removals were achieved for 4-acetamidoantipyrin (AAA), clofibric acid (ACF), atenolol (AM), caffeine (CFN), carbamazepine (CZP), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulpiride (SPD), although the combination of both strains enhanced the system's efficiency, with removals ranging from 15 to 41%. This increase of the removal efficiency when combining both strains was attributed to the interactions developed between them (i.e., competition). Results from enzymatic and cytochrome P450 examination suggested that both extracellular (laccase, MnP, LiP) and intracellular oxidation mechanisms participate in the biological removal of pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, the "green" potential of the fungal sludge generated during the biological removal process was assessed for biodiesel production by means of one-step direct (in-situ) transformation. This process consists of the simultaneous extraction and conversion of lipids contained in the sludge by catalytic esterification/transesterification using a robust acid heterogeneous Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. This catalytic system provided conversions close to 80% of the saponifiable fraction (including free fatty acids and glycerides) in the presence of high amount of impurities. The overall weight FAME yield, based on the initial dried mass, was close to 30% for both strains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is known to be effective for chemical oxidation and disinfection of water and wastewater. Recently, light emitting diode (LED) has been recognized as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable source of UV to replace conventional mercury lamps, so-called UV-LED. Less is known about the effectiveness of UV-LEDs, i.e., UVA, UVB, and UVC in comparison, for the decomposition of recalcitrant organic chemicals. In this study, direct photolytic decomposition and TiO2 photocatalytic decomposition of model pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen (ACT), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), was tested, and the effects of different UV-LED wavelengths on their decomposition were investigated. UV wavelength was found to be a more important parameter for the decomposition than light intensity. Shorter wavelength UV in order of UVC > UVB > UVA was more effective for the decomposition of the pharmaceuticals. Photocatalytic decomposition was much more significant than photolytic decomposition. Decomposition kinetics of the pharmaceuticals followed SMX > DCF > IBP > ACT, reflecting their molecular structures. Results on the mineralization of the pharmaceuticals also supported the observed trends for their disappearance. The investigation was resumed with microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a known lethal biological toxin often found in water resource, and the similar result to the pharmaceuticals was also observed for MC-LR. This study and the consequent results would facilitate applications of UV-LEDs for the treatment of water contaminated with recalcitrant toxic chemicals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study deals with the chemical characterization of hospital effluents in terms of the predicted and measured concentrations of 38 pharmaceuticals belonging to 11 different therapeutic classes. The paper outlines the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches through an analysis of a case study referring to a large hospital. It highlights the observed (and expected) ranges of variability for the parameters of the adopted model, presents the results of an uncertainty analysis of direct measurements (due to samplingmode and frequency and chemical analysis) and a sensitivity analysis of predicted concentrations (based on the annual consumption of pharmaceuticals, their excretion rate and annual wastewater volume generated by the hospital). Measured concentrations refer to two sampling campaigns carried out in summer and winter in order to investigate seasonal variability of the selected compounds. Predicted concentrations are compared to measured ones in the three scenarios: summer, winter and the whole year.
   It was found that predicted and measured concentrations are in agreement for a limited number of compounds (namely atenolol, atorvastatin and hydrochlorothiazide), and for most compounds the adoption of the model leads to a large overestimation in all three periods. Uncertainties in predictions are mainly due to the wastewater volume and excretion factor, whereas for measured concentrations, uncertainties are mainly due to samplingmode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

AB Regulatory ecotoxicology testing rarely accounts for the influence of natural water chemistry on the bioavailability and toxicity of a chemical. Therefore, this study identifies whether key omissions in relation to Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and pH have an impact on measured effect concentrations (EC). Laboratory ecotoxicology tests were undertaken for the widely used antimicrobial compound triclosan, using adult Gammarus pulex (L.), a wild-type amphipod using synthetic fresh water, humic acid solutions and wastewater treatment works effluent. The toxicity of triclosan was tested at two different pHs of 7.3 and 8.4, with and without the addition of DOC and 24 and 48 hour EC values with calculated 95% confidence intervals calculated. Toxicity tests undertaken at a pH above triclosan's pKa and in the presents of humic acid and effluent, containing 11 and 16 mg L-1 mean DOC concentrations respectively, resulted in significantly decreased triclosan toxicity. This was most likely a result of varying triclosan speciation and complexation due to triclosan's pKa and high hydrophobicity controlling its bioavailability. The mean 48 hour EC50 values varied between 0.75 +/- 0.45 and 1.93 +/- 0.12 mg L-1 depending on conditions. These results suggest that standard ecotoxicology tests can cause inaccurate estimations of triclosan's bioavailability and subsequent toxicity in natural aquatic environments. These results highlight the need for further consideration regarding the role that water chemistry has on the toxicity of organic contaminants and how ambient environmental conditions are incorporated into the standard setting and consenting processes in the future.

AB Bacterial and nutrient contamination from anthropogenic sources impacts fresh and marine waters, reducing water quality and restricting recreational and commercial activities. In many cases the source of this contamination is ambiguous, and a tracer or set of tracers linking contamination to source would be valuable. In this work, the effectiveness of utilizing a suite of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) as tracers of bacteria from human septic system effluent is investigated.
   Field sampling was performed at more than 20 locations over approximately 18 months and analyzed for a suite of CECs and fecal coliform bacteria. The sampling locations included seeps and small freshwater discharges to the shoreline. Sites were selected and grouped according to level of impact by septic systems as determined by previous field sampling programs. A subset of selected locations had been positively identified as being impacted by effluent from failing septic systems through dye testing. The CECs were selected based on their predominant use, their frequency of use, and putative fate and transport properties.
   In addition, two rounds of focused sampling were performed at selected sites to characterize shortterm variations in CECs and fecal coliform concentrations, and to evaluate environmental persistence following source correction activities.
   The results indicate that a suite of common use compounds are suitable as generalized tracers of bacterial contamination from septic systems and that fate and transport properties are important in tracer selection. Highly recalcitrant or highly labile compounds likely follow different loss profiles in the subsurface compared to fecal bacteria and are not suitable tracers. The use of more than one tracer compound is recommended due to source variability of septic systems and to account for variations in the subsurface condition. In addition, concentrations of some CECs were measured in receiving waters at levels which suggested the potential for environmental harm, indicating that the possible risk presented from these sources warrants further investigation.

AB Organic micropollutants found in the environment are a diverse group of compounds that includes pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors. Their presence in the aquatic environment continues to be a concern as the risk they pose towards both the environment and human health is still inconclusive. Removal of these compounds from water and wastewater is difficult to achieve and often incomplete, but UV-TiO2 is a promising treatment approach. In this study, the efficiency of titanium dioxide (TiO2) immobilized on porous supports were tested for treatment of target pharmaceuticals and their metabolites under UV-LED exposure, a potential low energy and cost effective alternative to conventional UV lamps. Immobilization was completed using two different methods: (1) dip coating of TiO2 onto quartz fiber filters (QFT) or (2) thermal-chemical oxidation of porous titanium sheets (PIT). Comparison against experimental controls (dark QFT, dark PTT, and photolysis using UV LED only) showed that UV-LED/PTT and UV-LED/QFT treatments have the potential to reduce the concentrations of the target compounds. However, the treatments were found to be selective, such that individual pharmaceuticals were removed well using QFT and FIT but not both. The complementary treatment behavior is likely driven by electrostatic interactions of charged compounds with the membranes. QFT membranes are negatively charged at the experimental pH (4.5-5) while FIT membranes are positively charged. As a result, cationic compounds interact more with QFT while anionic compounds with FIT. Neutral compounds, however, were found to be recalcitrant under any treatment conditions suggesting that ionic interactions were important for reactions to occur. This behavior can be advantageous if specificity is required. The behavior of pharmaceutical metabolites is similar to the parent compounds. However, isomeric metabolites of atorvastatin with functional groups in para and ortho configurations behave differently, suggesting that the positioning of functional groups can have an impact in their interaction with the immobilized TiO2. It was also apparent that FIT can be reused after cleaning by heat treatment. Overall, these newly synthesized membrane materials have potential applications for treatment of trace organic contaminants in water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes for the removal of nitrogen from municipal wastewater (known as "mainstream anammox") bears the potential to bring wastewater treatment plants close to energy autarky. The aim of the present work was to assess the long-term stability of partial nitritationianammox (PN/A) processes operating at low temperatures and their reliability in meeting nitrogen concentrations in the range of typical discharge limits below 2 mgNH(4)-(N)center dot L-1 and 10 mg(Ntot)center dot L-1. Two main 12-L sequencing batch reactors were operated in parallel for PN/A on aerobically pre-treated municipal wastewater (21 +/- 5 mg(NH4)-N center dot L-1 and residual 69 +/- 19 Mg-CODtot center dot L-1) for more than one year, including over 5 months at 15 degrees C. The two systems consisted of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and a hybrid MBBR (H-MBBR) with flocculent biomass. Operation at limiting oxygen concentrations (0.15-0.18 mg(O2)center dot L-1) allowed stable suppression of the activity of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria at 15 degrees C with a production of nitrate over ammonium consumed as low as 16% in the MBBR. Promising nitrogen removal rates of 20-40 mg(N)center dot L-1 center dot d(-1) were maintained at hydraulic retention times of 14 h. Stable ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies over 90% and 70% respectively were achieved. Both reactors reached average concentrations of total nitrogen below 10 mg(N)center dot L-1 in their effluents, even down to 6 mg(N)center dot L-1 for the MBBR, with an ammonium concentration of 2 mg(N)center dot L-1 (set as operational threshold to stop aeration). Furthermore, the two PN/A systems performed almost identically with respect to the biological removal of organic micropollutants and, importantly, to a similar extent as conventional treatments. A sudden temperature drop to 11 degrees C resulted in significant suppression of anammox activity, although this was rapidly recovered after the temperature was increased back to 15 degrees C. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing revealed that the anammox guild of the bacterial communities of the two systems was composed of the genus "Candidatus Brocadia". The potential of PN/A systems to compete with conventional treatments for biological nutrients removal both in terms of removal rates and overall effluent quality was proven. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB A simple, fast and reliable analytical method for the determination of phosphodiesterase type V inhibitors in wastewater was developed and validated. The method was based on direct injection followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole as mass analyzer. Transformation products and analogues were included in the target list besides the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil). The method performance was thoroughly investigated, including the analyte stability in wastewater and matrix effect. All target compounds presented linear fits between their LOD and 500 ng/L. The quantification limits ranged from 1.6 to 30 ng/L for all compounds except for n-octylnortadalafil (LOQ: 100 ng/L); precision calculated as intraday repeatability was lower than 30%; accuracy calculated as procedural recovery ranged successfully between 85 and 105% in all cases. The method was applied to samples collected during three week-long monitoring campaigns performed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in three Dutch cities. Only sildenafil and its two metabolites, desmethyl- and desethylsildenafil, were present with normalized loads ranging from LOQ to 8.3, 11.8 and 21.6 mg/day/1000 inh, respectively. Two additional week-long sets of samples were collected in Amsterdam at the time that a festival event took place, bringing around 350,000 visitors to the city. The difference in drug usage patterns was statistically studied: "weekday" versus "weekend", "normal" versus "atypical" week; and results discussed. The metabolite to parent drug concentration ratio evolution during consecutive years was discussed, leading to several possible explanations that should be further investigated. Finally, wastewater-based epidemiology approach was applied to back-calculate sildenafil consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of municipal wastewater for drug metabolites can reveal the scale of drug use within communities. An Australian city with a population of 1.2 million inhabitants was assessed for 4 stimulants: cocaine, methamphetamine, 3.4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and amphetamine; 6 opioids: codeine, morphine, heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone and methadone; 11 new psychoactive substances (NPS); benzylpiperazine (BZP), trifluoro-methylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), methcathinone, methylone, mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), alpha pyrrolidinopentiophenone (alpha-PVP), paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), 25C-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe; and cannabis, for up to four years between December 2011 and December 2015. Temporal trends revealed increasing usage rates of methamphetamine, cocaine, oxycodone, and fentanyl, while decreasing rates of use were observed for MDMA, BZP and methylone. Use of other opioids and cannabis was generally stable across years, while use of new psychoactive substances fluctuated without an apparent direction. Opioids and cannabis were used at a consistent level through the course of the week, while use of stimulants and some NPS increased on the weekend. Seasonal differences in use were observed for MDMA and cannabis (p $_amp_$lt; 0.05) where, on average, MDMA use was approximately 90% higher in December than in other months and cannabis use was approximately 45% lower in each February. Residual month-to-month variability measures on trend-free data showed NPS use had higher variability than the stimulants and opioids. Frequent wastewater sampling and analysis over prolonged periods has yielded valuable insights into long-term drug use trends, in some instances revealed important within-year trends, and demonstrated the differing patterns of use of drugs on weekends compared to weekdays.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is an alternative advanced treatment for wastewater reclamation, and it has the potential to control micropollutants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, the relationship of operating conditions in SAT and removals of micropollutants was not clear. In this study, the effects of operating conditions on the removals of PPCPs were evaluated by using lab-scale columns and plant pilot-scale reactors under different operating conditions. Firstly, weathered granite soil (WGS), standard sand (SAND) and Toyoura standard sand (TS) have different soil characteristics such as total organic carbon (TOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). In the columns with these packing materials, the removals of carboxylic analgesics and antilipidemics were effective regardless packing materials. The removals of antibiotics were more effective inWGS than in TS and SAND, indicating high TOC and CEC enhance the sorption in SAT. Secondly, with the extension of hydraulic retention time (HRT), the removals of sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, crotamiton, and antipyrine were improved inWGS columns, and adaptable biodegradation for moderately removable PPCPs was formed. Thirdly, the removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole and crotamiton were higher in the WGS column under vadose condition than in the WGS column under saturated condition, because of aerobic condition in WGS column under vadose condition. Though long HRT and vadose condition had positive influence on the removals of several PPCPs such as sulfamethoxazole, WGS column with an HRT of 7 days under saturated condition removed most PPCPs.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) relies on the principle that traces of compounds, which a population is exposed to or consume, are excreted unchanged or as metabolites in urine and/or feces, and ultimately end up in the sewer network. Measuring target metabolic residues i.e. biomarkers in raw urban wastewater allows identifying the exposure or use of substances of interest in a community. Up to date, the most popular application of WBE is the estimation of illicit drug use and studies have been made mainly across Europe, which has allowed estimating and comparing drug use in many European cities. However, until now a comprehensive study applying WBE on the most frequently consumed illicit drugs has not been performed in South American countries. In this work, we applied this approach to samples from Colombia, selecting two of the most populated cities: Bogota and Medellin. Several biomarkers were selected to estimate drug use of cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), heroin and ketamine. Composite samples (24-h) were collected at the corresponding municipal wastewater treatment plants. Sample treatment was performed at location by applying solid-phase extraction (SPE). Before SPE, the samples were spiked with appropriate isotope labeled internal standards. In parallel, samples (spiked with the analytes under study at two concentration levels) were also processed for quality control. Analysis of influent wastewater was made by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, with triple quadrupole analyzer. Data shown in this paper reveal a high use of cocaine by the population of the selected Colombian cities, particularly from Medellin, while the use of other illicit drugs were low. The relevance of using quality control samples, particularly in collaborative studies, as those presented in this work, where research groups from different countries participate and where the samples had to be shipped overseas, is highlighted in this paper.

AB Diosgenin (CAS No.: 512-04-9) hydrolyzed from Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright is a very important steroid in the pharmaceutical industry. However, serious environmental pollution and poor efficiency in the utilization of this natural resource have yet to be conquered. The aim of this study was to establish a more ecological and efficient approach for producing diosgenin from fresh D. zingiberensis tubers via pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch. The reaction was carried out in a high pressure kettle, and seven parameters, including the sample to acidic solution ratio, concentration of H2SO4 aqueous solution, volume of extraction solvent, reaction temperature, duration of hydrolysis, agitation speed and boiling point of petroleum ether, were sequentially optimized through single factor experimental design. It was shown that the yield of diosgenin has been increased to 4.17% under the optimal conditions, namely, a 1:100 ratio of saponini/acidic solution (g/mL), 50 mL of 2 mu L/mL H2SO4 aqueous solution, 30 mL of petroleum ether (90-120 degrees C), 130 degrees C, 2.0 h and 100 r/min. Then, the newly proposed approach was compared with our previous strategy as well as a conventional method in terms of the yield of diosgenin, the consumption of sulfuric acid and chemical oxygen demand as well as total organic carbon of wastewater. Consequently, it was found that the yield was 22.29% higher than the conventional process, and H2SO4 consumption was reduced by 88.53%. Furthermore, the level of pollution in wastewater of the novel strategy has fallen greatly as the chemical oxygen demand and the total organic carbon were decreased by 50.15% and 64.39%. Comprehensively, it has been well demonstrated that the novel strategy based on pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch is a more ecological and effective approach for producing diosgenin from the tubers of fresh D. zingiberensis, and it is a promising strategy for application in industrial practice.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, including illicit drugs in aquatic systems, is a topic of environmental significance because of their global occurrence and potential effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health, but few studies have examined the ecological effects of illicit drugs. We conducted a survey of several drug residues, including the potentially illicit drug amphetamine, at 6 stream sites along an urban to rural gradient in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. We detected numerous drugs, including amphetamine (3 to 630 ng L-1), in all stream sites. We examined the fate and ecological effects of amphetamine on biofilm, seston, and aquatic insect communities in artificial streams exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g L-1) of amphetamine. The amphetamine parent compound decreased in the artificial streams from less than 1 mu g L-1 on day 1 to 0.11 mu g L-1 on day 22. In artificial streams treated with amphetamine, there was up to 45% lower biofilm chlorophyll a per ash-free dry mass, 85% lower biofilm gross primary production, 24% greater seston ash-free dry mass, and 30% lower seston community respiration compared to control streams. Exposing streams to amphetamine also changed the composition of bacterial and diatom communities in biofilms at day 21 and increased cumulative dipteran emergence by 65% and 89% during the first and third weeks of the experiment, respectively. This study demonstrates that amphetamine and other biologically active drugs are present in urban streams and have the potential to affect both structure and function of stream communities.

AB Passive sampling is proposed as an alternative to traditional grab- and composite-sampling modes. Investigated here is a novel passive sampler configuration, the Chemcatcher containing an Atlantic HLB disk covered by a 0.2 mu m poly(ether sulfone) membrane, for monitoring polar organic micropollutants (personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and illicit drugs) in wastewater effluent. In situ calibration showed linear uptake for the majority of detected micropollutants over 9 days of deployment. Sampling rates (R-s) were determined for 59 compounds and were generally in the range of 0.01-0.10 L day(-1). The Chemcatcher was also suitable for collecting chiral micropollutants and maintaining their enantiomeric distribution during deployment. This is essential for their future use in developing more accurate environmental risk assessments at the enantiomeric level. Application of calibration data in a subsequent monitoring study showed that the concentration estimated for 92% of micropollutants was within a factor of 2 of the known concentration. However, their application in a legislative context will require further understanding of the properties and mechanisms controlling micropollutant uptake to improve the accuracy of reported concentrations.

AB The interest in the presence of pharmaceutical compounds (PhC) in the environment has increased significantly because of their potential impact on human health. Many studies have demonstrated that PhCs can be found in hospital and municipal wastewaters, mainly due to the inefficiency of the treatment plants. However, the question is how significant the hospital contribution represents in the total municipal wastewater generated. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to perform a comparison between hospital and municipal wastewaters based on literature review, serving as a base for the implementation of more efficient management policies in hospitals and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Results indicate that there are some compounds found in higher concentrations in hospital effluents than in municipal inffluent, particularly the class of antibiotics.

AB This study investigated adsorption of the carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater effluent to optimally synthesized magnetic nanocomposite of activated carbon (AC). The adsorbent was characterized by SEM, XRD, VSM, BET and FTIR analysis. Increase in the magnetite content up to mass ratio of 1:8 (Fe3O4: AC) had no adverse effect on the porous structure of adsorbent and decrease in adsorption capacity was only due to increase in inactive mass fraction of adsorbent. However, at higher contents of magnetite, decrease in adsorption capacity may be due to blockage of porous structure of AC. Sedimentation data of MAC 1:8 were well predicted by second order kinetic model with the rate constant of 8.9 x 10 (3) NTU (1) min (1). Response surface methodology was applied to optimize the treatment process. A significant quadratic model was achieved with the maximum removal efficiency of 93% within investigated intervals. By increasing of total dissolved solids (TDS); adsorption performance decreased slightly due to increase in water cluster formation on carboxylic groups which can block adsorption on the carbonyl sites. The equilibrium adsorption data were in agreement with the results predicted using Radke-Prausnitz, Redlich-Peterson and Temkin models. The maximum capacity was found to be 182.9 mg g (1). The adsorption kinetic data were closely fitted to Elovich, intraparticle diffusion and pseudo-second-order models. According to thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption process was found to be spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The error functions were used to evaluate the agreement between the experimental data and predictions using models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As far as we know, the electrochemical degradation of simvastatin, a widely used as a cholesterol lowering drug, has not been reported yet. The oxidation process has been investigated in pure water and wastewater using graphite-Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) composite electrode as anode. Effects of initial concentration of simvastatin, NaCl loading, type of sample and applied voltage were tested to evaluate the electrochemical oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of simvastatin followed pseudo first-order kinetics, with rate constant values ranged from 0.006-0.23 min (1) depending on the operating parameters. Simvastatin was completely removed, after 40 min of treatment, at 4 g/L NaCl and 10 V indicating high concentration of OCl produced in the solution but at the same time energy consumption (EC) was very high. However, 6 V was selected for further experiments (90% removal and 0.093 Wh/mg energy consumption) after 40 min. The low concentration of simvastatin (30 mg/L) exhibited better removal of 97% compared to 50 mg/L which gives removal 90% after 40 min. In this work the electrochemical oxidation process of simvastatin has been studied by monitoring the by-products and their toxicity using the time-of-flight (TOF/MS) technology. Chlorinated by-products were separated and identified accurately using isotope modern software. Simvastatin was transformed within 20-80 min, however, after 100 min most of by-products have been removed. Eleven new by-products of simvastatin were identified and monitored in both positive and negative ionization mode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of five pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, was studied by passive sampling and grab sampling in northern Lake Paijanne and River Vantaa. The passive sampling was performed by using Chemcatcher (R) sampler with a SDB-RPS Empore disk as a receiving phase. In Lake Paijanne, the sampling was conducted during summer 2013 at four locations near the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant and in the years 2013 and 2015 at four locations along River Vantaa. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in Lake Paijanne determined by passive sampling ranged between 1.4-2.9 ng L-1, 15-35 ng L-1, 13-31 ng L-1, 16-27 ng L-1, and 3.3-32 ng L-1, respectively. Similarly, the results in River Vantaa ranged between 1.2-40 ng L-1, 15-65 ng L-1, 13-33 ng L-1, 16-31 ng L-1, and 3.3-6.4 ng L-1. The results suggest that the Chemcatcher passive samplers are suitable for detecting pharmaceuticals in lake and river waters.

AB The project studied the occurrence, fate, and seasonal variation of 14 antibiotics, from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shanghai. The results indicated that ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and oxytetracycline were the predominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 1208.20, 959.13, and 564.30 ng/L in influents, while 916.88, 106.60, and 337.81 ng/L in effluents, respectively. The level of antibiotics in WWTPs obviously varied with seasonal changes, and higher detectable frequencies and concentrations were found in winter. The daily mass loads per capita of amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline in the study were all higher than those in other regions/countries, such as Hong Kong, Australia, and Italy. The elimination of antibiotics through these WWTPs was incomplete, and a wide range of removal efficiencies during the different treatment process and seasons were observed (-500.56 to 100 % in winter and -124.24 to 94.21 % in summer). Sulfonamides were relatively easy to be removed in WWTPs and the ultraviolet (UV) process can effectively improve the removal efficiency. Risk assessment of antibiotics in effluents was estimated. Only AMOX's hazard quotient (HQ) was higher than 0.01. Even though the environmental risks in the study were estimated to be low, the potential negative effects on aquatic ecosystems should call our attention as continually discharge in the long term.

AB Partial-filling micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (PF-MEKC) with UV detection was applied for determination of human-based steroids in water samples of Finnish wastewater treatment plants. The samples were purified with solid-phase extraction (SPE) on octadecyl substituted polymer sorbents obtaining analyte enrichment of 20,000-fold. The steroids studied were androgens, estrogens, and progesterone. Three of the steroids could be quantified with the PF-MEKC method. The detection and quantification limits were 0.05-1.06 mu g/mL and 0.15-3.2 mu g/mL, meaning in the SPE concentrates as 2.5-53 pg/L and 7.5-160 pg/L, respectively. In the influent waters, the total amount of testosterone glucuronide, androstenedione, and progesterone was up to 350 ng/L. In effluent water samples the total steroid quantity was maximum at 320 ng/L. Remarkably high quantity of androstenedione was quantified in both influent and effluent water samples. The cleanest effluent waters were produced in Western Finland. Correspondingly, the highest quantities were located near the largest lake and river areas in South-Eastern Finland. The concentration variation in effluent waters was explained with differences in the purification materials and processes at the plants and with steroid adsorption on soil and organic material suspended into water.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in our water resources is of prime concern. With this context, fate and seasonal variation of six EDCs (testosterone, T; progesterone, P; diethyl phthalate, DEP; dibutyl phthalate, DBP; propyl-paraben, PP and butylparaben, BP) were assessed throughout the year, i.e. in rainy, winter, spring and summer seasons in the raw, treated wastewater and activated sludge in an activated sludge process (ASP) based sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Haridwar, India. Qualitative and quantitative measurements were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results indicate that in summer, the examined STP could effectively remove 82.9% of T, 86.4% of P, 95.5% of DEP, 92.4% of DBP, 91.5% of PP, and 89.9% of BP from the wastewater. Among the EDCs considered, higher removal efficiencies were achieved for phthalates in the summer season. GC-MS analysis showed that a small fraction of EDCs was sorbed on the solid fraction of activated sludge. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy analysis were also performed to investigate the occurrence of EDCs in biomass samples. Results of this study also demonstrated that removal efficiency, assessed in terms of physicochemical and microbiological parameters, was maximum in summer and reached minimum in rainy season.

AB Investigation on the sources, discharges and related risks for the environment of the pharmaceutical substance (PhS) diclofenac (DCF) was performed in Lithuania, a country of the Baltic Sea region, for the first time. The investigation only refers to DCF as a PhS for human use; emissions from animal husbandry were not considered. In the first stage of the research, the main sources and pathways of DCF via substance flow analysis were identified within the country. During the second stage, DCF flows along the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two different cities were measured in order to assess the current levels of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. Furthermore, environmental risk assessment was carried out by taking into account the parameters of consumption data and elimination rate in WWTPs. Then, the assessment of different technical and managerial removal approaches was accomplished in an environmental management model of wastewater containing PhS, based on the framework of environmental systems theory.

AB The aquatic environment is becoming increasingly contaminated with pharmaceuticals. Salicylic acid (SA), which can be used individually or appear as a degradation product of the widely used acetylsalicylic acid was chosen for testing. Juvenile zebrafish Danio rerio were subjected to OECD test No. 215 (fish, juvenile growth test) with salicylic acid concentrations of 0.004; 0.04; 0.4; 4 and 40 mg/L. Specific growth rate (SGR), histological changes, and parameters of oxidative stress were evaluated. SA had no effects on histological changes, SGR, glutathione reductase, and lipid peroxidation. Increased catalytic activity of GPx was found at 0.04 mg/L compared to control, increased catalytic activity of catalase was found at 0.04 and 4 mg/L compared to control, and increased catalytic activity of glutathione-S-transferase was found at 0.004 and 0.04 mg/L compared to control (P < 0.05). Juvenile zebrafish turned out to be relatively insensitive to both environmentally relevant (0.004 mg/L) and higher concentrations of salicylic acid.

AB Propranolol (PROP) is a beta-blocicer prescribed mainly to treat human cardiovascular diseases and as a result of its wide usage and persistence, it is reported in aquatic environments. This study examined whether PROP alters developmental patterns and catecholamine (CA)-regulated processes in the zebrafish (Danio redo) and if exposure during early life alters the stress response and behaviors of adults. The calculated 48 h larva LC50 was 21.6 mg/L, well above reported environmental levels (0.01-0.59 mu g/L). Stressed and PROP-exposed adult zebrafish had reduced testosterone and estradiol levels and exhibited behaviors indicating less anxiety than control fish. Furthermore, adults previously PROP-exposed as embryos/larvae had decreased growth in terms of body length and mass. Finally, these adults showed increased cholesterol and a dose-dependent decrease in testosterone levels compared with unexposed zebrafish. Thus PROP-exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae alters developmental patterns and CA -regulated processes that may affect normal behaviors and responses to stressors, and at least some of these changes persist in the adult zebrafish.

AB This study investigates biosorption of Oxytetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, using aerobic granular sludge as an adsorbent in aqueous solutions. A sequencing batch reactor fed by a synthetic wastewater was operated to create aerobic granular sludge. Primarily, the pore structure and surface area of granular sludge, the chemical structure and the molecular sizes of the pharmaceutical, operating conditions, such as pH, stirring rate, initial concentration of Oxytetracycline, during adsorption process was verified. Subsequently, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the adsorption were examined and adsorption isotherm studies were carried out. It was shown that the aerobic granular sludge was a good alternative for biosorption of this pharmaceutical. The pharmaceutical was adsorbed better at pH values of 6-8. The adsorption efficiency increased with rising ionic strength. Also, it was seen that the adsorption process was an exothermic process in terms of thermodynamics. The adsorption can be well explained by Langmuir isotherm model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With constrained Nile water and the cruel drop in per capita freshwater share in Egypt, soil aquifer treatment (SAT) appears an attractive, low-cost, unconventional water resource that is environmentally friendly and relatively easy to operate. Nevertheless, organic micropollutants (OMPs) in treated wastewater pose environmental and health risks if not properly attenuated through vadose zone infiltration. Thus, determination of OMP removal in a SAT system is important for sustainable groundwater management. In this study, a new, simple equation for the prediction of organic micropollutant removal in SAT systems was developed using gene expression programming (GEP). A wide range of 15OMPs and aquifer conditions were examined along with various real operational aspects of SAT systems, including hydraulic loading rate and dry/wet ratio. The effect of spatial heterogeneity on saturated hydraulic conductivity was considered. Developed GEP models had an average coefficient of determination R2 of 0.92. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with 50,000 realizations was used to propagate uncertainty in SAT parameters in order to generate stochastic inputs for the GEP model. It was found that the removal of OMPs in SAT systems is mostly affected by biodegradation rate and soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity, in addition to dry/wet ratio. Finally,the developed GEP models were applied to enhance the criteria for selecting potential sites for SAT systems in Egypt considering OMP. It was shown that a SAT system would perform well at three sites, with a OMP removal efficiency reaching 100%, whereas it would have a removal of only 50% in the other two sites. Uncertainties in predictions were quantified with an average value of 35%. The developed GEP models can serve as basis for preliminary SAT site selection and design, and can substitute for complex commercial modeling software, especially for practitioners and decision makers in feasibility studies. However, for SAT implementation in a selected location, results can be confirmed only through field column tests.

AB The present study reports a precise and simple offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous determination of five representative and commonly present pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), a new class of emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment. The target list of analytes including ciprofloxacin, acetaminophen, caffeine benzophenone and irgasan were separated by a simple HPLC method. The column used was a reversed-phase C18 column, and the mobile phase was 1 % acetic acid and methanol (20: 80 v/v) under isocratic conditions, at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). The analytes were separated and detected within 15 min using the photodiode array detector (PDA). The linearity of the calibration curves were obtained with correlation coefficients 0.98-0.99. The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy and ruggedness demonstrated the reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity of the developed method. Prior to the analysis, the SPE was performed using a C18 cartridge to preconcentrate the targeted analytes from the environmental water samples. The developed method was applied to evaluate and fingerprint PPCPs in sewage collected from a residential engineering college campus, polluted water bodies such as Nag river and Pili river and the influent and effluent samples from a sewage treatment plant (STP) situated at Nagpur city, in the peak summer season. This method is useful for estimation of pollutants present in microquantities in the surface water bodies and treated sewage as compared to nanolevel pollutants detected by mass spectrometry (MS) detectors.

AB The detection of antibiotics in water systems has instigated great environmental concern due to the toxicological effects associated with these compounds. Their discharge into the environment results from the ubiquity of use in medical, veterinary, and agricultural practices. Some of the effects of antibiotics include development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it difficult to treat diseases, variation in natural microbial communities, and enzyme activities. In this study, the first comprehensive survey of some frequently used antibiotics namely ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), chloramphenicol (CAP), and ciprofloxacin (CPF) within Lake Victoria Basin of Kenya is presented. Sludge and wastewater samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and hospital lagoons within the study area. Samples were extracted and cleaned by solidphase extraction, and analysis was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All wastewater samples and sludge collected contained quantifiable levels of the selected antibiotics. The highest concentrations were recorded for AMP with WWTPs and hospitals having 0.36 +/- 0.04 and 0.79 +/- 0.07 mu g/L, respectively. In sludge samples, SMX recorded the highest concentrations of 276 +/- 12 ng/g. The high levels in sludge indicate the preferential partition of antibiotics onto solid phase, posing great danger to consumers of crops grown in biosolid-amended soils. The daily discharge loads of antibiotics from nine WWTPs ranged between 80.75 and 3044.9 mg day(-1) with a total discharge of 6395.85 mg day(-1), signifying a high potential of water resource pollution within the region. This report will aid in the assessment of the risks posed by antibiotics released into the environment.

AB Emerging organic contaminants in wastewater are usually analyzed by targeted approaches, and especially estrogens have been the focus of environmental research due to their high hormonal activity. The selection of specific target compounds means, however, that most of the sample components, including transformation products and potential new contaminants, are neglected. In this study, the fate of steroidal compounds in wastewater treatment processes was evaluated by a nontargeted approach based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The potential of the nontargeted approach to generate comprehensive information about sample constituents was demonstrated with use of statistical tools. Transformation pathways of the tentatively identified compounds with steroidal four-ring structure were proposed. The purification efficiency of the wastewater treatment plants was studied, and the distribution of the compounds of interest in the suspended solids, effluent water, and sludge was measured. The results showed that, owing to strong adsorption of hydrophobic compounds onto the solid matter, the steroids were mostly bound to the suspended solids of the effluent water and the sewage sludge at the end of the treatment process. The most abundant steroid class was androstanes in the aqueous phase and cholestanes in the solid phase. 17 beta-estradiol was the most abundant estrogen in the aqueous phase, but it was only detected in the influent samples indicating efficient removal during the treatment process. In the sludge samples, however, high concentrations of an oxidation product of 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, were measured.

AB Given that drugs and their degradation products are likely to occur as concoctions in wastewater, the degradation of a mixture of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diclofenac (DCF) and naproxen (NPX), was investigated by solar photolysis and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-mediated solar photocatalysis using an immersion-well photoreactor. An equimolar ratio (1:1) of both NSAIDs in distilled water, drinking water, and river water was subjected to solar degradation. Solar photolysis of the DCF and NPX mixture was competitive particularly in drinking water and river water, as both drugs have the ability to undergo photolysis. However, the addition of TiO2 in the mixture significantly enhanced the degradation rate of both APIs compared to solar photolysis alone. Mineralization, as measured by chemical oxygen demand (COD), was incomplete under all conditions investigated. TiO2-mediated solar photocatalytic degradation of DCF and NPX mixtures produced 15 identifiable degradants corresponding to degradation of the individual NSAIDs, while two degradation products with much higher molecular weight than the parent NSAIDs were identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). This study showed that the solar light intensity and the water matrix appear to be the main factors influencing the overall performance of the solar photolysis and TiO2-mediated solar photocatalysis for degradation of DCF and NPX mixtures.

AB The increasing reuse of wastewater for irrigation introduces surfactants and antibiotics into the environment. How these two kinds of compounds interact with regard to their sorption processes in soil is not clear.
   We performed batch experiments to investigate the sorption of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and its effect on sorption of sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin in irrigated and non-irrigated soils with different organic matter (OM) contents.
   LAS sorption was non-linear in the presence of the antibiotics, and as general trend, it increased with rising OM content of soils. Free LAS was also removed from solution by complexation with Ca2+. Dissolved organic compounds released from soils with OM contents aeyen18.4 g kg(-1) further reduced LAS sorption. Sorption of sulfamethoxazole was reduced by LAS sorption only in one soil with a small OM content of 9.5 g kg(-1).
   The strong sorption of ciprofloxacin is not affected by LAS. Sulfamethoxazole sorption only competes with LAS sorption in organic matter-poor soils. Accumulation of organic matter in soils, for example due to long-term wastewater irrigation, provides extra sorption capacity for LAS and sulfamethoxazole so that competition for sorption sites is reduced.

AB Wildlife can be exposed to human pharmaceuticals via prey that have accumulated the compounds from wastewater, surface water, sediment, and soil. One factor affecting internal absorption of pharmaceuticals is bioaccessibility, the proportion of the compound that enters solution in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, the bioaccessibility of most pharmaceuticals in prey remains unknown for most wildlife species. The authors evaluated the potential of a 2-compartment in vitro gastrointestinal tract model to compare the bioaccessibility of the antidepressant fluoxetine from invertebrate prey for birds and mammals. Samples of gizzard (or stomach) and intestinal-phase digestive juices were obtained from the in vitro models along with the residual solid material. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the bioaccessibility of fluoxetine in the avian in vitro models was statistically significantly lower than that in the mammalian models as a percentage of what was recovered; however, there were no statistically or biologically significant interspecies difference in terms of the amount recovered per gram of "food" inserted at the start of the simulation. This in vitro model provides a useful method of comparing the bioaccessibility of pharmaceuticals in different prey for species with different gastrointestinal conditions. There is merit for ecological risk assessments in further developing this in vitro approach to improve estimates of internal exposure for organics. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Triclosan (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]-phenol) is an antimicrobial agent found in a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products. Numerous studies have examined the occurrence and environmental fate of triclosan in wastewater, biosolids, biosolids-amended soils, and plants and organisms exposed to biosolid-amended soils. Triclosan has a propensity to adhere to organic carbon in biosolids and biosolid-amended soils. Land application of biosolids containing triclosan has the potential to contribute to multiple direct and indirect human health exposure pathways. To estimate exposures and human health risks from biosolid-borne triclosan, a risk assessment was conducted in general accordance with the methodology incorporated into the US Environmental Protection Agency's Part 503 biosolids rule. Human health exposures to biosolid-borne triclosan were estimated on the basis of published empirical data or modeled using upper-end environmental partitioning estimates. Similarly, a range of published triclosan human health toxicity values was evaluated. Margins of safety were estimated for 10 direct and indirect exposure pathways, both individually and combined. The present risk assessment found large margins of safety (>1000 to >100 000) for potential exposures to all pathways, even under the most conservative exposure and toxicity assumptions considered. The human health exposures and risks from biosolid-borne triclosan are concluded to be de minimis. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Simple semi-theoretical models were developed to estimate the performance of three different kinds of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in the degradation of pharmaceuticals. The AOPs included the photo-Fenton process as an example of a liquid-liquid reaction, the TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation process as a solid-liquid reaction, and the combined ozone and hydrogen peroxide oxidation process as a gas liquid reaction; the effects of the aqueous matrices (CESs: co-existing substances) of actual wastewater on the removal of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and diclofenac) was taken into account By comparing the characteristic parameters of the models, obtained from the experiments using pure water and actual wastewater, the effects of CESs on the respective removal mechanisms could be separately and quantitatively evaluated. As a general tendency, the AOPs proceeded less effectively (were inhibited) in the matrices containing CESs, as observed with the use of a lower initial concentration of pharmaceuticals. The inhibition mechanisms differed for the three types of AOPs. In the photo-Fenton process, the Fenton reaction was improved by the incorporation of CESs, while the photo-reduction reaction was significantly inhibited. In the TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation process, competition between the pharmaceuticals and CESs for adsorption on the catalyst surface was a less significant inhibitory factor than the scavenger effects of the CESs. The combined ozone and hydrogen peroxide oxidation process was most strongly inhibited by CESs among the AOPs investigated in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An effective, specific and accurate method is presented for the quantification of 13 markers of anthropogenic contaminants in water using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Validation was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Method recoveries ranged from 77 to 114% and limits of quantification between 0.75 and 4.91 ng/L. A study was undertaken to quantify the concentrations and loadings of the selected contaminants in 6 sewage treatment works (STW) effluent discharges as well as concentrations in 5 rain-driven street runoffs and field drainages. Detection frequencies in STW effluent ranged from 25% (ethinylestradiol) to 100% (benzoylecgonine, bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS) and diclofenac). Average concentrations of detected compounds in STW effluents ranged from 3.62 ng/L (ethinylestradiol) to 210 ng/L (BPA). Levels of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) as well as the plasticiser BPA were found in street runoff at maximum levels of 1160 ng/L, 647 ng/L and 2405 ng/L respectively (8.52, 3.09 and 2.7 times more concentrated than maximum levels in STW effluents respectively). Rain-driven street runoff may have an effect on levels of PFCs and plasticisers in receiving rivers and should be further investigated. Together, this method with the 13 selected contaminants enables the quantification of various markers of anthropogenic pollutants: inter alia pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites from humans and improper disposal of drugs, while the plasticisers and perfluorinated compounds may also indicate contamination from industrial and transport activity (street runoff).

AB Production in the pharmaceutical industry has increased and along with it, the amount of wastewater of various characteristics and contaminant concentrations. The main chemicals in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants-such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)-and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced in the amphipod Hyalella azteca by the effluent from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. The median lethal concentration (72 h-LC50) was determined and H. azteca were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (0.0732 %) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, and biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated [hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the superoxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)]. Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P < 0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC in H. azteca at all exposure times. Antioxidant enzymes activity SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to the control group. In conclusion, the industrial effluent analyzed in the present study contains NSAIDs and NaClO, and induces oxidative stress in H. azteca.

AB Sub-lethal toxicological responses are common occurrences in aquatic animals exposed to sewage wastewater and organic wastewater contaminants. Behavioural alterations are particularly sensitive indicators of sub-lethal toxicological stress in animals exposed to various pollutants, and often correlate with higher-level outcomes. Diurnal activity patterns in many fish species are sensitive to changes in natural biotic factors, but few studies have explored how environmental pollutants influence such rhythms. We investigated diurnal activity patterns in the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), after exposure to UV-treated sewage and a mixture of key contaminants identified through chemical analysis and subsequent risk-based prioritization of the wastewater. Exposure to 50% and 100% wastewater abolished daytime activity levels in male, but not female fish. Chemical analysis identified fluoxetine, diazinon and triclosan above their reported predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PNECs), and fish were thus exposed to a mixture of these compounds at 1, 10 and 100 g l(-1). Behavioural responses were highly consistent between fish exposed to wastewater and the contaminant mixture, indicating that these prioritized contaminants are indeed likely contributing to the observed effects. Effective concentrations of the mixture were considerably lower than those reported as eliciting behavioural effects in previous studies exploring each of these compounds alone. Results warn of the potential for negative higher-level consequences associated with exposures of fish to common organic wastewater contaminants, as altered diurnal activity patterns could conceivably scale-up to influence performance including foraging success and predator avoidance. Further research is necessary to increase our understanding of linkages between alterations to diurnal activities and effects at the population level. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
   Diurnal activity patterns occur in many fish species and are sensitive to changes in natural factors. We exposed the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to treated sewage and a mixture of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) identified in the wastewater, and quantified outcomes on diurnal rhythms. Daytime activity was abolished in male fish exposed to sewage and the mixture, whereas female activity was only significantly reduced with the PPCP mixture. Results demonstrate that diurnal activities provide a sensitive indication of sub-lethal toxicity in fish exposed to environmental pollutants.

AB An analysis of wastewater from Krakow (Poland) for the presence of controlled and uncontrolled stimulant drugs of abuse was performed. Samples were collected from the Plaszow wastewater treatment plant, Krakow, Poland, and prepared by solid phase extraction. The LC-QTOFMS method was applied for identification and quantification of popular stimulants: MDMA, mephedrone, 4-MEC, MDPV and mCPP. Environmental loads of illicit drugs were calculated; the WWTP discharged loads ranging from 3.6 to 6.7 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of MDMA, 3.6 to 7.1 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of mephedrone and 4.8 to 5.8 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of 4-MEC. The results confirmed the growing popularity of new psychoactive substances in Poland.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been identified as environmental emerging pollutants and are present in different compartments, including soils. Chemical remediation showed to be a good and suitable approach for soil remediation, though the knowledge in their impact for terrestrial organisms is still limited. Therefore, in this work, two different chemical remediation treatments (Fenton oxidation and nanoremediation) were applied to a soil contaminated with an environmental representative concentration of ibuprofen (3 ng g(-1)). The phytotoxic impact of a traditional soil remediation treatment (Fenton oxidation) and of a new and more sustainable approach for soil remediation (nanoremediation using green nano-scale zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVIs)) was evaluated in Lactuca sativa seeds. Percentage of seed germination, root elongation, shoot length and leaf length were considered as endpoints to assess the possible acute phytotoxicity of the soil remediation treatments as well as of the ibuprofen contaminated soil. Both chemical remediation treatments showed to have a negative impact in the germination and development of lettuce seeds, exhibiting a reduction up to 45% in the percentage of seed germination and a decrease around 80% in root elongation comparatively to the contaminated soil. These results indicate that chemical soil remediation treatments could be more prejudicial for terrestrial organisms than contaminated soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to study the occurrence, fate, and seasonal variations of pharmaceuticals at two urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in India and compare the results with a similar study conducted in the United States. This is the first study of its kind in comparing occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater of two different countries with the same methodology and analytical techniques. Twelve most relevant pharmaceuticals were selected for seasonal monitoring at two Indian WWTPs based on the comprehensive survey and through literature review. The yearly average influent concentrations of total pharmaceuticals were found to be 537 +/- 5 mu g/L at WWTP-1 and 353 +/- 9 mu g/L at WWTP-2. WWTP-2 exhibited comparatively higher removal efficiency of total pharmaceuticals (85% versus 59%, excluding monsoon season), possibly due to the cyclic activated sludge technology followed by chlorination employed at WWTP-2. Comparison with a similar study conducted in the United States revealed that concentration of most of the pharmaceuticals detected in the U.S. WWTPs were, on an average, more than 50% lower. U.S. WWTPs also exhibited 10-30% higher removal efficiencies for total pharmaceuticals. Our study results show that preliminary treatment and biological treatment alone are not adequate for complete removal of pharmaceuticals and polishing step and tertiary treatment is a necessity if higher removal of pharmaceuticals is desired in Indian WWTPs. Information obtained from this study will not only aid the local utilities but will also benefit understanding of global trends in usage of pharmaceuticals and their distribution in the environment.

AB The toxicity of water-receiving bodies, the effluent and other treatment stages in wastewater treatment plants has recently been of interest to the public due to the lack of a regulated toxicity-based index for wastewater discharge in China. This study aimed to evaluate the conventional pollution parameters and toxicities of wastewaters collected at different treatment stages from a pharmaceutical industrial park wastewater treatment plant through dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and bioluminescent bacteria (Vibrio qinghaiensis) tests. The results of an analysis of conventional parameters indicated that the total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) were largely removed after various treatments. However, the TN, NH3-N and COD still exceeded the regulated standards. The tested pharmaceutical park effluents were mainly polluted with organic pollutants and nitrogenous. The toxicity test results indicated that the toxicities could be markedly reduced after treatment, with the toxicities of two out of the six effluent samples at different treatment stages being greater than the influent toxicity. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients indicated a significantly positive correlation between the toxicity values obtained using the DHA and Vibrio qinghaiensis tests. Compared with the DHA measurement, the Vibrio qinghaiensis test was faster and more sensitive. Meanwhile, the toxicity indicators were significantly and positively correlated with the TSS, TN, TP and COD concentrations. These results may aid the understanding of the toxicity of pharmaceutical industrial park wastewaters and toxicity removal using the treatment techniques that are currently utilized in China.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are a class of emerging contaminants that are present in wastewater effluents, surface water, and groundwater around the world. There is a need to determine rapid and reliable bioindicators of exposure and the toxic mode of action of these contaminants to aquatic organisms. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was used to determine the metabolic profile of Daphnia magna after exposure to a range of sub-lethal concentrations of triclosan (6.25-100 mu g/L), carbamazepine (1.75-14 mg/L) and ibuprofen (1.75-14 mg/L) for 48 h. Sub-lethal triclosan exposure suggested a general oxidative stress condition and the branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, glutamate, and methionine emerged as potential bioindicators. The aromatic amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine are potential bioindicators for sub-lethal carbamazepine exposure that may have altered energy metabolism. The potential bioindicators for sub-lethal ibuprofen exposure are serine, methionine, lysine, arginine and leucine, which showed a concentration-dependent response. The differences in the metabolic changes were related to the dissimilar modes of toxicity of triclosan, carbamazepine and ibuprofen. H-1 NMR-based metabolomics gave an improved understanding of how these emerging contaminants impact the keystone species D. magna. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of ibuprofen was investigated in aqueous solution by three-dimensional particle electrode (TDE) technology. When the initial concentration was between 10 and 40mg/L, almost 80% of the ibuprofen was degraded at 6h. However, only about 16.64% of ibuprofen was mineralized even at 6h according to total organic carbon measurements. A combined process of TDE and biological aerated filter (BAF) was therefore developed to enhance the treatment of ibuprofen contaminated municipal sewage. The effluent quality of coupled process was substantially improved by TDE due to the degradation of ibuprofen and related intermediates. The experimental results showed that TDE-BAF is effective for removing ibuprofen from municipal sewage.

AB In this study, the toxic effects of binary mixtures of Pharmaceutical Active Compounds (PhACs) that are observed in the effluents from a wide range sewage treatment plants and surface water bodies were investigated using the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri (Microtox (R) test). The selected chemicals were the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac sodium [DCF] and the anti-epileptic carbamazepine [CBZ]. In addition, caffeine [CFF], a psychoactive stimulant of the central nervous system, was also included in the study. Binary combinations were prepared at a predefined ratio that corresponded to the individual IC50 values of the investigated compounds (equitoxic ratio). The experimental results were compared with those obtained using the two most frequently used predictive models in aquatic toxicology: the Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA) models. The results indicated that both models predict the observed mixture toxicity of the DCF-CBZ and DCF-CFF mixtures quite well. However, in the case of CFF-CBZ, both models slightly overestimated the experimental results, suggesting the presence of a potential antagonistic effect. The application of the Combination Index (CI) method, which allows us to identify and quantify the nature of the interactions between the chemicals present in a mixture (synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects), confirmed the additive behaviour of the DCF-CBZ and DCF-CFF combinations and the slightly antagonistic effect observed for the binary mixture of CFF-CBZ.

AB This study investigated the fate of selected pharmaceuticals and estrogens and the characteristics of bulk organic matter during pellet softening and proposed a possible hybridization with nanofiltration (NF) treatment. A groundwater softening system called pellet softening was used to remove calcium ions from groundwater by crystallizing calcium carbonate on the surface of sand grains that were used as seeding material. This crystallization was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron micrographs were used to characterize the surface of the sand grains during pellet softening. The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix showed that humic-like substances were slightly removed and that specific UV absorbance values decreased after pellet softening. The humic fraction determined by liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection was slightly more attenuated than the fractions of biopolymers, building blocks, low molecular weight acids, and low molecular weight neutrals. Therefore, the aromatic content per unit of dissolved organic carbon was preferentially attenuated during pellet softening. The average removal efficiencies of the three estrogens and 12 selected pharmaceuticals during the softening process were 59 and 5.7%, respectively. However, there was a greater reduction of pharmaceuticals during NF.

AB Phenol is one of the most toxic pollutants which get into the water ponds and streams with wastewater from chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. The most effective method of wastewater treatment from phenol is its adsorption on activated carbon, but the disadvantages of this sorbent usage are its high cost, the necessity of regeneration and soot formation due to the brittleness of carbon atoms bonds. A new trend that has intensively developed in the practice of water treatment recently is the use of wastes of industrial and agricultural production as reagents for removing of pollutants from natural water and wastewater. Cellulose and keratin-containing wastes from processing of agricultural raw materials are of particular interest. The advantages of these reagents are available resource base, renewability, low cost, availability and ease of disposal. Therefore, in single-step static adsorption mode with the use of phenol solutions as the model systems the kinetics of phenol adsorption by natural materials, namely, wheat husk, rye husk, oat husk and barley husk was studied at different temperatures (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C). Rye husk did not show any sorption properties in relation to phenol. For wheat, oat and barley husks the adsorption isotherms were constructed in coordinates: 1/F = f(1/C), lgF = f(lgC), lnF = f(epsilon(2)). The equations which describe the processes of phenol sorption by wheat, oat and barley husks were calculated. It was found that processes of phenol adsorption by wheat, oats and barley husks can be better represented by the Dubinin - Radushkevich equation, although Langmuir equation can also be used to describe these processes with correlation coefficients more than 0,992.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed to improve human and animal health, but may also be a threat to freshwater ecosystems, particularly after receiving urban or wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Knowledge on the fate and attenuation of pharmaceuticals in engineered and natural ecosystems is rather fragmented, and comparable methods are needed to facilitate the comprehension of those processes amongst systems. In this study the dynamics of 8 pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ibuprofen, diclofenac, diazepam) and 11 of their transformation products were investigated in a WWTP and the associated receiving river ecosystem. During 3 days, concentrations of these compounds were quantified at the influents, effluents, and wastage of the WWTP, and at different distances downstream the effluent at the river. Attenuation (net balance between removal and release from and to the water column) was estimated in both engineered and natural systems using a comparable model-based approach by considering different uncertainty sources (e.g. chemical analysis, sampling, and flow measurements). Results showed that pharmaceuticals load reduction was higher in the WWTP, but attenuation efficiencies (as half-life times) were higher in the river. In particular, the load of only 5 out of the 19 pharmaceuticals was reduced by more than 90% at the WWTP, while the rest were only partially or non-attenuated (or released) and discharged into the receiving river. At the river, only the load of ibuprofen was reduced by more than 50% (out of the 6 parent compounds present in the river), while partial and non-attenuation (or release) was observed for some of their transformation products. Linkages in the routing of some pharmaceuticals (venlafaxine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and their corresponding transformation products were also identified at both WWTP and river. Finally, the followed procedure showed that dynamic attenuation in the coupled WWTP-river system could be successfully predicted with simple first order attenuation kinetics for most modeled compounds.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants are ineffective in removing a broad range of micropollutants, resulting in the release of these compounds into the aquatic environment, including natural drinking water resources. Ozonation is a suitable treatment process for micropollutant removal, although, currently, little is known about the formation, behavior, and removal of transformation products (TP) formed during ozonation. We investigated the elimination of 30 selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, industrial chemicals, and TP) by biological treatment coupled with ozonation and, subsequently, in parallel with two biological filters (BF) or granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. The selected micropollutants were removed to very different extents during the conventional biological wastewater treatment process. Ozonation (specific ozone consumption: 0.87 +/- 0.29 g(03) g(DOG)(-1) hydraulic retention time: 17 +/- 3 min) eliminated a large number of the investigated micropollutants. Although 11 micropollutants could still be detected after ozonation, most of these were eliminated in subsequent GAC filtration at bed volumes (BV) of approximately 25,000 m(3) m(-3). In contrast, no additional removal of micropollutants was achieved in the BF. Ozonation of the analgesic tramadol led to the formation of tramadol-N-oxide that is effectively eliminated by GAC filters, but not by BF. For the antiviral drug acyclovir, the formation of carboxy-acyclovir was observed during activated sludge treatment, with an average concentration of 3.4 +/- 1.4 mu g L-1 detected in effluent samples. Subsequent ozonation resulted in the complete elimination of carboxy-acyclovir and led to the formation of N-(4-carbamoyl-2-imino-5oxo imidazolidin)-formamido-N-methoxyacetetic acid (COFA; average concentration: 2.6 +/- 1.0 mu g L-1). Neither the BF nor the GAC filters were able to remove COFA. These results highlight the importance of considering TP in the evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment processes. The results further indicate that post-treatment of ozonated wastewater with GAC filtration seems to be more suitable than BF, due to the sorption of formed TP to the activated carbon.

AB The effects of elevated inorganic salt concentration on anaerobic membrane bioreactor ( AnMBR) treatment regarding basic biological performance and trace organic contaminant ( TrOC) removal were investigated. A set of 33 TrOCs were selected to represent pharmaceuticals, steroids, and pesticides in municipal wastewater. Results show potential adverse effects of increase in the bioreactor salinity to 15 g/L ( as NaCl) on the performance of AnMBR with respect to chemical oxygen demand removal, biogas production, and the removal of most hydrophilic TrOCs. Furthermore, a decrease in biomass production was observed as salinity in the bioreactor increased. The removal of most hydrophobic TrOCs was high and was not significantly affected by salinity build-up in the bioreactor. The accumulation of a few persistent TrOCs in the sludge phase was observed, but such accumulation did not vary significantly as salinity in the bioreactor increased.

AB In this study, UV based treatments were implemented at pilot scale to assess their ability to remove hormones from treated wastewater, especially with the view to equip small and medium size Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs). To this end, the degradation of a mixture of estrogenic hormones (Estrone (E1), beta-Estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-Ethinyl Estradiol (EE2)) in waters by UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 process was investigated in real conditions. A particular attention was paid at designing a well validated laboratory scale pilot in order to optimise oxidant concentrations and UV fluence. A Low pressure lamp (254 nm) was used in a flow through commercial reactor. The effects of water matrices (drinking water and treated wastewater) and H2O2 concentrations (10, 40, and 90 mg/L) on the pilot efficiency were first determined. Only E1 could be partially degraded by UV photolysis whereas hormones were all well removed by UV/H2O2 process in both matrices. The second part of the study focused on a chemical and biological assessment of UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 process (30 and 50 mg/L). Degradation rate constants of hormones as well as changes in estrogenic activity (YES bioassay) and toxicity (Vibrio fischeri) were followed at the same time. UV photolysis could not remove neither estrogens nor estrogenic activity at relevant UV fluence in waters. However 80% of initial estrogenic compounds and estrogenic activity could be removed from treated wastewater by combining UV fluence of 423 and 520 mJ/cm(2) with 50 and 30 mg/L of H2O2, respectively. No high estrogenic or toxic by-products were detected by the two bioassays following UV photolysis or UV/H2O2 process. Operating costs were estimated for a full scale pilot. H2O2 was the major cost. By combining the appropriate concentration of H2O2 and UV fluence, it could be possible to design a cost effective treatment for treating estrogens in small and medium size WTPs.

AB The stability of lamotrigine (LMG) and its principal human metabolite, lamotrigine N2-glucuronide (LMG-N2-G), was studied as a function of pH (4-9). While LMG was stable across the entire pH range, under neutral-basic conditions, LMG-N2-G was converted to three transformation products (TPs) which were identified using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The MS fragmentation studies indicated that two TPs were the result of the hydrolysis of the amidine and guanidine moieties. The third TP detected was an intermediate in the guanidine hydrolysis reaction. In order to evaluate the transformation kinetics of the LMG-N2-G degradation, another set of pH-dependent experiments was carried out in hospital effluent, wastewater influent and effluent spiked at 20 and 200 nM after pH adjustment (pH 6.5, 7, 8, 8.5 and 9), demonstrating that, at higher pH, LMG-N2-G is degraded at higher rate. Later, the pH-dependent stability of related compounds with different nitrogen N2-substituents (N2-R) on the 1,2,4-triazine ring was studied. This revealed that because of different imino tautomer equilibrium LMG (N2-H) and LMG-N2-oxide ((+)N2-O-) were stable at all pHs but N2-methyl-LMG (N2-CH3) as well as LMG-N2-G were susceptible to amidine and guanidine hydrolysis at basic pH. Finally, hospital effluent samples collected over the course of one week were monitored for their presence. LMG, LMG-N2-G and two of its TPs were detected with concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 1 mu gL(-1). (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of kinetic models to predict oxidation performance in wastewater is limited due to fast ozone depletion during the first milliseconds of the reaction. This paper introduces the Quench Flow Module (QFM), a bench-scale experimental technique developed to measure the first 5-500 milliseconds of ozone depletion for accurate determination of ozone exposure in wastewater-ozonation processes. Calculated ozone exposure in QFM experiments was up to 24% lower than in standard batch experiments, strongly depending on the initial sampling point for measurement in batch experiments. However, oxidation rates of slowly- and moderately-reacting trace organic compounds (TrOCs) were accurately predicted from batch experiments based on integration of ozone depletion and removal of an ozone resistant probe compound to calculate oxidant exposures. An alternative concept, where ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures are back-calculated from the removal of two probe compounds, was tested as well. Although the QFM was suggested to be an efficient mixing reactor, ozone exposure ranged over three orders of magnitude when different probe compounds reacting moderately with ozone were used for the calculation. These effects were beyond uncertainty ranges for apparent second order rate constants and consistently observed with different ozone-injection techniques, i.e. QFM, batch experiments, bubble columns and venturi injection. This indicates that previously suggested mixing effects are not responsible for the difference and other still unknown factors might be relevant. Results furthermore suggest that ozone exposure calculations from the relative residual concentration of a probe compound are not a promising option for evaluation of ozonation of secondary effluents.

AB Microalgae based treatment was studied to polish sequential batch reactor (SBR) treated pharmaceutical wastewater under mixotrophic mode of operation with simultaneous biomass/lipid production. At the end of biomass growth phase (BGP), carbon removal efficiency was observed to be 73% along with good removal of nitrates (62%). Since microalgae assimilate nutrients from wastewater for growth, an increment in total biomass productivity (2.8 g/l) was observed. Subjecting to nutrient stress phase (NSP), total lipid content of 17.2% with neutral lipids of 6.2% was observed under light condition. Contrarily, dark condition depicted total lipid content of 15.8% with neutral lipids constituting 6.5%. The nutrient stress in combination with light showed marked influence on the profile of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Integration of microalgae cultivation improves environmental sustainability and enables greener routes of biofuels and value added products synthesis in a biorefinery approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to their widespread use in human and animal healthcare, antibiotics and other drug residues are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Given their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and public health, the quantification of environmental drug residues has become a necessity. Various analysis techniques have been found to be suitable for reliable detection of such compounds. However, quantification can be difficult because these compounds are present at trace or ultra-trace levels. Consequently, the accuracy of environmental analyses depends on both the efficiency and the robustness of the extraction and quantification method. In this work, an off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS was applied to the simultaneous extraction and quantification of 26 pharmaceutical products, including 18 antibiotics, dissolved in a water phase. Optimal conditions were determined and then applied to assess the contamination level of the targeted drug residues in water collected from four sites in Northern France: a river, the input and output of an aerated lagoon, and a wastewater treatment plant. Drug residues associated with suspended solid matter (SSM) were also quantified in this work using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) combined with an on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS system in order to complete an assessment of the degree of total background pollution.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate interactions of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NP) and natural organic matter (NOM) in aqueous suspensions. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of particles of TiO2 NP and NOM in the suspensions ranged from 113 to 255 nm. During batch experiments the radioactivity resulting from (CIP)-C-14 was determined in the filtrate (filter pore size 100 nm) by scintillation measurements,
   to 72 h, no significant sorption of NOM to TiO2 NP was observed at a TiO2 NP concentration of 5 mg/L. When the concentration of TiO2 NP was increased to 500 mg/L, a small amount of NOM of 9.5% +/- 0.6% was sorbed at 72 h. The low sorption affinity of NOM on TiO2 NP surfaces could be explained by the negative charge of both components in alkaline media or by the low hydrophobicity of the NOM contents.
   a TiO2NP concentration of 5 mg L r, the sorption of CIP on TiO2 NP was insignificant (TiO2 NP/CIP ratio: 10). When the TiO2 NP/CIP ratio was increased to 1000, a significant amount of 53.6% +/- 7.2% of CIP was sorbed on TiO2 NP under equilibrium conditions at 64 h. In alkaline media, CIP is present mainly as zwitterions which have an affinity to sorb on negatively charged TiO2 NP surfaces. The sorption of CIP on TiO2 NP in the range of TiO2 NP concentrations currently estimated for municipal wastewater treatment plants is estimated to be rather low. The Freundlich sorption coefficients (K-F) in the presence of NOM of 2167 L-n mg mg(-n) kg(-1) was about 10 times lower than in the absence of NOM. This is an indication that the particle fraction of NOM < 100 nm could play a role as a carrier for ionic organic micro-pollutants as CIP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of carbon based materials on the removal of antibiotics with high concentrations has been well studied, however the effect of this removal method is not clear on the actual concentration of environments, such as the hospital wastewater, sewage treatment plants and aquaculture wastewater. In this study, experimental studies on the adsorption of 7 antibiotics in environmental concentration of aqueous solutions by carbon based materials have been observed. Three kinds of carbon materials have shown very fast adsorption to antibiotics by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) detection, and the highest removal efficiency of antibiotics could reach to 100% within the range of detection limit. Surprisedly, the adsorption rate of graphene with small specific surface area was stronger than other two biochar, and adsorption rate of the two biochar which have approximate specific surface and different carbonization degree, was significantly different. The key point to the present observation were the pi-pi interactions between aromatic rings on adsorbed substance and carbon based materials by confocal laser scanning microscope observation. Moreover, adsorption energy markedly increased with increasing number of the pi rings by using the density functional theory (DFT), showing the particular importance of pi-pi interactions in the adsorption process.

AB The effects of pig manure, from diets incorporating veterinary pharmaceuticals, on survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida were evaluated. Manures derived from the following diets: corn and soymeal (CS); 85% CS diet + 15% wheat meal (TR); CS diet + 100 ppm doxycycline + 50 ppm colistin + 2500 ppm Zn oxide (CSa); TR diet + 100 ppm doxycycline + 50 ppm colistin + 2500 ppm Zn oxide (TRa). Manures were tested in two subtropical soils representative of southern (Oxisol and Entisol). Despite the antibiotics no significant differences were found between the four manures within each soil. However, strong differences were found on the toxicity between soils. In Oxisol, LC50 values were around 100 m(3) ha(-1), and EC50 values around 80 m(3) ha(-1). In Entisol these were much lower, with LC50 values oscillating around 20 m(3) ha(-1) and EC50 values between 10-15 m(3) ha(-1). The observed toxicity on both soils was attributed to excess of nitrogen, Cu and Zn in the highest doses. The strong difference between soils could be explained by soil properties, namely CEC, organic matter, and clay contents that were lower in Entisol, indicating a poor ability to retain contaminants increasing their availability in soil. Results suggest that the application of these residues should be regulated not only using a volume-based criterion, but should incorporate data on soil properties, complemented by an ecotoxicological assessment.

AB A screening of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and additives in personal care products (PPCPs) in sub-arctic locations of the Faroe Islands (FO), Iceland (IS) and Greenland (GL) was conducted. In total 36 pharmaceuticals including some metabolites, and seven additives in personal care products were investigated in influent and effluent waters as well as sludge of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and in water and sediment of recipients. Concentrations and distribution patterns for PPCPs discharged via sewage lines (SLs) to the marine environment were assessed. Of the 36 pharmaceuticals or metabolites analysed 33 were found close to or above the limit of detection (LOD) in all or a part of the samples. All of the seven investigated additives in personal care products were detected above the LOD. Some of the analysed PPCPs occurred in every or almost every sample. Among these were diclofenac, ibuprofen, lidocaine, naproxen, metformin, citalopram, venlafaxine, amiloride, furosemide, metoprolol, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and cetrimonium salt (ATAC-C16). Additionally, the study encompasses ecotoxicological risk assessment of 2/3 of the analysed PPCPs in recipient and diluted effluent waters. For candesartan only a small margin to levels with inacceptable risks was observed in diluted effluent waters at two locations (FO). Chronical risks for aquatic organisms staying and/or living around WWTP effluent pipe-outlets were indicated for 17 beta-estradiol and estriol in the three countries. Additives in PCPs were found to pose the largest risk to the aquatic environment. The surfactants CAPB and ATAC-C16 were found in concentrations resulting in risk factors up to 375 for CAPB and 165 for ATAC-C16 in recipients for diluted effluents from Iggia, Nuuk (GL) and Torshavn (FO) respectively. These results demonstrates a potentially high ecological risk stemming from discharge of surfactants as used in household and industrial detergents as well as additives in personal care products.

AB The macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin are very important in human and animal medicine, and can be entrained onto agricultural ground through application of sewage sludge or manures. In the present study, a series of replicated field plots were left untreated or received up to five annual spring applications of a mixture of three drugs to achieve a nominal concentration for each of 10 or 0.1 mg kg(-1) soil; the latter an environmentally relevant concentration. Soil samples were incubated in the laboratory, and supplemented with antibiotics to establish the dissipation kinetics of erythromycin and clarithromycin using radioisotope methods, and azithromycin using HPLC-MS/MS. All three drugs were dissipated significantly more rapidly in soils with a history of field exposure to 10 mg kg(-1) macrolides, and erythromycin and clarithromycinwere also degraded more rapidly in field soil exposed to 0.1 mg kg(-1) macrolides. Rapid mineralization of C-14-labelled erythromycin and clarithromycin are consistent with biodegradation. Analysis of field soils revealed no carryover of parent compound from year to year. Azithromycin transformation products were detected consistent with removal of the desosamine and cladinose moieties. Overall, these results have revealed that following several years of exposure to macrolide antibiotics these are amenable to accelerated degradation. The potential accelerated degradation of these drugs in soils amended with manure and sewage sludge should be investigated as this phenomenon would attenuate environmental exposure and selection pressure for clinically relevant resistance.

AB The aim of our study was to assess the aerobic biodegradation of four selected sulfonamides (sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine and sulfathiazole) using water samples drawn from highly polluted rivers. Additionally, we aimed to identify the factors that have a significant effect on the process efficiency.
   The 19 water samples were collected from Brynica and Czarna Przemsza rivers (in Poland) at the same location at approximately monthly intervals. A characteristic feature of the results is the presence of significant differences between the rates of sulfonamides biodegradation in particular samples.
   The sulfonamide most resistant to biodegradation was sulfamethoxazole, whereas sulfathiazole was most biodegradable. Seasonal variations and related microbial population changes had the most significant effects on sulfonamides biodegradation, e.g., the studied process was highly inhibited during wintertime. A decrease in the biodegradation rate in the river water could be caused by an accidental water pollution by industrial wastewater with heavy metals, an increase in salinity and a decrease in pH, and turbidity.

AB Discharge of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may contribute to deleterious effects on aquatic life. Release to the environment occurs both through WWTP effluent discharge and runoff following land applications of biosolids. This study introduces Enhanced Biological TOrC Removal (EBTCR), which involves continuous bioaugmentation of TOrC-degrading bacteria for improved removal in WWTPs. Influence of bioaugmentation on enhanced degradation was investigated in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), using bisphenol A (BPA) as the TOrC. The reactors were operated with 8 cycles per day and at two solids retention times (SRTs). Once each day, the test reactor was bioaugmented with Sphingobium sp. BiD32, a documented l3PA-degrading culture. After bioaugmentation, BPA degradation (including both the dissolved and sorbed fractions) was 2-4 times higher in the test reactor than in a control reactor. Improved removal persisted for >5 cycles following bioaugmentation. By the last cycle of the day, enhanced BPA removal was lost, although it returned with the next bioaugmentation. A net loss of Sphingobium sp. BiD32 was observed in the reactors, supporting the original hypothesis that continuous bioaugmentation (rather than single-dose bioaugmentation) would be required to improve TOrCs removal-during wastewater treatment. This study represents a first demonstration of a biologically based approach for enhanced TOrCs removal that both reduces concentrations in wastewater effluent and prevents transfer to biosolids.

AB Hybrid polycation-clay composites, based on methylated poly vinylpyridinium, were optimized as sorbents for secondary effluent organic matter (EfOM) including emerging micropollutants. Composite structure was tuned by solution ionic strength and characterized by zeta potential, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analyses. An increase in ionic strength induced a transition from a train to a loops and tails configuration, accompanied by greater polycation adsorption. Composite charge reversal (zeta potential -18 to 45 mV) increased the adsorption of EfOM and humic acid (HA), moderately and sharply, respectively, suggesting electrostatic and also nonspecific interactions with EfOM. Filtration of EfOM by columns of positively charged composites was superior to that of granular activated carbon (GAC). The overall removal of EfOM was most efficient by the composite with a train configuration. Whereas a composite with a loops and tails configuration was beneficial for the removal of the anionic micropollutants diclofenac, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen from EfOM. These new findings suggest that the loops and tails may offer unique binding sites for small micropollutants which are overseen by the bulk EfOM. Furthermore, they may explain our previous observations that in the presence of dissolved organic matter, micropollutant filtration by GAC columns was reduced, while their filtration by composite columns remained high.

AB In the last few decades, the presence of pharmaceutical products in the environment is known under the name of emerging contaminants. These substances can enter the aquatic environment via different sources, as parent compounds, metabolites or a combination of both. In this work, we have investigated the presence of four pharmaceutical active compounds belonging to the group of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), in wastewater, surface water and drinking water of Algiers, which have a direct impact on the Mediterranean Sea. The target analytes (ibuprofen (IBU), naproxen (NAP), ketoprofen (KET), and diclofenac (DIC)), were extracted from the water samples by using Solid Phase Extraction Oasis (R) HLB Cartridges; the identification and quantification were realized by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC MS). To obtain the best resolution and precision, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was used as the derivatization reagent and ibuprofen-d(3) was used as the internal standard. The obtained recoveries were good, ranging from 82% for ketoprofen to 120% for naproxen with relatively small standard deviations (<= 20%). The target compounds were detected in wastewater, influent/effluent with concentrations ranging from 155.5 to 6554 ng/L, implicating removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), between 30.3 and 95%. The surface water was also contaminated with pharmaceuticals from 72.9 ng/L for diclofenac to 228.3 ng/L for naproxen. In addition, the occurrence of ibuprofen and ketoprofen in drinking water, at concentrations of 142.1 and 110.9 ng/L, respectively, attracts concerns about possible impacts on human health.

AB In this study, the capability of Vetiver zizaniodes in removing the pharmaceutical-based product, naproxen from wastewater was evaluated. The plant was exposed to naproxen at concentrations ranging from 50, 100, 300 and 500 mgL(-1) for duration up to 56 days. Several wastewater parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO, mgL(-1)) and oxygen-reduction potential (ORP, mV) were recorded during the experimental runs where pH and ORP exhibited significant different (p < 0.05). At the end of the exposure, 81.5%, 64.5% and 60.9% of naproxen were removed at 100, 300 and 500 mgL(-1) concentration, respectively. The interaction between time, system and concentration showed significant naproxen removal (p < 0.05) from water and soil. Phytostimulation and phytostabilization played a major role for naproxen removal when there was an activity of the bacteria presence in the soil around the roots of the plants. Hence, V. zizaniodes is a potential plant in remediating pharmaceutical-contaminated water and could act as a phytoremediator plant.

AB Nanoparticles of ZnO are disposed of in the environment and abound in wastewater, but their toxicity to plants is little known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological response of Azolla filiculoides to the presence of two ZnO particle sizes: analytical grade nanoparticles (NPs, 26.7 +/- 1 nm) and pharmaceutical grade submicrometric particles (SMPs, 238 +/- 30.7 nm), in three concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mg L-1), and a control. The experimental design was completely randomized, data were analyzed with an ANOVA and means were compared with Tukey (p <= 0.05). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the NPs were isodiametric, while the SMPs were elongated. Plants were incubated in Yoshida solution containing the NPs and SMPs in a greenhouse for 6 d. The small particles (NPs) and the concentration of 400 mg NPs ZnO L-1 reduced growth and concentration of chlorophylls (Chia, Chlb, CM total) and of carotenes and xanthophylls (c+x). Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was decreased in all tested concentrations compared with the control, especially with NPs, which were more toxic than SMPs. NPs reduced total antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds, relative to SMPs. Nitrogenase activity decreased in all the ZnO particle concentrations regardless of size. The Zn element microanalysis with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on scanning microscopy (EDS-SEM) showed that Zn was more abundant on the abaxial side of the frond, in function of NPs concentration, in contrast with that of SMPs. In conclusion, ZnO particle size is more determinant in degree of toxicity than concentration. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrogenase activity were good indicators of toxicity in this species.

AB Emerging contaminants traditionally have not been measured in the environment, but they recently have been detected in various water systems as a result of advancements in analytical methods. These contaminants pose potential threats to ecosystems and public health, but are generally not regulated, nor are they required to be routinely monitored. This paper presents the implementation of watershed-scale monitoring-site selection as an effective monitoring design for emerging contaminants. The study aimed to identify critical areas of emerging contaminants for both point and nonpoint sources in five selected watersheds in the United States with different land-use compositions and climate conditions. Spatial association analysis using the Getis-Ord's Gi* statistic was employed to identify clusters of point and nonpoint emerging contaminants considering the impact of neighboring subwatersheds. This analysis identified subbasins containing major wastewater treatment systems as point-source hotspots and those containing and surrounded by concentrated agricultural activities or urban residential areas as nonpoint-source hotspots The results, supported by the measurement data, indicated that the outlets of these identified hotspots should be monitored during both dry- and wet-weather periods in order to understand their impacts on receiving waters. The significance of monitoring point- and/or nonpoint-source pollution was dictated by the pollution source distribution, watershed characteristics, and climate settings. The approach in this study provides a quantitative basis for selecting monitoring locations and managing emerging contaminants that can be applied to other watersheds.

AB The occurrence of drugs in wastewater has been considered an imminent risk to the population, for the treatments used are usually ineffective. The presence of four popular drug residues (metformin, paracetamol, tetracycline, and enalapril) in hospital effluents, by using ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) with electrospray (ESI) ionization, and removal/degradation by membrane bioreactor (MBR) system are investigated in this study. For analysis method, all standard calibration curves showed satisfactory linearity (R (2) aeyen 0.993) within a relatively wide range. The recovery was between 70.4 and 105.0 %, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) values were within the ranges of 8.2 and 13.5 %. The effluent samples were collected at the end of the process treated in a bench-scale MBR treatment system and preconcentrated on solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Following that procedure, the chemical analysis demonstrated that the MBR system was effective in enalapril 94.3 +/- 7.63 %, tetracycline 99.4 +/- 0.02 %, and paracetamol 98.8 +/- 0.86 % removal. However, the polar metformin was less effectively removed (35.4 +/- 12.49 %). Moreover, the degradation products were investigated using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) by quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF), which has been indicated a tetracycline metabolite. In order to investigate the environmental impact, the wastewater potential risk was evaluated. The risk quotient (RQ) by measure environmental concentration (MEC) and its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) ratio (RQ = MEC/PNEC) was between 0.003 (enalapril) to 0.815 (paracetamol). Finally, this work demonstrates that UFLC-MS/MS (ESI-Q) is a sensitive and selective method for drug analysis in wastewater and with ESI-Q-TOF has the accuracy required for determining the degradation products of these compounds. Also, it indicated that membrane bioreactor systems represent a new generation of processes that have proved to outperform conventional treatment showing better effluent quality. The removal capacity studied in this work demonstrates the efficiency of this process.

AB Illicit drugs and their metabolites have recently been recognized as an emerging group of contaminants due to their potential ecotoxicological impact in aquatic ecosystems. To date, information on the occurrence of these compounds in the aquatic environment of China remains limited. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 36 rivers in north China that discharge into the Bohai Sea and north Yellow Sea and measured the concentrations of amphetamine-like compounds, ketamines, cocainics, and opioids. The occurrence and spatial patterns of these substances show significant differences between the rivers and regions. Two designer drugs, methamphetamine (METH) and ketamine (KET), were the most abundant compounds detected in the entire set of samples (detection frequency of 92 and 69 %). The concentrations of METH and KET ranged from <0.1 to 42.0 ng L-1 (mean = 4.53 ng L-1) and <0.05 to 4.50 ng L-1 (mean = 0.49 ng L-1), respectively. The high detection frequencies of METH and KET are consistent with the fact that they are the main illicit drugs consumed in China. The high concentrations of these illicit drugs and their metabolites were found in areas that have a high population density. The riverine input of total illicit drugs into the Bohai Sea and north Yellow Sea was estimated to be in the range of 684 to 1160 kg per year.

AB Vancomycin (VCM) is an antibiotic, known medically as the deadline for defending against bacteria. In this study, the removal and fate of VCM were investigated in each treatment unit at two pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) in eastern China. VCM was present in all wastewater and sludge samples of both PWWTPs. After the treatment procedure (the moving bed biofilm reactor technology for PWWTP1 and the modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic technology for PWWTP2), total removal efficiencies were up to 99 %, corresponding to a reduction of two orders of magnitude of the influent concentrations in both PWWTPs. The aerobic tank dominated VCM removal. Mass balance flow analyses indicated that biodegradation (99.15 % for PWWTP1 and 99.51 % for PWWTP2) was the principle mechanism for removing VCM, while the contribution of sorption by sludge for both PWWTPs was negligible. However, the results of the environmental risk assessment of VCM in the effluents showed that the maximum trigger quotient values were much higher than 1 in both PWWTPs, indicating the non-negligible environmental and health risks. This is the first report of the fate and risks of VCM in pharmaceutical wastewater, and underscores the importance of PWWTPs as antibiotic pollution sources, even though wastewater management appeared efficient.

AB The study investigates the influence of process parameters on the effectiveness of ozonation in the removal of organic micro-pollutants from wastewater. Primary and secondary municipal wastewater containing phenol was treated. The effect of operating parameters such as initial pH, ozone dosage, and initial contaminant concentration was studied. An increase in contaminant decomposition with pH (3-11) was observed. The contaminant removal efficiencies increased with an increase in ozone dose rate (5.5-36.17 mg L-1 min(-1)). Furthermore, the ultraviolet absorbance (UV 254 nm) of the wastewater decreased during ozonation indicating the breakdown of complex organic compounds into low molecular weight organics. Along the reaction, the pH of wastewater decreased from 11 to around 8.5 due to the formation of intermediate acidic species. Moreover, the biodegradability of wastewaters, measured as biological and chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD), increased from 0.22 to 0.53. High ozone utilization efficiencies of up to 95% were attained thereby increasing the process efficiency; and they were dependent on the ozone dosage and pH of solution. Ozonation of secondary wastewater attained the South African water standards in terms of COD required for wastewater discharge and dissolved organic carbon in drinking water and increased significantly the biodegradability of primary wastewater.

Overall, light at 193 nm proved to be efficient to degrade the investigated micropollutants (diclofenac, diatrizoic acid, sulfamethoxazole). Experiments with WWTP effluent proved the ability of radiation at 193 nm to degrade micropollutants which are hardly removed with commonly used oxidation technologies like ozonation (diatrizoic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid).

AB This study evaluated the impact of secondary municipal effluent discharge on carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations in small and medium rivers in northern Germany and compared the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) calculated with four well-established models. During a 1-year sampling period, secondary effluent grab samples were collected at four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) together with grab samples from the receiving waters upstream and downstream from the wastewater discharge points. The carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS-MS) after solid phase extraction. In the secondary effluents, 84-790 ng/L carbamazepine, 395-2100 ng/L diclofenac, and 745-5000 ng/L metoprolol were detected. The carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations analyzed in the rivers downstream from the secondary effluent discharge sites ranged from <5 to 68, 370, and 520 ng/L, respectively. Most of the downstream pharmaceutical concentrations were markedly higher than the corresponding upstream concentrations. The impact of wastewater discharge on the MECs in rivers downstream from the WWTPs was clearly demonstrated, but the correlations of the MECs with dilution factors were poor. The smallest rivers exhibited the largest maximum MECs and the widest ranges of MECs downstream from the wastewater discharge point. Three of the four tested models were conservative, as they showed higher PECs than the MECs in the rivers downstream from the WWTPs.

AB Estrogens are known to be potent endocrine disrupting chemicals that are commonly found in wastewater effluents at ng L-1 levels. Yet, we know very little about the distribution and fate of estrogens in coastal oceans that receive wastewater inputs. This study measured a wide range of steroidal estrogens in sewage- impacted seawater using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) together with the method of standard addition. In Massachusetts Bay, we find conjugated, free, and halogenated estrogens at concentrations that are consistent with dilution at sites close to the sewage source. At a site 6 miles down current of the sewage source, we observe estrone (E1) concentrations (520 +/- 180 pg L-1) that are nearly double the nearfield concentrations (320 +/- 60 pg L-1) despite 9- fold dilution of carbamazepine, which was used as a conservative sewage tracer. Our results suggest that background E1 concentrations in Massachusetts Bay (similar to 270 +/- 50 pg L-1) are derived largely from sources unrelated to wastewater effluent such as marine vertebrates.

AB Antineoplastic drugs are important in the treatment of cancer. Some interact directly with the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are of utmost importance in terms of risk. As highly active compounds, antineoplastics and their metabolites are largely excreted into wastewater and are found in the aquatic environment up to the lower mu g/L range. Their predicted environmental concentrations are often below the action limit set in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline. An in-depth risk assessment regarding their presence and effects in the aquatic environment is often not performed, and there is a lack of knowledge. This study considered whether there is an underestimation of possible risks associated with the presence of antineoplastic drugs with regard to trigger value stated in the EMA and FDA guidelines. In a balance, we identified a total of 102 active pharmaceutical ingredients of the ATC-group L01 (antineoplastic agents), which are environmentally relevant. In Germany, 20.7 t of antineoplastic agents was consumed in 2012. The share of drugs with DNA-damaging properties increased within the last 6 years from 24 up to 67 %. Solely, capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil amount together 8 t-which corresponds to 39 % of the total antineoplastic consumption. Around 80 % of the total mass consumed could be attributed to prescriptions issued by office-based practitioners and is mostly excreted at home. Based on the different mode of actions, a case-by-case evaluation of the risk connected to their presence in the environment is recommended. DNA-damaging drugs should be assessed independently as no action limit can be assumed.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceutical residues has become a major problem in many countries worldwide. However, little is known about the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water sources in Tunisia. Residues in the natural environment have been of increasing concern due to their impact on bacteria resistance development and toxicity to natural communities and ultimately to public health. In this work, we collected the wastewater sample from a pharmaceutical industry, which specializes in the antibiotics manufacture, during the years 2014-2015. Generally, this effluent is discharged into the marine environment and causes environmental problems. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was commonly used as a model organism for its peculiar morphofunctional properties which also make it an excellent marine environmental biomonitoring species. The histological sections of mussel, which are exposed at different dilutions of pharmaceutical wastewater (PW), indicate a large pathological power revealed on the gills. On the other hand, genotoxicity of the studied effluent was evaluated using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation in gill cells. Results show that PW exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.001) genotoxic effect in a dose-dependent manner. However, the toxic effects of PW decreased significantly after its treatment with Bacillus atrophaeus. Toxicities can be imputed to the presence of antibiotics. In fact, chemical analysis of the gills of mussel M. galloprovincialis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) showed the presence of some antibiotic residues. These concentrations decrease to half in mussels treated with PW biodegraded by B. atrophaeus.

AB Increased use of antidepressants has led to an increase in their detection in final treated wastewater effluents and receiving streams. Antidepressants are intended to modify human behavior by altering brain chemistry, and because of the high functional conservation of antidepressant target receptors in vertebrates, aquatic organisms may be at risk. The antidepressant bupropion is designed to alter brain norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in humans. The objective of the present study was to understand if alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilisxMorone chrysops) brain by bupropion would alter this predator's ability to capture prey. The authors exposed hybrid striped bass to bupropion in a static system for 6d, followed by a 6-d recovery period. During the present study's 12-d experiment, each hybrid striped bass was fed 4 unexposed fathead minnows every 3d, and the time it took the hybrid striped bass to consume each of those 4 fathead minnows was quantified. After each feeding event, hybrid striped bass brains were harvested and analyzed for changes in several brain neurotransmitter concentrations, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and many of their metabolites. Although bupropion altered the concentration of dopamine and many of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations in the brains on day 3 of the exposure, it did not alter the time to capture prey. This suggests that alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass brain does not alter a predator's ability to capture prey.

AB Fishes in estuarine waters are frequently exposed to treated wastewater effluent, among numerous other sources of contaminants, yet the impacts of these anthropogenic chemicals are not well understood in these dynamic and important waterways. Inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) at an early stage of development [12 days posthatch (dph)] were exposed to waters from two estuarine wastewater-treatment outfall locations in a tidal estuary, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta (California, USA) that had varied hydrology and input volumes. The genomic response caused by endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these waters was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a suite of hormonally regulated genes. Relative androgenic and estrogenic activities of the waters were measured using CALUX reporter bioassays. The presence of bifenthrin, a pyrethroid pesticide and known EDC, as well as caffeine and the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen, which were used as markers of wastewater effluent input, were determined using instrumental analysis. Detectable levels of bifenthrin (2.89 ng L-1) were found on one of the sampling dates, and caffeine was found on all sampling dates, in water from the Boynton Slough. Neither compound was detected at the Carquinez Strait site, which has a much smaller effluent discharge input volume relative to the receiving water body size compared with Boynton Slough. Water samples from both sites incubated in the CALUX cell line induced estrogenic and androgenic activity in almost all instances, though the estrogenicity was relatively higher than the androgenicity. Changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts of endocrine-responsive genes and indicators of general chemical stress were observed after a 96-h exposure to waters from both locations. The relative levels of endocrine response, changes in gene transcript abundance, and contaminant concentrations were greater in water from the Boynton Slough site despite those effluents undergoing a more advanced treatment process. The availability of a widely geographically distributed estuarine model species (M. beryllina) now allows for improved assessment of treated effluent impacts across brackish, estuarine, and marine environments.

AB The adsorption behavior and mechanism of ibuprofen (IBP) on BiOBr microspheres were investigated for revealing the role of adsorption in BiOBr-based photocatalysis under visible light irradiation. Parameters such as initial concentration of IBP, catalyst dosage, solution pH value, cations and anions that affect the adsorption and photocatalytic efficiency of IBP were studied. We observed that approximately 80% of the IBP removal rate contributed from BiOBr adsorption in photocatalysis process. This suggests that the removal rate of IBP by BiOBr is highly adsorptivity dependent, with higher removal rate at higher adsorptioh capacity. We believe that the anion exchange between Br and dissociated IBP followed by formation of Bi-O bond on the surface of BiOBr microspheres is the main acting force during the IBP adsorption, which was further proved by XPS and FT-IR analysis. Furthermore, the TOC removal rate difference between adsorption and photocatalysis was only 11%, which indicated that most of the removal rate contribution was from adsorption. Therefore, the BiOBr adsorption property should be preferentially considered when discussing its photocatalytic mechanism. Our current work is expected to offer new insight into BiOBr-based photocatalysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity of carrot (Daucus corota L) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), two plants that are usually eaten raw, to uptake tetracycline and amoxicillin (two commonly used antibiotics) from irrigated water was investigated in order to assess the indirect human exposure to antibiotics through consumption of un-cooked vegetables. Antibiotics in potted plants that had been irrigated with known concentrations of the antibiotics were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction and analyzed on a liquid chromatographtandem mass spectrometer. The plants absorbed the antibiotics from water in all tested concentrations of 0.1-15 mg L-1. Tetracycline was detected in all plant samples, at concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 28.3 ng/g in lettuce and 12.0-36.8 ng g(-1) fresh weight in carrots. Amoxicillin showed absorption with concentrations ranging from 13.7 ng g(-1) to 45.2 ng g(-1) for the plant samples. The mean concentration of amoxicillin (27.1 ng g(-1)) in all the samples was significantly higher (p = 0.04) than that of tetracycline (20.2 ng g(-1)) indicating higher uptake of amoxicillin than tetracycline. This suggests that the low antibiotic concentrations found in plants could be important for causing antibiotics resistance when these levels are consumed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) is of growing interest in water research and society. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been proven to be an effective method of removal for TOrCs in water, with the degree of effectiveness depending on dosage, contact time, and activated carbon type. In this study, the attenuation of TOrCs in three different secondary wastewater effluents using four PAC materials was studied in order to elucidate the effectiveness and efficacy of PAC for TOrC removal. With the notable exception of hydrochlorothiazide, all 14 TOrC indicators tested in this study exhibited a positive correlation of removal rate with their log D-ow values, demonstrating that the main adsorption mechanism was hydrophobic interaction. As a predictive model, the modified Chick-Watson model, often used for the prediction of microorganism inactivation by disinfectants, was applied. The applied model exhibited good predictive power for TOrC attenuation by PAC in wastewater. In addition, surrogate models based upon spectroscopic measurements including UV absorbance at 254 nm and total fluorescence were applied to predict TOrC removal by PAC. The surrogate model was found to provide an excellent prediction of TOrC attenuation for all combinations of water quality and PAC type included in this study. The success of spectrometric parameters as surrogates in predicting TOrC attenuation by PAC are particularly useful because of their potential application in real-time on-line sensor monitoring and process control at full-scale water treatment plants, which could lead to significantly reduced operator response times and PAC operational optimization.

AB The seasonal and spatial variations of 12 selected antibiotics belonging to four groups, including sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides, were investigated in three main tributaries of Liao River in Jilin Province, northeast China. The concentrations of the antibiotics in the surface water and surface sediments were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that oxytetracycline (OTC), erythromycin (ETM), and ofloxacin (OFL) were dominant antibiotics in the water, with mean concentration of 174.9 +/- 266.9, 103.2 +/- 95.5, and 67.1 +/- 77.3 ng/L, respectively, while OFL, OTC, and norfloxacin were prominent antibiotics in sediments, with mean concentration of 152.2 V 108.3, 149.5 +/- 147.6, and 62.8 +/- 83.3 ng/g, respectively. The total antibiotic concentrations in water at each sampling site were 1.2-3 times higher in autumn (November 2015) than those in summer (July 2015), whereas antibiotic concentrations in sediments showed no significant seasonal variation. The highest total antibiotic concentrations in water and sediments were observed around cities with large populations of humans and livestock. Risk assessment based on single antibiotic exposure revealed that OFL, ETM, and OTC were main antibiotics with potential adverse ecological consequences for aquatic organisms. In addition, the mixtures of selected antibiotics posed medium to high risk for aquatic organisms in the Liao River in Jilin Province.

AB The present study investigates the effect of addition of calcium hypochlorite in the titanium dioxide (TiO2) mediated degradation of bio-recalcitrant wastewater from pharmaceutical industry. The degradation studies were carried out in photoreactor irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light at 365 nm under slurry mode. The reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was estimated as an index of degradation. The influence of process parameters viz., catalyst dose, pH, oxidant concentration and source of light (UV/Solar) on degradation was studied. The degradation efficiency was also compared with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which has been widely used as an oxidant in the photocatalytic systems. The degradation efficiency of wastewater with oxidant alone was found to be comparatively less. Degradation of 67% was achieved in UV/TiO2 system at optimized conditions (3.0 g/L TiO2, pH 4) after 7 h of irradiation. The use of calcium hypochlorite (0.25 g/L) along with TiO2 (3.0 g/L) at pH 4 has been found to increase the degradation efficiency of wastewater up to 82% which would facilitate the recycling of wastewater from pharmaceutical industry.

AB This paper aims to understand enantioselective transformation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) and MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters. In order to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the processes occurring, stereoselective transformation of amphetamine-like compounds was studied, for the first time, in controlled laboratory experiments: receiving water and activated sludge simulating microcosm systems. The results demonstrated that stereoselective degradation, via microbial metabolic processes favouring S-(+)-enantiomer, occurred in all studied amphetamine-based compounds in activated sludge simulating microcosms. R-(-)-enantiomers were not degraded (or their degradation was limited) which proves their more recalcitrant nature. Out of all four amphetamine-like compounds studied, amphetamine was the most susceptible to biodegradation. It was followed by MDMA and methamphetamine. Photochemical processes facilitated degradation of MDMA and methamphetamine but they were not, as expected, stereoselective. Preferential biodegradation of S-(+)-methamphetamine led to the formation of S-(+)-amphetamine. Racemic MDMA was stereoselectively biodegraded by activated sludge which led to its enrichment with R-(-)-enantiomer and formation of S-(+)-MDA. Interestingly, there was only mild stereoselectivity observed during MDMA degradation in rivers. This might be due to different microbial communities utilised during activated sludge treatment and those present in the environment. Kinetic studies confirmed the recalcitrant nature of MDMA.

AB This study compared the two most frequently used disinfectants (i.e., chlorine and ozone) to understand their efficiency in wastewater effluents and the ecotoxicity of disinfection by-products created during chlorination and ozonation. Four trihalomethanes (THMs) and nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) were measured from a chlorine-disinfected sample and two aldehydes (i.e., formaldehydes and acetaldehydes) were analyzed after ozonation. Chlorination was effective for total coliform removal with Ct value in the range of 30-60 mg-min/L. Over 1.6 mg/L of ozone dose and 0.5 min of the contact time presented sufficient disinfection efficiency. The concentration of THMs increased with longer contact time (24 h), but that of HAAs showed little change with contact time. The measured concentration of formaldehyde at the ozone dose of 1.6 mg/L and the contact time of 9 min showed the greatest value in this study, approximately 330 mu g L-1, from which the corresponding ecotoxicity was determined using an indicator species, Daphnia magna. The ecotoxicity results were consistent with the toxicological features judged by occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Both the disinfection efficiency as well as the DBP formation potential should therefore be considered to avoid harmful impacts on aquatic environments when a disinfection method is used for wastewater effluents.

AB The results of an inter-laboratory comparison exercise to determine cytostatic anticancer drug residues in surface water, hospital wastewater and wastewater treatment plant effluent are reported. To obtain a critical number of participants, an invitation was sent out to potential laboratories identified to have the necessary knowledge and instrumentation. Nine laboratories worldwide confirmed their participation in the exercise. The compounds selected (based on the extent of use and laboratories capabilities) included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, etoposide, methotrexate and cisplatinum. Samples of spiked waste (hospital and wastewater treatment plant effluent) and surface water, and additional non-spiked hospital wastewater, were prepared by the organising laboratory (JoA3/4ef Stefan Institute) and sent out to each participant partner for analysis. All analytical methods included solid phase extraction (SPE) and the use of surrogate/internal standards for quantification. Chemical analysis was performed using either liquid or gas chromatography mass (MS) or tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry. Cisplatinum was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A required minimum contribution of five laboratories meant that only cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide could be included in the statistical evaluation. z-score and Q test revealed 3 and 4 outliers using classical and robust approach, respectively. The smallest absolute differences between the spiked values and the measured values were observed in the surface water matrix. The highest within-laboratory repeatability was observed for methotrexate in all three matrices (CV a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 12 %). Overall, inter-laboratory reproducibility was poor for all compounds and matrices (CV 27-143 %) with the only exception being methotrexate measured in the spiked hospital wastewater (CV = 8 %). Random and total errors were identified by means of Youden plots.

AB Etoposide susceptibility to microbiological breakdown was studied in a batch biotransformation system, in the presence or absence of artificial wastewater containing nutrients, salts and activated sludge at two concentration levels. The primary focus of the present study was to study etoposide transformation products by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Data-dependent experiments combining full-scan MS data with product ion spectra were acquired to identify the molecular ions of etoposide transformation products, to propose the molecular formulae and to elucidate their chemical structures. Due to the complexity of the matrix, visual inspection of the chromatograms showed no clear differences between the controls and the treated samples. Therefore, the software package MZmine was used to facilitate the identification of the transformation products and speed up the data analysis. In total, we propose five transformation products; among them, four are described as etoposide transformation products for the first time. Even though the chemical structures of these new compounds cannot be confirmed due to the lack of standards, their molecular formulae can be used to target them in monitoring studies.

AB This study aimed to quantify the environmental fate of antimicrobials applied in Fenneropenaeus chinensis aquaculture production in China and to assess their potential risks for surrounding aquatic ecosystems, for the promotion of antimicrobial resistance in target and non-target bacteria and for consumers eating shrimp products that contain antimicrobial residues. For this, we first used the results of an environmental monitoring study performed with the antimicrobial sulfamethazine to parameterize and calibrate the ERA-AQUA model, a mass balance model suited to perform risk assessments of veterinary medicines applied in aquaculture ponds. Next, a scenario representing F. chinensis production in China was built and used to perform risk assessments for 21 antimicrobials which are regulated for aquaculture in China. Results of the model calibration showed a good correspondence between the predicted and the measured sulfamethazine concentrations, with differences within an order of magnitude. Results of the ecological risk assessment showed that four antimicrobials (levofloxacin, sarafloxacin, ampicillin, sulfadiazine) are expected to have adverse effects on primary producers, while no short-term risks were predicted for invertebrates and fish exposed to farm wastewater effluents containing antimicrobial residues. Half of the evaluated antimicrobials showed potential to contribute to antimicrobial resistance in bacteria exposed to pond water and farm effluents. A withdrawal period of three weeks is recommended for antimicrobials applied via oral administration to F. chinensis in order to comply with the current national and international toxicological food safety standards. The results of this study indicate the need to improve the current regulatory framework for the registration of aquaculture antimicrobials in China and suggest compounds that should be targeted in future aquaculture risk assessments and environmental monitoring studies.

AB To examine the occurrence and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and inform future monitoring of CECs in coastal urban waterways, water, sediment, and fish tissue samples were collected and analyzed for a broad suite of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), commercial and/or household chemicals, current use pesticides, and hormones in an effluent-dominated river and multiple embayments in southern California (USA). In the Santa Clara River, which receives treated wastewater from several facilities, aqueous phase CECs were detectable at stations nearest discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants but were attenuated downstream. Sucralose and the chlorinated phosphate flame retardants tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were most abundant in water, with maximum concentrations of 35g/L, 3.3g/L, 1.4g/L, and 0.81g/L, respectively. Triclocarban, an antimicrobial agent in use for decades, was more prevalent in water than triclosan or nonylphenol. Maximum concentrations of bifenthrin, permethrin, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and degradates of fipronil exceeded CEC-specific monitoring trigger levels recently established for freshwater and estuarine sediments by factors of 10 to 1000, respectively. Maximum fish tissue concentrations of PBDEs varied widely (370ng/g and 7.0ng/g for the Santa Clara River and coastal embayments, respectively), with most species exhibiting concentrations at the lower end of this range. These results suggest that continued monitoring of pyrethroids, PBDEs, and degradates of fipronil in sediment is warranted in these systems. In contrast, aqueous pharmaceutical concentrations in the Santa Clara River were not close to exceeding current monitoring trigger levels, suggesting a lower priority for targeted monitoring in this medium.

AB Cytostatic drugs represents a category of pharmaceutical products used in cancer treatment, and among em 5-fluorouracil is the most common. Drugs used in cancer treatment are inhibiting and even destroying the cells, acting in a non-selective manner and therefore being considered to present carcinogenic, genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic potential. About 15% of the administered 5-fluorouracil is eliminated from human body without any transformation and therefore ends up in the wastewater system. Due to the fact that removal of 5-Buoruracil and other pharmaceutical products using conventional wastewater treatment is incomplete and inefficient, there is a need for more performant degradation technologies such as advanced oxidation processes. Among them, photocatalytic oxidation using titanium dioxide represents one of the most efficient removal technology for hazardous organic compounds. UV/TiO2 degradation of 5-fluorouracil was investigated in the aim to optimize process operational parameters: pH = 7, photocatalyst dose = 100 mg/L, irradiation time = 180 min. The degradation kinetic of 5-fluorouracil was found to follow Langmuir - Hinshelwood model and degradation rate constant k(r) = 3.74 x 10(6) M min(-1) and equilibrium constant of 5-fluorouracil adsorption on photocatalyst particles K-ad = 9505 M-1 were determined.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) have a remarkable successful effect on fighting animal and human diseases induced by bacteria, too. Over the time, PhACs treatments became victims of their own success, so their intensive use corroborated with their misuse resulted in PhACs treatment resistance microorganisms, becoming a serious health hazard and an environmental threat. In this study, we analysed the effect of four distinct pharmaceutical compounds such as quaternary ammonium compounds (benzenthonium chloride), tricyclic compounds (carbamazepine), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) and a derived compound from pyrimidine (trimethroprim) on five bacterial gram positive and negative strains which are naturally present in the environment. The results pointed out that carbamazepine had a specific inhibitory effect only on Delfia acidovorans and a border line effect on Staphylococcus warneri. On the other side, trimethroprim (80mg/L trimethropim) inhibited the growth of 3 out of 5 bacterial strains, the resistant strains were Citrobacter freundi and Pseudomonas aurantica. Benzenthonium chloride had an overall inhibitory effect with the exception of Staphylococcus warned Interestingly, ciprofioxacin had an inhibitory effect on all bacterial strains regardless of the concentration. This study dearly pointed out that various chemical structures affected specific structural and functional biological bacterial components and their presence into environment could create a massive ecological imbalance with direct impact on human health.

AB Biosolids from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) are environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which attract great concerns on their efficient treatments. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used for sewage sludge treatment but its effectiveness is limited due to the slow hydrolysis. Ozone and thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment were employed to improve AD efficiency and reduce antibiotic resistant genes in municipal and pharmaceutical waste sludge (MWS and PWS, respectively) in this study. Sludge solubilization achieved 15.75-25.09% and 14.85-33.92% after ozone and thermal hydrolysis, respectively. Both pre-treatments improved cumulative methane production and the enhancements were greater on PWS than MWS. Five tetracycline-resistant genes (tet(A), tet(G), tet(QJ, tet(W), tet(X)) and one mobile element (intI1) were qPCR to assess pre-treatments. AD of pre-treated sludge reduced more tet genes than raw sludge for both ozonation and thermal hydrolysis in PWS and MWS. Thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment was more efficient than ozone for reduction after AD. Results of this study help support management options for reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance from biosolids. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emissions of many organic micro-pollutants (OMP) into the aquatic environment can be efficiently reduced with advanced treatment at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Post-treatment with activated carbon is currently considered as one of the most promising options, but powdered activated carbon (PAC) could also be dosed into the existing biological treatment process instead. Due to much greater concentrations of suspended and dissolved constituents the adsorptive OMP removal was expected to be severely hindered. Systematic comparative adsorption tests with samples from different process steps of a large conventional WWTP were conducted to investigate differences in adsorption competition and removal efficiencies. The results show that much greater competition occurs in the WWTP influent and in the anaerobic tank but removal efficiencies in the anoxic and aerobic tank and in the WWTP effluent were more similar than expected. Suspended solids thus seem not to severely affect OMP adsorption. Similar results were obtained in a comparison of different commercial PAC in all for the respective matrices. OMP removals showed a relation with the PAC dosage normalized to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon. In the anoxic and aerobic tank and in the WWTP effluent, a uniform correlation of OMP removals and reductions of UV light absorption was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four emerging micropollutants ibuprofen, diclofenac, estrone (E1) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were studied in large laboratory-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with high nitrifying activity. Activated sludge (AS) with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 12 days and 14 days in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) and 30 days, 60 days and 90 days in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were examined at 8 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals and their main metabolites were analysed in liquid phase and solid phase of AS by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A remarkable amount of contaminants were detected in solids of AS, meaning the accumulation of micropollutants in bacterial cells. The biodegradation rate constants (K-biol) were affected by SRT and temperature. MBR with a 90-day SRT showed the best results of removal. Conventional SBR process was inefficient at 8 degrees C showing K-biol values lower than 0.5 l gSS(-1)d(-1) for studied micropollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and removal of 19 antibiotics (including four macrolides, eight sulfonamides, three fluoroquinolones, three tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) were investigated in two ecological (constructed wetland (CW) and stabilization pond (SP)) and two conventional wastewater treatment processes (activated sludge (AS) and micro-power biofilm (MP)) in a county of eastern China. All target antibiotics were detected in the influent and effluent samples with detection frequencies of >90%. Clarithromycin, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin-H2O were the dominant antibiotics with maximum concentrations reaching up to 6524, 5411, 964 and 957 ng/L, respectively; while the concentrations of tiamulin, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethizole and sulfisoxazole were below 10 ng/L. Although the mean effluent concentrations of target antibiotics were obviously lower than the influent ones (except ciprofloxacin), their removals were usually incomplete. Principal component analysis showed that the AS and CW outperformed the MP and SP processes and the AS performed better than the CW process in terms of antibiotics removal. Both the AS and CW processes exhibited higher removal efficiencies in summer than in winter, indicating biological degradation could play an important role in antibiotics removal. Because of the incomplete removal, the total concentration of detected antibiotics increased in the mixing and downstream sections of a local river receiving the effluent from a typical wastewater treatment facility practicing AS process. Nowadays, ecological wastewater treatment processes are being rapidly planned and constructed in rural areas of China; however, the discharge of residual antibiotics to the aquatic environment may highlight a necessity for optimizing or upgrading their design and operation.

AB The competitive adsorption characteristics of four pharmaceutical compounds, including clofibric acid (CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NAP), and diclofenac (DCF), were evaluated on granular activated carbon in secondary effluent. In ultrapure water (UW), the adsorption efficiencies of CA, CBZ, NAP, and DCF on coconut shell-based carbon were 63.0, 85.5, 79.1, and 68.8%, respectively, at initial concentration of 500g/L and carbon dosage of 133mg/L. All the substrates could be removed completely when carbon dosage was increased to 250mg/L. In the secondary effluent from a real wastewater treatment plant, the removal of four pharmaceuticals were decreased to 26.9, 57.9, 44.7, and 31.0%, respectively, with carbon dosage of 250mg/L, which recovered to 39.6, 67.1, 53.4, and 48.1% after solution filtration by 0.22-m hydrophilic membrane. The suspended solids and soluble organic compounds in wastewater were considered as the key inhibited factors for pharmaceuticals adsorption by activated carbon. The differences of adsorption efficiency between spiked UW and secondary effluent demonstrate that further purification for secondary effluent is necessary in practical wastewater treatment, when activated carbon is used as adsorbent for pharmaceuticals removal and wastewater advanced treatment.

AB The agent triclosan has been extensively used in different personal care products as a broad-spectrumantimicrobial and preservative agent. Due to its continuous release into the environment, including discharge via wastewater treatment plants, triclosan has been widely detected in aquatic environments. There is growing interest in improving the knowledge about the environmental fate of triclosan due to its possible bioaccumulation and the toxicity it may pose to organisms, such as fish and other non-target species. To investigate the distribution and bioconcentration of triclosan in fish, Poecilia vivipara was exposed to 0.2 mg L-1. Contents of triclosan in whole fish, brain, gonads, liver, muscle and gills were quantified by LC-MS/MS. When lipid normalised concentration was used, the liver exhibited the highest concentration followed by the gills, gonads, brain and muscle tissues. Bioconcentration was increased with time reaching a steady-state around 7-14 days for most all tissues. After 24 h depuration, triclosan concentrations declined >80% in all tissues except liver, in which triclosan takes longer to be depurated. These results not only clearly indicate that triclosan accumulated in P. vivipara, with tissue-specific bioconcentration factors (BCF) that ranged from 40.2 to 1025.4, but also show that the elimination of triclosan after transferring the fish to triclosan-free freshwater is rapid in all tissues.

AB The reuse of treated municipal wastewater for crop irrigation is a necessity in arid and semiarid regions but a potential entrance for emerging contaminants into the food chain. However, little attention has yet been paid to the detection of micropollutants and possible metabolites in vegetables grown under realistic field conditions. In this study, the uptake of 28 micropollutants and carbamazepine metabolites in 10 different field-grown vegetable species (among them carrot, lettuce, potato, and zucchini) from Jordan was studied. A total of 12 micropollutants and six carbamazepine metabolites, four of which have never been analyzed before in plant-uptake studies, could be detected in all of the samples in concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 216 ng per g of dry weight. In edible tissues, the total concentration of micropollutants decreased in the order of leafy (247-533) > root (73-126) > fruit-bearing (5-76 ng per g of dry weight) vegetables. A preliminary health-risk assessment for nine compounds according to the TTC concept shows no risk for seven of the micropollutats; for ciprofloxacin and 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, however, more-specific toxicity data would be required for a refined risk assessment.

AB In countries like Spain, where water is a limited resource, reusing effluents from wastewater treatment plants may imply the introduction of incompletely eliminated pollutants into the environment. Therefore, this work identified the role of sorption and biodegradation in attenuating pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, caffeine, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole) in natural soil. It also determined which sorption and removal ("sorption + biodegradation") kinetics models describe the behaviour of these substances in the water-soil system. Presence of potential transformation products (TPs) as a result of pharmaceuticals biodegradation was also studied. To this end, serial batch-type experiments were performed with a soil: water ratio of 1:4 and an initial pharmaceutical concentration of 100 mu g L-1. Despite results are dependent on soil characteristics, they revealed that, for those substances with a higher affinity to the soil used (loamy sand), sorption seems to play a key role during the first 48 h of contactwith soil, and gives way to biodegradation afterwards. The sorption of the pharmaceuticals studied follows a pseudo second-order kinetics. Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole displayed the fastest initial sorption velocities (h = 2055 and h = 228 mu g kg(-1) h(-1), respectively). The removal kinetics experiments, satisfactorily simulated by the first-order kinetics model, indicated the presence of potential microbial adaptation to degradation. Indeed, half-lives decreased from 1.6- to 11.7-fold with respect to initial values. The microbial capacity to degrade sulfamethoxazole could be a matter of concern if bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic. Caffeine, acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole were mitigated to a greater extent, whereas the removal of naproxen and carbamazepine was more limited. The appearance of epoxy-carbamazepine and N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole as possible TPs of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, indicated that biodegradation was incomplete and showed the capacity of soil microbes to transform these substances.

AB Treated wastewater (TWW) reuse for agricultural irrigation is a well-established approach to coping with water shortages in semi-arid and arid environments. Recently, additional uses of TWW have emerged, including streamflow augmentation and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the water quality and fish health, in an artificial reservoir located in an arid climate (the Yeruham Reservoir, Israel), which regularly receives TWW and sporadic winter floods. The temporal distribution of water levels, nutrients and organic micropollutants (OMPs) were measured during the years 2013-2014. OMPs were also measured in sediment and fish tissues. Finally, the status of fish health was evaluated by histopathology. Water levels and quality were mainly influenced by seasonal processes such as floods and evaporation, and not by the discharge of TWW. Out of 16 tested OMPs, estrone, carbamazepine, diclofenac and bezafibrate were found in the reservoir water, but mostly at concentrations below the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for fish. Concentrations of PCBs and dioxins in fish muscle and liver were much lower than the EU maximal permitted concentrations, and similar to concentrations that were found in food fish in Israel and Europe. In the histopathological analysis, there were no evident tissue abnormalities, and low to moderate infection levels of fish parasites were recorded. The results from the Yeruham Reservoir demonstrated a unique model for the mixture effect between TWW reuse and natural floods to support a unique stable and thriving ecosystem in a water reservoir located in an arid region. This type of reservoir can be widely used for recreation, education, and the social and economic development of a rural environment, such as has occurred in the Yeruham region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Integrating powdered activated carbon (PAC) into wastewater tertiary treatment is a promising technology to reduce organic micro-pollutant (OMP) discharge into the receiving waters. To take advantage of the existing tertiary filter, PAC was pre-embedded inside the filter bed acting as a fixed-bed adsorber. The pre-embedding (i.e. immobilization) of PAC was realized by direct dosing a PAC solution on the filter top, which was then promoted to penetrate into the filter media by a down-flow of tap water. In order to examine the effectiveness of this PAC pre-embedded filter towards OMP removal, batch adsorption tests, representing PAC contact reactor (with the same PAC mass-to-treated water volume ratio as in the PAC pre-embedded filter) were performed as references. Moreover, as a conventional dosing option, PAC was dosed continuously with the filter influent (i.e. the wastewater secondary effluent with the investigated OMPs). Comparative results confirmed a higher OMP removal efficiency associated with the PAC pre-embedded filter, as compared to the batch system with a practical PAC residence time. Furthermore, over a filtration period of 10 h (approximating a realistic filtration cycle for tertiary filters), the continuous dosing approach resulted in less OMP removal. Therefore, it was concluded that the pre-embedding approach can be preferentially considered when integrating PAC into the wastewater tertiary treatment for OMP elimination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have raised considerable concern over the past decade due to their widespread detection in water resources and their potential to affect ecosystem health. This triggered many attempts to prioritize the large number of known APIs to target monitoring efforts and testing of fate and effects. However, so far, a comprehensive approach to screen for their presence in surface waters has been missing. Here, we explore a combination of an automated suspect screening approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry and a model-based prioritization using consumption data, readily predictable fate properties and a generic mass balance model for activated sludge treatment to comprehensively detect APIs with relevant exposure in wastewater treatment plant effluents. The procedure afforded the detection of 27 APIs that had not been covered in our previous target method, which included 119 parent APIs. The newly detected APIs included seven compounds with a high potential for bioaccumulation and persistence, and also three compounds that were suspected to stem from point sources rather than from consumption as medicines. Analytical suspect screening proved to be more selective than model-based prioritization, making it the method of choice for focusing analytical method development or fate and effect testing on those APIs most relevant to the aquatic environment. However, we found that state-of-the-practice exposure modeling used to predict potential high-exposure substances can be a useful complement to point toward oversights and known or suspected detection gaps in the analytical method, most of which were related to insufficient ionization.

AB This study evaluates aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability and toxicity of a real pharmaceutical wastewater, which focuses on antibiotics production. Zahn-Wellens and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) methodologies were applied in order to verify the wastewater's biodegradability and Microtox (R) analysis was performed for toxicity tests. Tests achieved more than 89% and 63% of Total Organic Carbon reduction, showing 80% and 50% of antibiotic removal, for aerobic and anaerobic processes, respectively. Moreover, acute ecotoxicological tests revealed that both techniques decreased the toxic character of real pharmaceutical wastewater. Desorption tests showed that the antibiotic was not degraded, but, in fact, adsorbed onto the sludge. Since biological treatment is the most widely used method for industrial wastewater treatment, this study indicates that this kind of treatment is probably unable to mineralize antibiotics present in pharmaceutical wastewaters, which may induce the development of resistant pathogens. Therefore, efforts must be taken to elucidate the main mechanisms of biological antibiotic removal from wastewaters since the presence of antibiotics in the environment is considered to be an emerging environmental issue.

AB Researching and industrializing a new pharmaceutical form results in an impressive amount of waste due to the methods used. Despite numerous reports about the addition of pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment, the effect they have on the environment at the nanogram (ng) level remains largely unknown; thus, it has been proposed to retain toxic compounds using Dowex resins in biomucoadhesive tablets containing miconazole nitrate, an antifungal medication. This study demonstrates the reduction of water pollution by using pharmaceutical forms of miconazol nitrate anions; at the same time, the proposed method can also re-utilize the anti-fungal substances by recovering them from the ion-changing resins. The pollutant examined in the study was nitrate anions, and the resin was represented by DowexTMNSR-1. Once the pharmaceutical form was disaggregated in distilled water and the resulting solution was filtered through the Dowex resin, chemical test reports were created, and all the parameters had registered values below the allowable wastewater limits. Through the ionic exchange method in this study, up to 99.8% of the anion nitrate ended up as waste during the preparation of new pharmaceutical forms while the antifungal effect was retained. This anion nitrate percentage was confirmed through 10 different determinations of 309 biomucoadhesive miconazol nitrate tablets disaggregated into 1000 mL of distilled water.

AB Tetracycline antibiotics have been increasingly used in medical applications and have been found in wastewater treatment plants as a result of human and industrial activities. This study investigates the combined effects of tetracycline antibiotics on the performance of an algal photo-bioreactor operated under different antibiotic concentrations in the ranges of 0.25 to 30 mg/L and considers the inhibition of algal growth, carbon and nutrient removal rates, and eukaryotic and cyanobacterial algal community changes. The results indicated that increases in the concentration of tetracycline mixtures have adverse effects on the algal community and the performance of a photo-bioreactor, and the eukaryotic algae species were more sensitive to tetracycline antibiotics than were the cyanobacterial species. Cultivation tests showed that approximately 94 % growth inhibition of mixed algae occurred at 30 mg/L.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are common contaminants found in surface and ground-waters, often due to their inefficient removal from wastewater treatment plants. One way in which these compounds can be removed is via aerobic cometabolism, a process that involves oxygenases produced by microorganisms. Limited work has been done examining the efficacy of cometabolism in the removal of PhACs. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the use of an alkane (pentane) in the aerobic cometabolic transformations of paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and nimesulide. Both paracetamol and ibuprofen (single aromatic compounds) were readily transformed, withnet specific biodegradation rates equal to 1.6 and 3.2 mu mol/g(cell)/day, respectively. Conversely, the two aromatic ring PhACs showed slower (naproxen and nimesulide) or no transformation (diclofenac). In addition, four of the tested PhACs (ibuprofen, paracetamol, naproxen and nimesulide) did not inhibit pentane uptake.

AB Pharmaceutical residues released into the environment are posing more and more public health problems. It is worthwhile to study the retention of pharmaceuticals residues by adsorption on solid supports. Batch sorption experiments are intended to identify the adsorption isotherms of the pharmaceutically active ingredient on the biomaterials. The results obtained in this study have shown that the retention possibilities of these compounds by bio-adsorbents (clay and sand) are not significant. The negligible sorption for these media is explained by the low hydrophobicity of paracetamol (Log K-ow = 0.46). The retention of paracetamol on the dehydrated sewage sludge and on Posidonia oceanica showed a relatively significant adsorption with a maximal quantity of 0.956 mg g(-1) and 1.638 mg g(-1) for the dehydrate sludge and P. oceanica, respectively. On the other hand, the study of paracetamol retention on the powdered activated carbon showed a high adsorption capacity of about 515.27 mg g(-1). Isotherm data show a good fit with Langmuir's model. An infrared analysis is carried out. It shows identical bands before and after adsorption, with some modifications.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, pesticides and industrial contaminants collectively termed as trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in wastewater has been well-documented in USA, Europe, China and other regions. However, data from India, the second most populous country in the world is severely lacking. This study investigated the occurrence and concentrations of twenty-two indicator TOrCs at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South India serving diverse communities across three sampling campaigns. Samples were collected after each WWTP treatment unit and removal efficiencies for TOrCs were determined. Eleven TOrCs were detected in every sample from every location at all sites, while only five TOrCs were detected consistently in effluent samples. Caffeine was present at greatest concentration in the influent of all three plants with average concentrations ranging between 56 and 65 mu g/L. In contrast, the x-ray contrast media pharmaceutical, iohexol, was the highest detected compound on average in the effluent at all three WWTPs (2.1-8.7 mu g/L). TOrCs were not completely removed in the WWTPs with removal efficiencies being compound specific and most of the attenuation being attributed to the biological treatment processes. Caffeine and triclocarban were well removed (>80%), while other compounds were poorly removed (acesulfame, sucralose, iohexol) or maybe even formed (carbamazepine) within the WWTPs. The effluent composition of the 22 TOrCs were similar within the three WWTPs but quite different to those seen in the US, indicating the importance of region-specific monitoring. Diurnal trends indicated that variability is compound specific but trended within certain classes of compounds (artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals). The data collected on TOrCs from this study can be used as a baseline to identify potential remediation and regulatory strategies in this understudied region of India. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rising levels of antibiotics in treated wastewater pose a great threat to human health worldwide. The present study shows degradation studies of antibiotic Cephalexin using slurry and innovative fixed-bed photocatalysis under UVA (365nm) irradiations. A UV-spectrophotometer/HPLC was used for analyzing the decay of Cephalexin. Studies showed that variation in UV intensity, dose variation of TiO2 and H2O2, area by volume (A/V), and pH affect the degradation to a great extent. The degradation rate followed pseudo-first order kinetics with optimized conditions for degrading the antibiotic being TiO2 1.0g center dot L-1, H2O2 0.15mL, with UV intensity of 25W center dot m(-2). The COD decrease (80%) with the generation of nitrite, nitrate, and sulphate ions confirmed the mineralization of the selected compound. TiO2-coated spherical cement beads were used for fixed-bed studies, which eliminates the implications of slurry mode photocatalysis. The beads were recycled for at least 50 cycles, which confirmed the durability of the catalyst, and characterized by SEM-EDAX. Attempts were made to study the pilot-scale fixed-bed baffled solar reactor for degrading Cephalexin, which confirmed 70% degradation after 10h.

AB To quantify the extent of antibiotic contamination and to identity the dominant pollutant sources in the Tiaoxi RiverWatershed, surface water samples were collected at eight locations and analyzed for four tetracyclines and three sulfonamides using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The observed maximum concentrations of tetracycline (623 ng L-1), oxytetracycline (19,810 ng L-1), and sulfamethoxazole (112 ng L-1) exceeded their corresponding Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. In particular, high concentrations of antibiotics were observed in wet summer with heavy rainfall. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics appeared in the vicinity of intensive aquaculture areas. High-resolution land use data were used for identifying diffuse source of antibiotic pollution in the watershed. Significant correlations between tetracycline and developed (r = 0.93), tetracycline and barren (r = 0.87), oxytetracycline and barren (r = 0.82), and sulfadiazine and agricultural facilities (r = 0.71) were observed. In addition, the density of aquaculture significantly correlated with doxycycline (r = 0.74) and oxytetracycline (r = 0.76), while the density of livestock significantly correlated with sulfadiazine (r = 0.71). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole were from aquaculture and domestic sources, whereas sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine were from livestock wastewater. Flood or drainage from aquaculture ponds was identified as a major source of antibiotics in the Tiaoxi watershed. A hot-spot map was created based on results of land use analysis and multivariable statistics, which provided an effective management tool of sources identification in watersheds with multiple diffuse sources of antibiotic pollution.

AB While environmental risk assessment is typically based on toxicant concentrations in water and/or sediment, awareness is increasing that internal concentrations or body burdens are the key to understand adverse effects in organisms. In order to link environmental micropollutants as causes of observed effects, there is an increasing demand for methods to analyse these chemicals in organisms. Here, a multi-target screening method based on pulverised liquid extraction (PULE) and a modified QuEChERS approach with an additional hexane phase was developed. It is capable to extract and quantify organic micropollutants of diverse chemical classes in freshwater invertebrates. The method was tested on gammarids from the Danube River (within the Joint Danube Survey 3) and target compounds were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, a non-target screening using high resolution-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HAMS/MS) was conducted. A total of 17 pollutants were detected and/or quantified in gammarids at low concentrations. Pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 6.52 ng g(-1) (wet weight), those of wastewater-derived pollutants from 0.1 to 2.83 ng g(-1) (wet weight). The presence of wastewater-derived pollutants was prominent at all spots sampled. Using non-target screening, we could successfully identify several chlorinated compounds. These results demonstrate for the first time the presence of pesticides and wastewater-derived pollutants in invertebrates of the Danube River. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption of weakly basic compounds by sludge is poorly understood, although it has important implications on the distribution and fate of such micropollutants in wastewater effluent and sludge. Additionally, many of these compounds are chiral, and it is likely that their interactions with sludge is stereoselective and that the process may be further modified by surfactants that coexist in these systems. Adsorption of (R) and (S)-enantiomers of five commonly used beta-blockers, i.e., acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol, on sludge was characterized through batch experiments. Stereo selectivity in adsorption increased with decreases in hydrophobicity of the beta-blockers. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of the amount of acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol sorbed on sludge were 0.27, 0.55 and 032, respectively. Thus, K-d values of the (S)-enantiomers of acebutolol and metoprolol were approximately twice that of the (R)-enantiomer, that is, 109 +/- 11 and 57 +/- 8 L/kg compared to 52 +/- 13 and 22 +/- 8 L/kg, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in K-d values of the enantiomers of pindolol and propranolol, suggesting stereoselectivity in adsorption was likely driven by specific polar interactions rather than hydrophobic interactions. The EF value of atenolol decreased from 0.55 +/- 0.03 to 0.44 +/- 0.04 after modifying the sludge with Triton X 100. These results suggested that surfactants altered adsorption of beta-blockers to sludge, likely by forming ion pair complexes that promote hydrophobic interactions with the solid surfaces.

AB The concentrations of 12 pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, erythromycin, cyclophosphamide, paracetamol, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, caffeine, clarithromycin, lidocaine, sulfamethoxazole and N-acetylsulfamethoxazol (NACS)) were investigated in the influents and effluents of two hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs) in Saudi Arabia. The majority of the target analytes were detected in the influent samples apart from bezafibrate, cyclophosphamide, and erythromycin. Caffeine and paracetamol were detected in the influent at particularly high concentrations up to 75 and 12 ug/L, respectively. High removal efficiencies of the pharmaceutical compounds were observed in both HWWTPs, with greater than 90 % removal on average. Paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole, NACS, ciprofloxacin, and caffeine were eliminated by between >95 and >99 % on average. Atenolol, carbamazepine, and clarithromycin were eliminated by >86 % on average. Of particular interest were the high removal efficiencies of carbamazepine and antibiotics that were achieved by the HWWTPs; these compounds have been reported to be relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment and are generally only partially removed. Elevated temperatures and high levels of sunlight were considered to be the main factors that enhanced the removal of these compounds.

AB This study aims to demonstrate that a combined system of membrane bioreactor (MBR) with electrooxidation (EO) can be a promising technology to treat compounds such as carbamazepine (CBZ). The MBR showed high capacity to remove the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and low capacity for the degradation (20% of removal), after 120 d of operation; which presumably indicates that CBZ was not toxic for microorganisms, despite its poor degradation. On the other hand, the EO system was capable to completely degrade CBZ (99.99% of removal). In addition, the MBR achieved 83% of conversion efficiency of NH4+ to NO3- or NO2-; and only 20.5% of PO4- removal. A toxicity test using Dapnia magna and Vibrio fischeri was carried out. Results indicated that MBR is an efficient method to decrease wastewater toxicity but during electrooxidation treatment higher toxicity was obtained, probably due to the generation of more toxic compounds than the initial pollutants.

AB Israel and its Palestinian neighbors constitute a unique venue for evaluating the treatment efficiency and potential environmental risks of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), because of their physical proximity yet contrasting societal dynamics. Israel primarily relies on advanced tertiary sewage treatment and recycles over 85% of its treated wastewater, while in the Palestinian Authority (PA), there is only secondary treatment levels at WWTPs and reuse is minimal (<1%). To evaluate the extent of EDC occurrence and treatment efficiency, we conducted four sampling campaigns over two consecutive years, and measured the concentrations of selected EDCs in raw wastewater (WW), treated WW and sludge in six WWTPs in Israel, as well as in two Palestinian plants. Low concentrations of bisphenol A, octylphenol and triclosan measured in the raw WW in the Palestinian WWTPs reflected the relatively modest industrial activity and consumption habits as compared to the westernized consumer patterns in Israel. On the other hand, hormone concentrations in raw WW were higher in the Palestinian WWTPs than those in the Israeli WWTPs, presumably because of a dilution effect associated with a higher water per capita consumption among Israelis. Despite these differences in raw WW concentrations, the removal efficiency in all advanced WWTPs was relatively high when compared to averages reported internationally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies in pharmaceutical wastewater treated by Fenton process under response surface methodology (RSM) optimized conditions were studied. High regression coefficient value R-2 (R-2 = 0.9680, 0.9040 for AOX and TOC removal efficiency, respectively) and low value coefficient of variation (2.21%, 2.04% for AOX and TOC, respectively) of the quadratic model indicated that the model was accurate in predicting the experimental results. The desirability function was used to optimize AOX and TOC removal efficiencies simultaneously. The optimal pH, Fe2+ concentration, molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ and reaction time were found to be 3.3, 19.05 mM, 20.16 and 2.2 h, respectively, and 91.78% AOX and 75.01% TOC were removed under these conditions, which was validated. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC MS) results revealed that 28 out of 33 kinds of organic compounds, including 11 kinds of AOX were completely removed by the Fenton process while one new AOX compound, 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorophthalide, was produced which was the result of the carbonyl of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-1,3-isobenzofurandione being attacked in the Fenton reaction. These results indicated that analysis of organics was important since new AOX compounds could be produced in Fenton process despite the value of AOX decreasing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the increased detections of commonly used pharmaceuticals in surface water and wastewater, extensive attentions were paid recently to the fate and transport of these pharmaceuticals in the environment. Amitriptyline (AMI) is a tricyclic antidepressant widely applied to treat patients with anxiety and depression. In this study, the removal of AMI with palygorskite clay (PFI-1) was investigated under different physico-chemical conditions and supplemented by instrumental analyses. The uptake of AMI on PFI-1 was well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm with an adsorption capacity of 0.168 mmol g(-1) at pH 6-7. The AMI uptake was fast and reached equilibrium in 15 min. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed no shift of the (110) peak position of palygorskite after AMI uptake. However, the (001) peak position of the minor component smectite (about 10%) shifted to lower angle as the amounts of AMI input increased. These results suggested surface uptake of AMI on palygorsldte and interlayer uptake of AMI in smectite. As smectite is a common component of palygorskite clays, its role in assessing the properties and performances of palygorskite clays for the uptake and removal of contaminants should not be neglected. Overall, the high affinity of AMI for PFI-1 and strong retention of AMI on PFI-1 suggested that it could be a good adsorbent to remove AMI from wastewater. Palygorskite clays can also be a sink for many cationic pharmaceuticals in the environmental of the arid regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In biological wastewater treatments, microbial populations of the so-called activated sludge work together in the abatement of pollutants. In this work, the metabolic behavior of the biomass of a lab-scale plant treating industrial pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated through a metaproteomic approach. The complete treatment process included a membrane biological reactor (MBR) coupled with an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for partial breakdown of non-biodegradable molecules. Proteins from biomass samples collected pre- and post-AOP application were investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), mass spectrometry (MS), and finally identified by database search. Results showed that most proteins remained constant between pre- and post-AOP. Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) belonging to Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii appeared as the most constantly expressed protein in the studied consortium. Other identified proteins belonging to Hyphomicrobium spp. revealed a predominant methylotrophic metabolism, and H. zavarzinii appeared as a key actor in the studied microbial community.

AB In this study, seven kinds of synthetic musks were characterized in sediment samples of Yellow River Delta wetland, including celestolide, phantolide, traseolide, galaxolide, tonalide, musk xylene, and musk ketone. They were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with recoveries of 91.85 %-105.35 % and the relative standard deviation (% RSD) were 3.30 %-8.11 % for all analytes. Galaxolide and tonalide were the main musk contaminants which were detected in sediment samples. The total concentrations of galaxolide ranged from 1.42 to 8.60 ng/g (mean 2.92 ng/g) (dry weight, dw); the total concentrations of tonalide ranged from the detection limit (LOD) to 3.63 ng/g (mean 1.69 ng/g, dw). The one reason of the higher level of SM pollutants was the domestic wastewater dumped by the local residents in some sites. And there was no significant correlation between SMs and TOC in sediment samples of Yellow River Delta wetland (p > 0.05).

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are chemicals of a synthetic origin or deriving from a natural source that has recently been discovered and for which environmental or public health risks are yet to be established. This is due to limited available information on their interaction and toxicological impacts on receptors. Several types of ECs exist such as antibiotics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, effluents, certain naturally occurring contaminants and more recently nanomaterials. ECs may derive from a known source, for example released directly to the aquatic environment from direct discharges such as those from wastewater treatment plants. Although in most instances the direct source cannot be identified, ECs have been detected in virtually every country's natural environment and as a consequence they represent a global problem. There is very limited information on the fate and transport of ECs in the environment and their toxicological impact. This lack of information can be attributed to limited financial resources and the lack of analytical techniques for detecting their effects on ecosystems and human health on their own or as mixture. We do not know how ECs interact with each other or various contaminants. This paper presents an overview of existing knowledge on ECs, their fate and transport and a risk-based analysis for ECs management and complementary strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contamination of aquatic systems by synthetic organic contaminants and emerging pollutants poses significant public and environmental health risks in developing countries. These contaminants mainly originate from textile, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The removal of such contaminants is problematic in developing countries because advanced water treatment methods are still lacking in developing countries due to their high costs. The application of biosorption for removal of organic contaminants in developing countries is attractive for three reasons; (1) large quantities of biomaterials for use as biosorbents are readily available; (2) lack of advanced water and wastewater treatment systems for removal of organic contaminants; and (3) the technology is relatively cheap compared to advanced methods (e.g. membrane filtration) often used in developed countries. Overall, this has the potential to remove organic contaminants from aqueous systems while simultaneously reducing the public health and environmental impacts associated with the disposal of such biowastes. However, large-scale application of biosorption faces potential challenges including lack of funding, poor mechanical properties of biosorbants, complex adsorption mechanisms involved, and poor regeneration capacity. In addition, spent biosorbents present an environmental risk and their disposal is problematic due to the potential of contaminating surface and ground water. Possible disposal methods for spent biosorbent include use as a filler in road surfacing, as a soil amendment, and in phytoremediation cells where the organics are absorbed and broken down by plants. Overall, biosorption is a potentially viable alternative, but further research on its ability to remove pollutants from multi-component systems, its regeneration capacity, and plant design parameters is required before the benefits of the technology are realised in developing countries.

AB This study investigates the use of ozone as a pretreatment process for water containing pharmaceuticals. Experiments were carried out on synthetic wastewater, surface water, and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant. The degradation efficiencies of four groups of pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, estrogens, acidic, and neutral) were studied, and the effect of ozone dose and pH on the degradation efficiency was monitored. A Microtox bioassay test was used to evaluate the change in the toxicity of aqueous solutions before and after ozonation. The efficiency of oxidation of antibiotics, estrogens, and neutral pharmaceuticals increased as the ozone dose and pH increased. Ozone input dose of 188.1, 222.3, and 222.4 mgh(-1)was found to be optimum yielding the highest oxidation efficiency for the studied pharmaceuticals in synthetic wastewater, surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment plant, respectively. An average specific ozone dose of 2.05 for antibiotics, 1.11 for estrogens, and 1.30 mg O-3/mg DOC for neutral pharmaceuticals reduced significantly the acute the toxicity of the water solutions and mineralized more than 40%, 33%, and 23% of DOC in less than 1 min. The kinetics of ozone with pharmaceuticals was modeled for synthetic wastewater as an overall second-order reaction with a rate constant ranging from 10(3) to 10(6) M(-1)s(-1). The results indicate the effectiveness of ozone-based advanced oxidation processes in removing emerging pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. The results showed that ozonation process is more effective than other conventional oxidation processes (Cl-2 and ClO2) in eliminating pharmaceuticals and reducing the toxicity of the effluent water or wastewater.

AB This study reports the efficiency of gamma-ray irradiation to degrade quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to determine the "pseudo-first" order degradation kinetics of norfloxacin in the concentration ranges of 3.4-16.1 mg L-1 by gamma-ray irradiation. The dose constant was found to be dependent on the initial concentration of norfloxacin and gammaray irradiation dose rate (D-r). The saturation of norfloxacin sample solutions with N-2, air or N2O, and the presence of tertbutanol and 2-propanol showed that (OH)-O-center dot played more crucial role in the degradation of norfloxacin. The second order rate constants of (OH)-O-center dot, c(aq)(-), and H-center dot with norfloxacin were calculated to be 8.81 x 10(9), 9.54x10(8), and 1.10 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The effects of various additives including CO32-, HCO3-, NO3-, NO2-, and thiourea and the pH of the medium on the degradation of norfloxacin were also investigated. Norfloxacin degradation was lower in surface water and wastewater than in ultrapure water. Several degradation byproducts of norfloxacin were identified from which the possible degradation pathway was proposed.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a simple extraction procedure and a multiresidual liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from various soil types. An extraction procedure for 91 pharmaceuticals from 13 soil types, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, was optimized. The extraction efficiencies of three solvent mixtures for ultrasonic extraction were evaluated for 91 pharmaceuticals. The best results were obtained using acetonitrile/water (1/1 v/v with 0.1 % formic acid) followed by acetonitrile/2-propanol/water (3/3/4 v/v/v with 0.1 % formic acid) for extracting 63 pharmaceuticals. The method was validated at three fortification levels (10, 100, and 1000 ng/g) in all types of representative soils; recovery of 44 pharmaceuticals ranged between 55 and 135 % across all tested soils. The method was applied to analyze actual environmental samples of sediments, soils, and sludge, and 24 pharmaceuticals were found above limit of quantification with concentrations ranging between 0.83 ng/g (fexofenadine) and 223 ng/g (citalopram).

AB A facile, environmental-friendly Ag3PO4-PN photocatalyst was synthesized by a simple precipitation method at room temperature in the presence of ammonia and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). As-synthesized samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS). The enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency of Ag3PO4-PN is strongly dependent on the excellent photo-absorption capacity, sharp edges and corners, and synergistic effect of PVP and NH3 center dot H2O. The effects of catalyst dosage, TC concentration and solution pH were explored with tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) as target contamination. The mineralization was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and determination of the concentration of inorganic ions such as NO3 (-) and Cl-. Radical detection experiment indicated the h(+) and center dot O2- are major active species in the degradation of TC by Ag3PO4-PN. Moreover, photocatalyst stability and regeneration experiments exhibited the favorable stability and rejuvenation ability, suggesting a promising prospect of practical application of Ag3PO4 in the wastewater treatment.

AB A 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was used to characterize the structures of microbial communities in wetland mesocosms receiving caffeine-enriched wastewater at a concentration of 250 mu g L-1. The removal efficiencies of caffeine in the planted beds (93.0 %) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in the unplanted beds (81.4 %). Bacterial diversity was decreased by 25 and 22.4 %, respectively, in both planted and unplanted mesocosms after 210-day operation. The results of taxonomic analyses suggested that chronic exposure of wetland ecosystems to caffeine could lead to moderate shifts in microbial community composition. In total, 2156 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated and 20 phyla comprising 260 genera were identified. The major phylogenetic groups at phylum level included Firmicutes (39 %), Actinobacteria (25.1 %), Proteobacteria (17.1 %), Synergistetes (5.6 %), and Chloroflexi (5.5 %). Bacilli and Synergistia increased in abundance in the planted mesocosms, while for the unplanted mesocosms, Actinobacterial, Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria exhibited increased proportion under the exposure of caffeine. At genus level, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Streptococcus were found to be increased in abundance after caffeine treatment. As for the response of fungal community to caffeine enrichment, genus like Cladosporium, Emericellopsis, Aspergillus, and Phoma were found to be resistant to caffeine disturbance. When compared to the microbial community between planted and unplanted mesocosms, a distinct community profile for both bacteria and fungi community was observed. The presence of plants had a remarkable effect on the structure of microbial community, helping buffer against the stress associated with caffeine exposure.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter freshwater and affect aquatic ecosystem health. Although toxicity tests have been carried out for the commonly used pharmaceuticals, evidence-based water quality guidelines have not been derived. High-reliability water quality guideline values have been derived for 4 pharmaceuticalscarbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine, and propranololin freshwaters using a Burr type III distribution applied to species sensitivity distributions of chronic toxicity data. Data were quality-assured and had to meet acceptability criteria for chronic no-observed-effect concentrations or concentrations affecting 10% of species, endpoints of population relevance (namely, effect endpoints based on development, growth, reproduction, and survival). Biomarker response data (e.g., biochemical, histological, or molecular responses) were excluded from the derivation because they are typically not directly relevant to wildlife population-related impacts. The derived guideline values for 95% species protection were 9.2g/L, 770g/L, 1.6g/L, and 14g/L for carbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine, and propranolol, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the unknown reliability values derived for the European Commission, Switzerland, or Germany that are based on the application of assessment factors to the most sensitive experimental endpoint (which may include biochemical, histological, or molecular biomarker responses) of a limited data set. The guideline values derived in the present study were not exceeded in recent data for Australian rivers and streams receiving pharmaceutical-containing effluents from wastewater-treatment plants.

AB This article addresses the issue of quality in reused water for potable purpose. The concerns of potential presence of pathogens and inorganic and organic constituents in the reused water and their health implications are discussed. Presently, there are no specific or international guidelines or standards for treatment or monitoring when municipal wastewater is used for potable purpose. Research to advance the safety, reliability and economic sustainability of reuse is also lacking. When assessing the risks associated with reclaimed water, the potential of production failure and reliability also needs to be addressed and mitigated.

AB Environmental hazards are a consequence of the massive use of synthetic chemicals that are prevalent in nearly every aspect of modern life. The outburst of the so-called "emerging pollutants" (pharmaceuticals and pesticides among others) generates an additional problem due to the scarce available information on their impact on the environment or their interferences with the biological processes. Among them, paracetamol is one of the drugs the most widely found in hospital effluents, in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants, as well as in rivers. In this work, the feasibility of paracetamol degradation by different processes based on ultraviolet radiation is discussed: photolysis, photo-oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, photo-Fenton reaction, and heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 are evaluated. The best results are obtained with the photo Fenton process, for which more than 99% of the pharmaceutical is degraded within 5 minutes. At best experimental conditions the mineralization was superior to 75% after one hour of reaction.

AB Parabens and triclosan compounds are widely used in pharmaceutical products, personal care, food and various products of daily use. After use, the final destinations of these contaminants are domestic effluents and the environment if not collected or treated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of parabens and triclosan in environments in a subtropical region, more specifically in the metropolitan region of Curitiba (southern Brazil) and possible effects of these compounds in aquatic environments through risk assessment through the use of risk quotient (RQ). Samples were collected in 20 points for 4 campaigns. For the extraction of the compounds we used the extraction technique of solid phase extraction (SPE). The determination of the compounds was using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was observed high concentrations of parabens, especially MeP (up to 2875 ng L-1). Despite high concentrations of parabens, their presence has a low risk to aquatic organisms. Triclosan has been observed at higher concentrations (415 ng L-1), suggesting once again that these environments are impacted by human action. The RQ assessed that triclosan has a high risk for certain groups of organisms.

AB The impact of residual pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment has gained widespread attention over the past years. Various studies have established the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in different water bodies throughout the world. In view of the absence of occurrence data in a number of developing world countries, and given the limited availability of analytical resources in these countries, it is prudent to devise methodologies to prioritize pharmaceuticals for environmental monitoring purposes that are site specific. In this work, several prioritization approaches are used to rank the 88 most commonly consumed pharmaceuticals in Lebanon. A simultaneous multi-criteria decision analysis method utilizing the exposure, persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (EPBT) approach is applied to a smaller subset of the original list (69 pharmaceuticals). Several base cases are investigated and sensitivity analysis is applied to one of these base case runs. The similarities and differences in the overall ranking of individual, and classes of, pharmaceuticals for the base cases and the sensitivity runs are elucidated. An environmental risk assessment (ERA), where predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) and risk quotients (RQ) are determined at different dilution factors, is performed as an alternative method of prioritization for a total of 84 pharmaceuticals. The ERA results indicate that metformin and amoxicillin have the highest PECs while 17 beta-estradiol, naftidrofuryl and dimenhydrinate have the highest RQs. The two approaches, EPBT prioritization and ERA, are compared and a priority list consisting of 26 pharmaceuticals of various classes is developed. Nervous system and alimentary tract and metabolism pharmaceuticals (9/26 and 5/26 respectively) constitute more than half of the numbers on the priority list with the balance consisting of anti-infective (4/26), musculo-skeletal (3/26), genito-urinary (2/26), respiratory (2/26) and cardiovascular (1/26) pharmaceuticals. This list will serve as a basis for the selection of candidate compounds to focus on for future monitoring campaigns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twenty commonly used pharmaceuticals including eight chiral drugs were investigated in Dongting Lake, China. The contamination level was relatively low on a global scale. Twelve pharmaceuticals were identified. The most abundant compound was caffeine followed by diclofenac, DEET, mefenamic acid, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine with mean concentrations from 2.0 to 80.8 ng L-1. Concentrations between East and West Dongting Lake showed spatial difference, with the West Dongting Lake less polluted. The relatively high ratio of caffeine versus carbamazepine (over 50) may indicate there was possible direct discharge of domestic wastewater into the lake. This is the first study presenting a survey allowing for comprehensive analysis of multiclass achiral and chiral pharmaceuticals including beta-blockers, antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs in freshwater lake. The enantiomeric compositions presented racemic to weakly enantioselective, with the highest enantiomeric fraction (EF) of 0.63 for fluoxetine. Meanwhile, venlafaxine was identified and evaluated the environment risk in surface water in China for the first time. The results of risk assessment suggested that fluoxetine, venlafaxine and diclofenac acid might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake. The resulting data will be useful to enrich the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake and stereochemistry for environment investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been recently shown to exert phytotoxic effects. The present study explores the uptake, systemic translocation, and abiotic stress responses and detoxification mechanisms induced by the exposure of alfalfa plants grown in sand under greenhouse conditions to four common, individually applied PhACs (10 mu g L-1) (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, 17a-ethinylestradiol) and their mixture. Stress physiology markers (lipid peroxidation, proline, H2O2 and NO content, antioxidant activity assays) and gene expression levels of key plant detoxification components (including glutathione S-transferases, GST7, GST17; superoxide dismutases, CuZnSOD, FeSOD; protonpump, H+-ATP, and cytochromec oxidase, CytcOx), were evaluated. PhACs were detected in significantly higher concentrations in roots compared with leaves. Stress related effects, manifested via membrane lipid peroxidation and oxidative burst, were local (roots) rather than systemic (leaves), and exacerbated when the tested PhACs were applied in mixture. Systemic accumulation of H2O2 in leaves suggests its involvement in signal transduction and detoxification responses. Increased antioxidant enzymatic activities, as well as upregulated transcript levels of GST7, GST17, H+-ATPase and CytcOx, propose their role in the detoxification of the selected PhACs in plants. The current findings provide novel biochemical and molecular evidence highlighting the studied PhACs as an emerging abiotic stress factor, and point the need for further research on wastewater flows under natural agricultural environments.

AB The fate of five antiviral drugs (abacavir, emtricitabine, ganciclovir, lamivudine and zidovudine) was investigated in biological wastewater treatment. Investigations of degradation kinetics were accompanied by the elucidation of formed transformation products (TPs) using activated sludge lab experiments and subsequent LC-HRMS analysis. Degradation rate constants ranged between 0.46 L d(-1) g(ss)(-1) (zidovudine) and 55.8 L d(-1) g(ss)(-1) (abacavir). Despite these differences of the degradation kinetics, the same main biotransformation reaction was observed for all five compounds: oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl-moiety to the corresponding carboxylic acid (formation of carboxy-TPs). In addition, the oxidation of thioether moieties to sulfoxides was observed for emtricitabine and lamivudine.
   Antiviral drugs were detected in influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with concentrations up to 980 ng L-1 (emtricitabine), while in WWTP effluents mainly the TPs were found with concentration levels up to 1320 ng L-1 (carboxy-abacavir). Except of zidovudine none of the original antiviral drugs were detected in German rivers and streams, whereas the concentrations of the TPs ranged from 16 ng L-1 for carboxy-lamivudine up to 750 ng L-1 for carboxy-acyclovir. These concentrations indicate an appreciable portion from WWTP effluents present in rivers and streams, as well as the high environmental persistence of the carboxy-TPs.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are ubiquitous in natural waters even in places where the human activity is limited. The presence of OMPs in natural water sources for human consumption encourages the evaluation of different water purification technologies to ensure water quality. In this study, the Biobio river (Chile) was selected since the watershed includes urban settlements and economic activities (i.e. agriculture, forestry) that incorporate a variety of OMPs into the aquatic environment, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Atrazine (herbicide), caffeine (psychotropic), diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) and triclosan (antimicrobial) in Biobio river water and in different stages of a drinking and two wastewater treatment plants downstream Biobio river were determined using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI). Quantification of these four compounds showed concentrations in the range of 8 +/- 2 to 55 +/- 10 ng L-1 in Biobio river water, 11 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 21 ng L-1 in the drinking water treatment plant, and 60 +/- 10 to 15,000 +/- 1300 ng L-1 in the wastewater treatment plants. Caffeine was used as an indicator of wastewater discharges.
   Because conventional water treatment technologies are not designed to eliminate some emerging organic pollutants, alternative treatment processes, UV and UV/H2O2, were employed. The transformation of atrazine, carbamazepine (antiepileptic), diclofenac and triclosan was investigated at laboratory scale. Both processes were tested at different UV doses and the Biobio river water matrix effects were evaluated. Initial H2O2 concentration used was 10 mg L-1. Results showed that, the transformation profile obtained using UV/H2O2 at UV doses up to 900 mJ cm(-2), followed the trend of diclofenac > triclosan > atrazine > carbamazepine. Furthermore acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna were carried out after UV/H2O2 treatments of the OMPs mixture studied. At the lower UV doses tested (300 mJ cm(-2)) a higher toxicity was observed, suggesting the formation of toxic intermediates in the course of the reaction. As expected, at higher UV doses the toxicity declined. Considering the treatment of the mixture of ATZ, CBZ, DCL and TCS with a UV dose of 1200 mJ cm(-2) and 10 mg L-1 of H2O2 the acute toxicity results exhibits values for Daphnia magna immobilization equal to 20 and 42% evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively.

AB For successful wastewater reclamation, advanced oxidation processes have attracted attention for elimination of emerging contaminants. In this study, the synergistic treatment with UV irradiation and chlorine (UV/chlorine) was used to degrade carbamazepine (CBZ). Neither UV irradiation alone nor chlorination alone could efficiently degraded CBZ. UV/chlorine oxidation showed a significant synergistic effect on CBZ degradation through generation of radical species ((OH)-O-center dot and (CI)-C-center dot), and this process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic. The degradation rate constants (k(obs.CBZ)) of CBZ increased linearly with increasing UV irradiance and chlorine dosage. The degradation of CBZ by UV/chlorine in acidic solutions was more efficient than that in basic solutions mainly due to the effect of pH on the dissociation of HOCl and OCl- and then on the quantum yields and radical species quenching of UV/chlorine. When pH was increased from 5.5 to 9.5, the rate constants of degradation of CBZ by (OH)-O-center dot decreased from 0.65 to 0.14 min(-1) and that by Cl-center dot decreased from 0.40 to 0.11 min(-1). The rate constant for the reaction between Cl-center dot and CBZ was 5.6 +/- 1.6 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1). Anions of HCO3- (1-50 mM) showed moderate inhibition of CBZ degradation by UV/chlorine, while Cl- did not. UV/chlorine could efficiently degrade CBZ in wastewater treatment plant effluent, although the degradation was inhibited by about 30% compared with that in ultrapure water with chlorine dosage of 0.14-0.56 mM. Nine main oxidation products of the CBZ degradation by UV/chlorine were identified using the HPLC-QToF MS/MS. Initial oxidation products arose from hydroxylation, carboxylation and hydrogen atom abstraction of CBZ by (OH)-O-center dot and Cl-center dot, and were then further oxidized to generate acylamino cleavage and decarboxylation products of acridine and acridione.

AB Intense reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture is practiced all over the world, especially in arid and water-scarce regions. In doing so, pharmaceutical residues in the water are irrigated to the soil and subsequently can percolate into the local aquifers. Since evaporation rates in these areas are typically high, persistent substances might enrich in the groundwater recharge of closed catchments like the Jordan Valley. Against this background, unsaturated column tests were conducted to investigate the potential for evaporative accumulation of the two pharmaceuticals bezafibrate and carbamazepine under simulated arid climate conditions. Parallel tests were conducted with inhibited microbiological activity where both substances showed an increase in the effluent concentrations proportional to the evaporation loss of the inflow solution. The mean accumulation factors of the pharmaceuticals correspond to the evaporated water loss. The experiments indicate the accumulation potential for pharmaceuticals with high persistence against biodegradation. For the first time, the overall potential for evaporative enrichment could be demonstrated for pharmaceuticals. Under the given experimental conditions, the two investigated pharmaceuticals did not enrich faster than chloride, which might result in soil salting prior to reaching harmful pharmaceutical concentrations in soil water. The findings are relevant to future assessments of environmental impacts of persistent trace substances, which need to take into account that concentrations in the aquatic cycle might increase further due to evaporative enrichment.

AB A novel bio-entrapped salt marsh sediment membrane reactor (BESMSMR) was evaluated for treating high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater, and membrane fouling behaviour was also assessed. The BESMSMR was operated in parallel with a conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR), and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) as well as an entrapped biomass MBR (bio-entrapped membrane reactor, BEMR) to facilitate a meaningful comparison of performance characteristics obtained in these reactor systems. Two hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 60 and 40,h with organic loading rates (OLRs) varied from 7.0 to 11.9 kg COD/m(3) d were tested. The pharmaceutical wastewater used has an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of 17,931 1851 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 20,881 2030 mg/L. The BESMSMR demonstrated the highest removal efficiencies of TCOD (78.481.3%), due to the ability of the marine sediment microorganisms seeded from coastal shores to thrive in the hyper-saline environment and degraded recalcitrant organic matter present in the pharmaceutical wastewater. The anoxic zone presented in the inner part of bio-carriers could have triggered the denitrification reaction, and thus improved the TN removal rate by 15-20%. Membrane fouling was reduced with lower concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the entrapped biomass MBRs. Proteins rather than carbohydrates were the main component of EPS and SMP in the MBR systems. The novel BESMSMR possesses the benefits of salt marsh sediment and an entrapped biomass technique that offered effective organic removal for the high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater and reduced membrane fouling.

AB In this study, the capability of pharmaceutical biodegradation of fungus Trichoderma harzianum was evaluated through the comparison with the well-known biodegradation capability of white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. The study was performed in aqueous phase under aerobic conditions, using two of the most frequently detected drugs in water bodies: carbamazepine and clarithromycin, with concentrations commonly found in treated wastewater (4 mu g/l and 0.03 mu g/l respectively). For the first time, we demonstrated that T. harzianum is able to remove carbamazepine and clarithromycin. The analyses were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry, using high-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry upon electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The high selectivity and mass accuracy provided by high-resolution mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify some unknown metabolites. On the basis of our study, the major metabolites detected in liquid culture treated by T. harzianum were: 14-hydroxy-descladinosyl- and descladinosyl-clarithromycin, which are pharmacologically inactive products not dangerous for the environment.

AB Chemical contaminants can be introduced into estuarine and marine ecosystems from a variety of sources including wastewater, agriculture and forestry practices, point and non-point discharges, runoff from industrial, municipal, and urban lands, accidental spills, and atmospheric deposition. The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time.

AB This work studies the sonochemical degradation of a penicillinic antibiotic (oxacillin) in simulated pharmaceutical wastewater. High frequency ultrasound was applied to water containing the antibiotic combined with mannitol or calcium carbonate. In the presence of additives, oxacillin was efficiently removed through sonochemical action. For comparative purposes, the photo-Fenton, TiO2 photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation processes were also tested. Therefore, the evolution of the antibiotic and its associated antimicrobial activity (AA) were monitored. A high inhibition was found for the other three oxidation processes in the elimination of the antimicrobial activity caused by the additives; while for the ultrasonic treatment, a negligible effect was observed. The sonochemical process was able to completely degrade the antibiotic, generating solutions without AA. In fact, the elimination of antimicrobial activity showed an excellent performance adjusted to exponential kinetic-type decay. The main sonogenerated organic by-products were determined by means of HPLC-MS. Four intermediaries were identified and they have modified the penicillinic structure, which is the moiety responsible for the antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the possible oxacillin sonodegradation mechanism was proposed based on the evolution of the by-products and their chemical structure. Furthermore, the high-frequency ultrasound action over 120 min readily removed oxacillin and eliminated its antimicrobial activity. However, the pollutant was not mineralized even after a long period of ultrasonic irradiation (360 min). Interestingly, the previously sonicated water containing oxacillin and both additives was completely mineralized using non-adapted microorganisms from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. These results show that the sonochemical treatment transformed the initial pollutant into substances that are biotreatable with a typical aerobic biological system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bed sediment samples from 79 coastal New York and New Jersey, USA sites were analyzed for 75 compounds including wastewater associated contaminants, PAHs, and other organic compounds to assess the post-Hurricane Sandy distribution of organic contaminants among six regions. These results provide the first assessment of wastewater compounds, hormones, and PAHs in bed sediment for this region. Concentrations of most wastewater contaminants and PAHs were highest in the most developed region (Upper Harbor/Newark Bay, UHNB) and reflected the wastewater inputs to this area. Although the lack of pre-Hurricane Sandy data for most of these compounds make it impossible to assess the effect of the storm on wastewater contaminant concentrations, PAH concentrations in the UHNB region reflect pre-Hurricane Sandy conditions in this region. Lower hormone concentrations than predicted by the total organic carbon relation occurred in UHNB samples, suggesting that hormones are being degraded in the UHNB region. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coastal onsite wastewater disposal systems (OWDS) were inundated by Hurricane Sandy's storm tide. This study compares the shallow groundwater quality (nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones) downgradient of OWDS before and after Hurricane Sandy, where available, and establishes a baseline for wastewater influence on groundwater in coastal communities inundated by Hurricane Sandy. Nutrients and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were detected in shallow, groundwater downgradient of OWDS in two settings along the New Jersey and New York coastlines: 1) a single, centralized OWDS in a park; and 2) multiple OWDS (cesspools) in low-density residential and mixed-use/medium density residential areas. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were lidocaine (40%), carbamazepine (36%), and fexofenadine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, meprobamate, and tramadol (24-32%). Increases in the number and total concentration of pharmaceuticals after Hurricane Sandy may reflect other factors (seasonality, usage) besides inundation, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing for a wide variety of CECs in regional studies.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment has become a subject of growing concern. The extensive use of vancomycin and other pharmaceuticals may alter the biodiversity of soil microbial communities and select antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of vancomycin and/or vancomycin-resistant Citrobacter freundii on soil microbial communities using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) approaches. The experiment had a completely randomized block design with the following treatments: control soil (C), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil-VA1), soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil VA10), soil with C. freundii (Cit), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA1+Cit), and soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA10 Cit). A bacterial strain resistant to vancomycin was isolated from raw sewage collected from the municipal sewage treatment plant. The obtained results indicated that the antibiotic and/or the bacterial strain exerted a selective pressure that resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in the population of soil microorganisms. However, a multivariate analysis showed that the genetic and structural diversity of the soil microbial community was primarily affected by the incubation time and to a lesser extent by the antibiotic and introduced bacteria. DGGE analysis clearly showed that certain species within the bacterial community were sensitive to vancomycin as was evidenced by a decrease in the values of S (richness) and H (Shannon-Wiener) indices. Moreover, a PLFA method-based analysis revealed alterations in the structure of the soil microbial community as indicated by changes in the biomass of the PLFA biomarkers specific for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi. The changes observed in the community of soil microorganisms may decrease the rate of microbial-mediated processes, which can lead to a disturbance in the ecological balance of the soil ecosystem.

AB The treatment performance of ibuprofen (IBP)-enriched wastewater by horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with cattail (Typha angustifolia) and unplanted control mesocosms was investigated. Removal efficiencies of IBP were significantly (p < .05) enhanced in the planted mesocosms (78.5%) compared to those in the unplanted beds (57.9%). An 18S rRNA gene high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was used to investigate the effects of IBP on the structure of the fungal community in these wetland systems. The overall diversity of the fungal community was reduced under the IBP exposure. Taxonomic analysis revealed that 62.2% of the fungal sequences were affiliated with Basidiomycota, followed by Ascomycota (37.4%) at the phylum level. Uncultured fungus (48.2%), Chaetomium sp. (14.2%), Aspergillus sp. (12.4%), Trichoderma sp. (5.7%), Cladosporium sp. (5.4%), and Emericellopsis sp. (5.2%) were identified as dominant genera. At the genus level, a distinct profile of the fungal community in the IBP-enriched mesocosms was observed as compared to the control beds, and as well specific fungal genera were enhanced in the planted beds, regardless of IBP enrichment. However, despite these differences, the composition of the fungal community (as measured by Bray-Curtis similarity) was mostly unaffected by the significant IBP enrichment. On the other hand, a consistent similarity pattern of fungal community structure in the planted mesocosms suggests that the presence of higher macrophytes in the wetland systems may well help shape the fungal community structure.

AB In this study, the effect of heavy monsoon rains on the environmental levels of 13 veterinary pharmaceuticals was investigated. Kyungahn Stream has an annual average flow rate (AVF) of 4.2 m(3)/s and receives runoffs from agricultural areas and livestock farms scattered in the upper stream area, and Han River has an AVF of 845 m(3)/s with four sewage treatment plants with individual capacities of >1 million m(3)/day.
   Grab samples collected in three different rain seasons, before, during, and after rain, were analyzed. Kyungahn Stream and Han River showed completely different patterns of environmental levels of pharmaceuticals: the former had higher detection rates and concentrations of the pharmaceuticals during and after rainy season, implying direct influence by rainfalls, whereas in the latter, higher detection rates were observed before rain (1236 ng/L of oxytetracycline (OTC), 2093 ng/L of tetracycline (TC), and 793 ng/L of chiorotetracycline (ChTC) as the highest values).

AB The applicability of any wastewater technology should be related not only to its degradation, mineralization or detoxification efficiency, but also to its environmental impacts. This could be particularly relevant in case of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are usually highly demanding on chemicals, energy, and generating residual fluxes with specific problems and potential environmental impacts (metal ion-containing sludge, exhausted solid catalysts, etc). In this work, the life cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied for the evaluation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes for the treatment of a wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical industry in Toledo, Spain. The application of LCA as tool for the evaluation of AOPs is scarce found in literature, although it provides a systematic estimation of the environmental changes related to the AOP treatment, quantification of consumptions and emissions, and their effects on human health. In this work, the potential environmental impacts were calculated with Gabi 6.0 software by using ReCiPe version 1.06 and ICCP 2007 methods. Additionally, the water footprint (WF) was used in this study for the first time as tool for comparison between both AOP systems. Experimental data, directly obtained from the company and the laboratory were used to carry out the life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, ensuring high accuracy and sensitivity of the obtained results. The obtained results showed that the recovery of the metallic sludge generated in the homogeneous Fenton process is the most contributing step to environmental impacts followed by the use of chemicals and the heat requirements. The comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes revealed that the latter is a more environmental friendly alternative for the treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater. In addition, the use of the heterogeneous process allows the reduction of the water footprint in more than 77% as compared to the homogeneous one. Besides the results regarding to both Fenton processes, this work shows the efficiency of the water footprint as a complementary parameter to the LCA for comparison between advanced wastewater treatments processes which can be intensive use of fresh water as a resource.

AB During the last decade, several emerging chemicals, also referred as Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), have raised the interest of the scientific community, because of possible adverse effects on the environment and the living organisms. Although several treatment technologies have been applied for their removal, operation and maintenance costs are prohibitive. Therefore, this study aims to study the treatment of EDCs with an alternative and environmentally friendly technology: constructed wetlands (CWs). For this purpose, 6 pilot-scale CW units of two types, horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) and vertical flow (VF), were used for the treatment of municipal wastewater originating from a university campus, targeting the removal of five EDCs: Bisphenol A (BPA), Nonylphenol (NP), Nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), Nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO) and Triclosan (TCS). Results showed that the median removal performance in HSF-R was 49.6%, 51.4% and 48.4%, in HSF-C was 50.0%, 99.0% and 66.0%, and in HSF-Z was 55.4%, 98.9% and 80.3% for BPA, NP1EO and NP2EO, respectively. NP was not removed but its concentration was increased by 48.0%, 43.7% and 51.9% in the HSF-R, HSF-C and HSF-Z, respectively. TCS was not detected in influent wastewater. In the VF-CWs, the median removal efficiencies were: 45.6%, 12.5%, 41.5% and 72.2% in VF-R, 60.0%, 96.2%, 99.0% and 99.8% in VF-C, and 59.0%, 95.6%, 98.7% and 99.8% in VF-Z for BPA, NP, NP1EO, NP2EO, respectively. The study indicates that the main removal pathways of the target EDCs is their biodegradation under aerobic or/and anaerobic conditions and adsorption onto the organic matter retained in the substrate.

AB A simple and convenient method was used to prepare novel granular carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for enhanced adsorption of pharmaceuticals. By heating CNTs powder at 450 degrees C in air, followed by filtration, the obtained granular adsorbent exhibited high surface area and pore volume since the heating process produced some oxygen-containing functional groups on CNT surface, making CNTs more dispersible in the formation of granular cake. The porous granular CNTs not only had more available surfaces for adsorption but also were more easily separated from solution than pristine CNTs (p-CNTs) powder. This adsorbent exhibited relatively fast adsorption for carbamazepine (CBZ), tetracycline (TC) and diclofenac sodium (DS), and the maximum adsorption capacity on the granular CNTs was 369.5 mu mol/g for CBZ, 284.2 mu mol/g for TC and 203.1 mu mol/g for DS according to the Langmuir fitting, increasing by 42.4%, 37.8% and 38.0% in comparison with the pristine CNTs powder. Moreover, the spent granular CNTs were successfully regenerated at 400 degrees C in air without decreasing the adsorption capacity in five regeneration cycles. The adsorbed CBZ and DS were completely degraded, while the adsorbed TC was partially oxidized and the residual was favorable for the subsequent adsorption. This research develops an easy method to prepare and regenerate granular CNT adsorbent for the enhanced removal of organic pollutants from water or wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB To understand the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment bioreactors, the ARGs in sludge from two full-scale pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were investigated and compared with sludge samples from three sewage treatment plants (STPs) using metagenomic approach. The results showed that the ARG abundances in PWWTP sludge ranged from 54.7 to 585.0 ppm, which were higher than those in STP sludge (27.2 to 86.4 ppm). Moreover, the diversity of ARGs in PWWTP aerobic sludge (153 subtypes) was higher than that in STP aerobic sludge (118 subtypes). In addition, it was found that the profiles of ARGs in PWWTP aerobic sludge were similar to those in STP aerobic sludge but different from those in PWWTP anaerobic sludge, suggesting that dissolve oxygen (DO) could be one of the important factors affecting the profiles of ARGs. In PWWTP aerobic sludge, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance genes were frequently detected. While, tetracycline, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and polypeptide resistance genes were abundantly present in PWWTP anaerobic sludge. Furthermore, we investigated the microbial community and the correlation between microbial community and ARGs in PWWTP sludge. And, significant correlations between ARG types and seven bacterial genera were found. In addition, the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were also examined and correlations between the ARGs and MGEs in PWWTP sludge were observed. Collectively, our results suggested that the microbial community and MGEs, which could be affected by DO, might be the main factors shaping the profiles of ARGs in PWWTP sludge.

AB A considerable knowledge gap exists with respect to the fate and environmental relevance of transformation products (TPs) of polar organic micropollutants in surface water. To narrow this gap we investigated the fate of 20 parent compounds (PCs) and 11 characteristic TPs in four wastewater-impacted rivers. Samples were obtained from time integrated active sampling as well as passive sampling using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Seventeen out of the 20 PCs were detected in at least one of the rivers. All the PCs except acesulfame, carbamazepine, and fluconazole were attenuated along the studied river stretches, with the largest decrease found in the smallest river which had an intense surface water-pore water exchange. Seven TPs were detected, all of which were already present directly downstream of the WWTP outfall, suggesting that the WWTPs were a major source of TPs to the recipients. For anionic compounds, attenuation was the highest in the two rivers with the lowest discharge, while the pattern was not as clear for neutral or cationic compounds. For most compounds the results obtained from active sampling were not significantly different from those using POCIS, demonstrating that the cost and labor efficient POCIS is suitable to determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.

AB Endogenous progestogens and pharmaceutical progestins enter the environment through wastewater treatment plant effluent and agricultural field runoff. Lab studies demonstrate strong, negative exposure effects of these chemicals on aquatic vertebrate reproduction. Behavior can be a sensitive, early indicator of exposure to environmental contaminants associated with altered reproduction yet is rarely examined in ecotoxicology studies. Gestodene is a human contraceptive progestin and a potent activator of fish androgen receptors. Our objective was to test the effects of gestodene on reproductive behavior and associated egg deposition in the fathead minnow. After only 1 day, males exposed to ng/L of gestodene were more aggressive and less interested in courtship and mating, and exposed females displayed less female courtship behavior. Interestingly, 25% of the gestodene tanks contained a female that drove the male out of the breeding tile and displayed male-typical courtship behaviors toward the other female. Gestodene decreased or arrested egg deposition with no observed gonadal histopathology. Together, these results suggest that effects on egg deposition are primarily due to altered reproductive behavior. The mechanisms by which gestodene disrupts behavior are unknown. Nonetheless, the rapid and profound alterations of the reproductive biology of gestodene-exposed fish suggest that wild populations could be similarly affected.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two forms of basic granular activated carbon (GAC), mineral (pH = 10.5) and vegetal (pH = 9), for the removal of three pharmaceuticals, as sulphamethoxazole (SMX), diclofenac (DCF) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2), from two different matrices: fortified distilled (2.4-3.0 mg L-1 and pH from 5.5 to 6.5) and natural (similar to 1.0 mg L-1 and pH from 7.1 to 7.2) water in a bench scale. The Rapid Small-Scale Column Test used to assess the ability of mineral and vegetal GAC on removal of such pharmaceuticals led to removal capacities varying from 14.9 to 23.5 mg g(-1) for E2, from 23.7 to 24.2 mg g(-1) for DCF and from 20.5 to 20.6 mg g(-1) for SMX. Removal efficiencies of 71%, 88% and 74% for DCF, SMX and E2, respectively, were obtained at breakthrough point when using mineral GAC, whereas for the vegetal GAC the figures were 76%, 77% and 65%, respectively. The carbon usage rate at the breakthrough point varied from 11.9 to 14.5 L g(-1) for mineral GAC and from 8.8 to 14.8 L g(-1) for vegetal GAC. Mineral CAG also exhibited the best performance when treating fortified natural water, since nearly complete removal was observed for all contaminants in the column operated for 22 h at a carbon usage rate of 2.9 L g(-1).

AB Occurrence of emerging contaminants in the environment reveals a growing problem, attributed to uncontrolled disposal or insufficient elimination of those pollutants during wastewater treatment. The possession of efficient and competent analytical tools is important in order to examine the root of this problem. In the present study, an analytical method was developed for the determination of selected endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical compounds in activated sludge (biosolids). The following ten compounds, triclosan, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, bisphenol A, estrone, 17-beta-estradiol, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, androsterone, 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one and 19-norethindrone were examined and finally included in the analytical method described. Target compounds were isolated from sludge by ultrasound extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The desorption of the analytes from the SPME fiber was carried out by gas chromatography, while identification and quantitation was achieved with mass spectroscopy. For the development and validation of the method, sludge standards were created by spiking target compounds in dewatered sludge. The metabolic activity of activated sludge was interrupted without changing the structure of the biomass, in order to imitate real sorption conditions that exist in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Concerning the optimization of the extraction process, several parameters were investigated, including the type of organic solvent used, duration of the ultrasound extraction, purification of the extract. The limits of detection for examined compounds ranged between 4 and 50 ng g (1) (biomass, dry weight). The method was applied for the determination of the selected compounds in sludge samples collected from large scale municipal on the island of Crete (Greece). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A comprehensive study was conducted at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and one water treatment plant (WTP) in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The occurrence of 220 emerging and legacy compounds, their removal efficiencies by the existing treatment processes, and their potential environmental impacts were studied. The results are reported in a two part paper. In this part (I), the occurrence and removal efficiencies are presented. Three of the 47 target pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) contributed 89-96% of the total concentration of PhACs/EDCs in the WWTP influents. They were acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. The existing treatment processes successfully removed between 95 and 98% of 'all' PhACs/EDCs, primarily due to the high removal rates of these three analgesics. Concentrations of PhACs/EDCs detected at the WTP intake were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in the effluent of the upstream WWTP. These concentrations remained relatively unchanged in the finished drinking water, indicating the WTP's low removal efficiency for trace amounts of them. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were detected at concentrations as high as 150 ng/L (for PBDE-209) in the WWTPs' influent, and removed at 86-96% efficiency. PDBE effluent concentrations were mostly below 1 ng/L at both WWTPs, with a maximum of 9 ng/L for PBDE-209. Octylphenol, nonylphenol, and nonylphenol ethoxylates concentrations were monitored in one WWTP's effluent, and ranged between undetectable and 286 ng/L (LoDs varied between 1.3 and 15.2 ng/L).

AB This is part two of a paper about the potential environmental impacts of treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharging to the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The WWTP uses conventional activated sludge with nitrification.
   The assessment was conducted over six months using a variety of established tests, including in vitro cell-based screening assays, as well as acute, chronic and full-life cycle in vivo exposures. Effluent monitoring included pharmaceutically active compounds and endocrine disrupting compounds.
   No tests reported significant toxicity. However, enhanced algal growth was observed in a Pseudokerchneriella subcapitata growth inhibition test. In full life-cycle fathead minnow exposure, liver-somatic index changes were noted in exposed fish - increases for males, decreases for females - and production of viable fry decreased. Neither alteration is thought biologically significant. Because the effluent is diluted substantially by the receiving water, the level of risk posed to aquatic receptors and the environment is probably negligible.

AB Biophenols are highly prized for their free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities. Olive mill wastewaters (OMWWs) are rich in biophenols. For this reason, there is a growing interest in the recovery and valorization of these compounds. Applications for the encapsulation have increased in the food industry as well as the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields, among others. Advancements in micro-fabrication methods are needed to design new functional particles with target properties in terms of size, size distribution, and functional activity. This paper describes the use of the membrane emulsification method for the fine-tuning of microparticle production with biofunctional activity. In particular, in this pioneering work, membrane emulsification has been used as an advanced method for biophenols encapsulation. Catechol has been used as a biophenol model, while a biophenols mixture recovered from OMWWs were used as a real matrix. Water-in-oil emulsions with droplet sizes approximately 2.3 times the membrane pore diameter, a distribution span of 0.33, and high encapsulation efficiency (98% +/- 1% and 92% +/- 3%, for catechol and biophenols, respectively) were produced. The release of biophenols was also investigated.

AB Psychotropic pharmaceuticals present in the environment may impact organisms both directly and via interaction strengths with other organisms, including predators; therefore, this study examined the potential effects of pharmaceuticals on behavioral responses of fish to avian predators. Wild-caught juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) were assayed using a striking bird model after a seven-day exposure to psychotropic pharmaceuticals (the antidepressants fluoxetine or sertraline, or the -blocker propranolol) under the hypotheses that exposure would increase vulnerability to avian predation via increasing the probability of predator encounter as well as degrading evasive behaviors upon encounter. None of the substances significantly affected swimming activity of the fish, nor did they increase vulnerability by affecting encounter probability or evasive endpoints compared to control treatments. Counter to our expectations, fish exposed to 100 g/L fluoxetine (but no other concentrations or pharmaceuticals) were less likely to enter the open area of the arena, i.e., less likely to engage in risky behavior that could lead to predator encounters. Additionally, all fish exposed to environmentally relevant, low concentrations of sertraline (0.12 g/L) and propranolol (0.1 g/L) sought refuge after the simulated attack. Our unexpected results warrant further research as they have interesting implications on how these psychotropic pharmaceuticals may affect predator-prey interactions spanning the terrestrial-aquatic interface.

AB Pharmaceuticals in wastewater have clearly raised concern and a broad range of analytical methods has been used to assess the risk as accurately as possible. The aim of our study was to measure and compare the concentrations of atorvastatin, bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fluoxetine, metoprolol, and sertraline in wastewater samples taken from one municipal and one hospital wastewater treatment plant in Slovenia and to predict the potential environmental burden using the risk quotient. In both effluents only clofibric acid and fluoxetine were not detected. The measured concentrations of the remaining seven pharmaceuticals varied between the ng L-1 and the mu g L-1 range. Hospital effluent showed higher concentrations, except for diclofenac and carbamazepine. However, high risk quotient was found only for ciprofloxacin and diclofenac in both municipal and hospital effluent. In conclusion, our method can provide a useful tool for systematic monitoring of pharmaceuticals commonly found in wastewater, which will enable a reliable assessment of the risks for the aquatic biota and humans. Knowing the risks will help to plan wastewater treatment and preserve our environment.

AB Loads of individual commonly used analgesics (ibuprofen, diclofenac), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, propranolol) and neuroleptics (carbamazepine, citalopram) to a large-scale operating wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Sweden (Ryaverket) were studied by monitoring concentrations and flows during a 9-year period (2006-2015). Variations in loads due to sampling and possible errors in chemical analyses were estimated to be below 40%. The variations in loads were analyzed and discussed in terms of the design of collecting wastewater system as an integrated part of the water treatment at the WWTP as well as the prescription and use of individual pharmaceuticals. Trend analysis in daily loads of individual pharmaceuticals indicated an increase for diclofenac, no significant changes for ibuprofen and metoprolol and a decrease for the other pharmaceuticals. The latter was ascribed to a decrease in their prescription and use. The increase in loads of diclofenac was ascribed to its growing topical use not requiring prescription. In view of future regulations by the EU, growing loads of diclofenac to WWTPs and its low removal rates in WWTPs may require an upgrade of WWTPs to achieve quality standards for diclofenac in receiving waters.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are taken up and accumulate in crops irrigated with treated wastewater. This raises the concern of chronic human exposure to pharmaceuticals via food consumption. Thus, there is a need to develop a reliable technique to detect and quantify pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations in human biological matrices, particularly urine. In this study, we focus on carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug and recalcitrant compound that is taken up by crops making it an excellent model compound for this study. This paper presents a new analytical technique enabling quantification of trace concentrations of carbamazepine and its metabolites in the urine of individuals who have been environmentally exposed. Sample preparation included extraction with acetonitrile followed by clean-up through mixed-mode ion-exchange cartridges and analysis using LC/MS/MS. This technique, which was validated for a wide range of concentrations (5-2000 ng L-1), exhibits low limits of quantification (3.0-7.2 ng L-1), acceptable recovery levels (70-120%), and low relative standard deviation (<20%). Unlike currently available methods for the analysis of water or treated wastewater that require large volumes (up to 1 L), the new method uses only 10 mL of urine. Moreover, relative to available methods for carbamazepine detection in the urine of individuals who are chronically treated with this drug, the limit of quantification values with our method are six orders of magnitude lower. The newly developed method has been successfully applied for the quantification of carbamazepine and its metabolites in the urine of healthy people exposed to this pharmaceutical through their diet. Our analytical protocol can provide the scientific community and stakeholders with real data for risk assessments and the design of policies ensuring safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation.

AB Pharmaceuticals can enter the soil environment when animal slurries and sewage sludge are applied to land as a fertiliser or during irrigation with contaminated water. These pharmaceuticals may then be taken up by soil organisms possibly resulting in toxic effects and/or exposure of organisms higher up the food chain. This study investigated the influence of soil properties on the uptake and deputation of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine and orlistat) in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals into E. fetida changed depending on soil type. Orlistat exhibited the highest pore water based bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and displayed the largest differences between soil types with BCFs ranging between 30.5 and 115.9. For carbamazepine, diclofenac and fluoxetine BCFs ranged between 1.1 and 1.6, 7.0 and 69.6 and 14.1 and 20.4 respectively. Additional analysis demonstrated that in certain treatments the presence of these chemicals in the soil matrices changed the soil pH over time, with a statistically significant pH difference to control samples. The internal pH of E. fetida also changed as a result of incubation in pharmaceutically spiked soil, in comparison to the control earthworms. These results demonstrate that a combination of soil properties and pharmaceutical physico-chemical properties are important in terms of predicting pharmaceutical uptake in terrestrial systems and that pharmaceuticals can modify soil and internal earthworm chemistry which may hold wider implications for risk assessment.

AB Suburban neighborhoods are a dominant type of human land use. Many housing regions globally rely on septic systems, rather than sanitary sewers, for wastewater management. There is evidence that septic systems may contaminate waterbodies more than sewer lines. There is also mounting evidence that human activities contaminate waterways with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which alter wildlife sexual development. While endocrine disruption is often associated with intense activities such as agriculture or wastewater treatment plant discharges, recent evidence indicates that endocrine disruption is pervasive in frogs from suburban neighborhoods. In conjunction with other putative EDC sources, one hypothesis is that wastewater is contaminating suburban waterways with EDCs derived from pharmaceuticals or personal care products. Here, we measure estradiol (E2) in metamorphosing green frogs (Rana clamitans) from forested ponds and suburban ponds adjacent to either septic tanks or sanitary sewers. We show that E2 is highest in male frogs from septic neighborhoods and that E2 concentrations are significantly lower in male frogs from forested ponds and from ponds near sewers. These results indicate that septic tanks may be contaminating aquatic ecosystems differently than sewer lines. This pattern contrasts prior work showing no difference in EDC contamination or morphological endocrine disruption between septic and sewer neighborhoods, implying that suburbanization may have varying effects at multiple biological scales like physiology and anatomy.

AB In this work, we reported the successful conversion of the industrial SLS originated from black liquor to low-cost porous carbon with tunable microstructure and ultrahigh adsorption performance of tetracycline (TC) from water via pre-carbonation and KOH activation. Comparatively, LCA-850-4 with a very high specific surface area (2805.8 m(2)/g) and pore volume (1.45 cm(3)/g) showed a maximum adsorption of 1173 mg/g at 298 K, which was far higher than other reported adsorbents. LCA-850-4 exhibited excellent adsorption over a broad pH range. Kinetics and isotherm data was well fitted to the pseudo-second order rate and Langmuir model, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. The results are of importance to indicate LCA-850-4 with fast kinetics and excellent reusability possessed the huge potentials in practical pharmaceutical antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB Electron beam irradiation (EBI) has been considered an advanced technology for the treatment of water and wastewater, whereas very few previous investigations reported its use for removing pharmaceutical pollutants. In this study, the degradation of fluoxetine (FLX), an antidepressant marketed as Prozac (R), was investigated by using EBI at FLX initial concentration of 19.4 +/- 0.2 mg L-1. More than 90 % FLX degradation was achieved at 0.5 kGy, with FLX below the detection limit (0.012 mg L-1) at doses higher than 2.5 kGy. The elucidation of organic byproducts performed using direct injection mass spectrometry, along with the results of ion chromatography, indicated hydroxylation of FLX molecules with release of fluoride and nitrate anions. Nevertheless, about 80 % of the total organic carbon concentration remained even for 7.5 kGy or higher doses. The decreases in acute toxicity achieved 86.8 and 9.6 % for Daphnia similis and Vibrio fischeri after EBI exposure at 5 kGy, respectively. These results suggest that EBI could be an alternative to eliminate FLX and to decrease residual toxicity from wastewater generated in pharmaceutical formulation facilities, although further investigation is needed for correlating the FLX degradation mechanism with the toxicity results.

AB Sewage sludge (SS) is a complex organic by-product of wastewater treatment plants. Deposition of large amounts of SS can increase the risk of soil contamination. Therefore, there is an increasing need for fast and accurate assessment of SS toxic potential. Toxic effects of SS were tested on earthworm Eisenia fetida tissue, at the subcellular and biochemical level. Earthworms were exposed to depot sludge (DS) concentration ratio of 30 or 70 %, to undiluted and to 100 and 10 times diluted active sludge (AS). The exposure to DS lasted for 24/48 h (acute exposure), 96 h (semi-acute exposure) and 7/14/28 days (sub-chronic exposure) and 48 h for AS. Toxic effects were tested by the measurements of multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR) activity and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the observation of morphological alterations and behavioural changes. Biochemical markers confirmed the presence of MXR inhibitors in the tested AS and DS and highlighted the presence of SS-induced oxidative stress. The MXR inhibition and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentration in the whole earthworm's body were higher after the exposition to lower concentration of the DS. Furthermore, histopathological changes revealed damage to earthworm body wall tissue layers as well as to the epithelial and chloragogen cells in the typhlosole region. These changes were proportional to SS concentration in tested soils and to exposure duration. Obtained results may contribute to the understanding of SS-induced toxic effects on terrestrial invertebrates exposed through soil contact and to identify defence mechanisms of earthworms.

AB Powdered activated carbon/ultrafiltration (PAC/UF) hybrid process was investigated for removing from wastewater five pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs): 1-H-benzotriazole, DEET, chlorophene, 3-methylindole and nortriptyline-HCl. Adsorption, UF and PAC/UF experiments were performed, focusing on PPCP adsorption as a function of PPCP characteristics and organic matter (EfOM) competition. Two water matrices and two fine-particle PACs were studied, differing on EfOM nature and concentration and on PAC microporosity. Neutral PPCP uptake by the positively charged, meso- and microporous PACs followed PPCP hydrophobicity expressed by log K-ow. The uptake of the positively charged nortriptyline exceeded the expected from log D due to its high aromaticity and the background ions, which partially shielded PAC-nortriptyline electrostatic repulsions. Adsorption capacity depended on PPCP hydrophobicity whereas the kinetics further depended on PPCP charge. Hydrophobic EfOM was preferentially adsorbed and a stronger competitor, particularly for PPCPs with logK(ow) < 2.6. The highly microporous PAC better adsorbed these PPCPs and the hydrophobic EfOM, and it attenuated the EfOM competition. For all waters, PAC had no effect on UF-flux, and it significantly improved PPCP and EfOM removal by PAC/UF over standalone PAC and UF. For all conditions and microcontaminants, PPCP uptake exhibited a sigmoid curve with logK(ow), with a turning point at 2.2-2.6. In real applications, meso- and highly microporous PACs are recommended, and the dose should target the PPCPs with log K-ow < 2.6.

AB Understanding the environmental risks of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has become very important in the field of aquatic toxicology. Hydroxylpropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) is an amphiphilic, toroidal shaped molecule with the ability to form noncovalent inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules. The molecule can reduce volatility as well as improve the aqueous solubility of apolar guest compounds and is an emerging PPCP. As such, HP beta CD is the active ingredient in Febreze (Procter & Gamble) and is extensively used as an excipient in the pharmaceutical industry. With the potential for entering the environment through waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, HP beta CD poses an unknown risk to nontarget aquatic biota. A 145-d chronic full life-cycle exposure using American flagfish (Jordanella floridae) was completed using flow-through nominal concentrations of 0 mg/L (control), 5 mg/L, 16 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 160 mg/L, 500mg/L, and 1600 mg/L of HP beta CD maintained via a peristaltic pump. Fecundity, growth, and liver somatic index were all monitored, and no significant difference was found between treatments and controls (p>0.05). However, a significant increase in the gonadosomatic index was observed in females exposed to HP beta CD (p <= 0.05). Reduced offspring growth was observed after exposure in the same manner as the parental generation (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, an acute copper toxicity challenge assay was conducted on second-generation flagfish larvae, and a decrease in copper tolerance was observed in larval progeny from parents exposed to HP beta CD.

AB In recent years, concerns about the occurrence and fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients, solvents, intermediates and raw materials that could be present in pharmaceutical industry effluents have gained increasing attention. Conventional treatment methods, such as activated sludge, are not sufficient enough to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients completely. As a result, complementary treatment methods like coagulation and flocculation are often used and play a critical role in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. The primary goal of these methods is to destabilize and remove colloidal particles along with other organic/inorganic contaminants. Recently empirical works have considered ozone as the most promising oxidant for the removal of micro-pollutants. The current study examined the effectiveness of coagulation/flocculation process using ferric chloride, polyaluminum chloride, and aluminum sulfate as a reasonable approach to tackle the issue of treating pharmaceutical wastewater. In addition, the results were compared with the process using only ferric chloride that was the coagulant of an actual treatment plant. Then, improvement of the process performance was investigated using ozone as an oxidant. In conclusion, it was found out that polyaluminum chloride presented better performance among two other coagulants and also adding 200 mg/L of polyaluminum chloride can lead to 97-98 % turbidity removal efficiency. Moreover, polyaluminum chloride was capable of reducing most of the environmental parameters such as chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solid with the removal efficiency of 70 and 68 %, respectively. Additionally, ozonation improved the coagulation process, especially iron ion removal, and dramatically decreased the concentration from 5.68 to 0.19 mg/L.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has become an esteemed method to convert sewage sludge into biochar. Besides dewatering and disinfection the process is suggested to reduce the micropollutant load, which would be beneficial for the use of biochar as fertilizer. This study was designed to examine reduction of micropollutants and formation of transformation products during HTC using the example of diclofenac. We investigated compounds' removal at HTC conditions in inert experiments and in real samples. Results showed that HTC temperature (>190 degrees C) and pressure (similar to 15 bar) have the potential to fully degrade diclofenac in inert experiments and spiked sewage sludge (>99%) within 1 h. However, interfering effects hinder full removal in native samples resulting in 44% remaining diclofenac. Additionally, a combination of suspected-target and non-target analysis using LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS resulted in the determination of six transformation products. These products have been reported in biochar from HTC for the first time, although other studies described them for other processes like advanced oxidation. Based on the detected transformation products, we proposed a degradation mechanism reflecting HTC reactions such as dehydroxylation and decarboxylation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antiestrogens and antiandrogens are relatively rarely studied endocrine disrupting chemicals which can be found in unitreated wastewaters. Antiestrogens and antiandrogens in the wastewater treatment effluents could contribute to sexual disruption of organisms. In this study, to assess the removal of nonspecific antiestrogens and antiandrogens by advanced treatment processes, ozonation and adsorption to granular activated carbon (GAC), the biological activities and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy of wastewater were evaluated. As the applied ozone dose increased to 12 mg/L, the antiestrogenic activity dramatically decreased to 3.2 mu g 4-hydroxytamoxifen equivalent (4HEQ)/L, with a removal efficiency of 84.8%, while the antiandrogenic activity was 23.1 mu g flutamide equivalent (FEQ)/L, with a removal efficiency of 75.5%. The removal of antiestrogenic/antiandrogenic activity has high correlation with the removal of fulvic acid-like materials and humic acid-like organics, suggesting that they can be used as surrogates for antiestrogenic/antiandrogenic activity during ozonation. The adsorption kinetics of antiestrogenic activity and antiandrogenic activity were well described by pseudo-second-order kinetics models. The estimated equilibrium concentration of antiestrogenic activity is 7.9 mu g 4HEQ/L with an effective removal efficiency of 70.5%, while the equilibrium concentration of antiandrogenic activity is 33.7 mu g FEQ/L with a removal efficiency of 67.0%. Biological activity evaluation of wastewater effluents is an attractive way to assess the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals by different treatment processes. Fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as a surrogate measure of bioassays during ozonation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As salicylic acid is one of widely used pharmaceuticals, its residue has been found in various environmental water systems e.g. wastewater, surface water, treated water and drinking water. It has been reported that salicylic acid can be efficiently removed by advanced oxidation processes, but there are few studies on its transformation products and ozonation mechanisms during ozonation process. The objective of this study is to characterize the transformation products, investigate the degradation mechanisms at different pH, and propose the ozonation pathways of salicylic acid. The results showed that the rate of degradation was about 10 times higher at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition in the first 1 min when 1 mg L-1 of ozone solution was added into 1 mg L-1 of salicylic acid solution. It was proposed that ozone direct oxidation mechanism dominates at acidic condition, while indirect center dot OH radical mechanism dominates at alkaline condition. A two stages pseudo-first order reaction was proposed at different pH conditions. Various hydroxylation products, carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids, such as 2,5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxylbenzoic acid, catechol, formaldehyde, glyoxal, acetaldehyde, maleic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid etc. were identified as ozonation transformation products. In addition, acrylic acid was identified, for the first time, as ozonation transformation products through high resolution liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometer. The information demonstrated in this study will help us to better understand the possible effects of ozonation products on the water quality. The degradation pathways of salicylic acid by ozonation in water sample were proposed. As both 03 and center dot OH radical were important in the reactions, the degradation pathways of salicylic acid by ozonation in water sample were proposed at acidic and basic conditions. To our knowledge, there was no integrated study reported on the ozonation of salicylic acid in water, in terms of transformation products, kinetic, mechanism, as well as degradation pathways.

AB The synthesis of steroid hormones produces wastewater that is difficult to manage and characterize due to its complex components and high levels of toxicity and bio-refractory compounds. In this work, interior micro-electrolysis (IME) and Fenton oxidation coagulation (FOC) were investigated as wastewater pretreatment processes in combination with biological treatments using a hydrolysis acidification unit (HA) and two-stage biological contact oxidation (BCO) in laboratory and field experiments. In laboratory experiments with an average initial COD load of about 15,000 mg/L, pH of 4, Fe-C/water (V/V) ratio of 1:1, air/water ratio of 10, and reaction time of 180 min, IME achieved a COD removal efficiency of 31.8% and a 1.7-fold increase in the BOD5/COD (B/C) ratio of wastewater. The Fe2+ concentration of 458.5 mg/L in the IME effluent meets the requirements of the Fenton oxidation (FO) process. FOC further reduced the COD with an efficiency of 30.1%, and the B/C ratio of the wastewater reached 0.59. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis showed that complex higher molecular weight organic compounds in the wastewater were degraded after the pretreatment process. In addition, a field experiment with a continuous flow of 96 m(3)/d was conducted for over 90 d. The combined process system operated steadily, though the Fe-C fillings should be soaked in a sulfuric acid solution (5 parts per thousand) for 12 h to recover activity every two weeks. The COD and BOD5 concentrations in the final effluent were less than 90 mg/L and 15 mg/L, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and removal of antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), sulfathiazole (SFI), sulfamethazine (SMA), trimethoprim (TMP), tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC), and enrofloxacin (EFX)) using constructed wetlands (CWs) for treating livestock wastewater were examined. The levels of antibiotics in the effluents of the CWs were in the order of CTC, SFI, SMZ, SMA, TMP, OTC, EFX and TC, ranging from 47.98 to 6834.66 mu g/L, respectively. There was an inverse correlation (p < 0.0493) in the removal of between sulfonamide group (SMZ, SFI, and SMA) and tetracycline group (TC, OTC, and CTC) antibiotics in the effluents of the CWs, indicating that sulfonamide-type antibiotics were more effectively removed in the CWs. Sulfonamide-type antibiotics also have higher pKa values, resulting in more effective adsorption into negatively charged soils through electrostatic interaction. Sunlight photo degradation experiment showed that EFX was effectively removed (70%) compared to other antibiotics. The microcosm adsorption experiment using wetland soils under biotic and abiotic conditions showed that antibiotics in the biotic system were more effectively removed than abiotic system, indicating that soil-mediated microbial degradation can be a major removal mechanism in the CW soils. The microcosm adsorption experiments using wetland plants (Phragmites australis) showed that the biotic system also removed sulfonamide-type antibiotics more effectively compared to the abiotic system. Our results suggest that the removals of antibiotics in the CWs are mainly mediated by biodegradation and adsorption onto soil and plants. Also, the physicochemical property can be the important factors in the removal of antibiotics in the CWs. Our results imply that the CW system can be used for the removal of antibiotics for treating livestock wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since most of the existing wastewater treatment options lack the ability to treat micro-contaminants, the increased use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and release as human waste have become a serious concern in recent years. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a low-cost technology for wastewater treatment, however, its performance in term of PPCPs removal has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to characterize the removal factors and efficiency of acetaminophen (ACT) removal by CWs. The results revealed the decreased concentrations of ACT with increasing hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 0, 3, 5 days. The contribution of removal factors was found to be varied with initial ACT concentration. At the low ACT concentration (i.e. 1 ppb), plant uptake was the dominant, followed by microbial and photolytic removal. In contrast, at the high ACT concentration (i.e. 100 ppb), microbial and photolytic removal were found as dominant factors. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration was found at higher level in the plant shoot than in the root probably due to occurrence of the Fenton reaction resulting in PPCPs removal.

AB Among soil organisms, nematodes are seen as the most promising candidates for bioindications of soil health. We hypothesized that the soil nematode community structure would differ in three land use areas (agricultural, forest and industrial soils), be modulated by soil parameters (N, P, K, pH, SOM, CaCO3, granulometric fraction, etc.), and strongly affected by high levels of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Hg) and emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products, PPCPs). Although these pollutants did not significantly affect the total number of free-living nematodes, diversity and structure community indices vastly altered. Our data showed that whereas nematodes with r-strategy were tolerant, genera with k-strategy were negatively affected by the selected pollutants. These effects diminished in soils with high levels of heavy metals given their adaptation to the historical pollution in this area, but not to emerging pollutants like PPCPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was designed to assess the occurrence and concentrations of a broad range of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from three local estuaries within a large estuarine ecosystem. In addition to effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), we sampled water and whole-body juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) in estuaries receiving effluent. We analyzed these matrices for 150 compounds, which included pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), and several industrial compounds. Collectively, we detected 81 analytes in effluent, 25 analytes in estuary water, and 42 analytes in fish tissue. A number of compounds, including sertraline, triclosan, estrone, fluoxetine, metformin, and nonylphenol were detected in water and tissue at concentrations that may cause adverse effects in fish. Interestingly, 29 CEC analytes were detected in effluent and fish tissue, but not in estuarine waters, indicating a high potential for bioaccumulation for these compounds. Although concentrations of most detected analytes were present at relatively low concentrations, our analysis revealed that overall CEC inputs to each estuary amount to several kilograms of these compounds per day. This study is unique because we report on CEC concentrations in estuarine waters and whole-body fish, which are both uncommon in the literature. A noteworthy finding was the preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon relative to staghorn sculpin, a benthic species with relatively high site fidelity.

AB This study describes a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical method for the analysis of cytostatic cyclophosphamide (CP), ifosfamide (IF) and their selected metabolites/transformation products (TPs): carboxy-cyclophosphamide (carboxy-CP), keto-cyclophosphamide (keto-CP) and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide/N-dechloroethyl-cyclophosphamide (N-decl-CP) in wastewater (WW). Keto-cyclophosphamide, CP and IF were extracted with Oasis HLB and N-decl-CP and carboxy-CP with Isolute ENV+ cartridges. Analyte derivatization was performed by silylation (metabolites/TPs) and acetylation (CP and IF). The recoveries and LOQs of the developed method were 58, 87 and 103 % and 77.7, 43.7 and 6.7 ng L-1 for carboxy-CP, keto-CP and N-decl-CP, respectively. After validation, the analytical method was applied to hospital WW and influent and effluent samples of a receiving WW treatment plant. In hospital WW, levels up to 2690, 47.0, 13,200, 2100 and 178 ng L-1 were detected for CP, IF, carboxy-CP, N-decl-CP and keto-CP, respectively, while in influent and effluent samples concentrations were below LOQs. The formation of TPs during abiotic treatments was also studied. Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify CP and IF TPs in ultrapure water, treated with UV and UV/H2O2. UV treatment produced four CP TPs and four IF TPs, while UV/H2O2 resulted in five CPs and four IF TPs. Besides already known TPs, three novel TPs (CP-TP138a, imino-ifosfamide and IF-TP138) have been tentatively identified. In hospital WW treated by UV/O-3/H2O2, none of the target metabolites/TPs resulted above LOQs.

AB The high levels of antibiotic residues in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) make these plants the hotspots for the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigated the fate and removal of 11 ARG subtypes for sulfonamide, tetracycline, beta-lactam,and macrolide resistance in each processing stage of two full-scale PWWTPs in northern China. The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from (2.56 +/- 0.13) x 10(1) to (2.36 +/- 0.11) x 10(7) copies/ml. The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for only 0.03-78.1 % of influents of the two PWWTPs, while the majority of the ARGs were transported to the dewatered sludge with concentrations from (2.65 +/- 0.43) x 10(5) to (4.27 +/- 0.03) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). The total loads of ARGs discharged through dewatered sludge plus effluent was 1.01-14.09-fold higher than that in the raw influents, suggesting the proliferation of ARGs occurred in the wastewater treatment. The proliferation of ARGs mainly occurs in biological treatment process, such as aeration tank, anoxic tank, sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and bio-contact oxidation, facilitates the proliferation of various ARGs, implying significant replication of certain ARG subtypes may be attributable to microbial growth. Chemical oxidation seems promising to remove ARGs, with removal efficiency ranged from 29.3 to 85.7 %, while the partial correlation analysis showed significant correlations between antibiotic concentration and ARG removal. Thus, the high antibiotic residues within the PWWTPs may have an influence on the proliferation, fate, and removal of the associated ARG subtypes.

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants are growing aquatic-health concerns and largely attributed to wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) discharges. Five biweekly water samples from 59 small Piedmont (United States) streams were analyzed for 108 pharmaceuticals and degradates using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The antidiabetic metformin was detected in 89% of samples and at 97% of sites. At least one pharmaceutical was detected at every site (median of 6, maximum of 45), and several were detected at >10% of sites at concentrations reported to affect multiple aquatic end points. Maximal cumulative (all detected compounds) concentrations per site ranged from 17 to 16000 ng L-1. Watershed urbanization, water table depth, soil thickness, and WWTF metrics correlated significantly with in-stream pharmaceutical contamination. Comparable pharmaceutical concentrations and detections at sites with and without permitted wastewater discharges demonstrate the importance of non-WWTF sources and the need for broad-scale mitigation. The results highlight a fundamental biochemical link between global human-health crises like diabetes and aquatic ecosystem health.

AB The fate and removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has received great attention during the last decade. Numerous data concerning concentrations in the water phase can be found in the literature, however corresponding data from sludge as well as associated mass balance calculations are very limited. In the present study, the adsorbed and dissolved concentrations of 9 PPCPs were investigated in each unit of a WWTP in Beijing, China. Based on the calculation of mass balance, the relative mass distribution and removal efficiency of each target compound was obtained at each process. The amount of PPCPs entering into the WWTP ranged from 12 g.d(-1) to 3848 g.d(-1). Five target compounds (caffeine, chloramphenicol, bezafibrate, clofibric acid, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) were effectively removed, with rates of 57%-100%. Negative removal efficiencies were obtained for sulpiride, metoprolol, nalidixic acid, and carbamazepine, ranging from -19% to -79%. PPCPs mainly existed in dissolved form (>= 92%) in both the raw influent and the final effluent. The sludge cake carried a much lower amount of PPCPs (17 g.d(-1)) compared with the discharged effluent (402 g.d(-1)). In A(2)/O treatment tanks, the anaerobic and anoxic tanks showed good performance for PPCPs removal, and the amount of adsorbed PPCPs was increased. The results reveal that both the dissolved and the adsorbed phases should be considered when assessing the removal capacity of each A(2)/O tank.

AB Hospital effluents represent an important source for the release of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment. This study aims to determine concentrations of various antibiotics in wastewater before and after wastewater treatment in a rural hospital (60 km from the center of Hanoi) and in an urban hospital (in the center of Hanoi) in Vietnam, and it aims to explore the relationship between antibiotic concentrations in wastewater before wastewater treatment and quantities of antibiotics used in the rural hospital, over a period of one year in 2013. Water samples were collected using continuous sampling for 24 h in the last week of every month. The data on quantities of antibiotics delivered to all inpatient wards were collected from the Pharmacy department in the rural hospital. Solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used for chemical analysis. Significant concentrations of antibiotics were present in the wastewater both before and after wastewater treatment of both the rural and the urban hospital. Ciprofloxacin was detected at the highest concentrations in the rural hospital's wastewater (before treatment: mean = 42.8 mu g/L; after treatment: mean = 21.5 mu g/L). Metronidazole was detected at the highest concentrations in the urban hospital's wastewater (before treatment: mean = 36.5 mu g/L; after treatment: mean = 14.8 mu g/L). A significant correlation between antibiotic concentrations in wastewater before treatment and quantities of antibiotics used in the rural hospital was found for ciprofloxacin (r = 0.78; p = 0.01) and metronidazole (r = 0.99; p < 0.001).

AB BACKGROUND: Clofibric acid (CLF), the main pharmacologically active metabolite of blood lipid regulating pharmaceutical clofibrat, etofibrat, etofyllinclofibrat is one of the most widely reported drugs found in water. It is hardly or not degraded by the conventional technology used in wastewater treatment plants.
   RESULTS: Sixteen new filamentous bacteria belonging to genus Streptomyces spp. isolated from different Romanian soil samples and three strains from a collection of microorganisms (MIUG) were morphologically characterized, tested based on their resistance against clofibric acid toxicity and then investigated as bioremediation agents. Only five Streptomyces spp. isolates coded MIUG 4.88, MIUG 4.89, LP1, LP2, SNA, showed high CLF tolerance at most of the concentrations tested (0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 8 mg L-1).
   CONCLUSION: The data obtained showed that only the strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 presents promising potential for clofibric acid biodegradation, with an elimination yield of 35%, which was not reported for this class of bacteria to date. However, further research is needed for optimization of the CLF biodegradation conditions to enhance its bioremediation yield especially in polluted aquatic systems.

AB BACKGROUND: Emerging organic contaminants include a large group of compounds that are frequently detected in wastewater along with heavy metals, due to incomplete removal or limitations in conventional and advanced treatment processes. In this work, the efficiency of Juncus acutus L. on the removal of mixed contamination; ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), bisphenol A (BPA) and heavy metals (chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn)), was investigated in a hydroponic experiment in order to evaluate its potential for use in the alternative remediation technology of constructed wetland (CW) systems. Concentrations of the compounds ranged from mu g L-1 to well beyond environmentally relevant values (50 mg L-1 for the organics and more than 1000 mg L-1 in the case of Zn and Cr).
   RESULTS: Antibiotics (CIP and SMX), BPA and heavy metals were efficiently removed after 28 days, without J. acutus exhibiting perceptible phytotoxicity symptoms, in concentrations even higher than those that are generally detected in industrial or hospital wastewater. Extremely high concentrations of heavymetals induced severe physiological damage to the plants.
   CONCLUSION: The remarkable efficiency of the halophyte J. acutus was revealed, regarding all the contaminants tested at environmentally relevant concentrations. In higher concentrations of antibiotics and mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants, the contribution of the plant was also demonstrated. Findings from this work suggest that J. acutus plants are an ideal candidate for phytoremediation applications in CW systems, targeting urban, industrial or pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB To evaluate the performance of zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 composite catalysts toward target pollutants under solar light irradiation, the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of 18 pharmaceuticals and pesticides with distinguishing features (molecular size and volume, and photolysis) were investigated using mordenite zeolites with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 18 and 240. Different quantities of carbon-doped TiO2 were coated on the zeolites, and then the finished composite catalysts were tested in demineralized, surface, and hospital wastewater samples, respectively. The composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and surface area and porosity analyses. Results showed that a dispersed layer of carbon-doped TiO2 is formed on the zeolite surface; this layer blocks the micropores of zeolites and reduces their surface area. However, these reductions did not significantly affect adsorption onto the zeolites. Our results demonstrated that zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 systems can effectively degrade 18 pharmaceuticals and pesticides in demineralized water under natural and simulated solar light irradiation. In surface and hospital wastewaters, zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 systems present excellent anti-interference capability against radical scavengers and competitive organics for pollutants removal, and higher pollutants adsorption on zeolites evidently enhances the removal rate of target pollutants in surface and hospital wastewater samples with a complicated matrix.

AB This study aims to evaluate the occurrence of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in wastewater sludge and their removal during anaerobic digestion. The significant occurrence of 18 TrOCs in primary sludge was observed. These TrOCs occurred predominantly in the solid phase. Some of these TrOCs (e.g. paracetamol, caffeine, ibuprofen and triclosan) were also found at high concentrations (>10,000 ng/L) in the aqueous phase. The overall removal of TrOCs (from both the aqueous and solid phase) by anaerobic digestion was governed by their molecular structure (e.g. the presence/absence of electron withdrawing/donating functional groups). While an increase in sludge retention time (SRT) of the digester resulted in a small but clearly discernible increase in basic biological performance (e.g. volatile solids removal and biogas production), the impact of SRT on TrOC removal was negligible. The lack of SRT influence on TrOC removal suggests that TrOCs were not the main substrate for anaerobic digestion. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of seven pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, naproxen, ranitidine and sulfamethoxazole) from water was investigated using three different microbial treatments with: (1) the microalga Chlorella vulgaris, (2) the fungus Aspergillus niger and (3) biopellets composed of both microorganisms. The three-day experiment was performed under laboratory conditions and pharmaceuticals were spiked at the environmentally relevant concentration of 10 mu g L-1. The biopellets and fungal treatments resulted in significantly lower ranitidine concentration compared with the initial value. Also, treatment with biopellets resulted in significantly lower final ranitidine concentrations compared to those found after control and microalgal treatments. Low removal rates were obtained for other substances, possibly because the amount of microbial biomass used was 16-500-fold lower than that normally used in activated sludge processes in wastewater treatments plants. Thus, the pharmaceutical removal potential, elimination potential and performance of biopellets should be further investigated at higher biomass concentrations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are widely used as flame retardants. In this study, the occurrence and distribution of six OPEs were investigated in sewage sludge from 24 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 18 cities of Henan province, Central China. The results indicated that all target OPEs were detected in the sludge samples with the detection rate of 95.8%, except tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate (TDCP). The total concentration of the six OPEs ranged from 38.6 to 508 mu g kg(-1). Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), and tris(2-chloroiso-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) were found to be predominant, with concentrations ranging from 2.50 to 203, 1.60 to 383, and 6.70 -161 mu g kg I, respectively. The potential factors affecting OPE levels in sewage sludge, such as wastewater source, sludge characteristics, operational conditions, treatment techniques, and total organic carbon (TOC) of sludge in WWTPs were investigated. The results indicated that the total concentration of OPEs in sewage sludge has no significant relationship with the individual parameters (p > 0.05). However, significant correlations were found between triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) level and treatment capacity (R = 0.484, p < 0.05), processing volume (R = 0.495, p < 0.05), and serving population (R = 0.591, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the relationship between treatment techniques and the total concentration of OPEs in sewage sludge was also investigated in this study, and the results illustrated that the levels of OPEs in sludge were independent of the solid retention time (SRT).

AB The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance represents one of the most important public health concerns and has been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine. The overall elimination of antibiotics in conventional wastewater treatment plants is quite low; therefore, residual amounts of these compounds are continuously discharged to receiving surface waters, which may promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In this study, the ability of a fungal treatment as an alternative wastewater treatment for the elimination of forty-seven antibiotics belonging to seven different groups (beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, metronidazoles, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) was evaluated. 77% of antibiotics were removed after the fungal treatment, which is higher than removal obtained in conventional treatment plants. Moreover, the effect of fungal treatment on the removal of some antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was evaluated. The fungal treatment was also efficient in removing ARGs, such as ermB (resistance to macrolides), tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), bla(TEM) (resistance to beta-lactams), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones). However, it was not possible to establish a clear link between concentrations of antibiotics and corresponding ARGs in wastewater, which leads to the conclusion that there are other factors that should be taken into consideration besides the antibiotic concentrations that reach aquatic ecosystems in order to explain the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.

AB A rapid analytical procedure based on high performance liquid chromatography for identification and quantification of amoxicillin in wastewaters after its degradation by advanced oxidation process (AOP) was developed and validated. The proposed methodology was validated concerning to linearity, precision, limit of quantification, and limit of detection according to the required INMETRO and ANVISA (regulatory agencies in Brazil) standards. The method was applied to the determination of amoxicillin in wastewaters from wastewater treatment plant of a Brazilian pharmaceutical industry spiked with amoxicillin after AOP treatment process on a pilot scale reactor. The method allows the determination of the referred drug in a concentration range of 10-100mgL(-1) with a detection limit of 2.32mgL(-1), a quantification limit of 7.04mgL(-1), and enabling control of contaminant removal.

AB Toxicity of heavy metals to higher life forms is ascribed to mobility and accumulation in water reservoir. Adsorption offers a promising alternative to treat wastewater. This article proposes green and economically viable options for the replacement of expensive commercial adsorbent. The spent Camelia sinensis (black tea) and Gallus domesticus (hen egg shell) powder under identical experimental conditions possesses better sorbing potential for cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). The adsorbents can be conveniently regenerated with HCl solution. The proposed adsorbents were found successful in situ remediation of textile, pharmaceutical, and leather industry effluents. Cost benefit and batch sorption analysis strongly recommends the present experimental endeavor for commercial scale up.

AB An efficient chiral liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method has been developed for the determination of metoprolol (MTP) and three of its major metabolites, namely O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha-HMTP) and metoprolol acid (MTPA) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents. The optimized analytical method has been validated with good quality parameters including resolution >1.3 and method quantification limits down to the ng/L range except for MTPA. On the basis of this newly developed analytical method, the stereochemistry of MTP and its metabolites was studied over time in effluent/sediment biotic and sterile microcosms under dark and light conditions and in influents and effluents of 5 different WWTPs. MTP stereoselective degradation was exclusively observed under biotic conditions, confirming the specificity of enantiomeric fraction variations to biodegradation processes. MTP was always biotransformed into MTPA with a (S)-enantiomer enrichment. The results of enantiomeric enrichment pointed the way for a quantitative assessment of in situ biodegradation processes due to a good fit (R-2 > 0.98) of the aerobic MTP biodegradation to the Rayleigh dependency in all the biotic microcosms and in WWTPs because both MTP enantiomers followed the same biodegradation kinetic profiles. These results demonstrate that enantiomeric fractionation constitutes a very interesting quantitative indicator of MTP biodegradation in WWTPs and probably in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A procedure was developed to assess the biodegradation of micropollutants in cell-free lysates produced from activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This proof-of-principle provides the basis for further investigations of micropollutant biodegradation via native enzymes in a solution of reduced complexity, facilitating downstream protein analysis. Differently produced lysates, containing a variety of native enzymes, showed significant enzymatic activities of acid phosphatase, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase in conventional colorimetric enzyme assays, whereas heat deactivated controls did not. To determine the enzymatic activity towards micropollutants, 20 compounds were spiked to the cell-free lysates under aerobic conditions and were monitored via LC-ESI-MS/MS. The micropollutants were selected to span a wide range of different biodegradabilities in conventional activated sludge treatment via distinct primary degradation reactions. Of the 20 spiked micropollutants, 18 could be degraded by intact sludge under assay conditions, while six showed reproducible degradation in the lysates compared to the heat-deactivated negative controls: acetaminophen, N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (acetyl-SMX), atenolol, bezafibrate, erythromycin and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ). The primary biotransformation of the first four compounds can be attributed to amide hydrolysis. However, the observed biotransformations in the lysates were differently influenced by experimental parameters such as sludge pre-treatment and the addition of ammonium sulfate or peptidase inhibitors, suggesting that different hydrolase enzymes were involved in the primary degradation, among them possibly peptidases. Furthermore, the transformation of 10-OH-CBZ to 9-CA-ADIN was caused by a biologically-mediated oxidation, which indicates that in addition to hydrolases further enzyme classes (probably oxidoreductases) are present in the native lysates. Although the full variety of indigenous enzymatic activity of the activated sludge source material could not be restored, experimental modifications, e.g. different lysate filtration, significantly enhanced specific enzyme activities (e.g. >96% removal of the antibiotic erythromycin). Therefore, the approach presented in this study provides the experimental basis for a further elucidation of the enzymatic processes underlying wastewater treatment on the level of native proteins.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are highly consumed pharmaceuticals and concentrated in effluents from conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) since they are not completely eliminated. Under microbial mediated nitrification/denitrification processes occurring in nitrifying activated sludge DCF biotransformed into its nitroso and nitro derivatives (NO-DCF and NO2-DCF, respectively). SMX was biotransformed under denitrification conditions in water/sediment batch reactors into its nitro and desamino derivatives (NO2-SMX and Des-SMX, respectively). Four transformation products (TPs) from DCF and SMX were analized in wastewaters (WW) and receiving surface waters (SW). Nitrifying/denitrifying-derivatives of DCF and SMX were detected for the first time in WW and SW at one order of magnitude lower than their parent compounds. Relationships observed among levels of NO-DCF, NO2-DCF and nitrogen-species tentatively suggested that nitrification/denitrification processes are involved in nitration and nitrosation of DCF during biological WW treatment. Acute toxicity of analytes to Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri was assessed individually and in mixtures with other relevant micropollutants. Individual effects showed these compounds as not harmful and not toxic. However, synergism effects observed in mixtures evidenced that contribution of these compounds to overall toxicity of complex environmental samples, should not be dismissed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants was investigated in 15 diverse biological reactors through short and long-term experiments. Short-term batch experiments were performed with activated sludge from three parallel sequencing batch reactors (25, 40, and 80 d solid retention time, SRT) fed with synthetic wastewater without micropollutants for one year. Despite the minimal micropollutant exposure, the synthetic wastewater sludges were able to degrade several micropollutants present in municipal wastewater. The degradation occurred immediately after spiking (1-5 mu g/L), showed no strong or systematic correlation to the sludge age, and proceeded at rates comparable to those of municipal wastewater sludges. Thus, the results from the batch experiments indicate that degradation of organic micropollutants in biological wastewater treatment is quite insensitive to SRT increases from 25 to 80 days, and not necessarily induced by exposure to micropollutants. Long-term experiments with municipal wastewater were performed to assess the potential for extended biological micropollutant removal under different redox conditions and substrate concentrations (carbon and nitrogen). A total of 31 organic micropollutants were monitored through influent-effluent sampling of twelve municipal wastewater reactors. In accordance with the results from the sludges grown on synthetic wastewater, several compounds such as bezafibrate, atenolol and acyclovir were significantly removed in the activated sludge processes fed with municipal wastewater. Complementary removal of two compounds, diuron and diclofenac, was achieved in an oxic biofilm treatment. A few aerobically persistent micro pollutants such as venlafaxine, diatrizoate and tramadol were removed under anaerobic conditions, but a large number of micropollutants persisted in all biological treatments. Collectively, these results indicate that certain improvements in biological micropollutant removal can be achieved by combining different aerobic and anaerobic treatments, but that these improvements are restricted to a limited number of compounds.

AB The conventional approach for the environmental assessment of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is typically based on the removal efficiency of organic load and nutrients as well as the quantification of energy and chemicals consumption. Current wastewater treatment research entails the monitoring of direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), which have been rarely considered in the environmental assessment of a wastewater treatment facility by life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. As a result of that, the real environmental impacts of a WWTP may be underestimated. In this study, two WVVIPs located in different climatic regions (Atlantic and Mediterranean) of Spain were evaluated in extensive sampling campaigns that included not only conventional water quality parameters but also direct GHG emissions and PPCPs in water and sludge lines. Regarding the GHG monitoring campaign, on -site measurements of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were performed and emission factors were calculated for both WWTPs. GHG direct emissions accounted for 62% of the total global warming potential (GWP), much more relevant than indirect CO, emissions associated with electricity use. Regarding PPCPs, 19 compounds were measured in the main streams: influent, effluent and sludge, to perform the evaluation of the toxicity impact categories. Although the presence of heavy metals in the effluent and the sludge as well as the toxicity linked to the electricity production may shade the toxicity impacts linked to PPCPs in some impact categories, the latter showed a notable influence on freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FETP). For this impact category, the removal of PPCPs within the wastewater treatment was remarkably important and arose as an environmental benefit in comparison with the non -treatment scenario.

AB Response surface methodology was utilized to optimize the treatment of wastewater from a production of cephem pharmaceuticals using ultrasound/Fenton processes. Box-Behnken design with four variables (initial pH (3, 4 ,5), Fe2+ concentration (0.006, 0.008, 0.010mol/L), mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+ (1:1, 2:1, 3:1), and ultrasound power (400, 450, 500W)) was employed in this study to determine the most efficient combination of these variables for COD removal. The optimum conditions of initial pH, Fe2+ concentration, mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+, and ultrasound power were found to be 4.04, 0.008mol/L, 2:1, and 487W, respectively, for maximum COD removal efficiency (87.9%). A quadratic model was obtained for COD removal efficiency through this design. The experimental values are in good agreement with predicted values and the model was highly significant with the correlation coefficient of 0.999.

AB Parabens are widely used as preservatives in personal care products, food, and pharmaceuticals. This paper presents the results of the photochemical degradation of four hazardous water contaminants (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben) using an ultraviolet (UV) radiation source in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and/or titanium dioxide. Oxidation kinetics and overall performance of the removal process for the four parabens in Milli-Q water using different advanced oxidation processes (namely, UV/H2O2, UV/TiO2, and UV/TiO2/H2O2) were studied. The most efficient oxidation system to remove these pollutants was UV/TiO2/H2O2. A factorial central composite orthogonal and rotatable design of experiments was used to improve the parabens removal using the UV/TiO2/H2O2 process. Initial concentrations of H2O2 and TiO2 were the selected operational variables to optimize the process in Milli-Q water. Similarly, experiments were carried out under optimal conditions in different surface water matrices, namely, Guadiana River water (Badajoz, SW Spain), Pena del Aguila reservoir water (Villar del Rey), and wastewater treatment plant effluent (Badajoz).

AB Ozonation is a promising technology for the treatment of biorefractory compounds. Parabens belong to a chemical family of apparently innocuous preservatives that have been used in the food and cosmetic industries for several years. Oxidation of different parabens, such as methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and butylparaben (BP), was carried out using. O-3 in ultrapure water. A design of experiments procedure-has, been, carried out in order to optimize the ozonation,process as well as to study the interaction between the studied variables: pH and temperature (T). In addition to the application of the single ozonation, ozone-combined processes were studied under the optimal conditions obtained for O-3 (namely, pH 8 and T = 20 degrees C). The tested processes were O-3/Fenton, O-3/H(2)Q(2),.O-3/UV, O-3/UV/H2O2, O-3/photo-Fenton, O-3/UV/TiO2, and O-3/UV/TiO2/H2O2. According to the experimental results, single ozonation is a more effective treatment than O-3-/H2O2 and O-3/Fenton processes. In addition, the introduction of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation results, in all cases, in a faster and more efficient removal of the parabens, because of the contribution of ozone photolysis to the radical-mediated pathway. The most efficient method for the degradation of these emerging, pollutants was O-3/UV/TiO2/H2O2. The influence of different aqueous matrices (namely, ultrapure water, river water, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and reservoir water) on the removal of the target pollutants has been analyzed:The direct ozonation pathway is the predominant degradation mechanism and a remarkable synergistic effect of bicarbonate ions has been demonstrated.

AB In a wastewater reclamation and reuse system, even though reverse osmosis (RO) or forward osmosis (FO) membrane is utilized as a main process, micropollutants, especially non-biodegradable matters, such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, and cancer causing matters, can give menaces to natural water environment and human. Initially, in this study, pharmaceuticals were measured present in both wastewater effluent and brackish water to investigate how much the pharmaceuticals remain after naturally degraded in water stream. Through the filtration with RO and FO, the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in permeate and retentate were observed. For the elimination of pharmaceuticals, the possibility of ultraviolet (UV) alone and UV/H2O2 processes for the integration with the membrane filtrations (RO and FO) was explored by observing the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in feed and retentate.

AB The increasing load of pharmaceutical compounds has raised concerns about their potential residues in aquatic environments and ecotoxicity. Metformin (MET), a widely prescribed antidiabetic-II medicine, has been detected in high concentration in sewage and in wastewater treatment effluents. An uptake and translocation study was carried out to assess the ultimate fate of MET in phytoremediation. MET was removed from media by Typha latifolia, and the removal processes followed first order kinetics. After 28 days, the removal efficiencies were in a range of 74.0 +/- 4.1-81.1 +/- 3.3%. In roots, MET concentration was increasing during the first two weeks of the experiment but thereafter decreasing. In contrast, MET concentration was continuously increasing in rhizomes and leaves. Bioaccumulation of MET in roots was much higher than in leaves and rhizomes. As degradation product of metformin in the plant, methyl-biguanide (MBG) was detected whereas guanylurea was undetectable. Moreover, MBG concentration in roots was increasing with exposure time. An enzymatic degradation experiment showed the degradation rate followed the order of MET < MBG guanylurea. This may explain the low concentration of MBG in plant. The findings of this study contribute to understand and evaluate the potential for phytoremediation of such kind of contaminants.

AB A model to predict the mass flows and concentrations of pharmaceuticals predominantly used in hospitals across a large number of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and river waters was developed at high spatial resolution. It comprised 427 georeferenced hospitals and 742 STPs serving 98% of the general population in Switzerland. In the modeled base scenario, domestic, pharmaceutical use was geographically distributed according to the population size served by the respective STPs. Distinct hospital scenarios were set up to evaluate how the predicted results were modified when pharmaceutical use in hospitals was allocated differently; for example, in proportion to number of beds or number of treatments in hospitals. The hospital scenarios predicted the mass flows and concentrations up to 3.9 times greater than in the domestic scenario for iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) used in computed tomography (CT), and up to 6.7 times greater for gadolinium, a contrast medium used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Field measurements showed that ICM and gadolinium were predicted best by the scenarios using number of beds or treatments in hospitals with the specific facilities (i.e., CT and/or MRI). Pharmaceuticals used both in hospitals and by the general population (e.g., cyclophosphamide, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac) were predicted best by the scenario using the number of beds in all hospitals, but the deviation from the domestic scenario values was only small. Our study demonstrated that the bed number-based hospital scenarios were effective in predicting the geographical distribution of a diverse range of pharmaceuticals in STP effluents and rivers, while the domestic scenario was similarly effective on the scale of large river-catchments.

AB The present study evaluates the effect of integrated nanobio approach involving nanoscale magnesium oxide (n-MgO) and yeast Candida sp. SMN04 on cefdinir degradation in aqueous medium. The nanoparticle was chemically synthesized and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDAX analysis, and particle size analyser. Nano-bio integrated system was prepared using chemically synthesized n-MgO (10 mg mL(-1)), coated onto the surface of yeast cells without causing any lethal effects to the cell. Cefdinir (250 mg L-1) degradation was studied using individual and nano-bio integrated system both. Nano-bio integrated system was found to be more effective for cefdinir degradation compared to native yeast cell. The adherence of nanoparticles on the surface of the yeast cells increased the permeability of the cell membrane, thereby enhancing the entry of cefdinir into the cell. The kinetic data showed the half-life of cefdinir, which was 1.46 days for integrated system and 2.97 days for native yeast, which confirmed that the integrated approach reduced the half-life to less than half of the time taken by the yeast alone. This study signifies the potential efficacy of the nanobio integrated approach to serve as an effective remedial tool for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The organic wastewater obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratory with ultra-high COD value (>15,000 mg/L) was treated by Fenton and Electrolytic oxidation technology separately. Single factor experiments of Fenton process and Box-bohnken design (BBD) method for Electrolytic oxidation technology were used to find their optimal conditions. BOD5 was measured to evaluate the biodegradability of the sample. Single pretreatment technology could improve the biodegradability of the organic wastewater a little, but not significantly. The combined sequence of the two technologies, Fenton-EOT process (Fenton first then Electrolytic), EOT-Fenton process (Electrolytic first then Fenton), F&E Process (Fenton and Electrolytic oxidation occurred simultaneity) was compared. The Fenton-EOT process had the highest COD removal efficiency. All the combined processes used in this study could improve the biodegradability of the raw wastewater significantly. Luminous bacteria detection was conducted to measure the biotoxicity of the organic wastewater and the effluents. Fenton-EOT was the optimal pretreatment process due to its advantages in decreasing the biotoxicity and improving degradability of the raw water.

AB In this study, ranitidine (RT), a cationic drug was tested for its removal by palygorskite (PA) under different physico-chemical conditions, such as initial RT concentrations, contact time, equilibrium solution pH, ionic strength, and temperature. FTIR, SEM, and XRD analyses were conducted to determine the mechanisms of RT uptake on PA. The results showed that cation exchange or electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged PA surfaces and positively charge dimethylamine of RT was the major mechanism of RT uptake when solution pH was less than the pK(a) value of RT. Under high pH conditions, the 2,5-disubstituted furan group interacted with the PA surface via a delocalized pi-bond, suggesting that the RT molecules were parallel to PA surface. The larger values for the RT distribution coefficient between PA and solution via electrostatic or cation exchange interactions and delocalized pi-bonds in a multi-regression analysis confirmed these mechanisms. The XRD results showed no expansion of the (1 1 0) reflection of PA while the SEM observation showed no changes in crystal size and morphology, indicating that the sites for RT uptake were limited to the external surfaces of PA.

AB A variety of pharmaceuticals has been detected in many environmental samples worldwide. Given the unpredictable and possible severe effects, there is substantial public concern about the environment contamination with pharmaceutical residues. Nevertheless, only preliminary measures aimed at protecting the environment from adverse effects of pharmaceutical pollutants are in place; these measures must be supplemented by integrated programs. This paper provides an overview of recent scientific research on the sources and occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, an up to date review of the EU regulations and directives on the environmental protection with respect to pharmaceuticals and emphases the problems encountered in the implementation of the protection measures.

AB The big challenge for the detection of pharmaceutical residues in water samples is the type of ionization mode in terms of positive or negative ionization which plays an important role to identify and quantify the analytes using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. An analytical method was applied to analysis of gliclazide (diabetic drug) in surface water and wastewater from sewage treatment plants and hospitals. The proposed analytical method allows simultaneous isolation and concentration procedure using solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB) prior to separation using high-performance liquid chromatography. The detection and confirmation was achieved by applying time-of-flight analyzer. The limits of quantification were as low as 1.4 ng/L (deionized water), 4 ng/L (surface water), 27 ng/L (hospital influent), 10 ng/L (hospital effluent), 6 ng/L (sewage treatment plant effluent) and 21 ng/L (sewage treatment plant influent), respectively. On average, good recoveries of higher than 87% were obtained for gliclazide in the studied samples. The proposed method successfully determined and quantified gliclazide in surface water and wastewater. The results showed that gliclazide is a persistent compound in sewage treatment effluents as well as in the recipient rivers.

AB In recent years measurable concentrations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown in the aquatic environment as a result of increasing human consumption. Effects of five frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid and piroxicam in 0.1 mg ml(-1) concentration) in batch cultures of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus, Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii), and eukaryotic algae (Desmodesmus communis, Haematococcus pluvialis, Cryptomonas ovata) were studied. Furthermore, the effects of the same concentrations of NSAIDs were investigated in natural algal assemblages in microcosms. According to the changes of chlorophyll-a content, unicellular cyanobacteria seemed to be more tolerant to NSAIDs than eukaryotic algae in laboratory experiments. Growth of eukaryotic algae was reduced by all drugs, the cryptomonad C. ovata was the most sensitive to NSAIDs, while the flagellated green alga H. pluvialis was more sensitive than the non-motile green alga D. communis. NSAID treatments had weaker impact in the natural assemblages dominated by cyanobacteria than in the ones dominated by eukaryotic algae, confirming the results of laboratory experiments. Diversity and number of functional groups did not change notably in cyanobacteria dominated assemblages, while they decreased significantly in eukaryotic algae dominated ones compared to controls. The results highlight that cyanobacteria (especially unicellular ones) are less sensitive to the studied, mostly hardly degradable NSAIDs, which suggest that their accumulation in water bodies may contribute to the expansion of cyanobacterial mass productions in appropriate environmental circumstances by pushing back eukaryotic algae. Thus, these contaminants require special attention during wastewater treatment and monitoring of surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have become important because of the risk of harmful effects to ecosystem and drinking water abstraction. This is also the case in shallow dimictic Lake Tegel, located in the city area of Berlin, Germany. Here, drinking water is produced via bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge, and concurrently, a substantial anthropogenic load takes place by micro-pollutants from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The measured mean daily loads of 260 g d(-1) carbamazepine, 180 g d(-1) diclofenac and 60 g d(-1) sulfamethoxazole results in the highest so far reported concentrations from natural waters, which are used as a drinking water resource. In the present study the spatial horizontal and vertical distribution and elimination of these three pharmaceuticals are quantified with the help of high-resolution sampling in Lake Tegel and its entire major in- and outflows. Monthly mass balances are modelled and substance-specific zero-order elimination rates are derived. Diclofenac showed the strongest elimination and revealed a significant seasonality with 50 % elimination in winter, and 95 % in summer. Elimination of carbamazepine was about 40 %; sulfamethoxazole did not degrade at determinable rates. Based on a basic plug-flow approach, a pseudo first-order elimination rate for diclofenac in summer (0.058 d(-1), half-life 12 days) was calculated from horizontal concentration gradient. Apart from presenting the current state of pharmaceuticals pollution in Lake Tegel, results demonstrate the importance of lake-specific mechanisms, such as inflow-outflow balances and seasonal density stratification for the transport of micro-pollutants.

AB This paper reports on recycling of industrial wastes (three pharmaceutical industrial sludges) into environmental friendly value-added materials. Stabilization/Solidification (S/S or bricks) process was applied to make a safer way for the utilization of pharmaceutical waste. The additives in this study include binders (cement, lime and bentonite) and strengthening material (pulverized fuel ash (PFA), silica fume and quarry dust) was used at different compositions. Bricks were cured for 28 days, and the following analysis-like compressive strength, leachability of heavy metals, mineralogical phase identity by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal behaviour by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) had done. All the bricks were observed to achieve the standard compressive strength as required for construction according to BIS standards. Metal concentration in the leachate has reached the dischargeable limits according to Brazilian standards. Results of this study demonstrate that production of bricks is a promising and achievable productive use of pharmaceutical sludge.

AB A user-friendly, menu-driven simulation software tool has been developed for the first time to optimize and analyze the system performance of an advanced continuous membrane-integrated pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. The software allows pre-analysis and manipulation of input data which helps in optimization and shows the software performance visually on a graphical platform. Moreover, the software helps the user to "visualize" the effects of the operating parameters through its model-predicted output profiles. The software is based on a dynamic mathematical model, developed for a systematically integrated forward osmosis-nanofiltration process for removal of toxic organic compounds from pharmaceutical wastewater. The model-predicted values have been observed to corroborate well with the extensive experimental investigations which were found to be consistent under varying operating conditions like operating pressure, operating flow rate, and draw solute concentration. Low values of the relative error (RE=0.09) and high values of Willmott-d-index (d(will)=0.981) reflected a high degree of accuracy and reliability of the software. This software is likely to be a very efficient tool for system design or simulation of an advanced membrane-integrated treatment plant for hazardous wastewater.

AB This study evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging characteristics of wastewater from five membrane bioreactor (MBR) and five activated sludge (AS) systems. The average values of the characteristics of both wastewater types was found to be significantly different at a 90% confidence interval in terms UV absorbance at 254 nm, alkalinity, and biopolymer concentration. Effluent organic matter (EfOM), with an average k(OH,EfOM) of (2.75 +/- 1.04) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), was identified as the primary hydroxyl scavenger contributing to >70% of the background scavenging in all cases, except when nitrite exceeded 0.3 mg NO2--N/L. The average scavenging capacity, EfOM scavenging capacity, and the EfOM reaction rate constant of the AS wastewaters exceeded that of the MBR. However, due to the small sample size (n = 5) and considerable variability in scavenging characteristics among the MBR wastewaters, the difference in EfOM reactivity between the two wastewaters was not statistically significant at a 90% confidence interval. Nevertheless, these preliminary findings suggest the possibility that MBR wastewaters may be more amenable to treatment by advanced oxidation. A plausible explanation is that MBRs were observed to reject biopolymers, and a strong correlation was observed between EfOM scavenging capacity and biopolymer concentration.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) absorption characteristics of poly-Al-Zn-Fe (PAZF), a polymerized coagulant containing three kinds of metallic elements prepared from a galvanized-aluminum slag, was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometry during its polymerization process. Pollutant removal by PAZF in treating various wastewaters was investigated, in comparison with that of polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The results showed that PAZF can be applied to different wastewaters and had excellent coagulation behavior due to its special internal composition. Various complicated substances having different absorption wavelengths and polymeric properties were produced during the PAZF polymerization process, and the structures of these complicated substances were adjusted continuously with the increasing of the polymerization time. PAZF posed better turbidity and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand, CODCr) removal than PAC for different wastewaters, and the required dosage of PAZF was far lower than that of PAC when achieving the same coagulation performance. For pharmaceutical, sugar, dyeing, simulated pesticide and landscape wastewaters, PAZF gave higher removal of turbidity or CODCr than PAC, by up to 79.5% (coagulant dose: 74 mg/L) or 16% (148 mg/L), 13.4% (111 mg/L) or 10% (185 mg/L), 26.5% (148 mg/L) or 8.1% (18.5 mg/L), 40% (18.5 mg/L) or 13.4% (111 mg/L), and 5% (70 mg/L) or 5% (70 mg/L), respectively.

AB In this work graphene was used for evaluation of its adsorption behavior and performance in removing phthalate esters and pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater. Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), acetaminophen (ACE), caffeine (CAF), cephalexin (CLX), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were emerging contaminants (ECs) with detection frequencies over 92% in a one-year monitoring of the occurrence of ECs in influent samples of a sewage treatment plant in Taiwan. Thus, these ECs were selected as the target contaminants for removal by graphene adsorption process. Experimental results showed that the adsorption isotherm data were fitted well to Langmuir model equation. It was also found that the adsorption process obeyed the pseudosecond-order kinetics. A graphene dosage of 0.1 g/L and adsorption time of 12 h were found to be the optimal operating conditions for the ECs of concern in model solutions in a preliminary study. By using the determined optimal operating conditions for removal of such ECs in actual municipal wastewater, removal efficiencies for various ECs were obtained and given as follows: (1) DnBP, 89%, (2) DEHP, 86%, (3) ACE, 43%, (4) CAF, 84%, (5) CLX, 81%, and (6) SMX, 34%.

AB The occurrence and removal of seven selected pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in South India were investigated. The PCs selected for this study were sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), chloramphenicol (CAP), erythromycin (ERY), naproxen (NPX), bezafibrate (BZF), and ampicillin (AMP). Wastewater samples were collected from inlet and outlet of the STPs during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to investigate the seasonal influences in occurrence and removal rates. The analytical method was based on simultaneous extraction of all target compounds by solid phase extraction (SPE), using a hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB) sorbent followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The STP that catered exclusively to domestic wastewater had lesser concentrations of PCs compared to the STPs serving the combined hospital and domestic effluents. SMX was the dominant compound in all effluents with the highest concentration at 3.2 mu g/L in the outlet of an STP. TMP and ERY were the other PCs present at higher concentrations in STP outlets (1 mu g/L and 0-0.13 mu g/L, respectively). Removal rates varied from 100 % for BZF to 60-100 % for SMX, CTX, and AMP.

AB In the present work, the use of magnetic mesoporous silica microbeads (MMSMB) as supports was proposed to produce magnetically-separable cross-linked enzyme aggregates (MCLEAs). The effects of cross linking time, addition of bovine serum albumin as protein feeder, pH, glutaraldehyde concentration, and laccase:MMSMB mass ratio on the immobilization yield and enzyme load were investigated. The best conditions allowed the rapid preparation of MCLEAs with high enzyme load, i.e., 1.53 U laccase/mg MCLEAs. The stability of MCLEAs was improved with regard to low pH, presence of chemical denaturants, and real wastewater matrix, compared to free laccase. In addition, the novel biocatalyst exhibited good operational stability, maintaining up to 70 % of its initial activity after 10 successive batch reactions. Finally, MCLEAs demonstrated its catalytic potential to transform acetaminophen and various non-phenolic pharmaceutical active compounds as mefenamic acid, fenofibrate, and indomethacin from biologically treated wastewater effluent, with similar or even higher efficiency than free laccase.

AB This study determined the fate of triclosan, a prevalent wastewater contaminant in recycled waters and surface streams, when soil and crop plants were irrigated at environmentally relevant concentrations. Soil triclosan concentrations were monitored in an 8-wk and in a 16-wk study without plants to determine triclosan degradation. Onion (Allium oschaninii O. Fedtsch.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were assessed for growth and triclosan accumulation at four levels of triclosan exposure (0, 0.015, 0.15, and 1.5 mu g L-1) in irrigation waters within ranges of those found in recycled waters and associated receiving streams. Onions were grown for 8 wk and tomatoes were grown for 8 wk (short-term study) and 12 wk (long-term study) in potting soil. Soil triclosan concentrations increased (5-fold) with triclosan levels applied to soils alone. With repeated application, the half-life of triclosan was 18 d, with low-level accumulation in soil. Bioaccumulation of triclosan was observed in all edible portions of onions (115-435 ng g(-1)), primarily in bulbs, with no discernible impact on biomass. In both short-and long-term tomato studies, triclosan translocated to shoots and fruits (approaching a translocation factor of 1) at the highest level examined. Even at low triclosan concentrations typically found in recycled waters and receiving streams, agricultural irrigation presents an additional exposure route for organic contaminants to humans via commercial crops. Our study indicates that bulb crops, in particular, would likely accumulate high levels of triclosan. However, concentrations detected in both onions and tomato fruits determined here are below current human exposure limits.

AB Pharmaceutical drugs are continuously discharged into the aquatic environment primarily through wastewater discharge; therefore, their possible effects on wildlife is a reason of concern. Diazepam is a widely prescribed benzodiazepine drug used to treat insomnia and anxiety disorders, and it has been found in wastewater effluents worldwide. The present study tested the effects of diazepam on fecundity and the reproductive behavior of the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, a fish that exhibits male parental care. Sexually mature fathead minnows were housed at a ratio of one male and two females per tank and exposed to nominal (measured) concentrations of 0, 0.1 (0.14 +/- 0.06), 1.0 (1.04 +/- 0.15), 10 (13.4 +/- 1.5) mu g L-1 for 21 days. Fish receiving the low diazepam treatment had significantly larger clutches than fish receiving the highest concentration but neither were different from controls. Diazepam exposure was not associated with a significant change in fertilization rate, hatchability or time to hatch, but a trend toward a higher number of eggs/day was observed in fish exposed to the low diazepam concentration relative to those exposed to the medium concentration. There were no significant differences in any of the behaviors analyzed when responses were averaged over time. The results showed that exposure to diazepam at concentrations as high as 13 mu g L-1 did not significantly impact the reproductive behavior of fathead minnow. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The degradation of 0.20 mM sulfamethazine (SMT) solutions was investigated by heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process using pyrite as source of Fe2+ (catalyst) and pH regulator in an undivided electro-chemical cell equipped either with a Pt or a BDD anode and carbon-felt as cathode. Effect of pyrite concentration and applied current on the oxidative degradation kinetics and mineralization efficiency has been studied. The higher oxidation power of the process, named "Pyrite-EF" using BDD anode was demonstrated. Pyrite-EF showed a better performance for the oxidation/mineralization of the drug SMT in comparison to the classic EF process: 95% and 87% TOC removal by Pyrite-EF with BDD and Pt anodes, respectively, versus 90% and 83% by classical EF with BDD and Pt anodes, respectively. The rate constant of the oxidation of SMT by (OH)-O-center dot was determined by the competition kinetics method and found to be 1.87 x 10(9) mol(-1) L s(-1). Based on the identified reaction intermediates by HPLC and GS-MS, as well as released SO42-, NH4+ and NO3- ions, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed for the mineralization of SMT during Pyrite-EF process. Toxicity assessment by means of Microtox method revealed the formation of some toxic intermediates during the treatment. However, toxicity of the solution was removed at the end of treatment.

AB The efficiency of wastewater ozonation for the abatement of three nitrogen-containing pharmaceuticals, two antihistamine drugs, cetirizine (CTR) and fexofenadine (FXF), and the diuretic drug, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was investigated. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reactions of the molecular, protonated (CTR, FXF) or deprotonated (HCTZ) forms of these compounds with ozone were determined. All three compounds are very reactive with ozone (apparent second order rate constants at pH 7: k(03,pH7) = 1.7.10(5) M(-1)s(-1), 8.5.10(4) M(-1)s(-1) and 9.0.10(3) M(-1)s(-1) for CTR, HCTZ and FXF, respectively). Transformation product (TP) structures were elucidated using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including isotope-labeled standards. For cetirizine and hydrochlorothiazide 8 TPs each and for fexofenadine 7 TPs were identified. The main TPs of cetirizine and fexofenadine are their respective N-oxides, whereas chlorothiazide forms to almost 100% from hydrochlorothiazide. In the bacteria bioluminescence assay the toxicity was slightly increased only during the ozonation of cetirizine at very high cetirizine concentrations. The main TPs detected in bench-scale experiments were also detected in full-scale ozonation of a municipal wastewater, for >90% elimination of the parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment is essential to ensure the ecological health of the receiving water bodies. Ozonation is a promising technology to achieve this purpose but important wastewater characteristics affecting the optimal removal efficiency need to be elucidated. Secondary effluents contain effluent organic matter (EfOM), which can react directly with ozone as well as react as the initiator, promoter and inhibitor in the hydroxyl radical (.OH) chain reactions resulting from ozone decomposition. These different reaction modes of EfOM, coupled with alkalinity and pH value, collectively determine the ozone and .OH exposures and the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds by ozonation. In this study, we determined the rate constants of EfOM collected from two municipal wastewater treatment plants in terms of direct ozone reaction, initiation, promotion and inhibition at various pH values (pH 6.0-7.5) and temperatures (10-30 degrees C). The rate constants of direct reaction and initiation generally increased with the increasing pH value while the rate constants of promotion and inhibition did not vary significantly. All rate constants increased with the increasing temperature. The removal of ibuprofen, acetylsulfamethoxazole and metoprolol in diluted secondary effluent by ozonation can be fairly-well modeled by using the determined rate constants of EfOM.

AB The occurrence and fate of 50 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in the surface water of Jiulong River estuary in the southeast of China in spring, wet season, summer, autumn and winter. Results demonstrated a wide distribution of PPCPs in Jiulong River estuary, where 34 PPCPs were detected at least once and 5 PPCPs were detected in all the samples, including caffeine, diclofenac, metoprolol, methyl paraben, and propyl paraben. Spatial and seasonal variations were observed. Special emphasis was placed on the PPCP fate in the estuary. Most PPCPs showed a non conservative behavior in the estuary, while the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bisphenol A showed a pseudo-conservative behavior. The non-conservative and pseudo-conservative behavior was attributed to the combination of the seawater dilution, the introduction of PPCPs via the sewage water, and the physical, chemical, or biological removal processes. Furthermore, PPCP concentrations showed drastic variations in the turbidity maximum zones. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to indicate the pseudo-conservative behavior of PPCPs in the estuary, and to show the drastic variations of PPCPs in the turbidity maximum zone. In addition, the ratio of labile to conservative PPCPs was calculated to track the source of untreated sewage contamination. Results showed a significantly higher ratio compared to the average value in WWTP effluents, indicating the ubiquitous discharge of untreated domestic wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. In addition, the high ratio of bisphenol A to conservative PPCPs implied the potential input of untreated industrial wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 16S rRNA gene multiplex 454 pyrosequencing approach was used to characterize the structure of the bacterial community in subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with Typha angustifoha and unplanted wetland mesocosms receiving ibuprofen-enriched wastewater at a concentration of 250 mu g L-1. The removal efficiency of ibuprofen (IBP) in the planted beds (78.5%) was significantly higher than that in the unplanted beds (57.9%) (P <= 0.05). The presence of ibuprofen significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced the diversity of the bacterial community. In total, 20 phyla comprising 265 genera were identified. The most predominant phyla were Firmicutes (27.6%), Actinobacteria (26.0%) and Proteobacteria (24.9%), making up 57-95% of the 16S rDNA sequences. Other dominating phyla in wetland soils were Chloroflexi (7.3%), Bacteroidetes (2.7%), Synergistetes (2.1%), and Acidobacteria (2.0%). A distinct profile of bacterial community in the wetland mesocosms was observed after IBP enrichment. IBP-enrichment enhanced the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacilli and gamma-Proteobacteria at class level. The efficient ibuprofen removal observed in this study suggested that the IBP-enriched wetland systems may have selected a restricted group of bacteria that was able to survive best in the disturbed condition and participate in the IBP biodegradation. Our findings also indicated that the presence of macrophytes may have a vital impact on the microbial community and planted wetlands may be more robust and buffered against significant shifts in microbial composition in response to IBP-disturbance.

AB BACKGROUNDThe environmental and health effects caused by oxytetracycline (OTC) contamination of aquatic systems are a serious problem throughout the world. The OTC-contaminated wastewater cannot be treated effectively by conventional anaerobic and aerobic biological treatments. Few studies have investigated the systematic treatment of OTC-contaminated wastewater.
   RESULTSA system including micro-electrolysis (ME), an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and an anoxic/oxic activated sludge process (A/O) could treat OTC production wastewater effectively. First, a ME reactor packed with new ceramic-corrosion-cell fillers, serving as a pretreatment step, was effective in removing residual OTC and enhancing biodegradability of the wastewater. Second, EGSB and A/O reactors played the main role in removing chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and chroma (color of the wastewater). After reaching steady state, the coupled ME-EGSB-A/O system removed more than 95.0% of COD, 90.0% of NH3-N and 80.0% of color, and the final effluent met the requirements of the national discharge standard (COD 500 mg L-1, NH3-N 45 mg L-1 and chroma 70; CJ 343-2010, China).
   CONCLUSIONThe coupled ME-EGSB-A/O system could treat the OTC production wastewater effectively. These findings have significant implications for a cost-efficient system in OTC production systematic treatment. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB BACKGROUNDTetracycline (TC), a group of broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotics, has been detected in wastewater at concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to mg L-1. However, low biodegradation efficiencies of TC, especially at high concentrations, were obtained in conventional activated sludge processes. This study aimed to investigate the biodegradation and behavior of TC at high concentrations in an enriched mixed culture system.
   RESULTHigh TC removal efficiencies of 83.6 4.3% and 93.2 +/- 2.2% were obtained in two reactors with the addition of TC at 10 mg L-1 and 1 mg L-1, respectively. In the presence of TC, activated sludge floc size kept increasing and aggregation phenomena were observed. In addition, TC exposure decreased the microbial diversity and enriched the dominant bacteria. These effects were more prominent with higher TC concentration.
   CONCLUSIONTC at high concentrations could be effectively removed in enriched mixed culture, and biodegradation was the primary mechanism. TC induced the aggregation of activated sludge and the effect was more prominent under higher TC stress. The TC exposure affected the microbial communities of activated sludge, resulting in a decrease in microbial diversity and the enrichment of dominant bacteria. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Ubiquitous occurrence of several pharmaceuticals in discharged sewage effluents has lead to considerable deterioration of life and quality of receiving water bodies. Ibuprofen, an acidic nonsteroid drug, is one such pharmaceutical being widely used for its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The present work investigated the efficiency of graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) in adsorption of Ibuprofen from its aqueous solutions. The GONPs were characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze changes in structure and morphology occurring due to adsorption (if any). The impact of various process parameters on percentage removal (%) of Ibuprofen was determined by batch adsorption experiments. The data obtained were subjected to isotherm and kinetic analysis in order to describe the distribution of ibuprofen between the liquid and solid phases in the batch studies. The results obtained best fitted the Langmuir isotherm model and were determined to be guided by pseudo second-order kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibb's free energy, Enthalpy and Entropy were also evaluated and the results revealed the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the process of adsorption of ibuprofen onto graphene oxide. Hence, graphene oxide may be considered as a suitable adsorbent for large scale efficient treatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen and similar other anti-inflammatory drugs.

AB The occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of 26 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were evaluated in 68 water samples in 2011-2012 in the Zumbro River watershed, Minnesota, U.S.A. Samples were collected across a range of seasonal/hydrological conditions from four stream sites that varied in associated land use and presence of an upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Selected CECs included human/veterinary pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, phytoestrogens, and commercial/industrial compounds. Detection frequencies and concentrations varied, with atrazine, metolachlor, acetaminophen, caffeine, DEET, and trimethoprim detected in more than 70% of samples, acetochlor, mecoprop, carbamazepine, and daidzein detected in 30%-50% of samples, and 4-nonylphenol, cotinine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, tylosin, and carbaryl detected in 10%-30% of samples. The remaining target CECs were not detected in water samples. Three land use-associated trends were observed for the detected CECs. Carbamazepine, 4-nonylphenol, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, tylosin, and carbaryl profiles were WWTP-dominated, as demonstrated by more consistent loading and significantly greater concentrations downstream of the WWTP and during low-flow seasons. In contrast, acetaminophen, trimethoprim, DEET, caffeine, cotinine, and mecoprop patterns demonstrated both seasonally-variable non-WWTP-associated and continual WWTP-associated influences. Surface water studies of CECs often target areas near WWTPs. This study suggests that several CECs often characterized as effluent-associated have additional important sources such as septic systems or land-applied biosolids. Finally, agricultural herbicide ( atrazine, acetochlor, and metolachlor) profiles were strongly influenced by agricultural land use and seasonal application-runoff, evident by significantly greater concentrations and loadings at upstream sites and in early summer when application and precipitation rates are greatest. Our results indicate that CEC monitoring studies should consider a range of land uses, seasonality, and transport pathways in relation to concentrations and loadings. This knowledge can augment CEC monitoring programs to result in more accurate source, occurrence, and ecological risk characterizations, more precisely targeted mitigation initiatives, and ultimately, enhanced environmental decision-making.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation was employed for the first time in continuous mode with TiO2-coated glass Raschig rings and light emitting diodes (LEDs) to treat urban wastewater as well as surface water collected from the supply area of a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Different levels of contamination and types of contaminants were considered in this work, including chemical priority substances (PSs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), as well as potential human opportunistic antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes (ARB&ARG). Photocatalytic ozonation was more effective than single ozonation (or even than TiO2 catalytic ozonation) in the degradation of typical reaction by-products (such as oxalic acid), and more effective than photocatalysis to remove the parent micro pollutants determined in urban wastewater. In fact, only fluoxetine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were detected after photocatalytic ozonation, by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) pre-concentration and LC-MS/MS analysis. In surface water, this treatment allowed the removal of all determined micropollutants to levels below the limit of detection (0.01-0.20 ng L-1). The efficiency of this process was then assessed based on the capacity to remove different groups of cultivable microorganisms and housekeeping (16S rRNA) and antibiotic resistance or related genes (intl1, blaTEM, qnrS, sul1). Photocatalytic ozonation was observed to efficiently remove microorganisms and ARGs. Although after storage total heterotrophic and ARB (to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem), fungi, and the genes 16S rRNA and intl1, increased to values close to the pre-treatment levels, the ARGs (blaTEM, qnrS and sul1) were reduced to levels below/close to the quantification limit even after 3-days storage of treated surface water or wastewater. Yeast estrogen screen (YES), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were also performed before and after photo catalytic ozonation to evaluate the potential estrogenic activity, the cellular metabolic activity and the cell viability. Compounds with estrogenic effects and significant differences concerning cell viability were not observed in any case. A slight cytotoxicity was only detected for Caco-2 and hCMEC/D3 cell lines after treatment of the urban wastewater, but not for L929 fibroblasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water samples from Vietnam, The Philippines, and Myanmar were analyzed for artificial sweeteners (ASs) and iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICMs). High concentrations (low micrograms per liter) of ASs, including aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, were found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from Vietnam. Three ICMs, iohexol, iopamidol, and iopromide were detected in Vietnamese WWTP influents and effluents, suggesting that these ICMs are frequently used in Vietnam. ASs and ICMs were found in river water from downtown Hanoi at concentrations comparable to or lower than the concentrations in WWTP influents. The ASs and ICMs concentrations in WWTP influents and adjacent surface water significantly correlated (r (2) = 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting that household wastewater is discharged directly into rivers in Vietnam. Acesulfame was frequently detected in northern Vietnamese groundwater, but the concentrations varied spatially by one order of magnitude even though the sampling points were very close together. This implies that poorly performing domestic septic tanks sporadically leak household wastewater into groundwater. High acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose concentrations were found in surface water from Manila, The Philippines. The sucralose concentrations were one order of magnitude higher in the Manila samples than in the Vietnamese samples, indicating that more sucralose is used in The Philippines than in Vietnam. Acesulfame and cyclamate were found in surface water from Pathein (rural) and Yangon (urban) in Myanmar, but no ICMs were found in the samples. The ASs concentrations were two-three orders of magnitude lower in the samples from Myanmar than in the samples from Vietnam and The Philippines, suggesting that different amounts of ASs are used in these countries. We believe this is the first report of persistent ASs and ICMs having ubiquitous distributions in economically emerging South Asian countries.

AB In this study, the preloading effects of different fractions of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the adsorption of trace-level pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) onto granular activated carbon (GAC) were investigated. A nanofiltration (NF) membrane was employed to separate the EfOM by size, and two GACs with distinct pore structures were chosen for comparison. The results showed that preloading with EfOM substantially decreased PhAC uptake of the GACs; however, comparable PhAC adsorption capacities were achieved on GACs preloaded by feed EfOM and the NF-permeating EfOM. This indicates that: (1) the NF-rejected, larger EfOM molecules with an expectation to block the PhAC adsorption pores exerted little impact on the adsorbability of PhACs; (2) the smaller EfOM molecules present in the NF permeate contributed mainly to the decrease in PhAC uptake, mostly due to site competition. Of the two examined GACs, the wide pore-size-distributed GAC was found to be more susceptible to EfOM preloading than the microporous GAC. Furthermore, among the fourteen investigated PhACs, the negatively charged hydrophilic PhACs were generally subjected to a greater EfOM preloading impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An industrial wastewater effluent coming from a pharmaceutical laboratory has been treated in a semi industrial autonomous solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) plant. A photo-Fenton process assisted with ferrioxalate has been used. Up to 79% of TOC can be removed in 2 h depending on initial conditions when treating an aqueous effluent containing up to 400 ppm of initial organic carbon concentration (TOC). An initial ratio of Fe(II)/TOC higher than 0.5 guarantees a high removal.
   It can be seen that most of TOC removal occurs early in the first hour of reaction. After this time, mineralization was very slow, although H2O2 was still present in solution. Indeed it decomposed to form oxygen in inefficient reactions. It is clear that remaining TOC was mainly due to the presence of acetates which are difficult to degrade. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the endocrine disrupting effects of domestic wastewater on fish using the brackish medaka Oryzias melastigma as the animal model. Estuarine water samples were collected from Sihchong Creek and Baoli Creek estuaries, Taiwan, in March of 2012 to assess the whole effluent toxicity (WET) of domestic wastewater produced by the local residents and tourists. Chemical analysis detected various pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the field water samples. Some of these PPCPs are endocrine disrupting chemicals. In the laboratory-based bioassay, breeding pairs were exposed to the water samples (Sihchong, Baoli, and control) for 21 days. Cumulative number of eggs spawned was significantly higher in the Sihchong group. While fish swimming activity was not affected, sexual behavior of the male fish was significantly induced in both Sihchong and Baoli groups. Male and female gonad histology was not affected. Expression level of biomarker genes CYP1A1, HSP70, and VTG was significantly induced in the Sihchong group. This study indicates that the mixture of contaminants contained in the estuarine water may cause endocrine disrupting effects in fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated at a short hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 h for the treatment of hospital wastewater. The removals of eleven pharmaceutical compounds in MBR operated at different mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) level were investigated during which nitrification degree was differed. The results experiments revealed the importance of immediate adsorption onto the colloidal particles in supernatant of MBR sludge and subsequently removed by membrane filtration for the recalcitrant pharmaceutical compounds. Nevertheless, the removals through biodegradation during short HRT were also found significant for some compounds. DGGE profile revealed the development of pharmaceutical degrading microorganisms in MBR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The co-exposure to UV irradiation and free chlorine may occur in certain drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. This study investigated the effects of simultaneous low pressure ultraviolet (LPUV) irradiation and free chlorination on the formation of chloroform from triclosan which is a commonly used antibacterial agent. Different treatment systems (i.e., combined UV/chlorine, UV alone, and chlorine alone) were applied to examine the degradation of triclosan and formation of chloroform. The fate of representative intermediates, including chlorinated triclosan, dechlorinated triclosan intermediates and 2,4-dichlorophenol, were tracked to deduce the effect of combined UV/chlorine on the transformation of chloroform formation precursors. The relation between intermediates degradation and chloroform formation was investigated in depth by conducting stepwise experiments with UV and chlorine in different sequences. Results indicate that the combined UV/chlorine notably enhanced the chloroform formation from triclosan. From the reaction mechanism perspective the combined UV/chlorine, where the direct photolysis may play an important role, could accelerate the decay of intermediates and facilitate the generation of productive chloroform precursors. The radicals had modest influence on the degradation of triclosan and intermediates and partly hindered the formation of chloroform. These results emphasize the necessity of considering disinfection by-products formation in the application of combined UV/chlorine technology during water treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Anti-influenza drugs constitute a key component of pandemic preparedness plans against influenza. However, the occurrence of such drugs in water environments, the potential of resistance development in the natural hosts, and the risk for transmission of antiviral resistance to humans call for measures to increase removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, removal of three anti-influenza drugs; amantadine (AM), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and zanamivir (ZA), and formation/removal of their transformation products during ozonation of wastewater effluents from two Swedish WWTPs in Uppsala and Stockholm were studied. The removal profile of target antivirals and formation/removal of their transformation products were studied by liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. 3.5 h of ozone exposure (total dose of ozone 5.95 g) led to complete removal of the three anti-influenza drugs with a degradation in the following order ZA > OC > AM. Two, five and one transformation products were identified and semi-quantified for AM, OC and ZA, respectively. Increasing and later decreasing transformation products concentration followed the decrease in concentration of target compounds. All transformation products detected, except one of AM in wastewater from Stockholm WWTP, were removed at the end of the experiment. The removal efficiency was higher for all studied compounds in wastewater from Uppsala WWTP, which had lower TOC and COD values, less phosphorus, and also higher pH in the water. Ozonation thus offers multiple benefits through its potential to degrade influenza antivirals, hence decrease the risk of environmental resistance development, in addition to degrading other pharmaceuticals and resistant microorganisms.

AB A comparative analysis of photocatalytic efficiency has been carried out with both TiO2 P25 and a home-made catalyst at a solar radiation pilot plant constituted by Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) systems. The effect of the chemical nature of three different substrates (phenol, dichloroacetic acid and pyrimethanil) and the impact of inorganic ions in natural waters, on their final photo-efficiencies was also analyzed. Subsequently, this solar photocatalytic process was applied to the photodegradation of a mixture of emerging contaminants considering the separation and recovery of catalysts by sedimentation. Although TiO2 P25 showed better results during phenol and dichloroacetic acid photodegradation, both photocatalysts presented similar photo-efficiencies in pyrimethanil mineralization and, specially, in the treatment of emerging pollutants. The presence of high concentrations of inorganic ions in natural waters constitutes a limiting factor for solar photocatalytic activity, but this process successfully photodegraded the mixture of micropollutants (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, flumequine) in natural water matrix using both TiO2 catalysts, at very short irradiation times (t(30w) < 35 min). Therefore, solar assisted heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a very efficient, promising and competitive AOP to remove emerging contaminants like the pharmaceutical micropollutants studied here and frequently detected in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants.

AB This study evaluated the link between anaerobic bacterial diversity and, the biodegradation of antibiotic combinations and assessed how amending antibiotic combination and increasing concentration of antibiotics in a stepwise fashion influences the development of resistance genes in anaerobic reactors. The biodegradation, sorption and occurrence of the known antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of erythromycin and tetracycline were investigated using the processes of UV-HPLC and qPCR analysis respectively. Ion Torrent sequencing was used to detect microbial community changes in response to the addition of antibiotics. The overall results indicated that changes in the structure of a microbial community lead to changes in biodegradation capacity, sorption of antibiotics combinations and occurrence of ARGs. The enhanced biodegradation efficiency appeared to generate variations in the structure of the bacterial community. The results suggested that controlling the ultimate Gram-negative bacterial community, especially Acinetobacter-related populations, may promote the successful biodegradation of antibiotic combinations and reduce the occurrence of ARGs.

AB Chlorine disinfection of wastewater was investigated to determine the reaction rate constant of the disinfection process at the Kanapaha Water Reclamation Facility in Gainesville, FL. Chlorine reactions with wastewater occurred in the contact basin, and they could be characterized by partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition to the difficulties of the solution of these PDEs, the determination of the reaction rate constant of chlorine disinfection is also difficult because of complex reactions with ammonia and the dynamic behavior of wastewater. These vary depending on the influent ammonia concentration, chlorine dosage, and wastewater content and flow rate. A method of characteristics and an odometric transformation technique were applied to these equations to more easily obtain a solution. The method of characteristics is a mathematical solution technique that transforms a PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Because the disinfection reaction also has a large and variable time delay, the odometric transformation technique was introduced to eliminate this obstacle. The application of these mathematical solution and transformation techniques converted the dynamics of the system into a constant time-delay model and a set of ODEs. To validate the model and determine the reaction rate constant by simulation, the resulting equations were coded in Matlab and solved numerically. The validation was performed by a comparison of the simulated response of the developed model with the experimental data using Matlab software packages. The validation criterion was the obtainment of the highest fit (%) for the simulated result. The simulation results revealed that the fit (%) was the highest when the reaction rate constant was 0.0074h(-1).

AB Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with peroxy chemicals, such as H2O2 and peroxydisulfate (PDS), have been considered potentially highly effective disinfection processes. This study investigated the inactivation of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores as surrogates for pathogens under UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS conditions, with the aim to provide further understanding of UV-based advanced disinfection processes (ADPs). Results showed that one additional log of inactivation of E. coli was achieved with 0.3 mM H2O2 or PDS at 5.2 X 10(-5) Einstein.L-1 photo fluence (at 254 nm) compared with UV irradiation alone. Addition of H2O2 and PDS greatly enhanced the inactivation rate of MS2 by around 15 folds and 3 folds, respectively, whereas the inactivation of B. subtilis spores was slightly enhanced. Reactive species responsible for the inactivation were identified to be center dot OH, SO4 center dot-, and CO3 center dot- based on manipulation of solution conditions. The CT value of each reactive species was calculated with respect to each microbial surrogate, which showed that the disinfection efficacy ranked as center dot OH > SO4 center dot- > CO3 center dot->> O-2(center dot-)/HO2-. A comprehensive dynamic model was developed and successfully predicted the inactivation of the microbial surrogates in surface water and wastewater matrices. The concepts of UV-efficiency and EE/O were employed to provide a cost-effective evaluation for UV-based ADPs. Overall, the present study suggests that it will be beneficial to upgrade UV disinfection to UV/H2O2 ADP for the inactivation of viral pathogens.

AB Fresh water scarcity has led to increased use of reclaimed wastewater as an alternative and reliable source for crop irrigation. Beyond microbiological safety, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of reclaimed wastewater by xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug which is ubiquitously detected in reclaimed wastewater, highly persistent in soil, and taken up by crops. In a randomized controlled trial we demonstrate that healthy individuals consuming reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce excreted carbamazepine and its metabolites in their urine, while subjects consuming fresh water-irrigated produce excreted undetectable or significantly lower levels of carbamazepine. We also report that the carbamazepine metabolite pattern at this low exposure level differed from that observed at therapeutic doses. This "proof of concept" study demonstrates that human exposure to xenobiotics occurs through ingestion of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce, providing real world data which could guide risk assessments and policy designed to ensure the safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation.

Reverse osmosis and tight nanofiltration membranes (MW cutoff < 200 Da) are treatment technologies that demonstrate high removal of many compounds, but at relatively high energy costs. Looser membranes (>200 Da) may provide sufficient removal of a wide range of contaminants with lower energy costs. This study examined the rejection of pharmaceuticals that are known NDMA precursors (similar to 300 Da) using nanofiltration (MW cutoff 350 Da). MQ water was compared to two raw water sources, and results illustrated that NDMA precursors (as estimated by formation potential testing) were effectively rejected in all water matrices (>84%). Mixtures of pharmaceuticals vs. single-spiked compounds were found to have no impact on rejection from the membranes used. The use of MQ water vs. surface waters illustrated that natural organic matter, colloids, and inorganic ions present did not significantly impact the rejection of the amine-containing pharmaceuticals. This study illustrates that NDMA formation potential testing can be effectively used for assessing NDMA precursor rejection from more complex samples with multiple and/or unknown NDMA precursors present, such as wastewater matrices.

AB Ozonation aimed at removing pharmaceuticals was studied in an effluent from an experimental pilot system using staged moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) tanks for the optimal biological treatment of wastewater from a medical care unit of Aarhus University Hospital. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH in samples varied considerably, and the effect of these two parameters on ozone lifetime and the efficiency of ozone in removing pharmaceuticals were determined. The pH in the effluent varied from 5.0 to 9.0 resulting in approximately a doubling of the required ozone dose at the highest pH for each pharmaceutical. DOC varied from 6 to 20 mg-DOC/L. The ozone required for removing each pharmaceutical, varied linearly with DOC and thus, ozone doses normalized to DOC (specific ozone dose) agreed between water samples (typically within 15%). At neutral pH the specific ozone dose required to remove the easiest degradable pharmaceutical, sulfadiazine, was 0.50 +/- 0.04 mg-O-3/mg-DOC and the most recalcitrant, diatrizoic acid, required 4.7 +/- 0.6 mg-O-3/mg-DOC. The lifetime of ozone increased drastically in the higher end of the indicated dosage. At the lowest observed pH of 5.0, its lifetime was quadrupled to 20 min which influences the design of the reaction tank. The addition of 0.1 mg-H2O2 per 1 mg-O-3 mitigated the prolonged lifetime without a corresponding influence in the pharmaceutical removal efficiency of ozone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Persulfate oxidation processes, with and without activation using ultraviolet light (respectively UV/PS and PS) have the potential to degrade anthropogenic chemicals in water. However, little is known about the impact of PS or UV/PS pre-oxidation on downstream formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). In this study the three antibiotic chloramphenicols (chloramphenicol and two of its analogues [thiamphenicol and florfenicol], referred to collectively as CAPs), which frequently occur in wastewater-impacted source waters used by drinking water treatment plants, were selected as model antibiotic compounds. The formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection by-products, including halomethanes, haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes, during chlorination and chloramination preceded by PS and UV/PS was investigated. No significant concentrations of haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes were detected during chlorination. During chloramination chloramphenicol formed a considerable amount of dichloronitromethane (e.g., 3.44 +/- 0.33% mol/mol at NH2Cl dose = 1 mM) and trichloronitromethane (e.g., 0.79 +/- 0.07% mol/mol at NH2Cl dose = 1 mM), compared with THM and HAN formation. PS pre-oxidation achieved a statistically significant reduction in trichloromethane formation from chlorination, and in HAN and HNM formation from chloramination. Although UV/PS slightly increased dichloroacetonitrile formation during chloramination, it significantly decreased dichloronitromethane and trichloronitromethane formation during chloramination. Overall, the use of PS and IN/PS has the potential to have contrasting impacts on DBP formation in heavily wastewater-impacted waters, depending on the disinfection method. Hence, their application needs to be carefully balanced against the downstream effect on DBP formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment of primary wastewater effluent containing a mixture of nine pharmaceuticals model compounds (acetaminophen ACM, antipyrine ANT, caffeine CAF, ketorolac KET, metoprolol MET, sulfamethoxazole SFX, carbamazepine CARB, hydrochlorothiazide HCT and diclofenac DIC) has been carried out by means of aerobic biodegradation followed by different advanced oxidation processes (solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation). Only ACM and CAF were completely removed from municipal wastewater in aerobic biological experiments. Apparently, the bacteriostatic nature of SFX could lead to some extent to bacterial growth inhibition. Photocatalytic ozonation allows for a higher degradation rate than simple photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of oxygen. Under the conditions investigated, emerging compounds (ECs) degradation (sum of concentrations) in the photocatalytic ozonation was in the range 80-100% depending on the system. Application of solar light (SL) Fe(III) photocatalytic ozonation, SL/O-3/Fe (III) (180 min) and ozonation (45 min) systems reduced the concentrations of the studied emerging contaminants below their detection limit (2 mu g L-1). Nevertheless, photocatalytic ozonation led to 41.3% mineralization compared to 34% achieved by single ozonation. Toxicity analyses by Daphnia magna showed no effluent toxicity after the application of the three tertiary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in the removal of micropollutants from a wastewater treatment plant effluent was evaluated at mesocosm level. Fifteen mesocosms were studied following a modified Latin Square experimental design with six additional points. Three variables at three levels were studied: porous media -PM- (river gravel, fine volcanic gravel and coarse volcanic gravel), macrophyte type -M- (Thypa latiffolia, Phragmites australis, and Cyperus papyrus) and hydraulic retention time -HRT- (1, 3 and 5 days). As response variables the removal percentages of the total organic load of the effluent (BOD5) and the loads of several micropollutants (caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide, alkylphenols and their monoethoxylates and diethoxylates, methyl dihydrojasmonate, sunscreen UV-15 and parsol) were used. The results showed that the systems remove between 70% and 75% of the organic load and that all the micropollutants were degraded at different extents, from 55% to 99%. The HRT was the variable that showed major effects on the treatment process, while M and PM showed no statistically significant differences in the used experimental conditions.

AB Trace organic chemical (TrOC) contaminants are of concern for finished water from water recycling schemes because of their potential adverse environmental and public health effects. Understanding the impacts of seasonal variations on fate and removal of TrOCs is important for proper operation, risk assessment and management of treatment systems for water recycling such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Accordingly, this study investigated the fate and removal of a wide range of TrOCs through a full-scale MBR plant during summer and winter seasons. TrOCs included 12 steroidal hormones, 3 xeno-estrogens, 2 pesticides and 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Seasonal differences in the mechanisms responsible for removing some of the TrOCs were evident. In particular the contribution of biotransformation and biomass adsorption to the overall removal of estrone, bisphenol A, 1713-estradiol and triclosan were consistently different between the two seasons. Substantially higher percentage removal via biotransformation was observed during the summer sampling peiiod, which compensated for a reduction in removal attributed to biomass adsorption. The opposite was observed during winter, where the contribution of biotransformation to the overall removal of these TrOCs had decreased, which was offset by an improvement in biomass adsorption. The exact mechanisms responsible for this shift are unknown, however are likely to be temperature related as warmer temperatures can lower sorption efficiency, yet enhance biotransformation of these TrOCs.

AB A model was developed to assess the impact of adding acids and bases to processed municipal sewage sludge (MSS) to mobilize contaminants, facilitating their removal from sludge by flushing prior to land application. Among 312 organic contaminants documented to occur in U.S. MSS, 71 or 23% were identified as ionizable organic contaminants (IOCs), contributing a disproportionately large fraction of 82% of the total mass of sludge borne contaminants. Detected IOCs included 57 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, 12 perfluorinated compounds, one surfactant and one pesticide. Annually, about 2000 t of IOCs were estimated to be released to U.S. soils via land-application of MSS. A partitioning model developed to assess the impact of pH on hydrophobic sorption revealed that between 36 and 85% of the mass of individual classes of IOCs potentially could be desorbed from MSS via pH adjustment and flushing. Thus, modeling results suggest that a sequential pH treatment [acidic (similar to pH 2) followed by basic (similar to pH 12) treatment] has the potential to reduce the burden of harmful IOCs in MSS applied on U.S. land by up to 40 +/- 16 t annually. This approach may serve as a cost-effective treatment process that can be implemented easily in existing sludge treatment infrastructure in the U.S. and worldwide, serving to significantly improve the quality of MSS destined for land application.

AB In this study, the efficacy of water treatment technologies: ultra-filtration (UF), powdered activated carbon (PAC), coagulation (COA) and a combination of these technologies (PAC/UF and COA/UF) to remove target pharmaceuticals (Acetaminophen, Bezafibrate, Caffeine, Carbamazepine, Cotinine, Diclofenac, Gemfibrozil, Ibuprofen, Metoprolol, Naproxen, Sulfadimethoxine, Sulfamethazine, Sulfamethoxazole, Sulfathiazole, Triclosan and Trimethoprim) was investigated. Samples of wastewater from municipal WWTPs were analyzed using direct aqueous injection High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) detection. On concentration basis, results showed an average removal efficiency of 29%, 50%, and 7%, respectively, for the UF, PAC dosage of 50 ppm, and COA dosage of 10 ppm. When PAC dosage of 100 ppm was used as pretreatment to the combined PAC and UF in-line membrane system, a 90.3% removal efficiency was achieved. The removal efficiency of UF in tandem with COA was 33%, an increase of 4% compared with the single UF treatment. The adsorption effect of PAC combined with the physical separation process of UF revealed the best treatment strategy for removing pharmaceutical contaminant from water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Membrane filtration processes such as ultrafiltration are increasingly employed in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. However, these filtration processes are usually poor for removing low molecular weight organic and inorganic contaminants. Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF), where contaminants first partition into micellar phases prior to removal by ultrafiltration, has been shown to be an effective removal technique for a variety of trace contaminants in wastewater. To characterize or predict the removal efficiency of MEUF, it is important to have a quantitative measure of the extent to which a species is able to bind to a micelle as well as to develop an understanding of the dynamics of the binding interactions.
   Herein, we report micellar binding constants for a series of sulfonamide antibiotics (sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfacetamide, sulfaguanidine, and sulfanilamide) with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) micelles, as determined using a semi -equilibrium dialysis method. Sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole and sulfamethoxazole exhibited the strongest tendency to bind to CTABr micelles, indicating that they possessed greater potential for removal via MEUF than did sulfanilamide or sulfaguanidine, which displayed little affinity for binding with CTABr micelles.
   Linear free energy plots of LogK(B) (in CTABr) versus LogK(ow) and pK(a2) values indicated that there was a weak correlation between binding and LogK(ow) and a stronger correlation with pK(a2) for these compounds, likely reflecting the stronger binding of ionizable sulfonamide molecules in the anionic form by the cationic micelles.

AB A sensitive, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS; 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) was developed. Novel immunizing haptens were synthesized by derivatizing at the 4-Cl position of the TCS molecule. Compounds derived from substitutions at 4'-Cl and that replaced the 2'-OH with a Cl atom were designed as unique coaling antigen haptens. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were screened against the coating antigen library to identify combinations of immunoreagents resulting in the most sensitive assays. The most sensitive assay identified was one utilizing antiserum no. 1155 and a heterologous competitive hapten, where the 2'-OH group was substituted with a Cl atom. An IC50 value and the detection range for TCS in assay buffer were 1.19 and 0.21-6.71 mu g/L, respectively. The assay was selective for TCS, providing low cross-reactivity (<5%) to the major metabolites of TCS and to brominated diphenyl ether-47. A second assay utilizing a competitive hapten containing Br instead of Cl substitutions was broadly selective for both brominated and chlorinated diphenylethers. Using the most sensitive assay combination, we measured TCS concentrations in water samples following dilution. Biosolid samples were analyzed following the dilution of a simple solvent extract. The immunoassay results were similar to those determined by LC-MS/MS. This immunoassay can be used as a rapid and convenient tool to screen for human and environmental exposure.

AB Intentional or accidental release (direct disposal) of high loads of unused pharmaceuticals into wastewater can go unnoticed. Here, direct disposal of a pharmaceutical drug via the sewer network was identified for the first time using wastewater analysis. An irregularly high load of the antidepressant fluoxetine in raw wastewater (10.5 +/- 2.4 g d(-1)) was up to 11 times greater than any other day. National prescription data revealed a predicted daily fluoxetine load for the studied treatment works to be 0.4-1.6 g d(-1). Enantio-selective analysis showed the high load of fluoxetine was present as a racemic mixture, which is typical for fluoxetine in dispensed formulations. As fluoxetine undergoes stereoselective metabolism within the body, a racemic mixture in wastewater suggests a nonconsumed drug was the major contributor of the high load. This was confirmed by its major metabolite norfluoxetine whose load did not increase on this day. Considering the most commonly prescribed formulation of fluoxetine, this increased load accounts for the disposal of similar to 915 capsules. Furthermore, as fluoxetine is prescribed as one capsule per day, disposal is unlikely to be at the patient level. It is postulated that direct disposal was from a facility which handles larger quantities of the drug (e.g., a pharmacy).

AB Complete mineralisation of reaction intermediates refractory towards hydroxyl radical, generated from a previous ineffective degradation of urban wastewater containing antipyrine by HO center dot-mediated sonophoto-Fenton reaction, has been attained using persulfate anions simultaneously activated by heat energy (thermally, ultrasound) and UV-C light The SO4 center dot--based mineralisation process enables another reaction pathway generating more easy degradable derivatives. The influences of the initial concentration of persulfate, ultrasound amplitude, temperature and the reaction time in the previous HO center dot-based previous oxidation on the mineralisation degree were studied by using a Central-Composite Experimental Design. Under optimal conditions ([S2O82-](0) = 1200 mg L-1, temperature = 50 degrees C, amplitude = 10%, pH 2.8, HO center dot-based reaction time = 25 min) practically complete degradation was achieved in approximately 120 min. The contribution of HO center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals in this system was also evaluated. The presence of chloride ion in urban wastewater can benefit the oxidation of acetate by sulfate radical. Results demonstrated that this activated persulfate-based oxidation system is a potential alternative to degrade intermediate compounds, which are refractory against hydroxyl radicals, generated in Advanced Oxidation Processes used to treat wastewater containing emerging contaminants such as antipyrine.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents contain potentially neuroactive chemicals though few methods are available to screen for the presence of such agents. Here, two parallel approaches (in vivo and in vitro) were used to assess WWTP exposure-related changes to neurochemistry. First, fathead minnows (FHM, Pimephales promelas) were caged for four days along a WWTP discharge zone into the Maumee River (Ohio, USA). Grab water samples were collected and extracts obtained for the detection of alkylphenols, bisphenol A (BPA) and steroid hormones. Second, the extracts were then used as a source of in vitro exposure to brain tissues from FHM and four additional species relevant to the Great Lakes ecosystem (rainbow trout (RT), river otter (RO), bald eagle (BE) and human (HU)). The ability of the wastewater (in vivo) or extracts (in vitro) to interact with enzymes (monoamine oxidase (MAO) and glutamine synthetase (GS)) and receptors (dopamine (D2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)) involved in dopamine and glutamate-dependent neurotransmission were examined on brain homogenates. In vivo exposure of FHM led to significant decreases of NMDA receptor binding in females (24 -42%), and increases of MAO activity in males (2.8- to 3.2-fold). In vitro, alkylphenol-targeted extracts significantly inhibited D2 (66% in FHM) and NMDA (24-54% in HU and RT) receptor binding, and induced MAO activity in RT, RO, and BE brains. Steroid hormone-targeted extracts inhibited GS activity in all species except FHM. BPA-targeted extracts caused a MAO inhibition in FHM, RT and BE brains. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, this study shows that WWTP effluents contain agents that can interact with neurochemicals important in reproduction and other neurological functions. Additional work is needed to better resolve in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE) as well as cross-species differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although various PPCPs have been reported to be taken up by plants in laboratories or under field conditions, at present little information is available on their metabolism in plants. In this study, we applied carrot cell cultures to investigate the plant metabolism of PPCPs. Five phase I metabolites of carbamazepine were identified and the potential metabolism pathways of carbamazepine were proposed. We also used the carrot cell cultures as a rapid screening tool to initially assess the metabolism potentials of 18 PPCPs. Eleven PPCPs, including acetaminophen, caffeine, meprobamate, primidone, atenolol, trimethoprim, DEET, carbamazepine, dilantin, diazepam, and triclocarban, were found to be recalcitrant to metabolism. The other 7 PPCPs, including triclosan, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, sulfamethoxazole, and atorvastatin, displayed rapid metabolism, with 0.4-47.3% remaining in the culture at the end of the experiment. Further investigation using glycosidase hydrolysis showed that 13-20.6% of initially spiked naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil were transformed into glycoside conjugates. Results from this study showed that plant cell cultures may be a useful tool for initially exploring the potential metabolites of PPCPs in plants as well as for rapidly screening the metabolism potentials of a variety of PPCPs or other emerging contaminants, and therefore may be used for prioritizing compounds for further comprehensive evaluations.

AB Carbamazepine is one of the pharmaceutical compounds frequently detected in the receiving waters and water bodies. The main objective of this study was to develop a quadratic model to predict carbamazepine (CBZ) photocatalytic removal through a response surface methodology. A factorial plan (linear model; 24 experiments) was used to determine the contribution of individual factors (pH, CBZ concentration, photocatalyst concentration, and treatment time) and interactions among the factors. Pollutant concentration and treatment time were found to be the most important parameters influencing the oxidation rate, with respective contributions of 19.22 and 71.55 %. Central composite methodology was then applied to determine the optimal experimental parameters for CBZ oxidation. The highest percentage of CBZ removed was 94.67 +/- 0.51 %, recorded using a pH of 5, a minimal CBZ concentration of 10 mg/L, a photocatalyst concentration of 1.14 g/L, and a treatment time of 90 min. The effects of different anions (NO3- and SO42-) and cations (Cu2+, Cr3+, Zn2+) were also studied. Copper was found to have both catalytic and inhibitory effects on CBZ removal rate.

AB In this study, a new, more effective and cost-effective treatment alternative is investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant effluent (WWTP-eff). The potential of combining clay with biodegradable polymeric flocculants is further highlighted. Flocculation is viewed as the best method to get the optimum outcome from clay. In addition, flocculation with cationic starch increases the biodegradability and cost of the treatment. Clay is naturally abundantly available and relatively inexpensive compared to conventional adsorbents. Experimental studies were carried out with existing naturally occurring pharmaceutical concentrations found and measured in WWTP-eff with atrazine spiking for comparison between the demineralised water and WWTP-eff matrix. Around 70% of the total measured pharmaceutical compounds were removable by the clay-starch combination. The effect of clay with and without starch addition was also highlighted.

AB The presence of five selected pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and an antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, was determined at four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the receiving waterway in central Finland. The samples were taken from influents and effluents of the WWTPs and from surface water of six locations along the water way, including northern Lake Paijanne. In addition, seasonal variation in the area was determined by comparing the concentrations in the winter and summer. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations in the influents and effluents ranged from hundreds of nanogram per liter to microgram per liter while ranged from tens of nanogram per liter in northern parts of the waterway to hundreds of nanogram per liter in northern Lake Paijanne near the city area. In addition, the concentrations were higher in the winter compared to summer time in surface water due to decreased temperature and solar irradiation. On the other hand, higher concentrations of ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen were found in summer at the WWTPs, possibly due to seasonal variations in consumption. In conclusion, there are considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals not only in influents and effluents of the WWTPs but also in lake water along the waterway and in northern Lake Paijanne.

AB Antibiotics are among the most commonly used group of pharmaceuticals in human medicine. They can therefore reach surface and groundwater bodies through different routes, such as wastewater treatment plant effluents, surface runoff, or infiltration of water used for agricultural purposes. It is well known that antibiotics pose a significant risk to environmental and human health, even at low concentrations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of aminoglycosides and phenicol antibiotics in municipal wastewaters, sea water and pharmaceutical effluents in Tunisia. All analysed water samples contained detectable levels of aminoglycoside and phenicol antibiotics. The highest concentrations in wastewater influents were observed for neomycin and kanamycin B (16.4 ng mL(-1) and 7.5 ng mL(-1), respectively). Chloramphenicol was found in wastewater influents up to 3 ng mL(-1). It was observed that the waste water treatment plants were not efficient in completely removing these antibiotics. Chloramphenicol and florfenicol were found in sea water samples near aquaculture sites at levels up to, respectively, 15.6 ng mL(-1) and 18.4 ng mL(-1). Also aminoglycoside antibiotics were found near aquaculture sites with the highest concentration of 3.4 ng mL(-1) for streptomycin. In pharmaceutical effluents, only gentamycin was found at concentrations up to 19 ng mL(-1) over a sampling period of four months.

AB Aniline aerofloat (DDA) is a widely used material in China and has become a main pollutant in floatation wastewater. In this study, a membrane reactor (MBR) was constructed to continuously treat simulated wastewater contaminated with DDA. The study investigated the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the impact of influent DDA concentration on MBR performance, and analyzed intermediates from the DDA biodegradation pathway and activated sludge transfer pathway. The results showed that a 3 h HRT was an efficient and economical time period for MBR to remove 95 +/- 5 mg/L DDA from the simulated wastewater; the chemical oxygen demand reduction rate was 89.9%. DDA concentration negatively impacted MBR performance. MBR performance fluctuated slightly when HRT was 3 h, dissolved oxygen ranged from 4.8 to 5.3 mg/L, pH was between 6.5 and 7.0, and DDA concentrations were at 95 +/- 5 mg/L DDA. The transfer pathway in the activated sludge of DDA was through soluble microbial products, loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances, tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances, and finally cell biodegradation. DDA initially degraded to aniline; the aniline was further biodegraded to other organic compounds and was finally mineralized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This study offers a new continuous biological treatment technology to address DDA.

AB Pilot tests as basis for the design, implementation and operation of a future full-scale oxidation plant completing the existing sewage treatment in Linkoping, Sweden, were performed. Using an ozonation step between bio-sedimentation and post-denitrification processes, the primary goal was the removal of the highest priority substances to effluent water levels that will not cause adverse effects in the recipient considering the natural dilution. The study included initial emission screenings, dose control trials, treatment performance studies and eco-toxicity studies. At an ozone dose of 5 mg O-3/L, most substances could be removed. Ecotoxicological tests showed no negative effect for the tested ozone doses. High levels of oxygen into the denitrification could be rapidly reduced in the biology. The number of bacteria in the treated water could be significantly reduced even at relatively low ozone doses. Based on these results, the planning for the full-scale implementation of the treatment system was initiated in 2015.

Aerated batch reactors containing sterile, glucose-amended (5 g l(-1)) wastewater were inoculated, incubated for eight days, and then spiked with either 5 mg l(-1) of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), or a mixture of E2, atrazine (ATZ), bisphenol A (BPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), estrone (E1), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), oxybenzone (OBZ), and triclosan (TCS) to a final concentration of 350 mu g l(-1) each. Abiotic and heat-killed fungus controls were also prepared. EC and metabolite concentrations were measured over time using HPLC and Gas Chromatography coupled with Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). Estrogenic activity was measured on the same samples using the Yeast Estrogen Screen. In less than 5 h, active fungi decreased the concentration of E2 from 5 mg l(-1) to below detection, producing E1 as a metabolite and subsequently removing it from solution. Acting on the mixture of ECs, fungi removed BPA, E1, E2, and EE2 to a significant degree (62-100%) vs. controls (0-28%) in only 3.5 h, reducing the estrogenic activity of the mixture by 77% (vs. 4-8% for controls). After 12 h, the total reduction of estrogenic activity was greater than 98% (vs. 24-42% for controls). These results show that T versicolor NRRL 66313 can reduce the estrogenic activity of mixtures of estrogens and BPA, which are typically the most significant contributors to the hormone disrupting activity of domestic WWTP effluent.

AB Compost amendment on agricultural soil is a current practice to compensate the loss of organic matter. As a consequence, dissolved organic carbon concentration in soil leachates can be increased and potentially modify the transport of other solutes. This study aims to characterize the processes controlling the mobility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in deep soil layers and their potential impacts on the leaching of organic contaminants (pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds) potentially present in cultivated soils receiving organic waste composts. We sampled undisturbed soil cores in the illuviated horizon (60-90 cm depth) of an Albeluvisol. Percolation experiments were made in presence and absence of DOM with two different pesticides, isoproturon and epoxiconazole, and two pharmaceutical compounds, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. Two types of DOM were extracted from two different soil surface horizons: one sampled in a plot receiving a co-compost of green wastes and sewage sludge applied once every 2 years since 1998 and one sampled in an unamended plot. Results show that DOM behaved as a highly reactive solute, which was continuously generated within the soil columns during flow and increased after flow interruption. DOM significantly increased the mobility of bromide and all pollutants, but the effects differed according the hydrophobic and the ionic character of the molecules. However, no clear effects of the origin of DOM on the mobility of the different contaminants were observed.

AB This article investigates the ability of Pseudomonas peli to treat industrial pharmaceuticals wastewater (PW). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis revealed the presence, in this PW, of a variety of antibiotics such as sulfathiazole, sulfamoxole, norfloxacine, cloxacilline, doxycycline, and cefquinome. P. peli was very effective to be grown in PW and inducts a remarkable increase in chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand (140.31 and 148.51%, respectively). On the other hand, genotoxicity of the studied effluent, before and after 24 h of shaking incubation with P. peli, was evaluated in vivo in the Mediterranean wild mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation. Results show that PW exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.001) genotoxic effect in a dose-dependent manner; indeed, the percentage of genotoxicity was 122.6 and 49.5% after exposure to 0.66 ml/kg body weight (b.w.); 0.33 ml/kg b.w. of PW, respectively. However, genotoxicity decreased strongly when tested with the PW obtained after incubation with P. peli. We can conclude that using comet assay genotoxicity end points are useful tools to biomonitor the physicochemical and biological quality of water. Also, it could be concluded that P. peli can treat and detoxify the studied PW.

AB In this study, the effects of organic loading rate (OLR) and the addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the performance and membrane fouling of MBR were conducted to treat real pharmaceutical process wastewater. Over 145 days of operation, the MBR system was operated at OLRs ranging from 1 to 2 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) without sludge wasting. The addition of PAC provided an improvement in the flux, despite an increase in the OLR:PAC ratio. The results demonstrated that the hybrid PAC-MBR system maintained a reduced amount of membrane fouling and steadily increased the removal performance of etodolac. PAC addition reduced the deposition of extracellular polymeric substance and organic matter on the membrane surface and resulted an increase in COD removal even at higher OLRs with low PAC addition. Membrane fouling mechanisms were investigated using combined adsorption fouling models. Modified fouling index values and normalized mass transfer coefficient values indicated that predominant fouling mechanism was cake adsorption.

AB The application of oxidation processes such as UV and/or H2O2 will change the physicochemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT). It may affect the sorption affinity of CNT to different contaminants and then affect their fate in the environment. In the present study the adsorption of two very common used pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and naproxen) onto CNT treated by UV, H2O2 or UV/H2O2 was investigated. Four different adsorption models (Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich) were tested. The best fitting of experimental data was observed for Freundlich or Langmuir model. The significant relationships between Q calculated from Langmuir model with 0% and dispersity were observed. Kinetics of diclofenac and naproxen followed mainly pseudo-second order indicating for chemisorption limiting step of adsorption. The data showed that the mechanism of sorption was physical or chemical depending on the type of CNT modification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and particularly antibiotics can harm sensitive aquatic species. Their occurrence in urban wastewater systems is the consequence of five successive processes: (i) ingestion of the substance, (ii) accumulation in the urine, (iii) excretion, (iv) degradation in the sewer system and (v) transport to the wastewater treatment plant (WTP). These processes were included in an integrated model that can be used to assess the dynamics of pharmaceuticals at a WTP inlet. First, information on sales data, posology, pharmacokinetics and toilet flushing frequency were combined to create a source model of pharmaceuticals entering a sewer system. This production function was then coupled with a transport/degradation model to simulate concentrations of pharmaceuticals at a WTP inlet. In an example application, the full model was applied to simulate the concentration of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on an hourly time scale. In this application, the model was calibrated and validated for a case study at a WTP in Lausanne, Switzerland. Validation of the integrated approach was successful despite the high variability evident in the model results. This modeling approach has potential use in pollution management and epidemiology related to wastewater.

AB Final leachates (leachate after storage or treatment processes) from 22 landfills in 12 states were analyzed for 190 pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), which were detected in every sample, with the number of CECs ranging from 1 to 58 (median = 22). In total, 101 different CECs were detected in leachate samples, including 43 prescription pharmaceuticals, 22 industrial chemicals, 15 household chemicals, 12 nonprescription pharmaceuticals, 5 steroid hormones, and 4 animal/plant sterols. The most frequently detected CECs were lidocaine (91%, local anesthetic), cotinine (86%, nicotine degradate), carisoprodol (82%, muscle relaxant), bisphenol A (77%, component of plastics and thermal paper), carbamazepine (77%, anticonvulsant), and N,N-diethyltoluamide (68%, insect repellent). Concentrations of CECs spanned 7 orders of magnitude, ranging from 2.0 ng/L (estrone) to 17 200 000 ng/L (bisphenol A). Concentrations of household and industrial chemicals were the greatest (similar to 1000-1 000 000 ng/L), followed by plant/animal sterols (similar to 1000-100 000 ng/L), nonprescription pharmaceuticals (similar to 100-10 000 ng/L), prescription pharmaceuticals (similar to 10-10 000 ng/L), and steroid hormones (similar to 10-100 ng/L). The CEC concentrations in leachate from active landfills were significantly greater than those in leachate from closed, unlined landfills (p = 0.05). The CEC concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.01) in untreated leachate compared with treated leachate. The CEC concentrations were significantly greater in leachate disposed to wastewater treatment plants from modern lined landfills than in leachate released to groundwater from closed, unlined landfills (p = 0.04). The CEC concentrations were significantly greater (p = 0.06) in the fresh leachate (leachate before storage or treatment) reported in a previous study compared with the final leachate sampled for the present study.

AB Concentrations and percent loadings of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and other emerging contaminants released from healthcare facilities (2 hospitals and a long-term care facility) to a sewage treatment plant (STP) in a large urban sewershed were evaluated. An additional hospital outside the sewershed was also monitored. Fourteen of the 24 steroids/hormones and 88 of the 117 PhACs and emerging contaminants were detected at least once. Commonly used substances, including cotinine, caffeine and its metabolite 1,7-dimethylxanthine, ibuprofen and naproxen (analgesics), venlafaxine (antidepressant), and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (insect repellant), were detected in all samples at all sites. Concentrations detected in the large specialty hospital outside the sewershed were similar to those within the sewershed. Cytotoxic drugs (tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide) and x-ray contrast media (iopamidol and diatrizoic acid) were infrequently detected in hospital effluents. Analysis for antibiotics indicated that azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole were consistently detected in hospital wastewaters, as was triclosan (antibacterial agent). Fifteen compounds individually contributed greater than 1% to the total PhAC and emerging contaminant load to the STP from the 2 hospitals in the sewershed, and 9 compounds in the STP effluent exceeded ecotoxicological criteria.

AB Studies have shown the potential for antibiotic uptake into food crops from irrigation water and soils containing pharmaceuticals. The objective of the present study was to develop and compare methods quantifying uptake of antibiotics in food crops. Four methods were evaluated: freeze-and-thaw cell lysing, mechanical maceration, tissue sonication, and microwave-assisted solvent extraction. Four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole) were tested representing 4 classes of antibiotics. The methods were evaluated based on method detection limits, analyte recoveries, and sample preparation time. The 2 most viable methods, freeze-and-thaw lysing and mechanical maceration, were used on replicate lettuce (Lactuca sativa) samples grown using irrigation water spiked with 3 of the antibiotic contaminants. Only lincomycin and sulfamethoxazole were detected in lettuce samples at concentrations as high as 1757 ng/g and 425 ng/g, with detection limits of 57 ng/g and 35 ng/g, respectively. Freeze-and-thaw cell lysing provided the highest level of extraction efficiency on environmental samples and required the least amount of sample preparation while providing adequate detection limits and reproducible analyte recovery.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging chemicals of concern detected in surface waters globally. Recent reviews advocate that PPCP occurrence, fate, and exposure need to be better predicted and characterized. The use of pharmaceutical prescription rates to estimate PPCP concentrations in the environment has been suggested. Concentrations of 7 pharmaceuticals (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) were measured in municipal wastewater using gas chromatography/ion trap-tandem mass spectroscopy (GC/IT-MS/MS). Subregional pharmaceutical prescription data were investigated to determine whether they could predict measured effluent concentrations (MECs) in wastewaters. Predicted effluent concentrations (PECs) for 5 of the 7 pharmaceuticals were within 2-fold agreement of the MECs when the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was not considered. When the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was considered, the respective PECs decreased, and most were within an order of magnitude of the MECs. Regression relationships of monthly PECs versus MECs were statistically significant (p < 0.05) but weak (R-2 = 0.18-0.56) for all pharmaceuticals except ketoprofen. This suggests high variability in the data and may be the result of factors influencing MECs such as the analytical methods used, wastewater sampling frequency, and methodology. The PECs were based solely on prescription rates and did not account for inputs of pharmaceuticals that had a significant over-the-counter component or were from other sources (e.g., hospitals).

AB Antidepressants have been found in measurable concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent and receiving waters throughout the world. Studies have shown that these concentrations are typically not overtly toxic, but the psychotropic mode of action of these chemicals warrants examination of their behavioral effects. Exposure of hybrid striped bass to the antidepressants fluoxetine or venlafaxine alone has been shown to cause decreased brain serotonin levels and increased time to capture prey at concentrations typically 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, equally effective doses of fluoxetine and venlafaxine were used to perform a mixture study, using a toxic unit approach to determine whether these antidepressants may act in an additive manner at lower concentrations. The results indicated that mixtures of these antidepressants caused decreased brain serotonin and increased time to capture prey at concentrations lower than reported in previous studies. Low concentration mixtures caused an additive effect on brain serotonin levels and time to capture prey, whereas higher concentrations were less than additive. The results were consistent with the dose addition concept, with higher concentration mixtures potentially saturating the effects on serotonin in the brain. Results from the present study indicate that antidepressants have the potential to be additive on the biochemical and individual scale, which necessitates more robust analysis of antidepressant mixtures and their potential to act together in low concentration scenarios.

AB The present study evaluated the environmental risks to common carp (Cyprinus carpio) posed by glucocorticoids present in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. To gather information on the seasonal variations in glucocorticoid concentration, the authors sampled the effluent of a Japanese STP every other week for 12 mo. Six of 9 selected glucocorticoids were detected in the effluent, with clobetasol propionate and betamethasone 17-valerate detected at the highest concentrations and frequencies. The present study's results indicated that effluent glucocorticoid concentration may depend on water temperature, which is closely related to the removal efficiency of the STP or to seasonal variations in the public's use of glucocorticoids. In a separate experiment, to clarify whether glucocorticoids in environmental water increase susceptibility to bacterial infection in fish, the authors examined the responses to bacterial infection (Aeromonas veronii) of common carp exposed to clobetasol propionate. Clobetasol propionate exposure did not affect bacterial infection-associated mortality. In fish infected with A. veronii but not exposed to clobetasol propionate, head kidney weight and number of leukocytes in the head kidney were significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas these effects were not observed in infected fish exposed to clobetasol. This suggests that clobetasol propionate alleviated bacterial infection-associated inflammation. Together, these results indicate that susceptibility to bacterial infection in common carp is not affected by exposure to glucocorticoids at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB Pharmaceuticals are present in low concentrations (<100 ng/L) in most municipal wastewater effluents but may be elevated locally because of factors such as input from pharmaceutical formulation facilities. Using existing concentration data, the authors assessed pharmaceuticals in laboratory exposures of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and added environmental complexity through effluent exposures. In the laboratory, larval and mature minnows were exposed to a simple opioid mixture (hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone), an opioid agonist (tramadol), a muscle relaxant (methocarbamol), a simple antidepressant mixture (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine), a sleep aid (temazepam), or a complex mixture of all compounds. Larval minnow response to effluent exposure was not consistent. The 2010 exposures resulted in shorter exposed minnow larvae, whereas the larvae exposed in 2012 exhibited altered escape behavior. Mature minnows exhibited altered hepatosomatic indices, with the strongest effects in females and in mixture exposures. In addition, laboratory-exposed, mature male minnows exposed to all pharmaceuticals (except the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor mixture) defended nest sites less rigorously than fish in the control group. Tramadol or antidepressant mixture exposure resulted in increased splenic T lymphocytes. Only male minnows exposed to whole effluent responded with increased plasma vitellogenin concentrations. Female minnows exposed to pharmaceuticals (except the opioid mixture) had larger livers, likely as a compensatory result of greater prominence of vacuoles in liver hepatocytes. The observed alteration of apical endpoints central to sustaining fish populations confirms that effluents containing waste streams from pharmaceutical formulation facilities can adversely impact fish populations but that the effects may not be temporally consistent. The present study highlights the importance of including diverse biological endpoints spanning levels of biological organization and life stages when assessing contaminant interactions.

AB Though pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern are increasingly observed in inland water bodies, the occurrence and bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in estuaries and coastal ecosystems are poorly understood. In the present study, bioaccumulation of select pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern was examined in fish from Buffalo Bayou, a tidally influenced urban ecosystem that receives effluent from a major (similar to 200 million gallons per day) municipal wastewater treatment plant in Houston, Texas, USA. Using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, various target analytes were observed in effluent, surface water, and multiple fish species. The trophic position of each species was determined using stable isotope analysis. Fish tissue levels of diphenhydramine, which represented the only pharmaceutical detected in all fish species, did not significantly differ between freshwater and marine fish predominantly inhabiting benthic habitats; however, saltwater fish with pelagic habitat preferences significantly accumulated diphenhydramine to the highest levels observed in the present study. Consistent with previous observations from an effluent-dependent freshwater river, diphenhydramine did not display trophic magnification, which suggests site-specific, pH-influenced inhalational uptake to a greater extent than dietary exposure in this tidally influenced urban ecosystem. The findings highlight the importance of understanding differential bioaccumulation and risks of ionizable contaminants of emerging concern in habitats of urbanizing coastal systems. (C) 2015 SETAC

TI RANKING PRESCRIBED PHARMACEUTICALS IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK:

AB A newly available dataset on pharmaceuticals used in Scottish hospitals enabled an environmental risk assessment that includes hospital consumption of pharmaceuticals, as previous United Kingdom rankings have been based on community prescriptions only. Although health and the environment are devolved issues for the Scottish government, it is merited to consider a Scottish ranking separately; regional differentiation is particularly relevant in the spatial context of the European Commission's Water Framework Directive. Nine pharmaceuticals are identified as having a risk quotient greater than 1. Four of these, the antibacterials piperacillin, tazobactam, flucloxacillin, and ciprofloxacin, had high hospital contributions and had not been highlighted previously in rankings based on community prescriptions. Some drugs with a risk quotient < 0.1 are used almost exclusively in hospitals and could be more concentrated near effluents carrying hospital wastewater, where they may be of local concern. Although treating hospital effluents separately is a policy option, specifically including hospital consumption is important. Continually increasing the availability of ecotoxicological data and trends in consumption further contributes to a substantially different prioritization than in previous rankings. This leads the authors to conclude that regular review of risk is necessary. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB Citalopram is an antidepressant drug, which acts by inhibiting the re-uptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic nerve ending. It is one of the most common drugs used in treatment of depression, it is highly lipophilic and frequently found in sewage treatment plant effluents and surface waters around the world. Citalopram and other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have, at concentrations that occur in nature, been shown to have behavioural as well as physiological effects on fish and other animals. This study is the result of several different experiments, intended to analyse different aspects of behavioural effects of chronic citalopram exposure in fish. Our model species the three-spine stickleback is common in the entire northern hemisphere and is considered to be a good environmental sentinel species. Female three-spine sticklebacks were exposed to 0, 1.5 and 15 mu g/l nominal concentrations of citalopram for 21 days and subjected to the novel tank (NT) diving test. In the NT test, the fish exposed to 1.5 mu g/l, but not the 15 mu g/l fish made a significantly higher number of transitions to the upper half and stayed there for significantly longer time than the fish exposed to 0 mu g/l. The 15 mu g/l group, however, displayed a significantly lower number of freeze bouts and a shorter total freezing time. The test for locomotor activity included in the NT test showed that fish treated with 1.5 and 15 mu g/l displayed a significantly higher swimming activity than control fish both 5-7 and 15-17 min after the start of the experiment. In the next experiment we compared fish exposed to 1.5 mu g/l and 0.15 mu g/l to pure water controls with regard to shoaling intensity and found no effect of treatment. In the final experiment the propensity of fish treated with 1.5 mu g/l to approach an unknown object and aggressive behaviour was investigated using the Novel Object test and a mirror test, respectively. The exposed fish ventured close to the unknown object significantly more often and stayed there for significantly longer time than unexposed fish. The aggression test yielded no statistically significant effects. It is concluded that citalopram changes the behaviour of the three-spine stickleback in a way that is likely to have ecological consequences and that it must not be considered an environmentally safe pharmaceutical.

TI Micropollutants removal from retentates generated in ultrafiltration and

AB One important disadvantage of using ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) for reclamation of secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is the necessity to dispose of the UF and NF retentates. Different advanced treatments including coagulation (iron and alum), oxidation (chlorine, permanganate and ozone) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption were compared for their efficiencies in removing 11 selected micropollutants and effluent organic matter (EfOM) from UF and NF retentates generated in the filtration of secondary effluents. Ozone exhibited better micropollutants and UV254 removal efficiencies than chlorine and permanganate. Similar abatement of organics was observed when the same specific oxidant dose was applied to UF and NF retentates. Coagulation preferentially removed high molecular weight compounds, being ineffective for the elimination of most micropollutants. In general terms, iron coagulation was more efficient than alum, since iron achieved higher DOC and UV254 removal at lower molar doses. In addition, PAC was an effective method for removing micropollutants, especially hydrophobic and aromatic compounds. The hybrid coagulation/ozonation process improved micropollutants and EfOM (DOC and UV254) removal. A specific ozone dose of 1 mg O-3 mg DOC-1 was able to almost completely remove selected micropollutants from the UF retentate. The final effluent, which is likely more biodegradable and less toxic, could be recirculated to biological treatment processes in the WWTP, avoiding the continuous discharge of non-biodegradable micropollutants through the WWTP effluents.

AB Emerging organic contaminants have not received a lot of attention in developing countries, particularly Africa, although problems regarding water quantity and quality are often even more severe than in more developed regions. This study presents general water quality parameters as well as unique data on concentrations and loads of 24 pharmaceuticals including antibiotic, anti(retro)viral, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and psychiatric drugs in three wastewater treatment plants, three rivers and three groundwater wells in Nairobi and Kisumu. This allowed studying removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment, identifying important sources of pharmaceutical pollution and distinguishing dilution effects from natural attenuation in rivers. In general, antiretrovirals and antibiotics, being important in the treatment of common African diseases such as HIV and malaria, were in all matrices more prevalent as compared to the Western world. Wastewater stabilization ponds removed pharmaceuticals with an efficiency between 11 and 99%. Despite this large range, a different removal is observed for a number of compounds, as compared to more conventional activated sludge systems. Total concentrations in river water (up to 320 mu g L-1) were similar or exceeded concentrations in untreated wastewater, with domestic discharges from slums, wastewater treatment plant effluent and waste dumpsites identified as important sources. In shallow wells situated next to pit latrines and used for drinking water, the recalcitrant antiretroviral nevirapine was measured at concentrations as high as 1 -2 mu g L-1. Overall, distinct pharmaceutical contamination patterns as compared to the Western world can be concluded, which might be a trigger for further research in developing regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) are from the group of pharmaceutical and personal care products known to be persistent and non-biodegradable in wastewater treatment. Adsorptive removal of CBZ and DTZ using superparamagnetic iron oxide (magnetite, Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs), along with those coated with either methacrylic acid (MAA), Al (OH)(3), or SiO2 were evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyzes revealed that the NPs were about 10 nm in diameter. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the presence of carboxyl group on MAA-coated NPs, and hydroxyl group on alumina-and silica-coated NPs. Results suggest that the major fraction of the drugs is adsorbed by the NPs in about 6-8 h. Maximum DTZ adsorption capacities (based on Freundlich isotherm) of MAA-, Al(OH)(3)-, and SiO2-coated NPs (112.46, 82.20, and 90.48 mg/g, respectively) were much higher than that of the uncoated NPs (66.17 mg/g). Based on batch adsorption studies, an optimal adsorption condition was proposed, i.e. CBZ and DTZ concentration of 100 mu g/L, 0.05 g of NPs, adjusted pH of 8, and exposure time of 7 h. At this condition, the maximum adsorption of CBZ was about 32.7, 47.3, 51.1, and 50.2% with uncoated, MAA-coated, Al(OH)(3)-coated, and SiO2-coated NPs, respectively. The equivalent removal for DTZ by the NPs was at 44.3, 52.8, 60.6, and 38.1%, respectively. Further desorption studies revealed that about 85.56 and 78.00% of adsorbed CBZ and DTZ can be readily released from Al(OH) 3- and MAA-coated NPs, respectively.

AB Results from coastal water pollution monitoring (Lesvos Island, Greece) are presented. In total, 53 samples were analyzed for 58 polar organic micropollutants such as selected herbicides, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, stimulants, artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals. Main focus is the application of a proposed wastewater indicator quartet (acesulfame, caffeine, valsartan, and valsartan acid) to detect point sources and contamination hot-spots with untreated and treated wastewater. The derived conclusions are compared with the state of knowledge regarding local land use and infrastructure. The artificial sweetener acesulfame and the stimulant caffeine were used as indicators for treated and untreated wastewater, respectively. In case of a contamination with untreated wastewater the concentration ratio of the antihypertensive valsartan and its transformation product valsartan acid was used to further refine the estimation of the residence time of the contamination. The median/maximum concentrations of acesulfame and caffeine were 5.3/178 ng L-1 and 6.1/522 ng L-1, respectively. Their detection frequency was 100%. Highest concentrations were detected within the urban area of the capital of the island (Mytilene). The indicator quartet in the gulfs of Gera and Kalloni (two semi-enclosed embayments on the island) demonstrated different concentration patterns. A comparatively higher proportion of untreated wastewater was detected in the gulf of Gera, which is in agreement with data on the wastewater infrastructure. The indicator quality of the micropollutants to detect wastewater was compared with electrical conductivity (EC) data. Due to their anthropogenic nature and low detection limits, the micropollutants are superior to EC regarding both sensitivity and selectivity. The concentrations of atrazine, diuron, and isoproturon did not exceed the annual average of their environmental quality standards (EQS) defined by the European Commission. At two sampling locations irgarol 1051 exceeded its annual average EQS value but not the maximum allowable concentration of 16 ng L. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This is the first study reporting the presence of endogenous caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline in all organs of poplar plants. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used in order to evaluate the uptake, translocation, and metabolism of caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) in Populus alba L. Villafranca clone grown in hydroponic conditions. We investigated the remediation of caffeine since it is one of the most widely consumed drugs and it is frequently detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents, surface water, and groundwater worldwide. Our results demonstrated that poplar can absorb and degrade exogenous caffeine without negative effects on plant health. Data showed that concentrations of all endogenous compounds varied depending on caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) treatments. In particular, in control conditions, endogenous caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were mainly distributed in roots. On the other hand, once caffeine-(trimethyl-C-13) was provided, this compound and its dimethy-C-13 metabolites are mainly localized at leaf level. In conclusion, our results support the possible use of Villafranca clone in association with other water treatment systems in order to complete the process of caffeine remediation.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutical and personal care products in the environment are of increasing public importance because of their ubiquitous nature and documented effects on wildlife, ecosystems, and potentially humans. One potential, yet undefined, source of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment is via the land application of municipal wastewater onto permitted lands. The objective of the present study is to determine the extent to which pharmaceuticals are mitigated by or exported from managed tree plantations irrigated with municipal wastewater. A specific focus of the present study is the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in groundwater and surface water discharge. The study site is a municipality that land-applies secondary treated wastewater onto 930 hectares of a 2000-hectare managed hardwood and pine plantation. A suite of 33 pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones was targeted in the analysis, which consisted of monthly grab sampling of groundwater, surface water, and wastewater, followed by concentration and cleanup via solid phase extraction and separation, detection, and quantification via liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. More than one-half of all compounds detected in irrigated wastewater were not present in groundwater and subsequent surface water. However, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, caffeine, and other prescription and over-the-counter drugs remained in groundwater and were transported into surface water at concentrations up to 10 ng/L. These results provide important documentation for pharmaceutical fate and transport in forest systems irrigated with municipal wastewater, a previously undocumented source of environmental entry.

AB Aquatic organisms can be exposed to thousands of chemicals discharged by the human population. Many of these chemicals are considered disruptive to aquatic wildlife, and the literature on the impacts of these chemicals grows daily. However, because time and resources are not infinite, research must focus on the chemicals that represent the greatest threat. One group of chemicals of increasing concern is pharmaceuticals, for which the primary challenge is to identify which represent the greatest threat. In the present study, a list of 12 pharmaceuticals was compiled based on scoring the prevalence of different compounds from previous prioritization reviews. These included rankings based on prescription data, environmental concentrations, predicted environmental concentration/predicted no-effect concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratios, persistency/bioaccumulation/(eco) toxicity (PBT), and fish plasma model approaches. The most frequently cited were diclofenac, paracetamol, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, naproxen, atenolol, ethinyl estradiol, aspirin, fluoxetine, propranolol, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole. For each pharmaceutical, literature on effect concentrations was compiled and compared with river concentrations in the United Kingdom. The pharmaceuticals were ranked by degree of difference between the median effect and median river concentrations. Ethinyl estradiol was ranked as the highest concern, followed by fluoxetine, propranolol, and paracetamol. The relative risk of these pharmaceuticals was compared with those of metals and some persistent organic pollutants. Pharmaceuticals appear to be less of a threat to aquatic organisms than some metals (Cu, Al, Zn) and triclosan, using this ranking approach. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB In several countries around the world, Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) exist in aquatic environments, a fact that increases the awareness within the scientific community with respect to their possible fate and environment effects. This research presents a preliminary monitoring of use, consumption and presence of PPCPs in wastewater from a treatment plant in a rural area of Pereira (Colombia). Domestic sewage is treated in a septic tank followed by an Up-Flow Anaerobic Filter and its effluent is discharged into the Otun River, upstream of the water intake of the supply system of the city. The compounds monitored in this research included ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, ketoprofen, caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide and dihydrojasmonate. An adapted method of multi-residue analysis was used, which is based on solid phase extraction with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance cartridges, and determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The removal efficiencies demonstrated that the treatment plant could eliminate less than 50 % of dihydrojasmonate, diclofenac and galaxolide existing in wastewater; concentration of aspirin, naproxen and tonalide could only be reduced in 15 %; and caffeine, ibuprofen and ketoprofen were not removed. Results provided basic information to decide over the necessity of complementary treatments for effluents from systems with the mentioned units.

AB The solid-waste treatment plant of RECIPLASA is located in the municipality of Onda (Castellon province), which is an important agricultural area of Spain, with predominance of citrus crops. In this plant, all urban solid wastes from the town of Castellon (around 200,000 inhabitants) and other smaller towns as Almassora, Benicassim, Betxi, Borriana, L'Alcora, Onda and Vila-Real are treated. In order to evaluate the potential impact of this plant on the surrounding water, both surface and groundwater, a comprehensive monitoring of organic pollutants has been carried out along 2011, 2012 and 2013. To this aim, an advanced analytical strategy was applied for wide-scope screening, consisting on the complementary use of liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) with quadrupole (Q)-time of flight analyser (TOF). A generic solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges was applied prior to the chromatographic analysis. The screening included more than 1500 organic pollutants as target compounds, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, veterinary drugs, drugs of abuse, UV-filters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), among others. Pesticides, mainly herbicides, were the compounds more frequently detected. Other compounds as antioxidants, cosmetics, drugs of abuse, PAHs, pharmaceuticals and UV filters, were also identified in the screening though at much lower frequency. Once the screening was made, quantitative analysis focused on the compounds more frequently detected was subsequently applied using LC coupled to tandem MS with triple quadrupole analyser. In this way, up to 24 pesticides and transformation products (TPs), 7 pharmaceuticals, one drug of abuse and its metabolite could be quantified at sub-ppb concentrations. Along the three years of study, ten compounds were found at concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g/L. Most of them were pesticides and TPs, a fact that illustrates that the main source of pollution seems to be the agricultural activities in this area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Greece was used as case study and the environmental risk associated with the existence of 99 emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in sludge-amended soil was estimated using risk quotient (RQ) approach. Data on the concentration levels of EOCs in sewage sludge was collected after literature review. Chemical analyses were also conducted for 50 pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in sludge samples from Athens Sewage Treatment Plant. Risk assessment was based on both terrestrial and aquatic acute toxicity data, using both the maximum and the average measured concentrations of the target compounds. EC50/LC50 values were collected through literature review or using the ECOSAR program in cases that experimental values were not available. Triclosan seems to pose an environmental risk on the soil environment, as its RQ values exceeded 1, both in terrestrial and aquatic toxicity data based risk assessment. Calculations based on aquatic toxicity data showed that another eleven compounds had RQs higher than 1, most of them belonging to the classes of synthetic phenolic compounds and siloxanes. Tetradecamethylhexasiloxane presented the highest RQ, while high RQs were also calculated for decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and caffeine. No environmental risk for the terrestrial environment is expected due to the individual action of illicit drugs, perfluorinated compounds and benzotriazoles. The sludge source and the day of sampling affected the estimated threat due to nonylphenolic compounds; however these factors did not affect the estimated risk for siloxanes, caffeine and ofloxacin. Calculation of RQ values for the mixture of EOCs, using either the maximum or the average concentrations, far exceeded 1 (253 and 209, respectively), indicating a presumable threat for the terrestrial environment due to the baseline toxicity of these compounds. Countries that reuse sludge for agricultural purposes should include specific EOCs in national monitoring campaigns and study more thoroughly on their effects to the terrestrial environment.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes are primarily designed to reduce the amount of organic matter, pathogens, and nutrients from the incoming influent. However, these processes are not as effective in reducing the concentrations of micropollutants, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which notoriously evade traditional wastewater treatment technologies and are found even in tertiary-treated effluent. For WWTPs practicing deep -well injection or surface -water discharge, EDCs in the treated effluent are discharged into groundwater or the aquatic environment where humans and wildlife may potentially suffer the effects of chemical exposure. In the current laboratory-scale study, we tested a bench -top electrocoagulation (EC) unit utilizing aluminum blades for the removal of six estrogenic EDCs [estrone (El), 17B-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol-A (BPA), and nonylphenol (NP)]. Samples of municipal wastewater influent and tertiary -treated effluent were spiked with the six EDCs in order to test the removal efficiency of the EC unit. The mean concentration of each EDC component was statistically lower after EC treatment (removal range = 42%-98%). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate aluminum electrocoagulation for removal of these specific EDCs, including nonylphenol (without the ethoxylate chain), as well as natural and synthetic estrogens.

AB Small-scale granular activated carbon (GAC) tests for the adsorption of organic micro-pollutants (OMP) were conducted with drinking water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. In both waters, three influent OMP concentration levels were tested. As long as the influent OMP concentrations are below certain thresholds, the relative breakthrough behavior is not impacted in the respective water. Accordingly, the GAC capacity for OMP is directly proportional to the influent OMP concentration in the corresponding water. The differences between the OMP breakthrough curves in drinking water and WWTP effluent can be attributed to the concentrations of the low molecular weight acid and neutral (LMW) organics of the waters. Presenting the relative OMP concentrations (c/c(0)) over the specific throughput of the LMW organics (mg LMW organics/g GAC), the OMP breakthrough curves in drinking water and WWTP effluent superimpose each other. This superimposition can be further increased if the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) of the LMW organics is considered. In contrast, using the specific throughput of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did not suffice to obtain superimposed breakthrough curves. Thus, the LMW organics are the major water constituent impacting OMP adsorption onto GAC. The results demonstrate that knowing the influent OMP and LMW organics concentrations (and UV254) of different waters, the OMP breakthroughs and GAC capacities corresponding to any water can be applied to all other waters.

AB Immunosuppresive therapy following organ transplant frequently includes treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid derivatives. These pharmaceuticals may enter the environment through waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and may have a potentially harmful effect on aquatic biota. Tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and their metabolites were measured at specific points of a large Polish river (Vistula), a smaller river (Utrata) and in tap water samples from the Warsaw region. Analysis was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, after solid phase extraction for water samples, or QuEChERS extraction for sediments. Residues of tacrolimus were below quantitation limits in both water and sediment samples. However, in water samples mycophenolic acid concentrations were measured at up to 180 ng L-1 downstream of WWTP outfalls. No immunosuppressive drugs were detected in tap water. Concentrations of mycophenolic acid exceeded the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) value in some Polish surface water, and risk calculations predicted at least twice higher concentrations in some other countries of the European Union. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of these immunosuppressive drug concentrations in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Beta-agonists and sulfonamides are widely used for treating both humans and livestock for bronchial and cardiac problems, infectious disease and even as growth promoters. There are concerns about their potential environmental impacts, such as producing drug resistance in bacteria. This study focused on their spatial distribution in surface water and the identification of pollution sources in the Langat River basin, which is one of the most urbanized watersheds in Malaysia. Fourteen beta-agonists and 12 sulfonamides were quantitatively analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to visualize catchment areas of the sampling points, and source profiling was conducted to identify the pollution sources based on a correlation between a daily pollutant load of the detected contaminant and an estimated density of human or livestock population in the catchment areas. As a result, 6 compounds (salbutamol, sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole) were widely detected in mid catchment areas towards estuary. The source profiling indicated that the pollution sources of salbutamol and sulfamethoxazole were from sewage, while sulfadiazine was from effluents of cattle, goat and sheep farms. Thus, this combination method of quantitative and spatial analysis clarified the spatial distribution of these drugs and assisted for identifying the pollution sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study determined environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals, cocaine, and the main human metabolite of cocaine in seawater sampled from a subtropical coastal zone (Santos, Brazil). The Santos Bay is located in a metropolitan region and receives over 7367 m(3) of wastewater per day. Five sample points under strong influence of the submarine sewage outfall were chosen. Through quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS, 33 compounds were investigated. Seven pharmaceuticals (atenolol, acetaminophen, caffeine, losartan, valsartan, diclofenac, and ibuprofen), an illicit drug (cocaine), and its main humanmetabolite (benzoylecgonine) were detected at least once in seawater sampled from Santos Bay at concentrations that ranged from ng.L-1 to mu g.L-1. In light of the possibility of bioaccumulation and harmful effects, the high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and cocaine found in this marine subtropical ecosystem are of environmental concern.

AB The occurrence of 41 pharmaceuticals and phytochemicals (PPs) including their metabolites was surveyed in hospital effluent in an urban area of Japan. A detailed survey of sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent, and river water was also conducted. Finally, mass balances with mass fluxes of the target PPs through the water flow were evaluated and the degree of contribution of hospital effluent to the environmental discharge was estimated. The results indicate that 38 compounds were detectable in hospital effluent over a wide concentration range from ng/L to mu g/L, with a maximum of 92 mu g/L. The contributions of PPs in the hospital effluent to STP influent varied widely from < 0.1% to 14.8%. Although almost all of the remaining components could be removed below 1.0 ng/L at STPs by the addition of ozone treatment, a number of PPs still remained above 10 ng/L in STP effluent. These findings suggest the importance of applying highly developed treatments to hospital effluents and at STPs in the future to reduce the environmental risks posed by PPs. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the presence of two conjugated metabolites of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide and acetaminophen sulfate, as well as of loxoprofen and loxoprofen alcohol, in hospital effluent, STP, and river waters.

AB This study evaluated the toxicity and cellular stresses of carbamazepine (CBZ) on Chlamydomonas mexicana and Scenedesmus obliquus, and its biodegradation by both microalgal species. The growth of both microalgal species decreased with increase of CBZ concentration. The growth of S. obliquus was significantly inhibited (97%) at 200 mg CBZ L-1, as compared to the control after 10 days; whereas, C. mexicana showed 30% inhibition at the same experimental conditions. Biochemical characteristics including total chlorophyll, carotenoid contents and enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) for both species were affected by CBZ at relatively high concentration. C. mexicana and S. obliquus could achieve a maximum of 35% and 28% biodegradation of CBZ, respectively. Two metabolites (10,11-dihydro-10,11-expox ycarbamazepine and n-hydroxy-CBZ) were identified by UPLC-MS, as a result of CBZ biodegradation by C. mexicana. This study demonstrated that C. mexicana was more tolerant to CBZ and could be used for treatment of CBZ contaminated wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reuse of sewage water treatment is becothing a priority, especially in arid regions, where water is scarce. However, there is increasing concern about the presence of emerging micropollutants refractory to the conventional treatments in wastewater treatment plants. Solar TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a valuable alternative for the simultaneous oxidation of chemical and inactivation of microorganisms. However, the variability of solar irradiance hinders the study of the process under controlled ultraviolet (UV) irradiance. This work reports the development of an innovative solar simulator and its validation against the use of natural sunlight in photocatalytic disinfection applications with simultaneous removal of emerging contaminants. The significant impact of osmotic and mechanical stress on the viability of E. coli bacteria was confirmed. UV irradiance and total-to-illuminated volume ratio showed no impact on the dependence of the bacteria inactivation kinetics on the energy accumulated in the system, indicating that the possible existence of dark repair mechanisms can be neglected within the studied irradiance range (20-60 W m(-2).). Average results show that after an accumulated energy of 3 kJ L-1, 5 logarithmic units (5-logs) of E. coli bacteria are inactivated, whereas a removal efficiency of >80% is achieved for the micropollutants.

AB The pharmaceutical industry constitutes an important place in terms of health and environment, both in our country and throughout the world. Various complex organic chemicals are present in the wastewater generated by pharmaceutical industries. The accumulation of toxic and persistent organic substances in wastewater is a serious problem for the environment. Therefore, it is important that pharmaceutical industry wastewater is treated before being discharged into receiving waters. Today, anaerobic treatment systems are commonly used for wastewater-containing high organic matter. The first stage of this study statistically investigates the optimization of anaerobic treatment conditions of pharmaceutical industry wastewater in a batch study. In the second stage, continuous treatment processes were planned using data obtained as a result of the batch study. For processing, an upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactor was used for treating substrate mixtures containing 10-100% pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The effects of operating parameters on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and the methane production rate were evaluated. COD removal efficiencies of 93-97% were obtained for the pharmaceutical industry wastewater using a 2.5-4d hydraulic retention time and a 0.6-2.2g CODd(-1) organic loading rate. The overall results suggested that the mixed bacterial and archaeal biomass was able to efficiently treat pharmaceutical industry wastewater under determined anaerobic conditions.

AB Several methods for evaluating the toxicity and biodegradability of hazardous pollutants (chlorinated compounds, chemical additives and pharmaceuticals) have been studied in this work. Different bioassays using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial ecosystems such as Vibrio fischeri and Pseudomonas putida have been used to assess the ecotoxicity. Activated sludge was used to analyse the effect of those pollutants in a biological reactor of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results demonstrate that none of the compounds is toxic to activated sludge, except ofloxacin to P. putida. The additives tested can be considered moderately toxic according to the more sensitive V. fischeri assays, whereas the EC50 values of the pharmaceuticals depend on the specific microorganism used in each test. Regarding the biodegradability, respirometric measurements were carried out for fast biodegradability assessment and the Zahn-Wellens test for inherent biodegradability. The evolution of the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) showed that only diethyl phthalate was easily biodegradable and acetylsalicylic acid was partially biodegradable (98% and 65% degradation, respectively). The persistence of dichloromethane, ofloxacin and hidrochlorothiazide was confirmed along the 28 days of the Zahn-Wellens test whereas 1,1,1-trichloroethane showed inherent biodegradability (74% removal). Most of the chlorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, bisphenol A and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were partially degraded in 28 d with total organic carbon (TOC) reduction ranging from 21% to 51%. Sulphamethoxazole showed certain biodegradation (50% removal) with TOC decrease around 31%, which indicates the formation of non-biodegradable by-products.

AB Emerging pharmaceutical contaminants have raised severe challenges to remediation technologies for water treatment. In this paper, we report a facile method for preparation of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) using urea as a nitrogen precursor. The prepared metal-free N-rGO is able to efficiently activate persulfate (PS) to produce reactive radicals for degradation of an antibiotic of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP). The effects of reaction parameters on SCP degradation were investigated. The activation processes were studied by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), which discovered the newly observed hydroxyl radicals from PS activation. This study suggests a green remediation for removal of antibiotics in wastewater without producing any heavy metal leaching as the secondary contamination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The main removal process for polar organic micropollutants during activated sludge treatment is biotransformation, which often leads to the formation of stable transformation products (TPs). Because the analysis of TPs is challenging, the use of pathway prediction systems can help by generating a list of suspected TPs. To complete and refine pathway prediction, comprehensive biotransformation studies for compounds exhibiting pertinent functional groups under environmentally relevant conditions are needed. Because many polar organic micropollutants present in wastewater contain one or several amine functional groups, we systematically explored amine biotransformation by conducting experiments with 19 compounds that contained 25 structurally diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amine moieties. The identification of 144 TP candidates and the structure elucidation of 101 of these resulted in a comprehensive view on initial amine biotransformation reactions. The reactions with the highest relevance were N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, N-acetylation, and N-succinylation. Whereas many of the observed reactions were similar to those known for the mammalian metabolism of amine-containing xenobiotics, some N-acylation reactions were not previously described. In general, different reactions at the amine functional group occurred in parallel. Finally, recommendations on how these findings can be implemented to improve microbial pathway prediction of amine-containing micropollutants are given.

AB Ball milling was used to prepare two ultrafine magnetic biochar/Fe3O4 and activated carbon (AC)/Fe3O4 hybrid materials targeted for use in pharmaceutical removal by adsorption and mechanochemical degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. Both hybrid adsorbents prepared after 2 h milling exhibited high removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), and were easily separated magnetically. These adsorbents exhibited fast adsorption of CBZ and tetracycline (TC) in the initial 1 h. The biochar/Fe3O4 had a maximum adsorption capacity of 62.7 mg/g for CBZ and 94.2 mg/g for TC, while values obtained for AC/Fe3O4 were 135.1 mg/g for CBZ and 45.3 mg/g for TC respectively when data were fitted using the Langmuir expression. Solution pH values slightly affected the sorption of TC on the adsorbents, while CBZ sorption was almost pH-independent. The spent adsorbents with adsorbed CBZ and TC were milled to degrade the adsorbed pollutants. The adsorbed TC itself was over 97% degraded after 3 h of milling, while about half of adsorbed CBZ were remained. The addition of quartz sand was found to improve the mechanochemical degradation of CBZ on biochar/Fe3O4, and its degradation percent was up to 98.4% at the dose of 0.3 g quarts sand/g adsorbent. This research provided an easy method to prepare ultrafine magnetic adsorbents for the effective removal of typical pharmaceuticals from water or wastewater and degrade them using ball milling.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compounds routinely detected in wastewater effluent-impacted environment. Biocatalytic degradation with enzymes such as laccase provides a promising approach for the elimination of CBZ. However, the relatively low redox potential of laccase makes its efficient CBZ degradation difficult. Therefore, an environmentally benign and effective mediator is required. In this study, three natural phenolic compounds, namely p-coumaric acid (PCA), syringaldehyde (SYR), and acetosyringone (ACE), were investigated as redox mediators for the enzymatic removal of CBZ by both free and immobilized laccase. Among the tested mediators, PCA resulted in the optimal CBZ removal performance with 60% removal rate (20 mu M initial CBZ) after 96 h incubation with immobilized laccase in a conventional suspension system. The degradation of CBZ was then carried out in a membrane hybrid reactor with the effluent recirculating through suspended biocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles. The effect of operation parameters including PCA concentrations, initial enzyme activity and operational flux on CBZ removal were investigated. Further CBZ metabolites study identified 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZD), 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxy-CBZ (CBZE) and acridone as the major metabolites of CBZ oxidation by laccase. The toxicity tests determined by algal viability using the fluorometric indicator alamarBlue indicated that the CBZ treatment via the hybrid reactor could effectively remove the toxicity of parent CBZ compound.

AB The wastewater contamination of a Swiss university hospital by active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) residues was evaluated with a three months monitoring campaign at the outlet of the main building. Flow-proportional samples were collected with an automatic refrigerated sampler and analyzed for 15 API, including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory drugs, by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The metals Gd and Pt were also analyzed using ICP-MS. Measured concentrations were compared to the predicted ones calculated after the drug average consumption data obtained from the hospital pharmacy. The hospital contribution to the total urban load was calculated according to the consumption data obtained from city pharmacies. Lastly, the environmental hazard and risk quotients (RQ) related to the hospital fraction and the total urban consumption were calculated. Median concentrations of the 15 selected compounds were ranging from 0.04 to 675 mu g/L, with a mean detection frequency of 84%. The ratio between predicted and measured environmental concentrations (PEC/MEC) has shown a good accuracy for 5 out of 15 compounds, revealing over-and under-estimations of the PEC model. Mean daily loads were ranging between 0.01 and 14.2 g/d, with the exception of paracetamol (109.7 g/d). The hospital contribution to the total urban loads varied from 2.1 to 100% according to the compound. While taking into account dilution and removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plant, only the hospital fraction of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole showed, respectively, a high (RQ > 1) and moderate (RQ > 0.1) risk for the aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, when considering the total urban consumption, 7 compounds showed potential deleterious effects on aquatic organisms (RQ > 1): gabapentin, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, ibuprofen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid. In order to reduce inputs of API residues originating from hospitals various solutions can be envisioned. With results of the present study, hospital managers can start handling this important issue.

AB Domestic drinking water wells serve 44 million people in the US and are common globally. They are often located in areas served by onsite wastewater treatment systems, including septic systems, which can be sources of biological and chemical pollutants to groundwater. In this study we tested 20 domestic drinking water wells in a sand and gravel aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, for 117 organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) and for inorganic markers of septic system impact. We detected 27 OWCs, including 12 pharmaceuticals, five per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), four organophosphate flame retardants, and an artificial sweetener (acesulfame). Maximum concentrations of several PFASs and pharmaceuticals were relatively high compared to public drinking water supplies in the US. The number of detected OWCs and total concentrations of pharmaceuticals and of PFASs were positively correlated with nitrate, boron, and acesulfame and negatively correlated with well depth. These wells were all located in areas served exclusively by onsite wastewater treatment systems, which are likely the main source of the OWCs in these wells, although landfill leachate may also be a source. Our results suggest that current regulations to protect domestic wells from pathogens in septic system discharges do not prevent OWCs from reaching domestic wells, and that nitrate, a commonly measured drinking water contaminant, is a useful screening tool for OWCs in domestic wells. Nitrate concentrations of 1 mg/L NO3-N, which are tenfold higher than local background and tenfold lower than the US federal drinking water standard, were associated with wastewater impacts from OWCs in this study.

AB PAC adsorption is a widespread option for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from secondary effluent. For an optimal exploitation of the adsorption capacity, PAC recirculation is nowadays a common practice, although the mechanistic interrelations of the complex recirculation process are not fully resolved. In this work, extensive multi-stage batch adsorption testing with repeated PAC and coagulant dosage was performed to evaluate the continuous-flow recirculation system. Partly loaded PAC showed a distinct amount of remaining capacity, as OMP and DOC removals considerably increased with each additional adsorption stage. At a low PAC dose of 10 mg PAC L-1, removals of benzotriazole and carbamazepine were shown to rise from <40% in the first stage up to >80% in the 11th stage at 30 min adsorption time per stage. At a high PAC dose of 30 mg PAC L-1, OMP and DOC removals were significantly higher and reached 98% (for benzotriazole and carbamazepine) after 11 stages. Coagulant dosage showed no influence on OMP removal, whereas a major part of DOC removal can be attributed to coagulation. Multi-stage adsorption is particularly beneficial for small PAC doses and significant PAC savings are feasible. A new model approach for predicting multi-stage OMP adsorption on the basis of a single-stage adsorption experiment was developed. It proved to predict OMP removals and PAC loadings accurately and thus contributes towards understanding the PAC recirculation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the performance of forward osmosis (FO) in treating the high-salinity feed waters containing heavy metal Ni2+ with different salinities was investigated using two different FO membranes (cellulose triacetate (CTA) and polyamide-based thin-film composite (TFC) membrane). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were selected to analyze the used membrane. The result showed that, heavy metals Ni2+ stimulated the formation of CP, and then decreased the water flux. However, this effect decreased with the increase of FS salinity and membrane hydrophilicity. Due to the amphiprotic characteristics, SDBS promoted the water permeation by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The effect of SDBS on CTA-FO membrane was greater than TFC-FO membrane for that CTA-FO membrane was weakly hydrophilic. However, the role decreased with the salinity increasing. Ni2+ removal efficiencies were more than 93%. Specifically, TFC-FO membrane was higher than CTA-FO membrane in high-salinity wastewater, and the FO mode maintained an advantage over the PRO mode. SDBS enhanced Ni2+ removal efficiency greatly at low salinity, and decreased it instead at high salinity. The SEM-EDS analysis supplied the technique support and reflected the role of Ni2+ and SDBS in the membrane directly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutant removal in an algal treatment system fed with source separated wastewater streams was studied. Batch experiments with the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana grown on urine, anaerobically treated black water and synthetic urine were performed to assess the removal of six spiked pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, metoprolol, carbamazepine and trimethoprim). Additionally, incorporation of these pharmaceuticals and three estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and ethinylestradiol) into algal biomass was studied. Biodegradation and photolysis led to 60-100% removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and metoprolol. Removal of carbamazepine and trimethoprim was incomplete and did not exceed 30% and 60%, respectively. Sorption to algal biomass accounted for less than 20% of the micropollutant removal. Furthermore, the presence of micropollutants did not inhibit C. sorokiniana growth at applied concentrations. Algal treatment systems allow simultaneous removal of micropollutants and recovery of nutrients from source separated wastewater. Nutrient rich algal biomass can be harvested and applied as fertilizer in agriculture, as lower input of micropollutants to soil is achieved when algal biomass is applied as fertilizer instead of urine.

AB This study examined the degradation behavior of polycyclic musks (PMs) and antineoplastic drugs (ADs) and the absorbance spectra of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in municipal wastewater by ozone. Specific ozone doses used in the experiments ranged from 0 to 1 mg O-3/mg dissolved organic matter (DOC). The examined PMs included galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide, traseolide and phantolide. ADs included busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, flutamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen and methotrexate. Strong monotonic albeit nonlinear correlations were found to exist between relative changes of EfOM absorbance at 254 nm (i.e. Delta A(254)/A(254)(0)) and the degradation of the selected PMs and ADs. This result was interpreted based on the concept of the simultaneous oxidation of EfOM and, on the other hand, PMs and ADs. This interpretation showed that PMs were degraded primarily via OH radical attack, with tonalide and phantolide being less reactive compared with the other PMs.ADs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and busulfan were also determined to undergo oxidation by OH radicals. Comparison of the behavior of the radical probe para-chlorobenzoic acid and the examined ADs and PMs allowed evaluating corresponding reaction rate constants for reactions between these species and OH radicals.

AB Ozonation is one of the most promising options to remove organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant effluents. For an economic operation and in order to avoid formation of bromate, the ozone dose has to be adjusted in real-time due to the strongly varying effluent quality. The reduction of UV absorption at 254nm (UV254) is a useful surrogate parameter for OMP removals. Unfortunately dissolved ozone also absorbs UV at 254nm and therefore might disturb a UV254-based process control. A fixed bed of manganese dioxide granules was found to efficiently remove residual ozone.

TI Photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals present in conventional

AB Pharmaceuticals have become an important public health issue as environmental pollutants over the last years. After ingestion, pharmaceuticals are partly excreted unchanged. They can reach the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) via the sewer network. Because the conventional treatments are ineffective in their removal, new methods should be approached, for example semiconductor photocatalysis. Several of the hitherto published studies analyzed the degradation of model pollutants but for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in unspiked real wastewater further investigations are required. Therefore, we want to focus on the removal of pharmaceuticals in an actual effluent from a WWTP and investigate the effluent background effect. This study shows the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of 14 pharmaceuticals with initial concentrations C-i > 0.3 mu g L (1) present in a WWTP effluent. We found that UVA (1.5 mW cm (2), intensity peak at 365 nm) irradiation of TiO2 P25 (A(s) = 56 m(2) g (1)) or ZnO (A(s) = 5.23 m(2) g (1)) nanoparticles leads to considerable degradation of the analyzed pharmaceuticals. With ZnO nanoparticles, 40 min UVA irradiation was sufficient to degrade over 95% of these pharmaceuticals (k(app) = 8.6 x 10 (2) s (1)). Using TiO2 P25 on the other hand, it would take more than six times longer to reach the same level (k(app) = 1.4 x 10 (2) s (1)). Carbamazepine dissolved in millipore water served as a comparison model. Also in this system ZnO presents faster degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microalgal cultivation has attracted global attention in recent years. It is a worldwide rapidly growing business sector due to the numerous applications of microalgae biomass and the valuable natural byproducts. Some of these products are used in pharmaceutical, biomedical, cosmetic, and food industries, and recently in biofuel production. The cost reduction of microalgal biomass production is an essential factor, and many studies have been focused on microalgae cultivation in wastewater. The selection of microalgae for biomass and lipid production is a very crucial factor. Chlorococcum sp. are common microalgae, found in wastewater. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of initial biomass concentration, air supply, and type and duration of light exposure of Chlorococcum sp. cultures in a high nutrient concentration synthetic wastewater. Experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions in order to investigate the removal of nutrients from wastewater, the biomass growth rates, and lipids accumulation in microalgae. The results of this study demonstrated that high initial biomass concentration is more efficient for lipid production. Specifically, higher lipids content (27.7%) was observed with high initial microalgae concentration, even though the phosphorus concentration was almost zero. Biomass production was increased faster at the higher air flow rate (6 L/min), without need for addition of carbon dioxide (CO2). The growth rate of Chlorococcum sp. was greater under artificial light compared to sunlight exposure, as well as the CO2 biofixation, since it is directly related to the algal biomass.

AB Wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) closures are rare environmental remediation events; offering unique insight into contaminant persistence, long-term wastewater impacts, and ecosystem recovery processes. The U.S. Geological Survey assessed the fate of select endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in surface water and streambed sediment one year before and one year after closure of a long-term WWTF located within the Spirit Creek watershed at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Sample sites included a WWTF-effluent control located upstream from the outfall, three downstream effluent-impacted sites located between the outfall and Spirit Lake, and one downstream from the lake's outfall. Prior to closure, the 2.2-km stream segment downstream from the WWTF outfall was characterized by EDC concentrations significantly higher (alpha = 0.05) than at the control site; indicating substantial downstream transport and limited in-stream attenuation of EDC, including pharmaceuticals, estrogens, alkylphenol ethoxylate (APE) metabolites, and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFR). Wastewater-derived pharmaceutical, APE metabolites, and OPFR compounds were also detected in the outflow of Spirit Lake, indicating the potential for EDC transport to aquatic ecosystems downstream of Fort Gordon under effluent discharge conditions. After the WWTF closure, no significant differences in concentrations or numbers of detected EDC compounds were observed between control and downstream locations. The results indicated EDC pseudo-persistence under preclosure, continuous supply conditions, with rapid attenuation following WWTF closure. Low concentrations of EDC at the control site throughout the study and comparable concentrations in downstream locations after WWTF closure indicated additional, continuing, upstream contaminant sources within the Spirit Creek watershed.

AB The extensive use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and their subsequent release into the environment may have direct consequences for autochthonous bacterial communities, especially in freshwater ecosystems. In small streams and rivers, local inputs of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may become important sources of organic matter, nutrients and emerging pollutants, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, we evaluated the effect of WWTP effluents as a source of ARGs in river biofilms. The prevalence of genes conferring resistance to main antibiotic families, such as beta-lactams (bla(CTX-M)), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul I), and macrolides (ermB), was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in biofilm samples collected upstream and downstream WWTPs discharge points in four low-order streams. Our results showed that the WWTP effluents strongly modified the hydrology, physico-chemistry and biological characteristics of the receiving streams and favoured the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance in microbial benthic communities. It was also shown that the magnitude of effects depended on the relative contribution of each WWTP to the receiving system. Specifically, low concentrations of ARGs were detected at sites located upstream of the WWTPs, while a significant increase of their concentrations was observed in biofilms collected downstream of the WWTP discharge points (particularly ermB and sill I genes). These findings suggest that WWTP discharges may favour the increase and spread of antibiotic resistance among streambed biofilms. The present study also showed that the presence of ARGs in biofilms was noticeable far downstream of the WWTP discharge (up to 1 km). It is therefore reasonable to assume that biofilms may represent an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance determinants and thus be considered suitable biological indicators of anthropogenic pollution by active pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Isolation, identification and toxicological monitoring of new microbial consortia to degrade PPCP's (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) have direct applications to improve the quality of effluents in WWTP (wastewater treatment plants). In this work, we present isolation and molecular identification of a microbial strain degrading frequently detected compounds in effluent water such as naproxen (analgesic) and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), as well as detoxification evaluation by a zebrafish embryos biomodel. Naproxen was completely removed from real contaminated water samples within 7 days of culture by Serratia sp. However, the microbial strain was unable to remove carbamazepine remaining constant until the analysis finished. Toxicity test showed that naproxen elimination reduces mortality zebrafish embryos at 28%. As conclusion, Serratia sp. and possible other Enterobacteriaceae could be used in bioreactors and purifying plant biodiscs in order to achieve naproxen and probably others PPCPs total elimination from effluent prior being poured into rivers or lakes.

AB The treatment of high-strength organic brewery wastewater with added acetaminophen (MP) by an anaerobic digester was investigated. An anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) was operated as a continuous process with an organic loading rate of 1.5-g COD per litre per day and a hydraulic retention time of three days. The results of steady-state analysis showed that the greatest APBR performances for removing COD and TOC were as high as 98 and 93%, respectively, even though the anaerobic digestibility after adding the different AAP concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 mg L-1 into brewery wastewater can affect the efficiency of organic matter removal. The average CH4 production decreased from 81 to 72% is counterbalanced by the increased CO2 production from 11 to 20% before and after the injection of AAP, respectively. The empirical kinetic models for substrate utilisation and CH4 production were used to predict that, under unfavourable conditions, the performance of the APBR treatment process is able to remove COD with an efficiency of only 6.8%.

AB The increase use of pharmaceutical compounds in veterinary practice and human population results in the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. Because pharmaceuticals are highly bioactive, there is concern about their toxicological effects in aquatic organisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of an effluent from a psychiatric hospital (containing a complex mixture of 25 pharmaceutical compounds from eleven therapeutic classes) on the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea using a proteomic approach. The exposure of C. fluminea to this complex effluent containing anxiolytics, analgesics, lipid regulators, beta blockers, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, antiplatelets and antiarrhythmics induced protein changes after 1 day of exposure in clam gills and digestive gland more evident in the digestive gland. These changes included increase in the abundance of proteins associated with structural (actin and tubulin), cellular functions (calreticulin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), T complex protein 1 (TCP1)) and metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). Results from this study indicate that calreticulin, PCNA, ALDH and alcohol dehydrogenase in the digestive gland and T complex protein 1 (TCP1)) and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the gills represent useful biomarkers for the ecotoxicological characterization of psychiatric hospital effluents in this species.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater can be characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis. Wastewater from animal farms or pharmaceutical plants usually contains high concentration of antibiotics. In this study, the quenching effect of antibiotics on the typical components of DOM was explored using fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC analysis. Four antibiotics (roxarsone, sulfaquinoxaline sodium, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin) at the concentration of 0.5 similar to 4.0 mg/L and three typical components of DOM (tyrosine, tryptophan, and humic acid) were selected. Fluorescence quenching effects were observed with the addition of antibiotics. Among these four antibiotics, roxarsone (2.9 similar to 20.2 %), sulfaquinoxaline sodium (0 similar to 32.0 %), and oxytetracycline (0 similar to 41.8 %) led to a stronger quenching effect than erythromycin (0 similar to 8.0 %). From the side of DOM, tyrosine and tryptophan (0.5 similar to 41.8 %) exhibited a similar quenching effect, but they were higher than humic acids (0 similar to 20.2 %) at the same concentration of antibiotics. For humic acid, a significant quenching effect was observed only with the addition of roxarsone. This might be the first report about the fluorescence quenching effect caused by antibiotics. The results from this study confirmed the interference of antibiotics on the fluorescence intensity of the main components of DOM and highlighted the importance of correcting fluorescence data in the wastewater containing antibiotics.

AB A continuous-flow ion exchange (IE) process for phenols recovery from olive mill waste-waters was examined through both strong-base and weak-base anion exchange resins. The effect of initial pH showed that phenols removal efficiency increased with an increase in the pH value up 7 and efficiency remains constant at higher pH values for Amberlyst A26. On the other hand, phenols removal efficiency for Amberlite IRA-67 also increased with an increase in the pH value up 7, reaching phenols removal efficiencies close to 57%. In addition, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Clark models were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves. The simulation of the best-performing operational condition was used to evaluate the process performances for different inlet phenols concentrations (5, 25 and 100 mg L-1) The results showed an increase in initial phenols concentration improved the adsorption capacity. In both cases, the Thomas model was found to give best fit to experiment data for the three initial phenols concentrations, followed by the Yoon-Nelson and Clark models. Finally, column regeneration studies showed almost 100% phenols recovery efficiencies were obtained. IE process led to a phenols solution susceptible to be concentrated and used in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical sectors. (C) 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, wastewater and sludge samples of two major hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan were analyzed by developing an HPLC-UV method for the possible occurrence of five frequently used fluoroquinolone antibiotics i.e. ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. The highest detected concentration was for moxifloxacin in both wastewater (224 mu g/L) and sludge samples (219 mu g/kg. The highest concentration of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and gemifloxacin were found to be 66,18,58 and 0.2 mu g/L respectively. Risk quotient (RQ) was also calculated based on maximum measured concentrations and the RQ values were very high particularly for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The maximum RQ values for ofloxacin against Vibrio fisheri, Pseudomonas putida, fish, Daphnia, Green algae and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were 3300, 66,000, 124, 46, 3300 and 6000, respectively. In case of ciprofloxacin, RQ values were found to be 1750 and 3500 against green algae and Microcystis aeruginosa, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil and vegetables are the most integral environmental segments for human and animal life. Day by day both of these segments are becoming polluted by anthropogenic resources, and one of the major sources of contamination is pharmaceutical wastewater entering environment. Contamination levels of antibiotics namely ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin (LEV), oxytetracycline (OTC), and doxycycline were determined (found) in soil and vegetables samples in surrounding areas of pharmaceutical industry. HPLC with DAD detector, C-18 column and solid-phase cartridges were used to extract and analyze antibiotic residues in soil, carrot, wheat, and spinach samples. In wheat samples, LEV and OFL in spinach and carrot samples were accumulated highest. OFL, in soil of wheat and spinach samples, and OTC, in soil of carrot samples, were determined as highest level contaminant. In all types of vegetable samples, the contamination of each antibiotic was highest in leaves and lowest in fruits. The order of accumulation was leaves > stem/shoot > root > fruit. The contamination level was higher in soil samples than vegetable samples. Plants and vegetables directly or indirectly are part of human food. From soil, antibiotics accumulates to plants and vegetables, and leach to groundwater.

AB BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration (UF) has led to the recovery of valuable products from seafood processing wastes. However, the use of crustacean process wastewaters as a source of bioactive compounds with application in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries has been scarcely studied to date.
   RESULTS: This study reports the recovery of high concentrations of astaxanthin (10(-13) mu g mL(-1)) by 300 kDa ultrafiltration of shrimp cooking wastewater, indicating that astaxanthin is associated with high MW retained proteins. Individual UF with 300, 100 and 30 kDa MWCO membranes and the sequential UF 100 -> 30 kDa were the most effective configurations for protein concentration. Hydrolysates from these three protein-concentrated fractions showed very potent ACE-inhibitory (1.98, 9.87 and 23.10 mu g mL(-1) IC50 values) and beta-carotene bleaching activities compared with hydrolysates from other fish and seafood species.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, shrimp cooking wastewater is a good source of astaxanthin and bioactive peptides. This approach based on the ultrafiltration of shrimp cooking wastewaters contributes towards the depuration of this by-product, while enabling the recovery and production of high value-added products.

AB Animal waste products from concentrated animal feeding operations are a significant source of antibiotics to the environment. Monensin, an ionophore antibiotic commonly used to increase feed efficiency in livestock, is known to have varied toxicological effects on nontarget species. The current study builds on prior studies evaluating the impact of dairy management on groundwater quality by examining the transport of monensin in an agricultural field with coarse-textured soils during irrigation with lagoon wastewater. The dairy is located in California's San Joaquin Valley, where groundwater can be encountered <5 m below the surface. Groundwater samples were collected from a network of monitoring wells installed throughout the dairy and adjacent to irrigated fields before and after an irrigation event, which allowed for measurement of monensin potentially reaching the shallow groundwater as a direct result of irrigation with lagoon water. Monensin was extracted from water samples via hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid-phase extraction and quantified with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Irrigation water was found to contain up to 1.6 mu g L-1 monensin, but monensin was only detected in monitoring wells surrounding the waste storage lagoon. Water chemistry changes in the wells bordering the irrigated field suggest that up to 7% of irrigation water reached groundwater within days of irrigation. The study suggests that contamination of groundwater with monensin can occur primarily by compromised waste storage systems and that rapid transport of monensin to groundwater is not likely to occur from a single irrigation event.

AB Application of manure, biosolids, and recycled wastewater to croplands could be a potential pathway through which trace organic compounds (TOrCs) may be taken up by food crops. We present a framework to prepare a short list of TOrCs for detailed risk assessment and evaluation in terms of bioaccumulation. The framework was modified from Lipinski's method to predict drug permeability based on four critical properties: (i) molecular weight (MW); (ii) lipophilicity (expressed as logKow, the octanol-water partition coefficient); (iii) H-bond acceptors; and (iv) H-bond donors. The literature shows that the compounds with MW ranging from 200 to 500 can readily diffuse through mammalian membranes, the uptake of compounds with logKow >5 is hindered, and an excessive number of H-bond donors and H-bond acceptors reduces the permeability across a mammalian membrane bilayer. In general, mammalian and plant membranes are similar in structure and functions. Based on these four properties, we developed the "Rule of 3," which states that greater absorption and higher permeability of a TOrC is likely when its logK(ow) is <3, its MW is <300, H-bond donors are <3, and H-bond acceptors are <6. Applicability of the framework was tested with published data, which showed that uptake and bioaccumulation of TOrCs in plants decreased in the order: Rule of 3 >Rule of 3 to 5 (logK(ow) between 3 and 5, MW between 300 and 500, H-bond acceptors between 3 and 6, and H-bond donors between 3 and 5) >Rule of 5 (logK(ow) >5, MW >500, H-bond acceptors >10, and H-bond donors <5). We conclude that TOrCs following the "Rule of 3" could be prioritized for detailed risk assessment involving dietary exposure.

AB Hospital wastewater is an important source of emerging contaminants. Recent studies emphasize the importance of assessing the effects of mixtures of contaminants rather than environmental risk of their individual components, as well as the determination of intrinsic toxicity of wastewater. Mixtures of pollutants has possible interactions that have notable environmental side effects. The aim of this study is an attempt to characterize biomarkers in Cyprinus carpio related to the exposure to a complex mixture of contaminants found in hospital wastewater. Results of a particular hospital effluent show the presence of traces of heavy metals, high chlorine concentration and emerging contaminants such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The LC50 was of 5.49 % at 96 h. The cytotoxic, genotoxic and apoptotic biomarkers increase when fishes were exposed to wastewater (1/10 CL50) from hospital wastewater. This study emphasizes the importance of identifying and quantifying the effects of contaminants as pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and surfactants in order to design and implement an ecotoxicologycal plan.

AB Wastewater (WW) for irrigation and application of biosolids in soil is becoming important as it is going to become very common in the near future. By 2050, the world is going to have four billion people living in water-scarce countries, making it a norm of freshwater for the cities and WW for agriculture. Further, biosolids might still be used as green biofertilizers for soils, if they are improved from an ecological point of view. However, application of biosolids in soil is argued because of the amount of organic pollutants that compromise the dynamic equilibrium of the biological systems. Therefore, information on the concentration, behavior, and cycling of organic pollutants as well as their possible degradation pathways is needed to predict, prevent, and remediate these pollutants from different sources including WW and biosolids. Among the group of organic pollutants, emerging contaminants (ECs) enter into the soil with the irrigation water from treated effluents and fertilization by biosolids. Quantification of ECs from WW and biosolids is of main importance to predict the toxic effects of WW effluents and sludge. Moreover, their incorporation into vegetables through irrigation and their magnification through natural food webs have been proved and must be monitored. This review presents information on the different sources of emerging contaminants and linking with the ecological effects they produced by reacting in the environment during various applications of WW and biosolids in soil. The available methods for analysis and quantification of ECs in different matrices, such as WW and biosolids, are also presented.

AB This study investigates the environmental fate of eight benzophenone derivatives (the pharmaceutical ketoprofen, its phototransformation products 3-ethylbenzophenone and 3-acetylbenzophenone, and five benzophenone-type UV filters) by evaluating their photolytic behaviour. In addition, the genotoxicity of these compounds and the produced photodegradation mixtures was studied. Laboratory-scale irradiation experiments using a medium pressure UV lamp revealed that photodegradation of benzophenones follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. Ketoprofen was the most photolabile (t(1/2) = 0.8 min), while UV filters were more resistant to UV light with t(1/2) between 17 and 99 h. The compounds were also exposed to irradiation by natural sunlight and showed similar photostability as predicted under laboratory conditions. Solar photodegradation experiments were performed in distilled water, lake and seawater, and revealed that photosensitizers present in natural waters significantly affect the photolytic behaviour of the investigated compounds. In this case, the presence of lake water resulted in accelerated photodecomposition, while seawater showed different effects on photodegradation, depending on a compound. Further, it was shown that the transformation products of ketoprofen 3-ethylbenzophenone and 3-acetylbenzophenone were formed under environmental conditions when ketoprofen was exposed to natural sunlight. Genotoxicity testing of parent benzophenone compounds using the SOS/umuC assay revealed that UV filters exhibited weak genotoxic activity in the presence of a metabolic activation system, however the concentrations tested were much higher than found in the environment (>= 125 mu g mL(-1)). After irradiation of benzophenones, the produced photodegradation mixtures showed that, with the exception of benzophenone that exhibited weak genotoxic activity, all the other compounds tested did not elicit any activity when exposed to UV light.

AB As irrigation with untreated wastewater often leads to an accumulation of contaminants in soils, nowadays, treated wastewater is increasingly used for irrigation. Here, we investigated whether and to which degree irrigation with treated wastewater might cause desorption of antibiotics from three soils (Leptosol, Phaeozem, Vertisol) and a sediment (Endh reservoir) of the Mezquital Valley, Mexico, that were exposed to untreated wastewater in the past.
   We performed sequential batch desorption experiments with treated wastewater, artificial wastewater with anionic surfactants, and artificial wastewater without surfactants.
   We observed no desorption, but net sorption of ciprofloxacin in contact with treated wastewater containing 3.475 mu g L-1 of ciprofloxacin. Sulfamethoxazole was desorbed from the Leptosol, the Phaeozem, and the Vertisol in a similar degree with and without surfactant, but not from sediment, where no sulfamethoxazole was detected. In contact with treated wastewater containing 1.045 mu g L-1 of sulfamethoxazole, it was desorbed from the Leptosol and the Phaeozem with low clay, Fe oxide, and organic matter contents, whereas the Vertisol and sediment showed a net sulfamethoxazole sorption. Desorption could be described with a bi-phasic kinetic desorption model, with most sulfamethoxazole being desorbed via a rate-limited process from poorly accessible binding sites, where it had been accumulated during the long-term irrigation in the past.
   We conclude that a potential release of pharmaceuticals as a result from changes in wastewater irrigation is soil specific: Leptosols and Phaeozems of the Mezquital Valley might act as long-term sources of the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole, though not of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin.

AB In this study, we investigated a protocatechuate catabolic gene cluster involved in naphthalene degradation in Rhodococcus ruber OA1. Rhodococcus ruber OA1 was isolated from the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant of Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Zibo, China). Substrate utilization tests showed that OA1 utilizes naphthalene, phenol, benzoate, salicylate, and protocatechuate as the sole carbon and energy sources for growth. A degradation assay revealed that phthalate is an intermediate in naphthalene degradation and that the protocatechuate pathway plays an important role in naphthalene degradation. To determine the genetic basis and regulation of protocatechuate catabolism in OA1, a fosmid genomic library was constructed and a positive clone carrying the protocatechuate degradation gene cluster was isolated. Sequencing and a bioinformatics analysis identified the complete gene cluster, pcaJIGHBARC, responsible for protocatechuate degradation. Based on this gene cluster, the genes pcaGH (encoding the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, 3,4-PCD) were coexpressed and the expressed products showed 3,4-PCD activity. This study illustrates a potential pathway of naphthalene degradation and identifies a protocatechuate pathway in Rhodococcus ruber OA1 for the first time, thus extending our understanding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and the related aromatic compounds degraded in the process.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants and are released into surface waters resulting in toxin accumulation. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of solar irradiation on PhACs in wastewater using immobilized TiO2 present as a catalyst, and to study the potential of this photocatalysis technique as a post-treatment process for wastewater effluent. We treated a mixture of PhACs spiked in wastewater effluent and in deionized water as a control with simulated solar irradiation for 96h. Experiments were conducted with immobilized TiO2 (photocatalysis) and without (photolysis). First, TiO2 was successfully immobilized on 200-500 mu m sand by using a sol-gel method. The photocatalysis resulted in high removal efficiencies for poorly biodegradable PhACs in wastewater effluent: 100% for propranolol, 100% for diclofenac, and 76 +/- 3% for carbamazepine. Photodegradation of all four PhACs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the kinetic constant of photocatalysis was much higher than that of photolysis in the absence of a catalyst. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater effluent enhanced photodegradation of PhACs by producing reactive radicals. However, at the same time, DOM inhibited photodegradation, possibly because DOM reforms the oxidation intermediates of PhACs into parent compounds. From an application perspective, water depth was confirmed as a key factor in photodegradation of PhACs due to light attenuation by modelling and experimental results. In addition, after photocatalysis, toxicity of PhACs decreased and biodegradability of wastewater effluent increased slightly. In conclusion, the technique is a promising post-treatment process to improve water quality, prior to discharging to natural waters or to polishing water treatment systems such as wetlands and lagoons.

AB Freshwater mussels are frequently found in rivers receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), and there is strong evidence that poor water quality is deleterious to freshwater mussel populations. WWTPs are among the main sources of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters. We monitored 145 PPCPs in wild and caged mussels both upstream and downstream of the Kitchener WWTP in the Grand River, Ontario, as well as 118 PPCPs in water samples. Our objectives were to characterize the seasonal changes in PPCP concentrations in water, to calculate bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PPCPs in mussels, and to determine the chemical and physical properties of PPCPs driving the bioaccumulation. Seventy PPCPs were detected in water, and concentrations were highest in the summer or early fall, which corresponded to low river flow. Forty-three PPCPs from many pharmaceutical classes were detected in mussel tissues, including stimulants, a contrasting agent, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-bacterial agents, antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, progestins, and illicit drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. The BAFs ranged from 0.66 for metformin to 32 022 for sertraline. Using partial least squares to predict BAFs based upon chemical properties, log K-OC, Log K-OW, and fugacity ratio (sediment) all had similar and positive loadings with BAFs ((RX)-X-2 = 0.70; caged mussels). BAFs of PPCPs in mussels were predictable from fugacity models that estimate bioconcentration factors using log K-OW. Our study demonstrated that mussels readily bioaccumulate PPCPs, in a manner consistent with expectations based upon BCF models and the chemical characteristics of each compound.

AB Biosolids are extensively used in agriculture as fertilizers while offering a practical solution for waste disposal. Many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), such as triclosan and triclocarban, are enriched in biosolids. Biosolid amendment changes soil physicochemical properties, which may in turn alter the persistence of PPCPs and hence the risk for secondary contamination such as plant uptake. To delineate the effect of biosolids on PPCPs persistence, triclosan and triclocarban were used as model compounds in this study and their sorption (K-d) and persistence (t(1/2)) were determined in different soils before and after biosolid amendment. Biosolids consistently increased sorption of triclosan and triclocarban in soil. The K-d of triclosan increased by 3.9-21 times following amendment of a sandy loam soil with biosolids at 2-10%. The persistence of both compounds was prolonged, with t(1/2) of triclosan increasing from 10 d in the unamended soil to 63 d after biosolid amendment at 10%. The relationship between t(1/2) and K-d was further examined through a meta-analysis using data from this study and all relevant published studies. A significant linear relationship between t(1/2) and K-d was observed for triclosan (r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.01) and triclocarban (r(2) = 0.38, p < 0.05) in biosolid-amended soils. On the average, when biosolid amendment increased by 1%, t(1/2) of triclosan was prolonged by 7.5 d, while t(1/2) of triclocarban was extended by 4.7 d. Therefore, biosolid amendment greatly enhances persistence of triclosan and triclocarban, likely due to enhanced sorption or decreased chemical bioavailability. This finding highlights the importance to consider the effect of biosolids when evaluating the environmental risks of these and other biosolid-borne PPCPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The acute waste management problems, coupled with the proliferation of small scale industries in many developing countries, make low quality water treatment before use inevitable in the long run. These industries have the potential to discharge effluent containing chemicals and heavy metals into the environment. The indiscriminative use of pharmaceutical products by households in many of these countries is another source of health concern. Low quality water treatment in these countries has however been hampered by the high cost of infrastructure provision and maintenance. Cost-sharing among stakeholders appears to be a promising strategy to finance and maintain the wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study therefore, the willingness and ability of urban open space commercial vegetable farmers to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation purposes has been assessed. One hundred open space commercial vegetable farmers and four vegetable farmers' associations were selected and interviewed in Kumasi in Ghana using semi-structured interview schedules and interview guides respectively. The results of the study show that approximately three out of every five vegetable farmers were willing to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation. The results further show that the probability of being willing to pay by farmers who agreed that the current water they used for irrigation was harmful is approximately 5.3 times greater than that of those who did not. The analysis of the farmers' ability to pay revealed that all the farmers would be capable of paying for reclaimed water at a price of US$0.11/m(3). This has implications for land tenure security and vegetable consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for the produce.

AB Activated carbon processes, initially designed for drinking water production, are tested for wastewater application in order to characterize their efficiency to remove micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharges. In that purpose, a pilot was studied by the Paris sanitation service (SIAAP) and the water environment and urban systems laboratory (LEESU). The in-situ study raised several additional questions related to the structural and morphological properties of activated carbons, in order to select the proper material, the influence of operational parameters such as the activated carbon dose and the contact time, the role of organic matter concentration and composition, the presence of a residual concentration of methanol or the impact of ferric chloride addition. Thus, various complementary experiments were carried out at laboratory scale to improve the understanding of the micropollutants adsorption process on activated carbon, in particular on powdered activated carbon (PAC).
   The results have highlighted a strong link between the efficiency of PACs and their specific surface (BET), which can be easily estimated by their bulk density. The study of the sorption process has also confirmed the strong influence of the PAC dose and the rapidity of the sorption kinetic. From an operational point of view, the ferric chloride injection seems to slightly improve most of the detected compounds adsorption, probably thanks to the coagulation of the dissolved organic matter colloidal fraction. In contrary, the presence in the water of a residual concentration of methanol seems to have no impact on the micropollutant fate. The influence of the wastewater matrix is strong, with notably lower adsorption in water from primary settling compared to various WWTP discharges. However, the dissolved organic carbon concentration is not always sufficient to explain sorption competitions in wastewater, and the nature of the organic matter should be considered too. In particular, the carbon removal from biological treatments is the step that clearly modifies both the quantity and the composition of the organic matter. It has been observed that discharges from WWTPs operating with different biological processes (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor or biofiltration) have similar organic matter concentrations and compositions, and allows comparable removals of organic matter and micropollutants by adsorption. The lower performances on micropollutants observed in the settled water can be explained by the higher quantity of protein-like molecules (fluorophores I delta and I gamma), which compose the most competitive organic matter fraction for adsorption on activated carbon, compared to the other waters.

AB With rising demands on water supplies necessitating water reuse, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is often used to irrigate agricultural lands. Emerging contaminants, like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), are frequently found in effluent due to limited removal during WWTP processes. Concern has arisen about the environmental fate of PPCPs, especially regarding plant uptake. The aim of this study was to analyze uptake of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, and carbamazepine in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants that were spray-irrigated with WWTP effluent. Wheat was collected before and during harvest, and plants were divided into grain and straw. Subsamples were rinsed with methanol to remove compounds adhering to surfaces. All plant tissues underwent liquid-solid extraction, solid-phase extraction cleanup, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Residues of each compound were present on most plant surfaces. Ofloxacin was found throughout the plant, with higher concentrations in the straw (10.2 +/- 7.05 ng g(-1)) and lower concentrations in the grain (2.28 +/- 0.89 ng g(-1)). Trimethoprim was found only on grain or straw surfaces, whereas carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were concentrated within the grain (1.88 +/- 2.11 and 0.64 +/- 0.37 ng g(-1), respectively). These findings demonstrate that PPCPs can be taken up into wheat plants and adhere to plant surfaces when WWTP effluent is spray-irrigated. The presence of PPCPs within and on the surfaces of plants used as food sources raises the question of potential health risks for humans and animals.

AB Pharmaceuticals, newly recognized classes of environmental pollutants, are becoming increasingly problematic contaminants of either surface water or ground water around industrial and residential communities. Pharmaceuticals are constantly released into aquatic environments, mainly due to their widespread consumption and complicated removal in wastewater treatment plants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis appear to be one of the most destructive advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for organic contaminants and are possible to obtain complete mineralization of organic pollutants into eco-friendly end products under visible and solar light irradiation. In this study, flower-like In S-2(3) hierarchical nanostructures were successfully prepared via a facile solution-phase route, using thioacetamide as both sulfur source and capping agent. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the flowers revealed that the cubic structure of In2S3; morphological studies examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the synthesized In2S3 nanostructure was flowerlike hierarchitecture assembled from nanoscale flakes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the stoichiometry of In2S3 nanoflowers. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity studies revealed that the prepared indium(III) sulfide(In2S3) nanoflowers exhibit an excellent photocatalytic performance, degrading rapidly the aqueous pharmaceutical solution of Lisinopril under visible light irradiation. These results suggest that In2S3 nanoflowers will be a promising candidate of photocatalyst working in thevisible light range.

AB This study investigated for the first time the photocatalytic degradation of three well-known transformation products (TPs) of pharmaceutical Tramadol, N-desmethyl-(N-DES), N,N-bidesmethyl (N,N-Bi-DES) and N-oxide-tramadol (N-OX-TRA) in two different aquatic matrices, ultrapure water and secondary treated wastewater, with high (10 mg L-1) and low (50 mu g L-1) initial concentrations, respectively. Total disappearance of the parent compounds was attained in all experiments. For initial concentration of 10 mg L-1, the target compounds were degraded within 30-40 min and a mineralization degree of more than 80% was achieved after 240 min of irradiation, while the contained organic nitrogen was released mainly as NH4+ for N-DES, N, N-Bi-DES and NO3- for N-OX-TRA. The degradation rates of all the studied compounds were considerably decreased in the wastewater due to the presence of inorganic and organic constituents typically found in effluents and environmental matrices which may act as scavengers of the HO center dot. The effect of pH (4, 6.7, 10) in the degradation rates was studied and for N-DES-TRA and N,N-Bi-DES-TRA, the optimum pH value was 6.7. In contrast, N-OX-TRA showed an increasing trend in the photocatalytic degradation kinetic in alkaline solutions (pH 10). The major transformation products were identified by high resolution accurate mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (HR-LC-MS). Scavenging experiments indicated for all studied compounds the important role of HO center dot in the photocatalytic degradation pathways that included mainly hydroxylation and further oxidation of the parent compounds. In addition, Microtox bioassay (Vibrio fischeri) was employed for evaluating the ecotoxicity of photocatalytically treated solutions. Results clearly demonstrate the progressive decrease of the toxicity and the efficiency of the photocatalytic process in the detoxification of the irradiated solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of acoustic cavitation for water and wastewater treatment (cleaning) is a well known procedure. Yet, the use of hydrodynamic cavitation as a sole technique or in combination with other techniques such as ultrasound has only recently been suggested and employed.
   In the first part of this paper a general overview of techniques that employ hydrodynamic cavitation for cleaning of water and wastewater is presented.
   In the second part of the paper the focus is on our own most recent work using hydrodynamic cavitation for removal of pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, carbamazepine), toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa), green microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris), bacteria (Legionella pneumophila) and viruses (Rotavirus) from water and wastewater.
   As will be shown, hydrodynamic cavitation, like acoustic, can manifest itself in many different forms each having its own distinctive properties and mechanisms. This was until now neglected, which eventually led to poor performance of the technique. We will show that a different type of hydrodynamic cavitation (different removal mechanism) is required for successful removal of different pollutants.
   The path to use hydrodynamic cavitation as a routine water cleaning method is still long, but recent results have already shown great potential for optimisation, which could lead to a low energy tool for water and wastewater cleaning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, microbial community dynamics were assessed in two lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs). One of the reactors was fed by synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewater with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as the test reactor and the other without sulfamethoxazole as the control reactor. DNA based DGGE results indicated that Clostiridum sp. became dominant in the SMX reactor while the inoculum was dominated with Firmicutes (61%) and Methanomicrobiales (28%). However their abundances in active community decreased through the last phase. Also the abundance of hydro-genotrophs was high in each phase, while acetoclastic methanogens disappeared in the last phase. Q-PCR analysis revealed that there is a significant reduction in the bacterial community approximately 84%, while methanogens increased to 97% through the operation. Additionally an increase in the expression level of bacterial and methanogenic 16S rRNA (60% and 20%, respectively) was detected. Significant correlation between microbial community and the reactor operation data was found. The study demonstrated that the microbial community maintains the system stability under high antibiotic concentration and long-term operation by homoacetogenesis coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.

AB In an effort to mitigate the discharge of micropollutants to surface waters, adsorption of micropollutants onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) after conventional wastewater treatment has been identified as a promising technology for enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals and pesticides from wastewater. We investigated the effectiveness of super-fine powdered activated carbon, SPAC, (ca. 1 mu m mean particle diameter) in comparison to regular-sized PAC (17-37 mu m mean diameter) for the optimization of micropollutant removal from wastewater. Adsorption isotherms and batch kinetic experiments were performed for 10 representative micropollutants (bezafibrate, benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gabapentin, mecoprop, metoprolol, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) onto three commercial PACs and their super-fine variants in carbonate buffer and in wastewater effluent. SPAC showed substantially faster adsorption kinetics of all micropollutants than conventional PAC, regardless of the micropollutant adsorption affinity and the solution matrix. The total adsorptive capacities of SPAC were similar to those of PAC for two of the three tested carbon materials, in all tested waters. However, in effluent wastewater, the presence of effluent organic matter adversely affected micropollutant removal, resulting in lower removal efficiencies especially for micropollutants with low affinity for adsorbent particles in comparison to pure water. In comparison to PAC, SPAC application resulted in up to two-fold enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from effluent wastewater. The more efficient adsorption process using SPAC translates into a reduction of contact time and contact tank size as well as reduced carbon dosing for a targeted micropollutant removal. In the tested effluent wastewater (5 mg/L DOC), the necessary dose to achieve 80% average removal of indicator micropollutants (benzotriazole, diclofenac, carbamazepine, mecoprop and sulfamethoxazole) ranged between 13 and 15 mg/L. These promising results warrant pilot-scale tests using super-fine PAC as an alternative to PAC for more efficient micropollutant removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biologically treated cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater is a complex industrial wastewater that is toxic and refractory for further biological treatment. For this purpose, a novel sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation-driven process using a nanocoated electrode has been developed to treat such wastewater. In the process, the synergy and mechanism of the sonoelectrochemistry using ultrasound enhancement of the nanocoated electrode activity to treat the wastewater was studied. The nanocoated electrode generated more radicals than the traditional coated electrode did; in the presence of ultrasonic waves, the mass-transfer effects on the nanocoated electrode surface were enhanced, resulting in rapid diffusion of the generated hydroxyl radicals into the solution, and quickly reacted with organic pollutants. Compared with the traditional coated electrode, the effect of the nanocoated electrode used on the wastewater treatment process was more enhanced by ultrasound under the same conditions. The biotoxicity of the wastewater in the sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation process was monitored and shown as having first increased and then decreased. The optimum operating conditions resulted in a 94% removal efficiency for COD and consisted of a current of density 8 mA/cm(2) and an ultrasound frequency of 45 kHz. All of the results showed that the sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation-driven process was found to be a very efficient method for the treatment of non-biodegradable cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB To simulate complex pollutant conditions encountered in wastewater treatment plant influents, a solution containing three common pharmaceuticals was prepared. The adsorbents were exposed to various dilutions (1-100 mg/L) of a solution containing equal amounts carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TMP). The adsorbents were composed of varying proportions of sewage sludge and fish waste, such that the former represented 100%, 90%, 75% and 25% of the composition, while the remainder consisted of fish waste. Adsorption isotherms were used to determine adsorption capacity for each pharmaceutical. To understand the surface changes during adsorption, analysis by TA-MS and potentiometric titration were carried out. The results were compared to those obtained for single component pharmaceutical solutions. CBZ was consistently adsorbed from the multi-component solution in greater quantities than was either SMX or TMP on all adsorbents. The adsorption of SMX was most negatively impacted by the presence of multiple pharmaceuticals. The best adsorbent performance varied depending on the pharmaceutical, as the mechanism of adsorption varied between pharmaceuticals, with CBZ interacting more with the carbon phase of the material, whereas SMX and TMP were more apt to react with the inorganic content.

AB In this study, the performance of bezafibrate (BZF) degradation and detoxification in the aqueous phase using cerium-modified red mud (RM) catalysts prepared using different cerium sources and synthesis methods were evaluated. Experimental results showed that the surface cerium modification was responsible for the development of the catalytic activity of RM and this was influenced by the cerium source and the synthesis method. Catalyst prepared from cerium (IV) by precipitation was found to show the best catalytic activity in BZF degradation and detoxification. Reactive oxygen species including peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, and super oxide ions were identified in all reactions and we proposed the corresponding catalytic reaction mechanism for each catalyst that prepared from different cerium source and method. This was supported by the intermediates profiles that were generated upon BZF degradation. The surface and the structural properties of cerium-modified RM were characterized in detail by several analytical methods. Two interesting findings were made: (1) the surface texture (specific surface area and mesoporous volume) influenced the catalytic reaction pathway; and (2) Ce(III) species and oxygen vacancies Were generated on the surface of the catalyst after cerium modification. This plays an important role in the development of the catalytic activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extensive usage of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and their discharge through domestic sewage have been recently recognized as a new generation environmental concern which deserves more scientific attention over the classical environmental pollutants. The major issues of this type of effluent addressed in this study were its colour, triclosan and anionic surfactant (SDS) content. Samples of cosmetic effluent were collected from different beauty treatment salons and spas in and around Kolkata, India and treated in bioreactors containing a bacterial consortium isolated from activated sludge samples collected from a common effluent treatment plant. Members of the consortium were isolated and identified as Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp. and Comamonas sp. The biotreated effluent was subjected to ultrafiltration (UF) involving indigenously prepared ceramic membranes in both side-stream and submerged mode. Analysis of the MBR treated effluent revealed 99.22%, 98.56% and 99.74% removal of colour, triclosan and surfactant respectively. Investigation of probable acute and chronic cyto-genotoxic potential of the untreated and treated effluents along with their possible participation in triggering oxidative stress was carried out with Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch). Comet formation recorded in both liver and gill cells and micronucleus count in peripheral erythrocytes of individuals exposed to untreated effluent increased with duration of exposure and was significantly higher than those treated with UF permeates which in turn neared control levels. Results of this study revealed successful application of the isolated bacterial consortium in MBR process for efficient detoxification of cosmetic effluent thereby conferring the same suitable for discharge and/or reuse.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is an important technique for potable water reuse. However, the problem of membrane fouling in RO must be addressed for its widespread use. In this study, fouling in RO was investigated with 2540 membrane elements fed with effluents from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating municipal wastewater. The results of chemical cleaning, elemental analysis for a cross section of the fouled membrane and microwave digestion of the fouled membrane suggested that silica was a major player in the membrane fouling. Also, organic matter present in the MBR effluent (mainly composed of soluble microbial products) was found to play an important role in the evolution of membrane fouling. A unique experimental setup enabled investigation of the interaction between silica and organic matter in the membrane fouling in RO: concentrations of silica and organic matter in the feedwater were manipulated. Remarkable membrane fouling occurred only when feedwater containing both silica and organic matter was filtered. It was found that silica or organic matter alone did not cause severe membrane fouling in the RO. The co -presence of silica and organic matter seems to have synergetic effects that cause severe membrane fouling in RO. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The drug ibuprofen (IBP) appears frequently in the wastewater discharge from pharmaceutical industries. This paper reports studies in degradation of IBP employing hybrid technique of sono-enzymatic treatment. This paper also establishes synergy between individual mechanisms of enzyme and sonolysis for IBP degradation by identification of degradation intermediates, and Arrhenius & thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data. Positive synergy between sonolysis and enzyme treatment is attributed to formation of hydrophilic intermediates during degradation. These intermediates form due to hydroxylation and oxidation reactions induced by radicals formed during transient cavitation. Activation energy and enthalpy change in sono-enzymatic treatment are lower as compared to enzyme treatment, while frequency factor and entropy change are higher as compared to sonolysis. Degradation of IBP in sono-enzymatic treatment is revealed to be comparable with other hybrid techniques like photo-Fenton, sono-photocatalysis, and sono-Fenton. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is one of the most widespread emerging contaminants and has adverse impact on aquatic ecosystem, yet little is known about its complete biodegradation mechanism in bacteria. Sphingomonas sp, strain YL-JM2C, isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant, was very effective on degrading TCS. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the conditions like temperature and pH. From RSM, the optimal TCS degradation conditions were found to be 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. Under optimal conditions, strain YL-JM2C completely mineralized TCS (5 mg L-1) within 72 h. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2-chlorohydroquinone and hydroquinone are three main by-products of TCS. Furthermore, stable isotope experimental results revealed that the C-13(12)-TCS was completely mineralized into CO2 and part of heavier carbon (C-13) of labeled TCS was utilized by strain YL-JM2C to synthesize fatty acids (PLFAs). Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and degradation test results suggested that the strain could enhance degradation capacity of TCS through increasing CSH. In addition, the bacterium also completely degraded spiked TCS (5 mg L-1) in wastewater collected from the wastewater treatment plant. Hence, these results suggest that the strain has potential to remediate TCS in the environment.

AB Like many insects, mosquitoes, rely on endosymbionts to grow and develop. These can be acquired from the environment. We used next generation 454 pyrosequencing to discern the whole-body microbiome of the mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus in various larval stadia and following exposure to common pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) found in wastewater. PPCP treatments included environmentally-relevant concentrations; 1) a combination of common antibiotics, 2) a combination of mammalian hormones, 3) a mixture of the antibiotic and hormone treatments plus acetaminophen and caffeine and, 4) an untreated control. Within control groups, the predominant families of bacterial symbionts change with each larval instar despite consistent diets and rearing conditions. This trend was also seen in hormone treatments but not in the antibiotic or the mixture treatments. Richness and evenness were reduced in both antibiotic and mixture treatments, suggesting that antibiotics remove certain bacteria or inhibit them from increasing to proportions seen in the control treatment. Interestingly, the mixture treatments had greater richness and evenness compared to antibiotic alone treatments, possibly due to the other contaminants facilitating growth of different bacteria. These findings illuminate the complexity of the microbiome of C. quinquefasciatus and may have implications for more effective control strategies.

AB The presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and artificial sweeteners are of concern to water providers because they may be incompletely removed by wastewater treatment processes and they pose an unknown risk to consumers due to long-term consumption of low concentrations of these compounds. This study utilized pilot-scale conventional and biological drinking water treatment processes to assess the removal of nine PhACs and EDCs, and two artificial sweeteners. Conventional treatment (coagulation, flocculation, settling, non-biological dual-media filtration) was compared to biofilters with or without the addition of in-line coagulant (0.2-0.8 mg Al3+ /L; alum or PACl). A combination of biofiltration, with or without in-line alum, and conventional filtration was able to reduce 7 of the 9 PhACs and EDCs by more than 50% from river water while artificial sweeteners were inconsistently removed by conventional treatment or biofiltration. Increasing doses of PACl from 0 to 0.8 mg/L resulted in average removals of PhACs, EDCs increasing from 39 to 70% and artificial sweeteners removal increasing from similar to 15% to similar to 35% in lake water. These results suggest that a combination of biological, chemical and physical treatment can be applied to effectively reduce the concentration of EDCs, PhACs, and artificial sweeteners.

AB Clofibric acid is the metabolite and active principle of blood lipid regulators, it represents the class of acidic pharmaceuticals, and is one of the most persistent drug residues detected in the aquatic environment worldwide. This interdisciplinary work evaluates the effect of solution pH and water hardness in clofibric acid adsorption onto commercial activated carbons. Kinetic and equilibrium assays revealed that the highest clofibric acid removal efficiencies (>70%) were attained at pH 3, and that at pH 8 water hardness degree plays a fundamental role in the adsorption process. In hard water at pH 8 the removal efficiency values increased by 22 or 46% points depending on the carbon sample. Adsorbents' textural properties also affect the adsorption process since for the microporous sample (CP) the increase of water hardness has a great influence in kinetic and equilibrium data, while for the micro + mesoporous carbon (VP) the variation of the water hardness promoted less significant changes. At pH 3 the increase of water hardness leads to changes in the adsorption mechanism of clofibric acid onto CP carbon signaled by a transition from an S-type to an L-type curve. At pH 8 the change from deionized water to hard water doubles the maximum adsorption capacity of sample CP (101.7 mg g(-1) vs 211.9 mg g(-1), respectively).
   The adsorption enhancement, with water hardness under alkaline conditions, was reasoned in terms of calcium complexation with clofibrate anion exposed by molecular modeling and conductivity studies. Ca2+ complexation by other acidic organic compounds may also occur, and should be considered, since it can play a fundamental role in improved design of water treatment processes employing activated carbons.

AB River ecosystems are of immense ecological and social importance. Despite the introduction of wastewater treatment plants and advanced chemical authorization procedures in Europe, chemical pollution is still a major threat to freshwater ecosystems.
   Here, large-scale monitoring data was exploited to identify taxon-specific chemical concentrations beyond which benthic invertebrate taxa are unlikely to occur using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). 365 invertebrate taxa and 25 organic chemicals including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plasticisers, flame retardants, complexing agents, a surfactant and poly- and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a total of 399 sites were analysed. The number of taxa that responded to each of these chemicals varied between 0% and 21%. These sensitive taxa belonged predominantly to the groups Plecoptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Turbellaria, Megaloptera, Crustacea, and Diptera. Strong effects were observed in response to wastewater-associated compounds, confirming that wastewater is an important cause of biological degradation. The majority of change points identified for each compound were well below predicted no-effect concentrations derived from laboratory toxicity studies. Thus, the results show that chemicals are likely to induce effects in the environment at concentrations much lower than expected based on laboratory experiments.
   Overall, it is confirmed that chemical pollution is still an important factor shaping the distribution of invertebrate taxa, suggesting the need for continued efforts to reduce chemical loads in rivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reported significant suppressive matrix effects in analyses of six pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in activated sludge, sterilized activated sludge and untreated sewage by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative matrix evaluation on selected PPCPs supplemented the limited quantification data of matrix effects on mass spectrometric determination of PPCPs in complex environment samples. The observed matrix effects were chemical-specific and matrix-dependent, with the most pronounced average effect (-55%) was found on sulfadiazine in sterilized activated sludge. After correcting the matrix effects by post-spiking known amount of PPCPs, the removal mechanisms and biotransformation kinetics of selected PPCPs in activated sludge system were revealed by batch experiment. Experimental data elucidated that the removal of target PPCPs in the activated sludge process was mainly by biotransformation while contributions of adsorption, hydrolysis and volatilization could be neglected. High biotransformation efficiency (52%) was observed on diclofenac while other three compounds (sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and roxithromycin) were partially biotransformed by similar to 40%. The other two compounds, trimethoprim and carbamazepine, showed recalcitrant to biotransformation of the activated sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Relative stable aerobic granular sludge (AGS) formed in a newly constructed continue flow microbial fuel cell (cf-MFC) system. AGS bulking caused by filamentous over-growth was observed in treating simulated wastewater with COD concentration of around 1,000mg/L after more than 50d. Addition of pharmaceutical wastewater in the influent of the cf-MFC at COD concentration of around 1,500mg/L alleviated AGS bulking obviously, with average COD removal efficiency of 82.2%. However, AGS self-collapse happened after influent COD concentration of the pharmaceutical wastewater increased to around 2,500mg/L, corresponding COD removal efficiency decreased to 58.2% dramatically. High simultaneous nitrification and denitrification performance was obtained in the cf-MFC, which was affected by the addition of pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, appearance variations of the AGS under different operation conditions were shown.

AB The excess sludge from Up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor operated on source separated toilet wastewater is a potential source of nutrients and organic matter. It can be further stabilized and dried by composting and applied as a soil amendment. Presence of pathogens, heavy metals and micropollutants in the compost derived from anaerobic sludge is thus undesirable. This paper focuses on removal of micropollutants, typically present in domestic wastewater, via composting of UASB sludge with waste wood. Estrone, diclofenac, ibuprofen, metoprolol, carbamazepine, galaxolide and triclosan were spiked to a mixture of UASB sludge and waste wood. Their concentrations were monitored during 92 days of composting at controlled temperature conditions. All studied micropollutants were removed at various rates with overall removal ranging from 99.9% for ibuprofen, diclofenac and estrone to 87.8% for carbamazepine. Accumulation of methyltriclosan as by-product of triclosan degradation was observed. The prospects and limitations of the integration of a composting process into Source Separated Sanitation concepts are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stability and removal of the anti-anxiety drug diazepam (valium) from spiked wastewater samples were studied. An advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), utilizing ultrafiltration (UF), activated charcoal (AC), and reverse osmosis (RO) after the secondary biological treatment showed that UF and RO were relatively sufficient in removing spiked diazepam to a safe level. Kinetic studies in both pure water (abiotic degradation) and in sludge (biotic degradation) at room temperature were investigated. Diazepam showed high chemical stability toward degradation in pure water, and underwent faster biodegradation in sludge providing two main degradation products. The degradation reactions in sludge and pure water showed first-order kinetics with rate constant values of 2.6x10(-7)s(-1) and 9.08x10(-8)s(-1), respectively (half-life=31 and 88d, respectively). Adsorption of diazepam by activated carbon and composite micelle-clay (octadecyltrimethylammonium montmorillonite) complex was studied using both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Based on the determination coefficient, Langmuir isotherm was found to better fit the data, indicating the retention of diazepam monolayer on both adsorbents. Filtration of 100mgL(-1) solutions of diazepam by micelle-clay filter yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of 2mLmin(-1).

AB Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are more efficient than non-nitrifying WWTPs to remove several micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This may be related to the activity of nitrifying organisms, such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOBs), which could possibly co-metabolically oxidize micropollutants with their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). The role of AOBs in micropollutant removal was investigated with aerobic granular sludge (AGS), a promising technology for municipal WWTPs. Two identical laboratory-scale AGS sequencing batch reactors (AGS-SBRs) were operated with or without nitrification (inhibition of AMOs) to assess their potential for micropollutant removal. Of the 36 micropollutants studied at 1 mu g l(-1) in synthetic wastewater, nine were over 80% removed, but 17 were eliminated by less than 20%. Five substances (bisphenol A, naproxen, irgarol, terbutryn and iohexol) were removed better in the reactor with nitrification, probably due to co-oxidation catalysed by AMOs. However, for the removal of all other micropollutants, AOBs did not seem to play a significant role. Many compounds were better removed in aerobic condition, suggesting that aerobic heterotrophic organisms were involved in the degradation. As the AGS-SBRs did not favour the growth of such organisms, their potential for micropollutant removal appeared to be lower than that of conventional nitrifying WWTPs.

AB Organic micropollutants (MPs), in particular xenobiotics and their transformation products, have been detected in the aquatic environment and the main sources of these MPs are wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, an additional cleaning step is necessary. The use of activated carbon (AC) is one approach to providing this additional cleaning. Industrial AC derived from different carbonaceous materials is predominantly produced in low-income countries by polluting processes. In contrast, AC derived from sewage sludge by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a regional and sustainable alternative, based on waste material. Our experiments demonstrate that the HTC-AC from sewage sludge was able to remove most of the applied MPs. In fact more than 50% of sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and bezafibrate were removed from artificial water samples. With the same approach carbamazepine was eliminated to nearly 70% and atrazine more than 80%. In addition a pre-treated (phosphorus-reduced) HTC-AC was able to eliminate 80% of carbamazepine and diclofenac. Atrazine, sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate were removed to more than 90%. Experiments using real wastewater samples with high organic content (11.1 g m(-3)) succeeded in proving the adsorption capability of phosphorus-reduced HTC-AC.

AB We investigated the impact of ionic strength, hardness and surfactant on the removal of the widely used drug naproxen (NAP) onto the developed porous sugarcane bagasse (PSB). The experiments demonstrated that increases in ionic strength, surfactant and hardness impacted on the removal of NAP from aqueous phase. The surface of the developed materials showed very high (52 %) carbon content and low (2.3 %) moisture content. The presence of hydroxyl and carboxylate groups might be responsible for the removal of NAP, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic study. The developed material showed relatively higher surface area of 669.76 m(2) g(-1), and pore volume of 1.15 cm(3) g(-1) with average particle size of 37.5 A mu m, justifying its utility for the adsorption process. The developed material also showed heterogeneous surface morphology and graphite-like pattern. The mechanism of adsorption was explained based on spectroscopic analysis. The computed thermodynamics parameters (Delta HA degrees A = -22.03 kJ mol(-1), Delta SA degrees A = -54.53 J mol(-1) K-1 and Delta GA degrees A = - 5.50 kJ mol(-1)) confirmed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. Experiments were also conducted to optimize the operating parameters for maximum possible removal of NAP from aquatic environment. Regeneration of spent adsorbent was carried out using microwave irradiation, achieving similar to 83.11 % desorption. The energy recovered from the loaded NAP in terms of higher heating value was 14.15 MJ kg(-1), further enhancing its utilization. The low cost of PSB (USD 19.49) also justifies its utilization for wastewater treatment from the economic perspective.

AB A screening survey of 81 pharmaceuticals was carried out at a wastewater facility and in a detrital aquifer (Barcelona, Spain), where treated wastewater (TWW) was injected through wells to build up a hydraulic barrier against seawater intrusion. The monitored data correspond to the 2007-2010 period. The TWW was tertiary treated with additional treatment consisting of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and UV disinfection. During the monitoring period groundwater monitoring was carried out in wells located within a 1-km radius distance from the injection wells. During monitoring period 20 new pharmaceuticals were detected in the aquifer media and 11 compounds were found with concentration above 0.1 mu g l(-1) (selected threshold) in both TWW and wells. After 1 year of TWW injection change of redox conditions, a decrease of Cl- concentration and presence of 11 pharmaceuticals (4-AAA, 4-FAA, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diazepam, diclofenac, hydrochlorothiazide, mepivacaine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine and sulfapyridine) was observed in the monitoring wells. After the studied period the sodium-chloride aquifer water type evolved to a bicarbonate-sulphate facies. Decrease of the pharmaceuticals concentration in groundwater appears to be driven by the dilution process and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer media, with the attenuation or degradation process much less important.

AB Two different types of mesoporous adsorbents and one microporous adsorbent were used for the adsorption of chlorhexidine gluconate and Cetrimide. Chlorhexidine gluconate and Cetrimide are widely used in antiseptic solutions, mouthwashes, and germicidal hand rinses, etc. Scanning electron microscopy images, N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, Fourier transform infrared spectra and points of zero charge illustrate that significant changes occur on the activated carbon after functionalization with NH4OH when compared to the precursor granular activated carbon (GAC). The adsorption capacity of the novel alkali functionalized activated carbon (FAC-NH3) was found to be comparable with the highly expensive mesoporous aluminosilicate MCM-41 for both chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide. For a wide concentration range, adsorption with FAC-NH3 is approximately three times more in comparison to GAC for both compounds. Chlorhexidine gluconate forms surface complexes with the functional groups present in the super microporous FAC-NH3. This fact is also supported by kinetic studies, where pseudo first-order and second-order models, intra-particle diffusion, and Boyd's plots showed evidences to support chemisorption, on top of pure physical adsorption.

AB Ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) has been widely used to generate sulfate radicals for degradation of water organic pollutants in previous studies. However, its impacts on disinfection byproduct formation during post-chlorination of degraded compounds is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of UV irradiation, PS oxidation, and the combined UV/PS advanced oxidation process (AOP) pre-treatments on halomethane formation during the following chlorination of chloramphenicol (CAP), a model antibiotic commonly found in wastewater-impacted water. Results showed that CAP could be transformed to more trichloromethane (TCM) than monochloromethane (MCM) and dichloromethane (DCM) in the presence of excess chlorine. UV photolysis, PS oxidation and UV/PS AOP all directly decomposed CAP to produce halomethanes (HMs) before post-chlorination. Moreover, UV and UV/PS pre-treatments both enhanced the formation of all the HMs in the subsequent chlorination. PS pre-oxidation decreased the TCM formation during post-chlorination, but increased the yields of MCM, DCM and total HMs. UV pre-irradiation significantly increased the bromide utilization of HMs, whereas UV/PS pre-oxidation decreased the bromine incorporation and utilization of HMs from the chlorination of CAP in a low-bromide water. UV irradiation, PS oxidation, and UV/PS AOP can inactivate pathogens and degrade organic pollutants, but this benefit should be weighed against a potential risk of the increased halomethane formation from degraded organic pollutants with and without post-chlorination.

AB Photodegradation of estrone (E1) was investigated under simulated solar radiation in absence and presence of the different fractions of humic substances (HS), namely humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and XAD-4 fraction. The pseudo-first order photodegradation rate constants increased from 0.1137 h(-1), in ultrapure (MQ) water, to 0.1774, 0.1943 and 0.3109 h(-1), in presence of HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. Half-life time decreased from 6.10 h in MQ water to 3.91, 3.57 and 2.23 h in presence of HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. These results evidence the relevant photosensitizing effect of XAD-4 fraction of HS on the degradation of E1, which, to the best of our knowledge have never been studied.
   Photodegradation studies were also conducted in organic matter-rich environmental aquatic matrices, namely fresh, estuarine and waste water. After 2 h, photodegradation achieved values ranged between 35.6 and 57.1% in natural water samples, compared with 26.4% in ultrapure water. The higher photo degradation occurred in an estuarine water sample, known to be rich in XAD-4 fraction and poor in HA, indicating that not only the presence of organic matter, but also its type, are determinant in the E1 photodegradation rate.
   Finally, the use of sodium azide as singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) scavenger during the phototransformation of E1 in ultrapure and in two wastewater samples allowed to conclude that O-1(2) has an important role in the E1 photodegradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seven mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with different design configurations, dealing with primary-treated urban wastewater, were assessed for the concentration, distribution and fate of ten pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) [ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, caffeine, carbamazepine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide] and eight of their transformation products (TPs). Apart from influent and effluent, various CW compartments were analysed, namely, substrate, plant roots and pore water. PPCP content in pore water depended on the specific CW configuration. Macrophytes can take up PPCPs through their roots. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide were present on the root surface with a predominance of galaxolide and caffeine in all the planted systems. Naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide were uptaken by the roots. In order to better understand the removal processes, biomass measurement and biodegradability studies through the characterization of internal-external isomeric linear alkylbenzenes present on the gravel bed were performed. Three TPs namely, ibuprofen-amide, 3-ethylbenzophenone and 4-hydroxy-diclofenac were identified for the first time in wetland pore water and effluent water, which suggests de novo formation (they were not present in the influent). Conversely, O-desmethyl-naproxen was degraded through the wetland passage since it was detected in the influent but not in the subsequent treatment stages. Biodegradation pathways are therefore suggested for most of the studied PPCPs in the assessed CWs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Antibiotics have been increasingly used for veterinary and medical purposes. The overuse of these compounds for these purposes can pollute the environment, water resources in particular. Tetracycline, among other forms of antibiotics, is one of the most applied antibiotic in aquaculture and veterinary medicine. The present study aimed to tack the traces of tetracycline in the effluents of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants, surface and groundwater resources and finally the drinking water provided from these water resources.
   Methods: The samples were taken from Fasha-Foyeh Dam, wells located at Varamin Plain, and Yaftabad; and also, wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater treatment plant effluents of Emam Khomeini Hospital and a municipal wastewater treatment plant which its effluent is being released to the surface water of the area covered in this work. 24 samples were collected in total during July 2012 to December 2012. The prepared samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: Based on the results, mean tetracycline levels in surface and ground water at nearby of animal farms was found to vary from 5.4 to 8.1 ng L-1. Furthermore, the maximum TC concentration of 9.3 ng L-1 was found to be at Yaft-Abad sampling station. Although tetracycline traces could not be detected in any investigated Hospital WWTP effluents, it was tracked in MWWTP effluent samples, in the concentration range of 280 to 540 ng L-1.
   Conclusion: The results showed that the concentration of TC in water resource near the animal farms is higher than the other sampling stations. This is related to the usage of antibiotic for animals. In fact, it caused the contamination of water resources and could contribute to radical changes in the ecology of these regions.

The removal processes investigated were the direct photolysis with UV radiation at 254 nm, and the advanced oxidation process (AOP) with the same UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide. As a result of the microfluidics approach developed through an innovative experimental apparatus, full conversion of BE was reached within a few seconds or minutes of residence time in the MCF depending on the process conditions adopted. The radiation dose was estimated to be approximately 5.5 J cm(-2). The innovative MCF reactor was found to be an effective tool for photochemical studies, especially when using highly priced, uncommon, or regulated substances. The removal efficiency was affected by the nature of the aqueous matrix, due to the presence of different xenobiotics and natural compounds that act primarily as HO' radical scavengers and secondly as inner UV254 filters. Moreover, nano -liquid chromatography (LC)-high resolution-mass spectrometry analysis was utilized to identify the main reaction transformation products, showing the formation of hydroxylated aromatics during the photochemical treatment.

AB This study investigates removal of total nitrogen (TN) in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) supported with high-density polyethylene for biofilm formation and ibuprofen (IBU) as a carbon source. At first, the microorganisms have been acclimated for 45 days. In the optimum condition, TN removal of more than 80% was reached. Optimization results of simultaneous removal of IBU and TN showed that the obtained removal efficiencies for IBU and TN are close together and the correlation coefficients have high values. The obtained results show that MBBR bioreactor could remove 72.03 % IBU and 81.1 % TN at 145.15 h and TN concentration of 156.37 mg/L. Biodegradation constant (k(biol)) values were varying from 0.4 to 0.009 L/g biomass.d, which represents that IBU is a hard biodegradable or persistent substance. This study demonstrated that the proposed MBBR is highly effective for the simultaneous removal of IBU and TN in wastewater.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) contain a large number of chemical pollutants such as disinfectants, surfactants, and pharmaceutical residues. A part of these pollutants is not eliminated by traditional urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), leading to a risk for the aquatic ecosystems receiving these effluents. In order to assess this risk, we formulated a specific methodology based on the ecotoxicological characterisation of the hospital wastewater using a battery of three chronic bioassays (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Heterocypris incongruens and Brachionus calyciflorus). We used it for the posteriori risk assessment of a hospital recently built in south-east France, and we studied the evolution of this risk during two years. We also used it to assess the decrease of the ecotoxicological risk after treatment of the effluent in a specific line of the local WWTP. Lastly, we compared these results with the risk assessment made before the building of the hospital in the context of a priori risk assessment. The results obtained showed an important evolution of the risk overtime, according to the hospital activities and the river flows, and a real decrease of the risk after treatment in the dedicated line. They also showed that the a priori assessment of ecotoxicological risks, made previously, was overstated, mainly because of the application of the precautionary principle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An innovative plant configuration based in an UASB reactor coupled to a hybrid aerobic membrane bioreactor designed for sustainable treatment of municipal wastewater at ambient temperatures and low hydraulic retention time was studied in terms of organic micropollutants (OMPs) removal. OMPs removal mechanisms, as well as the potential influence of biomass activity and physical conformation were assessed. Throughout all periods of operation (150 days) high organic matter removals were maintained (>95%) and, regarding OMPs removal, this innovative system has shown to be more efficient than conventional technologies for those OMPs which are prone to be biotransformed under anaerobic conditions. For instance, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have both shown to be biodegradable under anaerobic conditions with similar efficiencies (removal efficiencies above 84%). OMPs main removal mechanism was found to be biotransformation, except in the case of musk fragrances which showed medium sorption onto sludge. OMPs removal was strongly dependent on the efficiency of the primary metabolism (organic matter degradation and nitrification) and the type of biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated organic micropollutant (OMP) biodegradation rates in laboratory-scale soil columns simulating river bank filtration (RBF) processes. The dosed OMP mixture consisted of 11 pharmaceuticals, 6 herbicides, 2 insecticides and 1 solvent. Columns were filled with soil from a RBF site and were fed with four different organic carbon fractions (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, transphilic and river water organic matter (RWOM)). Additionally, the effect of a short-term OMP/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) shock-load (e.g. quadrupling the OMP concentrations and doubling the DOC concentration) on OMP biodegradation rates was investigated to assess the resilience of RBF systems. The results obtained in this study imply that - in contrast to what is observed for managed aquifer recharge systems operating on wastewater effluent - OMP biodegradation rates are not affected by the type of organic carbon fraction fed to the soil column, in case of stable operation. No effect of a short-term DOC shock-load on OMP biodegradation rates between the different organic carbon fractions was observed. This means that the RBF site simulated in this study is resilient towards transient higher DOC concentrations in the river water. However, a temporary OMP shock-load affected OMP biodegradation rates observed for the columns fed with the river water organic matter (RWOM) and the hydrophilic fraction of the river water organic matter. These different biodegradation rates did not correlate with any of the parameters investigated in this study (cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), DOC removal, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), richness/evenness of the soil microbial population or OMP category (hydrophobicity/charge).

AB Iopromide is an X-ray and MRI contrast agent that is virtually non-biodegradable and persistent through typical wastewater treatment processes. This study determined whether molecular transformation of iopromide in a UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) can result in biodegradable products. The experiments used iopromide labeled with carbon-14 on the aromatic ring to trace degradation of iopromide through UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation and subsequent biodegradation. The biotransformation assay tracked the formation of radiolabeled (CO2)-C-14 which indicated full mineralization of the molecule. The results indicated that AOP formed biodegradable iopromide products. There was no C-14 released from the pre-AOP samples, but up to 20% of all radiolabeled carbon transformed into (CO2)-C-14 over the course of 42 days of biodegradation after iopromide was exposed to advanced oxidation (compared to 10% transformation in inactivated post-AOP controls). In addition, the quantum yield of photolysis of iopromide was determined using low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) mercury lamps as 0.069 +/- 0.005 and 0.080 +/- 0.007 respectively. The difference in the quantum yields for the two UV sources was not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval (p = 0.08), which indicates the equivalency of using LP or MP UV sources for iopromide treatment. The reaction rate between iopromide and hydroxyl radicals was measured to be (2.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). These results indicate that direct photolysis is a dominant degradation pathway in UV/H2O2 AOP treatment of iopromide. Other iodinated contrast media may also become biodegradable after exposure to UV or UV/H2O2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Glucocorticoids are pharmaceutical contaminants of emerging concern due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment, increased presence in aquatic environment and their biological potency. The zebrafish is a popular model for aquatic toxicology and environmental risk assessment. This study aimed to determine if glucocorticoids at environmental concentrations would perturb expression of selected glucocorticoid-responsive genes in zebrafish and to investigate their potentials as an in vivo zebrafish assay in complementing in vitro glucocorticoid receptor bioassay. The relative expression of eleven glucocorticoid-responsive genes in zebrafish larvae and liver of adult male zebrafish exposed to three representative glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone and triamcinolone) was determined. The expression of pepck, baiap2 and pxr was up-regulated in zebrafish larvae and the expression of baiap2, pxr and mmp-2 was up-regulated in adult zebrafish exposed to glucocorticoids at concentrations equivalent to total glucocorticoids reported in environmental samples. The responsiveness of the specific genes were sufficiently robust in zebrafish larvae exposed to a complex environmental sample detected with in vitro glucocorticoid activity equivalent to 478 pM dexamethasone (DEX-EQ) and confirmed to contain low concentration (0.2 ng/L or less) of the targeted glucocorticoids, and possibly other glucocorticoid-active compounds. The findings provided in vivo relevance to the in vitro glucocorticoid activity and suggested that the environmental sample can perturb glucocorticoid-responsive genes in its original, or half the diluted, concentration as may be found in the environment. The study demonstrated the important complementary roles of in vivo zebrafish and in vitro bioassays coupled with analytical chemistry in monitoring environmental glucocorticoid contaminants.

AB In line with the Directive 2013/39/EU the most representative surface waters, regarding pharmaceuticals contamination, were selected based on a Portuguese nationwide monitoring exercise. To meet this purpose, and given that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as the major point sources of pharmaceuticals environmental contamination, the occurrence, fate and environmental risk assessment (ERA) of eleven of the most consumed pharmaceuticals, belonging to several therapeutic classes were assessed in 15 WWTPs (influents (WWIs) and effluents (WWEs)), from five different regions during one year (4 sampling campaigns).
   Results showed that all samples were contaminated with at least 1, and up to 8 from the 11 targeted pharmaceuticals. The highest concentrations observed were 150 and 33 mu g L-1 for WWI and WWE, respectively.
   Regarding temporal and spacial influence, winter, Alentejo, Algarve and Center regions presented higher mass loads. The ERA posed by 7 of the selected pharmaceuticals presented a risk quotient higher than 1 to the three trophic levels. Our findings highlighted that the rivers Mondego, Tagus, Ave, Trancao, Fervenca and Xarrama should be selected as surface water monitoring stations.
   This study gives a good overview on pharmaceuticals contamination in WWTPs and its impact on surface waters in Portugal. Thus, a more integrative approach to rank and prioritize pharmaceuticals, based on an integrated assessment of ERA and exposure of surface water, was provided to support the future selection of the 6 most representative monitoring stations in Portugal, as required by the above mentioned directive.

AB Nowadays, the number of treatment plants has been increasing due to advancing technology and industrialization throughout Turkey and the world. This situation brings with it the need to analyse the features of the wastewater of treatment plants and treatment sludge in a more detailed way. In recent years, it has been remarkable to see studies conducted on endocrine disrupting substances (EDCs) in wastewaters and treatment sludge and the effects of these substances on the environment and public health. Being one of the estrogenic hormones, which are EDCs and which are found naturally in organisms, 17-estradiol and estrone are highly important for the ecological balance. In the adsorption studies for the removal of estrogenic hormones, removal efficiencies, adsorption isotherms, kinetic values and thermodynamic studies have been conducted for 17-estradiol and estrone. In adsorption studies, isotherm calculations are made with 90% and over removal efficiency and it is seen that the adsorption is in conformity with the Freundlich isotherm. Following the kinetic calculations, it is also seen that the adsorption is in conformity with the second-order rate equations. Following the analysis of the adsorption thermodynamically, G Gibbs free energy is found to be positive and enthalpy and entropy variations are also found to be positive.

AB Many studies demonstrated the presence of diverse environmental contaminants in the Douro River estuary, such as natural and synthetic estrogens, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides. This estuary is located between two densely populated cities and is highly impacted due to anthropogenic activities, such as industry and agriculture. Although the presence of mycotoxins and phytoestrogens, such as lignans and coumestrans, in the aquatic environment is reported by some authors, their occurrence in Portuguese waters was not investigated yet. To evaluate the presence of phytoestrogens, phytosterols and mycotoxins in Douro River estuary, water samples were collected seasonally at nine sampling points, preconcentrated by solid phase extraction and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Local flora was collected on the riverside, in the same sampling points, for identification and evaluation of the possible relation to the presence of phytoestrogens and/or phytosterols in the estuarine water. Results showed the ubiquitous presence of mycotoxins, namely deoxynivalenol up to 373.5 ng L-1. Both phytoestrogens and phytosterols showed a possible seasonal fluctuation, which is in accordance to the life cycle of the local flora and agricultural practices. Physicochemical parameters were also determined for water quality evaluation. This study revealed for the first time the presence of mycotoxins and lignans in estuarine waters from Portugal, and highlights the need to consider natural contaminants in future monitoring programs.

AB Due to the lack of analytical standards the application of surrogate parameters for organofluorine detection in the aquatic environment is a complementary approach to single compound target analysis of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFASs). The recently developed method adsorbable organically bound fluorine (AOF) is based on adsorption of organofluorine chemicals to activated carbon followed by combustion ion chromatography. This AOF method was further simplified to enable measurement of larger series of environmental samples. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.77 mu g/L F. The modified protocol was applied to 22 samples from German rivers, a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and four groundwater samples from a fire-fighting training site.
   The WWTP effluent (AOF = 1.98 mu g/L F) and only three river water samples (AOF between 0.88 mu g/L F and 1.47 mu g/L F) exceeded the LOQ The AOF levels in a PFASs plume at a heavily contaminated site were in the range of 162 +/- 3 mu g/L to 782 43 mu g/L F.
   In addition to AOF 17 PFASs were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 32-51% of AOF in the contaminated groundwater samples were explained by individual PFASs wheras in the surface waters more than 95% remained unknown.
   Organofluorine of two fluorinated pesticides, one pesticide metabolite and three fluorinated pharmaceuticals was recovered as AOF by >50% from all four tested water matrices. It is suggested that in the diffusely contaminated water bodies such fluorinated chemicals and not monitored PFASs contribute significantly to AOF. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to propose a method to estimate the spatially resolved dataset for human-use antibiotics, which are highly needed in exposure models dealing with regions of various environmental characteristics. In this study, a regression model describing the relationship between the use of antibiotics and a set of socio-economic determinants was developed. It has been demonstrated that economic status (expressed using per capita gross domestic production) dominates the antibiotic use at least in China. Linear regression analysis was used to build the model, resulting in high goodness-of-fit, R-2 (>0.75). Internal and external validations along with residue plot indicated that the model was robust and predictive. The model was successfully applied to allocate the use of antibiotics in China in 2011 at national-, provincial, prefectural-, and county-level, which are comparable to that back-calculated from the available data of wastewater analysis in some cities. Antibiotic uses were higher in East China than other regions and it was found that uses of total antibiotics vary among Chinese counties on four orders of magnitude (0.186-1645 t antibiotics per year per county). Also management practice could be worked out according to our exploration of the impact transition of social-economic factors on antibiotic uses. To our knowledge, this is the first endeavor to explore this economic dominated relationship for estimating spatially resolved use map of antibiotics in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical industries are amongst the foremost contributor to industrial waste. Ecological well-being is endangered owing to its facile discharge. In the present study, heavy metals and organic contaminants in waste water were characterized using atomic absorption spectrophotometer and GC-MS, respectively. Mutagenicity and genotoxic potential of pharmaceutical waste water were investigated through bacterial reverse mutation assay and in vitro comet assay, respectively. Ames test and comet assay of first sample were carried out at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 % v/v effluent with distilled water. Chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) were found in high concentrations as compared to WHO- and EPA-recommended maximum limits. Arsenic was found to be the most abundant metal and its maximum concentration was 0.8 mg.L-1. GC-MS revealed the presence of lignocaine, digitoxin, trimethoprim, caffeine, and vitamin E in waste water. Dose-dependent decrease in mutagenic index was observed in both strains. Substantial increase in mutagenicity was observed for TA-100, when assay was done by incorporating an enzyme activation system, whereas a slight increase was detected for TA-102. In vitro comet assay of waste water exhibited decrease in damage index and percentage fragmentation with the increase in dilution of waste water. Tail length also decreased with an increase in the dilution factor of waste water. These findings suggest that pharmaceutical waste water being a mix of different heavy metals and organic contaminants may have a potent mutagenic and genotoxic effect on exposed living organisms.

AB Anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater offers the prospect of a new paradigm by reducing aeration costs and minimizing sludge production. It has been successfully applied in warm climates, but does not always achieve the desired outcomes in temperate climates at the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values of municipal crude wastewater. Recently the concept of fortification' has been proposed to increase organic strength and has been demonstrated at the laboratory and pilot scale treating municipal wastewater at temperatures of 10-17 degrees C. The process treats a proportion of the flow anaerobically by combining it with primary sludge from the residual flow and then polishing it to a high effluent standard aerobically. Energy consumption is reduced as is sludge production. However, no new treatment process is viable if it only addresses the problems of traditional pollutants (suspended solids - SS, BOD, nitrogen - N and phosphorus - P); it must also treat hazardous substances. This study compared three potential municipal anaerobic treatment regimes, crude wastewater in an expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) reactor, fortified crude wastewater in an EGSB and crude wastewater in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor. The benefits of fortification were demonstrated for the removal of SS, BOD, N and P. These three systems were further challenged with the removal of steroid estrogens at environmental concentrations from natural indigenous sources. All three systems removed these compounds to a significant degree, confirming that estrogen removal is not restricted to highly aerobic autotrophs, or aerobic heterotrophs, but is also a faculty of anaerobic bacteria.

AB Mefenamic acid (MEF) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated for relief of mild to moderate pain, and for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The presence of MEF in raw and sewage waters has been detected worldwide at concentrations exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration. In this study, using experimental designs, different oxidative processes (H2O2, H2O2/UV, fenton and Photofenton) were simultaneously evaluated for MEF degradation efficiency. The influence and interaction effects of the most important variables in the oxidative process (concentration and addition mode of hydrogen peroxide, concentration and type of catalyst, pH, reaction period and presence/absence of light) were investigated. The parameters were determined based on the maximum efficiency to save time and minimize the consumption of reagents. According to the results, the photo-Fenton process is the best procedure to remove the drug from water. A reaction mixture containing 1.005 mmol L-1 of ferrioxalate and 17.5 mmol L-1 of hydrogen peroxide, added at the initial reaction period, pH of 6.1 and 60 min of degradation indicated the most efficient degradation, promoting 95% of MEF removal. The development and validation of a rapid and efficient qualitative and quantitative HPLC/UV methodology for detecting this pollutant in aqueous solution is also reported. The method can be applied in water quality control that is generated and/or treated in municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents for the first time the development of a method for the analysis of cinnamaldehyde and diallyl disulfide in soil by ultrasound assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The optimized method was applied in a laboratory-scale study of mobility of these substances applied within a bio-pesticide embodiment on three different soil textures, fine sand, sandy loam, and silty clay loam.
   Two initial soil moistures were approached, 20 and 90 % field capacity, in order to cover different climatic site scenarios (dry-wet locations). After the application, which was carried out as a pulse on the top soil surface, three different sprinkler irrigation regimes (1x, 2x, and 3x field capacity water volume) were simulated. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate.
   The results have shown that irrigation pushes the compounds down, and their mobility is soil texture dependent, with the sandy loam having the least resistance to leachability. In any case, cinnamaldehyde is shown to be more prone to leach down than diallyl disulfide. Mass balances in each scenario were also discussed.
   When these bio-pesticides are used for agricultural purposes, the irrigation regime should be adjusted so that the pesticides reach the target location without causing unnecessary environmental contamination.

AB Sorption studies of organic micropollutants to sediments are useful for predicting their fate and transport. They allow for a better understanding of the migration of contaminants through environmental media, the exposure of aquatic organisms to such chemical and their affect on human health.
   This study examined the sorption of carbamazepine, ketoprofen, diclofenac, bisphenol A and triclosan onto sediments sampled along a dam reservoir. The sediments differed in structure, chemical composition and particle size distribution. The potential effect on the quality of drinking water through the removal of micropollutants by sorption was also estimated.
   Sorption isotherms of micropollutants were constructed at pH 7.6 on three natural sediments. The sorption points were determined by measuring the concentrations of analytes in both the solution and sediment samples. The results of partitioning coefficients suggest that triclosan (187.5-1248.5 mu g(1-1/n) l(1/n) kg(-1)) and bisphenolA (11.4-51.0 mu g(1-1/n) l(1/n) kg(-1)) exhibited relatively higher sorption, whereas ketoprofen (1.3-2.0 l kg(-1)), diclofenac (4.8-5.5 l kg(-1)) and carbamazepine (2.9-5.5 l kg(-1)) did not sorb to the studied sediments. The affinity of all micropollutants was higher for the finest sediment with the highest content of organic carbon and clay minerals, collected in the deepest part of the reservoir near the water intake.
   The low values of partitioning coefficients suggest that all of the tested micropollutants, except triclosan, are predominantly freely dissolved, which can have an adverse effect on the quality of drinking water.

AB The limited availability of natural water resources and dependency on mineral fertilizer challenge agricultural value chains in arid and nutrient-poor areas. Reusing wastewater in agriculture may help and could reduce costs and lead to increased added-value. The objective of this analysis is to assess the economic impact of linking the value chains of wastewater treatment, crop production and the generation of bioenergy by reusing treated municipal wastewater and sludge. The assessment was based on the cost/benefits and the added-value from the reused wastewater by the Braunschweig Wastewater Association (Germany). Benefits were assessed by comparing the costs of wastewater irrigation and sludge application with conventional disposal options, as well as comparing the costs of irrigation and fertilization with treated wastewater to groundwater irrigation and mineral fertilization. The added-value was calculated by ascertaining the remunerations received by the stakeholders in the various value chains. The results indicate that the reuse of wastewater and sludge results in: (a) the development of linked regional value chains; (b) lower costs of wastewater treatment and sludge disposal; (c) higher profitability and added-value in crop production; and (d) a high share (77%) of regional added-value. However, the results also show that the reuse of wastewater and sludge within linked value-chains can restrict actors and lead to crowding out effects on the added-value. Agricultural reuse schemes should provide additional opportunities that enable farmers to increase their scope of possibilities and compensate for missed economic potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A comprehensive study, which contains the seasonal occurrence, removal, mass loading and environmental risk assessment of 55 multi-class pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), took place in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Volos, Greece. A one year monitoring study was performed and the samples were collected from the influent and the effluent of the WWTP. Solid phase extraction was used for the pre-concentration of the samples followed by an LC-DAD-ESI/MS analysis. Positive samples were further confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The maximum concentrations of the PPCPs varied between 21 ng/L and 15,320 ng/L in the influents and between 18 ng/L and 9965 ng/L in the effluents. The most commonly detected PPCPs were the diuretic furosemide, the beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol, the analgesics paracetamol, nimesulide, salicylic add and diclofenac and the psychomotor stimulant caffeine. The removal efficiencies ranged between negative and high removal rates, demonstrating that the WWTP is not able to efficiently remove the complex mixture of PPCPs. The estimated mass loads ranged between 5.1 and 3513 mg/day/1000 inhabitants for WWTP influent and between 4.1 to 2141 mg/day/1000 inhabitants for WWTP effluent. Finally, environmental risk assessment has been regarded a necessary part of the general research. According to the results produced from the calculation of the risk quotient on three trophic levels, the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the antibiotics, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin, identified to be of high potential environmental risk for acute toxicity, while didofenac also for chronic toxicity.

AB When reverse osmosis brines from potable wastewater reuse plants are discharged to poorly-flushed estuaries, the concentrated organic contaminants are a concern for receiving water ecosystems. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/S2O82-) advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) may reduce contaminant burdens prior to discharge, but the effects of the high levels of halide, carbonate and effluent organic matter (EfOM) normally present in these brines are unclear. On the one hand, these substances may reduce process efficiency by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate (SO4 center dot-) radicals. On the other, the daughter radicals generated by halide and carbonate scavenging may themselves degrade organics, offsetting the effect of ROS scavenging. UV/H2O2 and UV/S2O82- AOPs were compared for degradation of five pharmaceuticals spiked into brines obtained from two reuse facilities and the RO influent from one of them. For UV/H2O2, EfOM scavenged -75% of the (OH)-O-center dot, reducing the degradation efficiency of the target contaminants to a similar extent; halide and carbonate scavenging and the reactivities of associated daughter radicals were less important. For UV/S2O82-, anions (mostly Cl-) scavenged -93% of the SOT. Because daughter radicals of Cr contributed to contaminant degradation, the reduction in contaminant degradation efficiency was only -75-80%, with the reduction driven by daughter radical scavenging by EfOM. Conversion of SO4- to more selective halogen and carbonate radicals resulted in a wider range of degradation efficiencies among the contaminants. For both AOPs, 250 mJ/cm(2) average fluence achieved significant removal of four pharmaceuticals, with significantly better performance by UV/S2O82- treatment for some constituents. Accounting for the lower brine flowrates, the energy output to achieve this fluence in brines is comparable to that often applied to RO permeates. However, much higher fluence was required for the least reactive pharmaceutical. Comparing AOP application to the RO influent or brine, equal or greater removal was achieved for brine treatment for comparable energy input. AOP treatment of brines could be applied to reduce, but not eliminate, contaminant burdens prior to discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study was aimed at treating pharmaceutical industry wastewater employing chemical coagulation and ozonation process. Coagulation was carried out by alum and lime. Parameters like coagulant type & dose, settling time and pH ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 g/L., 10 to 60 min and 4 to 10 respectively were investigated. Coagulation with alum proved to be effective with a dose of 0.75 g/L at pH 6 leading to 59% COD and 76.8% turbidity removal. Ozonation was carried out for 10-60 min. The COD abatement mechanism of ozonation is changed in unbuffered samples and is only 13.5% after 1 h ozonation. However, 93.4% color removal was reported at the same ozonation time. The treatment strategy is handy in treating pharmaceutical wastewaters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A screening-level risk assessment of biosolids-borne PPCPs in agricultural scenarios was developed in this work. While several of these compounds are efficiently removed in sewage treatment plants (STPs), others are recalcitrant to degradation and can be found in sludge at significant levels. As the rate of biosolids reuse for fertilising and/or amendment purposes is increasing, it is necessary to evaluate the fate in soil and possible biotransfer of this type of pollutants in the long-term. The study includes six compounds that were selected considering data availability, presence in sludge and persistence. Due to the scarce data still present in literature, a probabilistic assessment to address uncertainty was developed. A 95th percentile of the hazard index (HI) exceeding 1 was obtained, with main contributions of triclosan and carbamazepine. Although these estimates were obtained under a worst-case approach, and that they can vary depending on scenario characteristics, they change the least-concern classification associated to the presence of PPCPs in biosolids. A sensitivity analysis indicates the high influence of application rate and sludge concentration level on the results. Thus, the importance of developing new strategies of removal in advanced STPs and the establishment of a specific biosolids reuse regulation including this type of compounds acquires an added significance.

AB Venlafaxine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, irbesartan and ofloxacin are highly-consumed pharmaceuticals that show considerable removal efficiencies (between 40 and 98%) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Consequently, they are expected to generate transformation products (TPs) during wastewater treatment and in surface water (SW) receiving WWTP effluent. In this work, degradation experiments for these five pharmaceuticals have been carried out with SW and WWTP activated sludge under laboratory-controlled aerobic conditions to identify their transformation products by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS). Initially, 22 pharmaceutical TPs were tentatively identified. A retrospective analysis was performed in effluent wastewater (EWW) and SW samples. All parent compounds as well as several TPs were found in some of the selected EWW and SW samples. Additionally, valsartan and 3 TPs were also detected by searching for common fragments in these waters. It is important to highlight that some TPs, such as O-desmethyl-venlafaxine and an oxidized gemfibrozil TP, were more frequently found than their corresponding parent compounds. On the basis of these results, it would be recommendable to include these TPs (at least those found in EWW and SW samples analyzed) in monitoring programs in order to gain a more realistic understanding of the impact of pharmaceuticals on water quality.

AB This study reports an investigation of omeprazole and venlafaxine parent substances and metabolites in Italian municipal influent wastewaters (IWWs). These pharmaceuticals were selected because they are widely consumed in Italy, but are poorly detected in waste and surface water. The aim of the study was to identify the most relevant pharmaceuticals metabolites in wastewater in order to improve the prioritization step and choose priority pollutants for environmental monitoring campaigns. This was done by investigating omeprazole, venlafaxine and their main metabolites in 30 IWWs from ten Italian cities and by comparing results with information from pharmacokinetic studies. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We searched for 23 omeprazole and four venlafaxine metabolites using data-dependent and MS/MS methods. Parent omeprazole was never present in the samples. Six omeprazole metabolites were found in IWWs. Venlafaxine and two metabolites were present in all the samples. The metabolic profiles in Italian IWW agreed with results in IWW from Spain and with urinary excretion profiles from pharmacokinetic studies. Comparing results from different sources was useful to improve the identification of pharmaceuticals metabolites in environmental samples and to focus the attention of future studies on the most relevant compounds.

The valuable information regarding treatment of the wastewater from the edible oil industry is presented in this research. The obtained results confirm a promising application of the third generation membranes, comprised of ceramic material (aluminium oxide), in treatment of wastewater from the edible oil industry. Positive results regarding chemical oxygen demand reduction and turbidity removal were noticed. Permeate flux values were used for process optimization in order to achieve a cost-effective process. Response surface methodology was used for the experimental design. The effects of wastewater temperature, transmembrane pressure, and feed-flow rate on the microfiltration model fit were studied. The experiments showed that microfiltration of this type of wastewater is a convenient technique for a possible large scale industrial application as a secondary step in treating wastewater from the oilseed processing facilities.

AB Gemfibrozil is a widely used hypolipidemic and triglyceride lowering drug. Excess of the drug is excreted and discharged into the environment primarily via wastewater treatment plant effluents. Bacillus sp. GeD10, a gemfibrozil-degrader, was previously isolated from activated sludge. It is the first identified bacterium capable of degrading gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil degradation by Bacillus sp. GeD10 was here studied through genome sequencing, quantitative proteomics and metabolite analysis. From the bacterial proteome of Bacillus sp. GeD10 1974 proteins were quantified, of which 284 proteins were found to be overabundant by more than 2-fold (FDR corrected p-value <= 0.032, fold change (log(2)) >= 1) in response to gemfibrozil exposure. Metabolomic analysis identified two hydroxylated intermediates as well as a glucuronidated hydroxyl-metabolite of gemfibrozil. Overall, gemfibrozil exposure in Bacillus sp. GeD10 increased the abundance of several enzymes potentially involved in gemfibrozil degradation as well as resulted in the production of several gemfibrozil metabolites. The potential catabolic pathway/modification included ring-hydroxylation preparing the substrate for subsequent ring cleavage by a meta-cleaving enzyme. The identified genes may allow for monitoring of potential gemfibrozil-degrading organisms in situ and increase the understanding of microbial processing of trace level contaminants. This study represents the first omics study on a gemfibrozil-degrading bacterium.

AB In this study, fungal membrane bioreactor (FMBR) and semiconductor photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) were used in order to test the efficiency of integrated fungal biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation of textile wastewater from reactive washing processes. It was found that color removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction efficiencies were 88% and 53% for photocatalytic degradation, respectively. TiO2 and ZnO were tested as semiconductor catalysts in the PMR and TiO2 showed better efficiencies than ZnO for both color and COD removal. However, it was attained that color removal and COD reduction efficiencies were about 56% and 60% for fungal biodegradation using Phatterochaete chrysosporium, respectively. Moreover, integrated system in which photocatalytic degradation was employed as a post-treatment application after fungal biodegradation process achieved high removal efficiencies for color and COD removal as 93% and 99%, respectively.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) are one class of the most widely used antibiotics around the world and have been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water in recent years. Their transformation in waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and in water treatment plants (WTP), as well as, their fate and transport in the aquatic environment are of concern.
   The reaction of six sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine) with free chlorine was investigated at a laboratory scale in order to identify the main chlorination by-products. A previously validated method, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, was used to analyse SAs and their chlorination by-products. At room temperature, pH 6-7, reaction times of up to 2 h and an initial concentration of 2 mg/L of free chlorine, the majority of SAs suffered degradation of around 65%, with the exception of sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole (20%). The main reaction of SAs with free chlorine occurred in the first minute. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed at gaining knowledge on the degradation pathway during biological treatment of wastewater of diclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac, its main human metabolite. For that purpose, an aerobic MBR was acclimatised to diclofenac, and the MBR biomass subsequently incubated with C-14-diclofenac or C-14-4'hydroxydiclofenac over 25 days. It was demonstrated that diclofenac degradation was much slower and limited than that of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac. Indeed, after 18 days of batch incubation, diclofenac was removed up to 40%, this rate remained stable till the end of the experiment, while 4'-hydroxydiclofenac was completely degraded within nine days. The analyses of supernatant samples have shown that diclofenac degradation led to four transformation products, more polar than the parent compound, one of them being 4'-hydroxydiclofenac. The degradation of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac led to the formation of the same metabolites than those detected during diclofenac degradation. With these results, the hydroxylation of diclofenac to 4'-hydroxydiclofenac was identified as one major bottleneck in diclofenac degradation during biological treatment of wastewater.

AB This study investigated the effects of selected four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, and roxithromycin) on the photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes of Cyperus alternifolius in constructed wetlands (CWs). Moreover, the removal and kinetics of PhACs in CWs were evaluated to explore the related removal mechanisms. Results showed that C. alternifolius can uptake and withstand certain PhACs. The PhAC tolerance of C. alternifolius might be attributed to their capacity to maintain relatively normal photosynthetic activity and elevated antioxidative defense. CWs offered comparable or even higher removal efficiencies for the selected PhACs compared with conventional WWTPs. The removal of the target PhACs was enhanced in the planted CWs versus the unplanted CWs mostly because of plant uptake and rhizosphere effects. In particular, carbamazepine, which is considered the most recalcitrant of the PhACs, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The removal of target PhACs fitted into two distinct periods. The initial fast step (within the first 2 h) was essentially attributed to the adsorption onto the CW medium surface. The subsequent slow process (2-12 h) closely followed first-order kinetics probably because of the interaction between microorganisms and plants. The obtained results indicate that C alternifolius can phytoremediate PhAC-contaminated waters in CWs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photo-degradation process of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is studied under different conditions. Reactions were carried out under UV-H2O2, US-UV-H2O2 and US-UV-H2O2-Fe systems. An important synergistic effect between sonolysis and UV irradiation of 27.7% was quantified using the first order rate constants for carbamazepine degradation.
   An empirical model that includes the scavenger effect was applied and found to reproduce both degradation and mineralization of CBZ satisfactorily.
   Comparison experiments of scavenger-loaded conditions demonstrated that the carbamazepine photodegradation occurs mainly through a radical mechanism in two steps: during the first 10-15 min, CBZ is completely degraded, whereas TOC barely changes, confirming that intermediates are not easy to mineralize. During this phase, dissolved oxygen (DO) remains in low values and the pair O-2(center dot-)/HO2 center dot is an active contributor to CBZ degradation. Mineralization is low and the scavenger effect from center dot OH radicals is relatively high (k(scv) = 0.0014 min(-1) mM(-1)). From that moment, intermediates are formed and center dot OH radicals are responsible for increased mineralization rate with a gradual decrease in the scavenger effect (k(scv) = 0.0004 min(-1) mM(-1)).
   Experiments performed under the US-UV-H2O2-Fe system proved the important contribution of center dot OH radicals. The maximum mineralization (93% in 35 min) was reached for [Fe] = 15 ppm and [H2O2] = 680 ppm.
   A study of the flow pattern inside the reactor showed that improvement in mineralization rate with US radiation cannot be attributed to a positive effect in mixing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aerated batch reactors (2.5 L) fed either with urban or synthetic wastewater were inoculated with microalgae (dominated by Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) to remove caffeine, ibuprofen, galaxolide, tributyl phosphate, 4-octylphenol, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and carbamazepine for 10 incubation days. Non-aerated and darkness reactors were used as controls. Microalgae grew at a rate of 0.25 d(-1) with the complete removal of N-NH4 during the course of the experiment. After 10 incubation days, up to 99% of the microcontaminants with a Henry's law constant higher than 3 10(-1) Pa m(3) mol(-1) (i.e., 4-octylphenol, galaxolide, and tributyl phosphate) were removed by volatilization due to the effect of air stripping. Whereas biodegradation was effective for removing ibuprofen and caffeine, carbamazepine and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate behaved as recalcitrant compounds. The use of microalgae was proved to be relevant for increasing the biodegradation removal efficiency of ibuprofen by 40% and reducing the lag phase of caffeine by 3 days. Moreover, the enantioselective biodegradation of S-ibuprofen suggested a biotic prevalent removal process, which was supported by the identification of carboxy-ibuprofen and hydroxy-ibuprofen. The results from microalgae reactors fed with synthetic wastewater showed no clear evidences of microalgae uptake of any of the studied microcontaminants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been recognized that numerous synthetic compounds like Bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenols (NP) are present in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) at levels of parts per billion (mu g L-1) or even parts per trillion (ng L-1) with a high potential to cause endocrine disruption in the aquatic environment. Constructed wetlands (CW) are a cost-effective wastewater treatment alternative with promising performance to treat these afore mentioned compounds. This research was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CW treatment of WWTP effluent for mitigating the effects endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). This research goal was accomplished by (1) quantifying the removal of BPA and NP in CWs; (2) isolating CW fungal strains and testing for laccase production; and (3) performing endocrine disruption (reproduction) bioassays using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Three pilot scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF-CW) were operated for eight weeks: one planted with Phragmites australis; one planted with Heliconia psitacorum; and one unplanted. The Heliconia CW showed a removal efficiency of 73.3(+/- 19%) and 62.8(+/- 20.1%) for BPA and NP, respectively; while the Phragmites CW demonstrated a similar removal for BPA (70.2 +/- 27%) and lower removal efficiency for NP 52.1(+/- 37.1%). The unplanted CW achieved 62.2 (+/- 33%) removal for BPA and 25.3(+/- 37%) removal for NP. Four of the eleven fungal strains isolated from the Heliconia-CW showed the capacity to produce laccase. Even though complete removal of EDCs was not achieved by the CWs, the bioassay confirmed a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in fly viability for all CWs, with Heliconia sp. being the most effective at mitigating adverse effects on first and second generational reproduction. This study showed that a CW planted with a native Heliconia sp. CW demonstrated a higher removal of endocrine disrupting compounds and better mitigation of reproductive disruption in the bioassay.

AB The study was performed in order to clarify whether carbamazepine-spiked solutions used as model waste-waters are suitable for the assessment of carbamazepine removal from real secondary municipal effluents by photocatalytic oxidation in the presence and absence of activated carbon. Therefore, carbamazepine (10 mg L-1) was dissolved in deionized water or in secondary municipal effluent. Photocatalytic oxidation of these model wastewaters was carried out with TiO2 "P25" (100 mg L-1) and UV-A lamps in the absence and in the presence of 20 mg L-1 powdered activated carbon (PAC). Carbamazepine was analyzed photometrically. In deionized water at pH 5.5, carbamazepine was nearly completely removed with a UV dose of 6.48 kJ L-1. A similar efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of carbamazepine added to secondary effluent was observed when the suspension pH was 2.7, while at pH 8 and 10.6, carbamazepine removal from spiked secondary effluent with the same UV dose was only 40 and 60%, respectively. Although PAC addition resulted in an initial adsorptive carbamazepine reduction of 20 to 35% from the model wastewaters, it did not lead to markedly enhanced carbamazepine removal in the subsequent photocatalysis phase. During photocatalytic oxidation of unspiked secondary effluent (initial carbamazepine concentration: 133 ng L-1) at pH 7.3 with and without PAC, carbamazepine concentrations were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. While PAC addition resulted in the adsorption of about 90% of the initial carbamazepine, photocatalysis did not lead to any carbamazepine removal at all. This indicates that the experiments with spiked model wastewaters - even in a secondary effluent matrix - are absolutely inadequate for predicting photocatalytic carbamazepine removal under real conditions.

AB Hospital wastewaters (HWW) contain wider spectrum and higher quantity of pharmaceuticals than urban wastewaters (UWW), but they are generally discharged in sewers without pretreatment. Since traditional urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are not designed to treat HWWs, treated effluents may still contain pollutants that could impair receiving aquatic environments. Hence, a better understanding of the effect of pharmaceuticals in the environment is required. Biofilms are effective "biological sensors" for assessing the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals due to their ability to respond rapidly to physical, chemical and biological fluctuations by changes in their structure and composition.
   This study evaluated the efficiency of biological treatment with conventional activated sludge system performed parallel on HWW and UWW. Furthermore, six successive monthly colonizations of biofilms were done on autoclaved stones, placed in grid-baskets in the hospital treated effluents (HTE) and urban treated effluents (UTE). The biomass of these biofilms as well as the structure and diversity of their bacterial communities were investigated.
   Results showed better treatment efficiency for phosphate and nitrite/nitrate during the treatment of UWW. Pharmaceuticals from all investigated therapeutic classes (beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, analgesics and anticonvulsants) were efficiently removed, except for carbamazepine. The removal efficiency of the antibiotics, NSAIDs and beta-blockers was higher during the treatment of HWW. HTE and UTE shaped the bacterial communities in different ways. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the HTE caused adapted development of the microbial community, leading to less developed biomass and lower bacterial diversity. Seasonal changes in solar irradiance and temperature, caused changes in the community composition of biofilms in both effluents.
   According to the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals, the separate treatment was beneficial. However, their high concentrations in the HTE and the following adaptations of biofilm communities identify the importance of adapting wastewater treatment to specific hospital pollutants.

AB Among the solutions to reduce micropollutant discharges into the aquatic environment, activated carbon adsorption is a promising technique and a large scale pilot has been tested at the Seine Centre (240,000 m(3)/d-Paris, France) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). While most of available works studied fixed bed or contact reactors with a separated separation step, this study assesses a new type of tertiary treatment based on a fluidized bed containing a high mass of activated carbon, continuously renewed. For the first time in the literature, micro-grain activated carbon (mu GAC) was studied. The aims were (1) to determine the performances of fluidized bed operating with mu CAG on both emerging micropollutants and conventional wastewater quality parameters, and (2) to compare its efficiency and applicability to wastewater to former results obtained with PAC. Thus, conventional wastewater quality parameters (n = 11), pharmaceuticals and hormones (PPHs; n = 62) and other emerging pollutants (n = 57) have been monitored in mu GAC configuration during 13 campaigns.
   A significant correlation has been established between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), PPHs and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV-254) removals. This confirms that UV-254 could be used as a tertiary treatment performance indicator to monitor the process. This parameter allowed identifying that the removals of UV-254 and DOC reach a plateau from a mu GAC retention time (SRT) of 90-100 days.
   The mu GAC configuration substantially improves the overall quality of the WWTP discharges by reducing biological (38-45%) and chemical oxygen demands (21-48%), DOC (13-44%) and UV-254 (22-48%). In addition, total suspended solids (TSS) are retained by the mu GAC bed and a biological activity (nitratation) leads to a total elimination of NO2-.
   For micropollutants, PPHs have a good affinity for mu GAC and high (>60%) or very high (>80%) removals are observed for most of the quantified compounds (n=22/32), i.e. atenolol (92-97%), carbamazepine (80-94%), ciprofloxacin (75-95%), diclofenac (71-97%), oxazepam (74-91%) or sulfamethoxazole (56-83%). In addition, alkylphenols, artificial sweeteners, benzotriazole, bisphenol A, personal care products (triclocarban and parabens) and pesticides have removals lying in the 50->90% range.
   Overall, the fluidized bed of mu GAC allows obtaining performances comparable to PAC at the sameactivated carbon dose. Indeed, the average removal of the 13 PPHs found at a high occurrence (>75%) in WWTP discharges is similar at 20 g/m(3) of mu GAC (78-89%) and PAC (85-93%). In addition, this recycled mu GAC operation leads to several operational advantages (no FeCl3, reactivable, higher SRT, higher treated flow) and has a stronger impact on the overall wastewater quality compared to PAC.

AB The occurrence and spatial distribution of 158 pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse were studied in seawater of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Saronikos Gulf and Elefsis Bay in central Aegean Sea). This area is affected by various anthropogenic pressures as it receives the treated wastewater of the greatest Athens area and off-shore input fluxes. This study constitutes the largest one in terms of number of analytes in this environmental compartment. It provides the first evidence on the occurrence of several pharmaceuticals in marine environment including amoxicillin, lidocaine, citalopram or tramadol, among others.
   22 samples were collected at three different depths in 9 sampling stations in order to assess the presence and the spatial distribution of the target compounds. A multi-residue method based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of the 158 target substances and validated for seawater sample analysis. 38 out of the 158 target compounds were detected, 15 of them with frequencies of detection equal to or higher than 50%. The highest detected values corresponded to amoxicillin, caffeine and salicylic acid, with concentrations in the range of <5.0-127.8 ng L-1; 5.2-78.2 ng L-1 and <0.4-53.3 ng L-1, respectively. Inputs from the wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) of Athens revealed to be the main source of pollution in the Inner Saronikos Gulf, whereas, other anthropogenic pressures such as contamination from shipping activity, industrial effluents, dredging and/or inputs from land proved to be also relevant. The concentrations of some compounds varied significantly with depth suggesting that currents play an important role in the dilution of the target compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of nitrification, nitratation and heterotrophic conditions on the biotransformation of several pharmaceuticals in a highly enriched nitrifying activated sludge was evaluated in this study by selective activation of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrifiers displayed a noticeable capacity to process ibuprofen due to hydroxylation by ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) to produce 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen. Naproxen was also biotransformed under nitrifying conditions. On the other hand, heterotrophic bacteria present in the nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) biotransformed sulfamethoxazole. In contrast, both nitrifying and heterotrophic activities were ineffective against diclofenac, diazepam, carbamazepine and trimethoprim. Similar biotransformation rates of erythromycin, roxithromycin and fluoxetine were observed under all conditions tested. Overall, results from this study give more evidence on the role of the different microbial communities present in activated sludge reactors on the biological removal of pharmaceuticals.

A survey of surface waters and wastewater effluents was conducted across the watershed to assess the occurrence and distribution of several antimicrobials (i.e., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, lincomycin, and monensin) and chemical indicators (i.e., ammonia, nitrate, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, atrazine) and to characterize exposure levels. The human antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were detected in the urban areas of the main channel at mean concentrations of 8 +/- 7 ng/L and 31 +/- 24 ng/L, respectively, but at much lower concentrations in the agricultural tributaries. In contrast, the veterinary antimicrobial sulfamethazine was detected at a mean concentration of 11 +/- 9 ng/L in the main channel, and at a much higher concentration in the agricultural tributaries. Lincomycin was detected in only two river samples and not in the effluents while monensin was not detected in all samples. The herbicide atrazine was detected at very low concentrations in the surface waters of both the tributaries and the main channel. The concentrations of the antimicrobials and chemical indicators generally increased downstream of the confluences with agricultural tributaries and effluent outfalls. In the wastewater effluents, the concentrations of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and venlafaxine decreased with increasing treatment levels (i.e., secondary to tertiary) as indicated by ammonia/nitrate concentrations. There was a strong correlation among trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and venlafaxine in the main channel and in the wastewater effluents. While the environmental concentrations of antimicrobials in the watershed are low relative to toxicity thresholds, their persistence in the environment may be an important consideration in defining strategies for future water management.

AB Reports of pharmaceuticals in STPs and aquatic systems in the northern hemisphere have surged over the last decade. However, the Australian evidence base is relatively limited, and information on the role of seasonal dilution in attenuation of micropollutants is also scarce. We investigated the removal of 11 PPCPs during sewage treatment in Australia's largest inland STP, and concentrations in the effluent-receiving environment under 2 dilution scenarios. Five treatment stages were sampled, as well as upstream and downstream of the effluent outfall in the Lower Molonglo/Upper Murrumbidgee Catchment, which is dominated by effluent flow during dry periods. Compounds of interest include carbamazepine (CBZ), venlafaxine (VEN), sertraline (SER), fluoxetine (FLX), atenolol (ATL), sotalol (SOT), metoprolol (MET) propranolol (PRL), chlorpheniramine (CHP), diphenhydramine (DPH), and triclosan (TCS). Removal of most pharmaceuticals in the STP was incomplete, although the degree of removal was highly variable for compounds in the same therapeutic class, and for the same compounds in different seasons. Removal efficiency was highest for TCS and lowest for VEN (effluent concentrations 5-7 times higher than influent). Influent mass loads and removal efficiencies of cardiovascular medicines varied considerably. Effluent loads were highest for CBZ, VEN and SOT in both seasons (up to 64 g/day). The dilution conditions were clearly reflected in the 'zone of impact' of PPCPs in the catchment. This study confirms that risk assessment models for PPCPs must account for seasonality of influent loads and removal efficiency of STPs, and site validation is critical for predictive capability. Seasonal dilution can play an important role in ameliorating potentially adverse effects related to mixtures of PPCPs in effluent-impacted systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distribution of eight UV filters benzophenone (BP), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (OD-PABA), 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS), isoamyl benzoate, and benzyl cinnamate in eleven sites among three rivers, five sewage treatment plants (STPs), and four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different parts of Korea was investigated. The total concentrations of UV filters in the three sampled seasons were 62.9-412 ng L-1 (river), 417-5055 ng L-1 (STP influent), 108-2201 ng L-1 (STP effluent), 122-4154 ng L-1 (WWTP influent), and 120-849 ng L-1 (WWTP effluent). The concentration of the target pollutants in the influent of the treatment systems was directly proportional to the resident population density. A seasonal increase of >27% was observed in the total concentration of the UV filters in the rivers and influents of the treatment plants (TPs) during summer. BP, BP-3, EHMC, 4-MBC, and EHSwere the most dominant, showing a distinct distribution pattern that was dependent on the effectiveness of the treatment process and properties of each compound. The concentrations of the UV filters were higher in the TPs influents than in the rivers, and the most dominant UV filters in the rivers were those with low removal rate. Although biological treatment processes favored the removal of the UV filter compounds in the TPs, complete removal was not achieved before discharge into the rivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB C-14-sulfamethoxazole biotransformation, sorption and mineralization was studied with heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass under aerobic and anoxic conditions, as well as with anaerobic biomass. The C-14-radiolabelled residues distribution in the solid, liquid and gas phases was closely monitored along a total incubation time of 190 h. Biotransformation was the main removal mechanism, mineralization and sorption remaining below 5% in all the cases, although the presence of a carbon source exerted a positive effect on the mineralization rate by the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. In fact, an influence of the type of primary substrate and the redox potential was observed in all cases on the biotransformation and mineralization rates, since an enhancement of the removal rate was observed when an external carbon source was used as a primary substrate under aerobic conditions, while a negligible effect was observed under nitrifying conditions. In the liquid phases collected from all assays, up to three additional peaks corresponding to C-14-radiolabelled residues were detected. The highest concentration was observed under anaerobic conditions, where two radioactive metabolites were detected representing each around 15% of the total applied radioactivity after 180 h incubation. One of the metabolites detected under anoxic and anaerobic conditions, is probably resulting from ring cleavage of the isoxazole ring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemicals released into freshwater systems threaten ecological functioning and may put aquatic life and the health of humans at risk. We developed a new contaminant fate model (CFM) that follows simple, well-established methodologies and is unique in its cross-border, seamless hydrological and geospatial framework, including lake routing, a critical component in northern environments. We validated the model using the pharmaceutical Carbamazepine and predicted eco-toxicological risk for 15 pharmaceuticals in the Saint-Lawrence River Basin, Canada. The results indicated negligible to low environmental risk for the majority of tested chemicals, while two pharmaceuticals showed elevated risk in up to 13% of rivers affected by municipal effluents. As an integrated model, our CFM is designed for application at very large scales with the primary goal of detecting high risk zones. In regulatory frameworks, it can help screen existing or new chemicals entering the market regarding their potential impact on human and environmental health. Due to its high geospatial resolution, our CFM can also facilitate the prioritization of actions, such as identifying regions where reducing contamination sources or upgrading treatment plants is most pertinent to achieve targeted pollutant removal or to protect drinking water resources.

AB Synthetic pharmaceutical effluents loaded with the beta-lactamantibiotic oxacillin were treated using advanced oxidation processes (the photo-Fenton system and TiO2 photocatalysis) and chloride mediated electrochemical oxidation (with Ti/IrO2 anodes). Combinations of the antibiotic with excipients (mannitol or tartaric acid), an active ingredient (calcium carbonate, i.e. bicarbonate ions due to the pH) and a cleaning agent (sodium lauryl ether sulfate) were considered. Additionally, urban wastewater that had undergone biological treatment was doped with oxacillin and treated with the tested systems. The evolution of antimicrobial activity was monitored as a parameter of processes efficiency. Although the two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) differ only in the way they produce center dot OH, marked differences were observed between them. There were also differences between the AOPs and the electrochemical system. Interestingly, each additive had a different effect on each treatment. For water loaded with mannitol, electrochemical treatment was the most suitable option because the additive did not significantly affect the efficiency of the system. Due to the formation of a complex with Fe3+, tartaric acid accelerated the elimination of antibiotic activity during the photo-Fenton process. For TiO2 photocatalysis, the presence of bicarbonate ions contributed to antibiotic activity elimination through the possible formation of carbonate and bicarbonate radicals. Sodium lauryl ether sulfate negatively affected all of the processes. However, due to the higher selectivity of HOCl compared with center dot OH, electrochemical oxidation showed the least inhibited efficiency. For the urban wastewater doped with oxacillin, TiO2 photocatalysis was the most efficient process. These results will help select the most suitable technology for the treatment of water polluted with beta-lactam antibiotics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study was performed to remove emerging contaminants ibuprofen (IBU) and ketoprofen (KETO), COD and nitrogen compounds from pharmaceutical wastewater. The ASSBR was operated under a constant aeration rate at 1.0 L/min, 24 h HRT and various loadings of IBU (1.71-5.1 mg/m(3) day), KETO (0.39-2.1 mg/m(3) day), COD (1.2-10 kg/m(3) day) and ammonia (NH3-N: 4.3-6.3 g/m(3) day). The results showed that IBU, KETO, COD, NH3-N and nitrate (NO3-N) were efficiently removed in the range of 63-90%, 13-92%, 88.7-89.3%, 77.2-96%, 35.7-92.5%, respectively. Isolation and screening of effective microbes found three isolates identified as Bacillus pseudomycoides, Rhodococcus ruber and Vibrio mediterranei, which had a higher toxicity resistance towards IBU and KETO. Thus, the pharmaceutical wastewater especially IBU and KETO could be biologically removed with the presents of valuable effective microbes in the ASSBR system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antibiotics are currently considered to be an emerging threat to the aquatic environment if left untreated. Persistence of antibiotic compounds has been detected in vast aquatic environments, including wastewater. This involves the development and increase of antibiotic resistance and bacterial presence in the aquatic communities. Several previous studies have been conducted for the removal of micro-contaminants by ozonation. The comprehensive study on residual antibiotics effect to antibiotic resistance transfer before and after oxidation has not yet been explored. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to (1) investigate the antibiotic resistance growth under the presence of tetracycline in short and long period without oxidation process and to (2) look into the amount of residual tetracycline that persists after oxidation and its possible effect in potentially influencing antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transfer among bacteria. As shown in the results, a few ppm or few hundred ppb of tetracycline, regardless of ozonation, enhanced the ARG transfer compared to control. These results implied that ARG transfer can be enhanced by incomplete removal of micro-contaminants in the environment.

AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was treated using a microwave-assisted Fenton-like (MW-Fenton-like) process with satisfactory efficiency. Firstly, based on the MW power chosen, three factors, namely ferric sulfate dose, hydrogen peroxide dose, and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration were used to investigate the improvement in the efficiency of the MW-Fenton-like process for pharmaceutical wastewater pretreatment. Ferric sulfate and hydrogen peroxide doses (ferric sulfate 1.5mg/L and hydrogen peroxide 10mL/L) were low, after mixing well, oxidation decomposition was explored without acidification, this time was short (6min). Under optimal conditions, the removal rate of TOC was with satisfactory effects (57.5%). Furthermore, the initial pH value was selected without adjustment when the MW radiation started. It was unnecessary to extend the radiation time because no hydrogen peroxide existed in system with the radiation time of 8min. The influent was unnecessary to be diluted. Biodegradation of the wastewater could be elevated well (BOD5/COD arose from 0.23 to 0.40). Moreover, all of coloration from Riboflavin sodium phosphate dissolved (<15mg/1L wastewater) was completely removed in the sample. Finally, according to the TOC removal, the second step (flocculation precipitation) was as equally important as the first step (oxidation decomposition), though ferric sulfate dose was low. The effect of biological treatment was unsatisfactory compared with MW-Fenton-like process.

AB Chemically treated and carbonized adsorbents were prepared from Moringa oleifera pod husks (MPH) and evaluated for the aqueous phase removal of Norfloxacin (NOX), a common antibiotic. The pulverized precursor was steeped in a saturated ammonium chloride solution (24h) to give the chemically treated adsorbent (AMPH). Pyrolysis of AMPH (623K, 1/2h) yielded the carbonized adsorbent (CMPH). Both adsorbents showed favorable physicochemical attributes (pH, bulk density, attrition, iodine adsorption number/surface area, titratable surface charge, and FT-IR analysis). NOX removal was studied under the effects of initial solution pH (2-11), adsorbent dosage (0.5-2.5g), initial NOX concentration (5-25mg/L), contact time (0-240min), and temperature (298-328K). Optimal NOX uptake (mg/g) by AMPH (1.42) and CMPH (1.88) occurred at solution pH 5 and adsorbent dose of 0.5g. Equilibrium adsorption obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. Free energy change (G degrees), enthalpy change (H degrees), and entropy change (S degrees) indicated that the adsorption of NOX was feasible, spontaneous, exothermic, and physisorptive. Kinetically, NOX uptake increased rapidly within the first 10min for both adsorbents and overall, was well modeled by the Blanchard pseudo-second-order equation. The adsorbents may find use in the removal of microcontaminants of pharmaceutical origin from effluents/wastewater.

AB Wastewater and surface water samples, extracted with four solid-phase extraction cartridges of different chemistries, were suspect-screened for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine (LMG), its metabolites, and related compounds. LMG, three human metabolites, and a LMG synthetic impurity (OXO-LMG) were detected. Preliminary results showed significantly higher concentrations of OXO-LMG in wastewater effluent, suggesting its formation in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, biodegradation experiments with activated sludge demonstrated that LMG is resistant to degradation and that its human metabolite lamotrigine-N-2-glucuronide (LMG-N2-G) is the actual source of OXO-LMG in WWTPs. In batch reactors, LMG-N2-G was transformed, following pseudo-first-order kinetics to OXO-LMG and LMG, but kinetic experiments suggested an incomplete mass balance. A fragment ion search applied to batch-reactor and environmental samples revealed another transformation product (TP), formed by LMG-N2-G oxidation, which was identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Accounting for all TPs detected, a total mass balance at two concentration levels in batch reactors was closed at 86% and 102%, respectively. In three WWTPs, the total mass balance of LMG-N2-G ranged from 71 to 102%. Finally, LMG-N2-G and its TPs were detected in surface water samples with median concentration ranges of 23-139 ng L-1. The results of this study suggest that glucuronides of pharmaceuticals might also be sources of yet undiscovered, but environmentally relevant, transformation products.

AB Understanding the sources, transport, and spatiotemporal variability of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is important for understanding risks and developing monitoring and mitigation strategies. This study used mass balances to compare wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and upstream sources of 16 CECs to a mixed-use watershed in Minnesota, under different seasonal and hydrological conditions. Three distinct CEC groups emerged with respect to their source proportionality and instream behavior. Agricultural herbicides and daidzein inputs were primarily via upstream routes with the greatest loadings and concentrations during high flows. Trimethoprim, mecoprop, nonprescription pharmaceuticals, and personal care products entered the system via balanced/mixed pathways with peak loadings and concentrations in high flows. Carbaryl, 4-nonylphenol, and the remaining prescription pharmaceuticals entered the system via WWTP effluent with relatively stable loadings across sampling events. Mass balance analysis based on multiple sampling events and sites facilitated CEC source comparisons and may therefore prove to be a powerful tool for apportioning sources and exploring mitigation strategies.

AB Background: Removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater by post-ozonation has been investigated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) temporarily upgraded with full-scale ozonation, followed by sand filtration, as an additional treatment step of the secondary effluent. Here, the SPEAR (species at risk) indicator was used to analyse macroinvertebrate abundance data that were collected in the receiving stream before, during and after ozonation to investigate whether ozonation improved the water quality.
   Results: The SPEAR values indicate a better water quality downstream the WWTP during ozonation. With ozonation the relative abundance of vulnerable macroinvertebrates in the stream receiving the treated wastewater increases from 18 % (CI 15-21 %) to 30 % (CI 28-32 %). This increase of 12 % (CI 8-16 %) indicates improved ecological quality of the stream and shifts classification according to the Water Framework Directive from poor to moderate.
   Conclusions: The SPEAR concept, originally developed to indicate pesticide stress, also appears to indicate toxic stress by a mixture of various micropollutants including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and pesticides. The responsiveness of the SPEAR indicator means that those macroinvertebrates that are vulnerable to pesticide pollution are also vulnerable to micropollutants from WWTPs. The change in the macroinvertebrate community downstream the WWTP indicates that toxicity by pollutants decreased by more than one order of magnitude during ozonation. Ozonation followed by sand filtration has favourable impacts on the composition of the macroinvertebrate community and can improve the water quality in the receiving stream.

AB Adsorption plays a significant role in removing hydrophobic 17-estradiol (E2) from wastewater. Batch experiments were conducted to compare the adsorption of E2 onto activated aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and activated sludge (AS), and features evaluated included the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and influence of other environmental factors. By using a non-chemical wet-heat technique, both AGS and AS were treated to inactivated status. Then, after loading E2, the adsorption equilibrium capacity of the AGS was found to be greater than that of the AS at the same initial concentration of E2. Moreover, both the adsorption processes corresponded to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model; the adsorption rate constant of AGS was found to be higher and the half-adsorption time was shorter than that of AS. Next, evaluations of adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics indicated that the adsorption process was mainly a physical process. Lower temperatures facilitated a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity. However, the adsorption binding sites of AGS were distributed more uniformly at higher temperature, in contrast to the distribution found for AS. Finally, acidic conditions and an appropriate ionic strength (0.4mol/L) were found to be particularly conducive to the adsorption process. Overall, the results showed that AGS has the potential to adsorb E2 with significant efficiency, thereby offering a new and more efficient means of treating E2 and trace oestrogens in wastewater.

AB Pharmaceutical products are bioactive compounds designed to pose therapeutic effects on living systems. In lieu with the increasing global usage of these products ranging from perfumes to analgesics, numerous tests have evidenced an alarming rise of concentration in water runoffs, despite various secondary water treatment steps. Therefore, in order to ensure that water is safe for consumption, tertiary treatment is devised for the efficient removal of pharmaceuticals. More recently; the incorporation of advanced materials into conventional techniques has been deemed as a prospective alternative as they circumvent some of the major drawbacks. Various forms of advanced materials that have been studied include polymers (e.g., dendrimers), inorganics (e.g., carbon nanotubes, TiO2), semiconductors, zero-valence metals (e.g., Fe2O3), and composite membranes. By virtue of its vast variety, the compilation and review of this information are vital to enable comparison of their performance. Here, we present a summarized critical review on these advanced materials in the removal of pharmaceutical products in water. Based on their properties and applications, the main objective of using advanced material is then to reduce the cost and ineffectiveness of conventional wastewater treatment processes.

AB Due to advances in analytical techniques and increasing concerns related to the potential impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms, the reported occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in groundwater has significantly increased during the past two decades. This chapter provides an overview of the detection of pharmaceutical, life-style, and endocrine disruptor compounds in groundwater from five geographical areas (Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and North America). The occurrence of these compounds has been linked to the four major sources of contamination: agricultural practices/wastes, landfill, septic tanks, and wastewater. The concentration of the detected compounds ranged between ng/L and mu g/L. Pharmaceutical compounds, in particular antibiotic and analgesic/anti-inflammatory, represent the most common group detected in groundwater, regardless of the geographic location. Carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic), and caffeine (life-style) represent the three most common compounds detected in groundwater. The occurrence of the detected compounds in groundwater is primarily related to wastewater and/or agricultural practices/wastes. None of the detected compounds has been linked to all four major sources of contamination. However, five compounds (ibuprofen, paracetamol, triclosan, caffeine and cotinine) have been linked to three sources of contamination such as wastewater, landfill, and septic tanks.

AB A huge amount of hazardous organopollutants, often persistent and toxic, is produced annually over the world and may contaminate soil, water, ground water, and air. Being from various sources such as wastewater, landfill leachates, and solid residues, xenobiotics include phenols, plastics, hydrocarbons, paints, dyes, pesticides and insecticides, paper and pulp mills, and pharmaceuticals. Among biological processes for degradation of xenobiotics, fungal ones, being eco-friendly and cost cheap, have been investigated extensively because most of basidiomycetes are more tolerant to high concentrations of pollutants. Fungal bioremediation is a promising technology using their metabolic potential to remove or reduce xenobiotics. Basidiomycetes are the unique microorganisms that show high capacities of degrading a wide range of toxic xenobiotics. They act via the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, including laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase. Their capacities to remove xenobiotic substances and produce polymeric products make them a useful tool for bioremediation purposes. During fungal remediation, they utilize hazardous compounds, even the insoluble ones, as the nutrient source and convert them to simple fragmented forms. The aim of this chapter is to elucidate the ability of basidiomycetes to degrade xenobiotics. This is an overview to present the importance of extracellular enzymes for efficient bioremediation of a large variety of xenobiotics.

AB In this work, two analytical methodologies based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were developed for quantification of emerging pollutants identified in sewage sludge after a previous wide-scope screening. The target list included 13 emerging contaminants (EC): thiabendazole, acesulfame, fenofibric acid, valsartan, irbesartan, salicylic acid, diclofenac, carbamazepine, 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AA), 4-acetyl aminoantipyrine (4-AAA), 4-formyl aminoantipyrine (4-FAA), venlafaxine and benzoylecgonine. The aqueous and solid phases of the sewage sludge were analyzed making use of Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and UltraSonic Extraction (USE) for sample treatment, respectively. The methods were validated at three concentration levels: 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g L-1 for the aqueous phase, and 50, 500 and 2000 mu g kg(-1) for the solid phase of the sludge. In general, the method was satisfactorily validated, showing good recoveries (70-120%) and precision (RSD < 20%). Regarding the limit of quantification (LOQ), it was below 0.1 mu g L-1 in the aqueous phase and below 50 mu g kg(-1) in the solid phase for the majority of the analytes. The method applicability was tested by analysis of samples from a wider study on degradation of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge under anaerobic digestion. The key benefits of these methodologies are:
   SPE and USE are appropriate sample procedures to extract selected emerging contaminants from the aqueous phase of the sewage sludge and the solid residue.
   LC-MS/MS is highly suitable for determining emerging contaminants in both sludge phases.
   Up to our knowledge, the main metabolites of dipyrone had not been studied before in sewage sludge. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

AB Groundwater is essential for human life and its protection is a goal for the European policies. All the anthropogenic activities could impact on water quality.
   Conventional pollutants and more than 700 emerging pollutants, resulting from point and diffuse source contamination, threat the aquatic ecosystem.
   Policy-makers and scientists will have to cooperate to create an initial groundwater emerging pollutant priority list, to answer at consumer demands for safety and to the lack of conceptual models for emerging pollutants in groundwater.
   Among the emerging contaminants and pollutants this paper focuses on organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) mainly released into the environment by domestic households, industry, hospitals and agriculture. This paper starts from the current regulatory framework and from the literature overview to explain how the missing conceptual model for OWCs could be developed.
   A full understanding of the mechanisms leading to the contamination and the evidence of the contamination must be the foundation of the conceptual model. In this paper carbamazepine, galaxolide and sulfamethozale, between the OWCs, are proposed as "environmental tracers" to identify sources and pathways ofcontamination/pollution. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are usually characterised by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. Therefore, it must be treated. The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by CuO/TiO2 was investigated. The effect of reaction time, catalyst dosage, aeration and pH on decolorisation efficiency was investigated. The results indicated that CuO/TiO2 photocatalytic can decolorise pharmaceutical wastewater effectively. Decolorisation efficiency increased with reaction time prolonging, aeration and catalyst dosage increasing. But excessive catalyst and aeration decreased decolorisation efficiency, and decolorisation efficiency under acidic conditions was superior to alkaline conditions.

AB In this work, the toxicity of 11 products (three brands of mouthwash, three toothpastes, three detergents and two analgesics) was evaluated in relation to juvenile snails Physa acuta (Draparnaud, 1805). Bioassays of toxicity were conducted and the organisms exposed to six concentrations of each product, along with a control group, to determine the 96-hour LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50). The sensitivity of the gastropods to the different products was determined by comparing their LC50 values to that of acute toxicity values. In addition, the degree of lipoperoxidation in the gastropod tissue was evaluated by measuring the concentration of MDA (malondialdehyde) in sublethal tests (LC10) for chronic toxicity (during 30-day exposure). The toxicity of the products tested varied from highly toxic and harmful (mouthwashes) through harmful (detergents), potentially harmful (analgesics), and non-toxic (toothpastes). The degree of lipoperoxidation observed in the sublethal tests was (from most to least toxic): Analgesics > Mouthwashes > Detergents > Toothpastes. These results indicate that a certain risk exists resulting from the presence in wastewater dumped into aquatic systems of components of these products which may cause adverse effects on populations of P. acuta and other aquatic organisms.

AB The release of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with treated wastewater is one of the major sources of CNTs in the environment. The great sorption capacity of pristine CNTs can be changed during wastewater processing. CNTs in the environment can interact with different components and pollutants. The aim of this study is the determination of the effect of treatment methods of wastewater containing functionalized CNTs on the sorption of new emerging contaminants. The process of sorption of diclofenac sodium (DCF) and naproxen (NPX) was tested using carbon nanotubes released after treatment by UV and/or H2O2. The results revealed that sorption on non-treated CNTOHs was governed by chemisorption, with chemisorption being rate limiting step (pseudo-second order regime). Treatment of the CNTOHs changed the kinetics of NPX sorption to a pseudo-first order (CNTOH-UV and CNTOH-H2O2) or an intraparticle diffusion model (CNTOH-UV + H2O2). DCF sorption was described by pseudo-first or pseudo-second order kinetics. NPX sorption onto treated CNTOHs and CNTCOOHs was ascribed to the Freundlich or Temkin models. The Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models revealed the best fitting for the description of DCF sorption onto CNTOHs and CNTCOOHs. Although treatment affected the physicochemical properties of the CNTs only slightly, it did change the sorption affinity and capacity. NPX sorption was favored over all tested CNTs, and CNTCOOHs revealed a higher sorption capacity for all tested adsorbates. The mechanism of sorption was connected with p-p interactions between the NPX and the CNTOHs, and the functional groups of the CNTCOOHs. DCF sorption onto CNTOHs was governed by electrostatic forces, with adsorption onto CNTCOOHs governed by functionalization.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their active metabolites are one of the significantly emerging environmental toxicants. The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient. The most important and distinct features of pharmaceuticals are that they are deliberately designed to have an explicit mode of action and designed to exert an effect on humans and other living systems. This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Brief ideas about toxicity endpoints, available ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems employed for rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are also discussed.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been reported to occur in coastal environments across the globe from Antarctica to the Arctic. Worldwide, the number of people living along the coast is rapidly increasing, resulting in increased discharges of wastewater, which is a major source of pharmaceuticals entering aquatic environments. At the same time there is an increasing demand for farmed seafood. It also is likely that the number of different pharmaceutical compounds and their concentrations in the marine environment is also increasing. There is a growing body of evidence that some pharmaceuticals are present in marine ecosystems at concentrations that are likely to have adverse effects on marine organisms. Of particular concern are the potential impacts on primary producers, such as algae, that may have follow- on effects on aquatic food webs, including the availability of seafood for human consumption. There is limited evidence for the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food chains and a paucity of data for higher trophic- level organisms, including marine mammals. This chapter presents an overview of the occurrence, fate and sources of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and veterinary medicines in the marine environment, and their potential impact on marine organisms and human health.

AB Pharmaceuticals are increasingly used in large amounts in human (and veterinary) medicine around the world. They reach the aquatic environment mainly through sewage treatment systems and can reach mg l(-1) levels. The continual input of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment, via sewage, can also impart a persistent quality to compounds that otherwise possess no inherent environmental stability. While the literature contains increasing numbers of studies detailing fate, effects and behaviour in the environment, the subject is still not fully understood for all the different therapeutic classes. The toxicological significance for non-target (especially aquatic) organisms is poorly understood. The use/ release of antibiotics and natural/ synthetic steroids to the environment has generated most of the concern to date, but a plethora of other drugs are increasingly attracting attention, as their biological activity alone may support ecotoxicity assessments of those compounds with high production volumes (or toxicity), especially in view of the increasing importance of freshwater resources. Pharmaceuticals display a variety of removal efficiencies during wastewater treatment and their fate and behaviour are not determined by their physicochemical properties alone. Despite the fact that many drugs have high sorption potentials, partitioning to the solid phase was determined to be an unlikely removal pathway for the majority of compounds. The partitioning behaviour of these compounds both in sewage treatment and the aquatic environment is likely to be dictated by a number of physicochemical parameters. Findings also indicate that the costs of using tertiary treatment options (mainly based on drinking water treatment) to remove drugs from wastewater effluent are likely to be prohibitively expensive, and potentially undesirable, due sustainability implications. While adjusting existing treatment parameters may increase the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals, any changes to sewage treatment parameters would need to be offset against the economic and environmental costs. Likewise, any regulations on drug use must be balanced against health benefits. If receiving waters are used for potable supplies, the presence of these compounds may (although it is unlikely) represent a potential hazard to human health, especially in areas without advanced water treatment. The focus for future research should therefore be on proper and sufficient science for establishing the occurrence, exposure and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment, so that sound decisions can be made regarding human and ecological health.

AB The characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater were identified based on its particle size distribution (PSD), biodegradability and acute toxicity. The PSD profiles were determined through physical segregation experiments using membrane discs with varying pore sizes between 2 and 3000 nm. The biodegradability was evaluated using readily biodegradable COD (Ss) and soluble inert COD (S-I) contents in wastewater, and the acute toxicity was assessed based on luminescent bacteria test. Domestic sewage samples were used for control experiments. The results indicated that PSD-based COD fractionation profiles could serve as effective fingerprints for identifying the characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater. The COD component in pharmaceutical wastewater was found mainly as the S-I with size of below 2 nm, while little SI was found in domestic sewage. The biodegradability characteristics of the domestic and pharmaceutical wastewaters exhibited clear difference. The level of acute toxicity in pharmaceutical wastewater is relatively higher than domestic sewage. Also, the acute toxicity of the wastewater decreased after sewage treatment process.

AB Due to the inability of biochemical processes to remove refractory organic compounds from wastewater in pharmaceutical industrial parks, this research tried to find a new way to meet the requirement of the Discharge Standard in China. A combined process involving micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation, and coagulation was studied. Considering the removal efficiencies and operation costs, the reaction conditions were optimized. The COD concentration in the effluent after the combined treatment was less than the standard limit of 50mg/L. Molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in wastewater was analyzed by sequential filtration and ultrafiltration. When treated by the combined process, the particulate fraction (particle size>1,000nm) decreased, and the soluble portion (particle size<1nm) increased significantly. Composition of the refractory organics was investigated using GC-MS. A total of 34 types of low-molecular-weight organics were identified in the effluent, among which phthalates, amides, heterocyclic compounds, and PAHs were the main organic pollutants. All these results show that the proposed method is promising for refractory wastewater because it is efficient and easy to operate.

AB Recent regulation policies are focusing on the presence of priority and emerging pollutants in water, among them, pharmaceutical residues are of particular public concern since trace of these molecules is commonly found in drinking and superficial waters. Progresses in innovative technologies for wastewater treatment are mandatory in order to improve their abatement efficiencies for water source prevention and reclamation. The OH-based technologies, a group of different techniques usually called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), can be used to mineralize organic pollutants. In particular, combined treatments based on UV light appear to be more eco-friendly, also giving very interesting removal efficiencies if opportunely devised. Moreover, many of the commonly detected pharmaceutical compounds are susceptible to degradation by UV at disinfection doses. In this paper, the removal of ibuprofen (IBP)a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)from synthetic water streams was explored using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at fixed wavelength and intensity (254nm; 400mJm(-2)). IBP initial concentration (C-IBP0) was varied in the range 30-60mgL(-1). The treatment time, the initial IBP concentration, pH and the presence of nitrates were investigated by several sets of experiments in order to study their effect on IBP degradation, showing very promising results. IBP removal of 75% was obtained at pH 6.0 with a concentration of NaNO3 of 10mgL(-1) and at pH 6.6 with an initial concentration of ibuprofen of 60mgL(-1). Moreover, a reaction mechanism has been proposed, which fits well in the experimental results, and the kinetic constants of 0.026 and 0.015 were statistically evaluated.

AB Amoxicillin, used to manage bacterial infection, is among the top five popular pharmaceuticals in the United States, based on the number of prescriptions. Problems with environmentally available drugs can arise chiefly; biological resistance in excess amounts becomes available in wastewater samples. Previously, we observed that Amoxicillin could be removed quantitatively from deionized water by passage over Octolig (R), a polythylenediimine covalently attached to high-surface-area silica gel. This study was concerned with testing the potential removal of Amoxicillin in different solutions (tap water, well water, river water, and the weakly saline water). These solutions were passed over chromatography columns at a rate of 10mL per minute; 50-mL fractions were collected and analyzed for total dissolved solids and pH as well as concentration. As noted in our previous work, the percentage removal was related to the length of the column, and this aspect was evaluated again. Consistent results were obtained for DI water, tap water, well water, and river water, indicating quantitative removal, and but not artificial bay water, presumably because of ion competition.

AB Effluent-impacted surface water has the potential to transport not only water, but wastewater-derived contaminants to shallow groundwater systems. To better understand the effects of effluent discharge on in-stream and near-stream hydrologic conditions in wastewater-impacted systems, water-level changes were monitored in hyporheic-zone and shallow-groundwater piezometers in a reach of Fourmile Creek adjacent to and downstream of the Ankeny ( Iowa, USA) wastewater treatment plant ( WWTP). Water-level changes were monitored from approximately 1.5 months before to 0.5 months after WWTP closure. Diurnal patterns in WWTP discharge were closely mirrored in stream and shallow-groundwater levels immediately upstream and up to 3 km downstream of the outfall, indicating that such discharge was the primary control on water levels before shutdown. The hydrologic response to WWTP shutdown was immediately observed throughout the study reach, verifying the far-reaching hydraulic connectivity and associated contaminant transport risk. The movement of WWTP effluent into alluvial aquifers has implications for potential WWTP-derived contamination of shallow groundwater far removed from the WWTP outfall.

AB The work is focused on spontaneous colonization of fungal mycelium by invading microorganisms in a trickle-bed fungal bioreactor operating under semi-sterile conditions. Pleurotus ostreatus was grown under the flow of synthetic wastewater containing activated sludge bacteria and the microbial consortium developed in the reactor was characterized. Genotype and phenotype profile of the reactor-invading, bacterial consortium was clearly distinctive from that of the original activated sludge. The bacterial consortium from the reactor contained a higher portion of bacteria capable of cellobiose utilization and a small amount of bacteria with the ability to utilize benzoic acids. The invading bacteria had no effect on the dye decolorization performance of the fungal reactor. Five bacterial strains colonizing P. ostreatus reactor cultures were isolated and identified as species of the genera Pseudomonas and Bacillus. Except for Bacillus cereus all strains displayed a potential to inhibit fungal growth on solid media (14 to 51 % inhibition) which was comparable or higher than that of the reference bacterial strains. The pH- and media composition-dependence of the growth inhibition was demonstrated.

AB This study was undertaken to develop an extraction method for seven acidic pharmaceuticals and five steroidal estrogens from wastewater, treated wastewater and sludge samples. The temperature and time of sample derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was optimized. Our results show that pretreatment combined with solid phase extraction (SPE) for wastewater samples (using an ENVI-C18 cartridge) and liquid-solid extraction combined with SPE (using an HLB cartridge) for sludge samples increased the analytical efficiency for acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogenic hormones using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The derivatization conditions were optimized at 40 degrees C for 2h. In addition, the derivatized samples were stable at ambient temperature. The new method was validated and applied to the analysis of real wastewater and discharged sludge samples from a local wastewater treatment plant. Except for 17-ethinylestradiol, all acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogens were detected in the influent, effluent and discharged sludge samples. The concentrations of these compounds were particularly high in the discharged sludge samples.

AB In this study, the electro-oxidation capacities of Na2SO4 and potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes were tested and compared for destruction of the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF) on platinum (Pt) electrode and graphite carbon electrode in aqueous medium. The suitability of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) for electrochemical oxidation was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique performed in the potential range -1.5 to +1.5V versus Ag/AgCl, which confirmed the electro-activity of the selected PhACs. The degradation and mineralization were monitored by ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC. 0.1M Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte was found to be more effective for mineralization of SMX and DCF, with efficiency of 15-30% more than the 0.1M phosphate buffer supporting electrolyte on the platinum (Pt) and carbon electrodes. The Pt electrode showed better performance in the degradation of the two PhACs while under the same conditions than the carbon electrode for both 0.1M Na2SO4 and 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes. The SMX and DCF degradation kinetics best fitted the second-order reaction, with rate constants ranging between 0.000389 and 0.006mol(2) L-2 min(-1) and correlation coefficient (R-2) above 0.987. The second-order degradation kinetics indicated that the rate-determining step in the degradation could be a chemical process, thus suggesting the active involvement of electrolyte radical species in the degradation of SMX and DCF. Results obtained from a real field sample showed a more than 98% removal of the PhACs from the wastewater by electrochemical degradation.

AB Mesoporous ionosilicas bearing ammonium groups appear as versatile adsorbent for anionic drugs. High amounts of the anionic drugs diclofenac and sulindac are irreversibly trapped within the materials whereas neutral species are hardly adsorbed. Our results open the route towards new ionic materials for wastewater treatment via ion exchange.

AB The behaviour and fate of carbamazepine (CBZ) in urban wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and its possible effects on the system's efficiency, and on mixed microbial communities, has been studied. The experimental microfiltration MBR system, with capacity to treat 10.8 m(3) d(-1) of urban wastewater, operated with a pre-denitrification configuration with high sludge and hydraulic retention time. The CBZ concentration assayed was higher than in the usual urban wastewater, in order to provoke a strong biomass reaction. Influent, effluent, and all bioreactors of the MBR system were analysed in order to calculate a CBZ balance. Bench-scale experiments and respirometric analyses were performed, with and without the presence of CBZ, to evaluate its influence on the bacterial activity. The respirometric assays showed variations in the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the presence of CBZ. Negative effects were detected in the MBR bacterial community during the initial period of dosing. However, the effects were not permanent and the biomass spiked with CBZ had behaviour similar to that of the biomass without CBZ after a few hours. Biodegradation was not detected during the MBR treatment. The system showed an inefficient elimination of CBZ (less than 10%) with a high concentration in the effluent. The small percentage of CBZ removal was associated with the sludge retention and eliminated by the purge. All CBZ present in the influent was accounted for, and even an increase in the total amount of CBZ was registered in the permeate. During and after the experimental process, CBZ did not significantly affect the efficiency of the MBR system, and the quality of the effluent was not affected by the dosing of CBZ in terms of COD and nitrogen removal.

AB Parabens, commonly used preservatives, are emerging pollutants that are known to enter waterways through the wastewater system where they can pose a threat to aquatic organisms. Less is known about their presence and contribution to urban waterways in cities with separated stormwater and wastewater systems, such as Sydney, Australia. We measured the occurrence of methyl-(MeP), ethyl-(EtP), propyl-(PrP) and butyl-(BuP) parabens in urban river and stormwater samples across a range of land uses, using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the analysis. MeP in modified stormwater channels was more frequently detected and found at higher mean levels (6.29 mu g L-1) than in urban rivers (3.62 mu g L-1). Waterways in residential catchments had greater mean total paraben load (26.87 mu g L-1) when compared to parkland catchments (12.71 mu g L-1) and bushland catchments (2.10 mu g L-1). EtP had the highest peak concentrations across the study area (max = 305.55 mu g L-1) associated with industrial land uses and areas historically associated with poor water quality. The levels of EtP were relatively high when compared to international studies in cities with combined stormwater and wastewater systems. The results also suggest overflows from the sewer during heavy rain are likely not as significant when compared to the contribution from urban runoff. The study did not reveal the source of the EtP and further studies are recommended to identify this and the potential environmental impact.

AB The anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) receives growing attention due to slow biodegradation and inherent accumulation in the aquatic environment. The application of a gas-phase pulsed corona discharge (PCD) was investigated to remove CBZ from synthetic solutions and spiked wastewater effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. The treated water was showered between high voltage (HV) wires and grounded plate electrodes, to which ultra-short HV pulses were applied. CBZ was readily oxidized and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydroquinazoline-2-one (BQM) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) were identified as the most abundant primary transformation products, which, contrary to CBZ ozonation data available in the literature, were further easily oxidized with PCD: BQM and BQD attributed to only a minor portion of the target compound oxidized. In concentrations commonly found in wastewater treatment plant effluents (around 5 mu g L-1), up to 97% reduction in CBZ concentration was achieved at mere 0.3 kW h m(-3) energy consumption, and over 99.9% was removed at 1 kW h m(-3). The PCD application proved to be efficient in the removal of both the parent substance and its known transformation products, even with the competing reactions in the complex composition of wastewater.

AB Use of silver nanoparticles is increasing in different packaging material as disinfectant to protect food and pharmaceutical products. Its use has raised the contamination risk of fresh water and human exposure can cause serious problems. The coagulation/flocculation process can be an attractive option for silver nanoparticles removal at small-scale treatment just after its use. Four coagulants, aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, Ocimum basilicum, and Hibiscus esculentus (synthetic and natural) were applied. For coagulation/flocculation activity, a series of jar test experiments were conducted to treat silver nanoparticles at concentration of 1mgL(-1) from wastewater. H. esculentus efficiently removed silver nanoparticles (98.7%) from aqueous solution at a dose of 150mgL(-1), whereas at same coagulant dose, ferric chloride, O. basilicum, and aluminum sulfate successfully removed silver nanoparticles at 96, 69, and 50%, respectively. No broad change in pH was observed and it remained between 6.5 and 7.5 during all the experiments at room temperature.
